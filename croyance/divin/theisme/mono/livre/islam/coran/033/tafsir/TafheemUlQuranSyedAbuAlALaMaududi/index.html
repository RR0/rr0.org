    <p lang="en">*110) Jilbab is a large sheet and idna' is to draw close and wrap up, but when this word is used with
      the associating particle ala, it gives the meaning of letting something down from above. Some modern translators,
      under the influence of the West, have translated this word " to wrap up " so as to avoid somehow the Command about
      covering of the face. But if Allah had meant what these gentlemen want to consture, He would have said: yudnina
      ilai-hinna and not yudnina alai-hinna. Anyone who knows Arabic knows that yudnina 'alai-hinna cannot merely mean "
      wrapping up. " Moreover, the words min jalabib-i hinna also do not permit of this meaning. It is obvious that the
      preposition min here signifies a part of the sheet, and also that wrapping up is done by means of a whole sheet
      and not merely by a part of it. The verse, therefore, clearly means : The women should wrap themselves up well in
      their sheets, and should draw and let down a part of the sheet in front of the face.

      This same meaning was understood by the major commentators who lived close to the time of the Holy Prophet. Ibn
      Jarir and Ibn al-Mundhir have related that Muhammad bin Sirin asked Hadrat `Ubaidah as-Salmani the meaning of this
      verse. ( This Hadrat `Ubaidah had become a Muslim in the time of the Holy Prophet but had not been able to visit
      him. He came to Madinah in the time of Hadrat 'Umar and settled down there. He was recognized as equal in rank
      with Qadi Shuraih in jurisprudence and judicial matters ). Instead of giving a verbal reply Hadrat 'Ubaidah put on
      his sheet and gave a practical demonstration by covering his head and forehead and face and an eye, leaving only
      the other eye uncovered. Ibn 'Abbas also has made almost the same commentary. In his statements which have been
      reported by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Marduyah, he says: " Allah has commanded the women that when they move .out of
      their houses for an outdoor duty, they should conceal their faces by drawing and letting down aver themselves a
      part of their sheets, keeping only the eyes uncovered. " The same explanation of this verse has been given by
      Qatadah and Suddi.

      All the great commentators who have passed after the period of the Companions and their immediate followers have
      given the same meaning of this verse. Imam Ibn Jarir Tabari, in his commentary of this verse, says: " The
      respectable women should not look like the slave-girls from their dress when they move out of their houses, with
      uncovered faces and loose hair; they should rather draw and Iet down over them a part of their sheets or
      outer-garments so that no evil person may dare molest them. " ( Jami'al Bayan, vol. XXII, p. 33 ).

      'Allama Abu Bakr al-Jassas says: " This verse points out that the young woman has been commanded to conceal her
      face from the other men; when moving out of the house she should cover herself up well to express chastity and
      purity of character so that people of doubtful character do not cherish any false hope when they see her. " (
      Ahkam al-Qur'an, vol. III, p. 458 ).

      'Allama Zamakhshari says: " It means that they should Iet down a part of their sheet over themselves, and should
      cover their faces and wrap up their sides well. " ( AI-Kashshaf, vol. II, p. 221 ). 'Allama Nizamuddin Nishapuri
      says: " That is, they should Iet down a part of the sheet over them: in this verse, the women have been commanded
      to cover the head and face. " ( Ghara'ib al-Qur an, vol. XXII, p. 32 ).

      Imam Razi says: " What is mean is that the people may know that they are not promiscuous women. For the woman who
      covers her face, though the face is not included in the satar, cannot be expected to uncover her satar, which is
      obligatory to cover before the other man. Thus, everyone will know that they are modest and virtuous women who
      cannot be expected to do anything indecent. " ( Tafsir Kabir. vol. VI, p 591 ) Incidentally, another thing that is
      proved by this verse is that the Holy Prophet had several daughters, for Allah Himself says: " O Prophet, enjoin
      your wives and daughters. " These words absolutely refute the assertion of those people who without any fear of
      God make the claim that the Holy Prophet had only one daughter, Hadrat Fatimah, and the other daughters were not
      froth his own loins but by the former husbands. These people are so blinded by prejudice that they do not even
      bother to consider what crime they arc committing by denying the parentage of the children of the Holy Prophet,
      and what severe punishment will await them in the Hereafter. AII authentic traditions concur that from Hadrat
      Khadijah the Holy Prophet had not one daughter, Hadrat Fatimah, but three other daughters as well. The Holy
      Prophet's earliest biographer, Muhammad bin Ishaq, after mentioning his marriage with Hadrat Khadijah, says; " She
      was the mother of aII the Holy Prophet's children except Ibrahim, namely Qasim and Tahir and Tayyib and Zainab and
      Ruqayyah and Umm Kulthum and Fatimah. " ( Ibn Hisham, vol. I, p. 202 ).

      The famous genealogist, Hashim bin Muhammad bin as-Sa'ib al-Kalbi, states: 'The first born child to the,
      Messenger. of Allah before his call to Prophethood was Qasim; then Zainab was born to him, then Ruqayyah, then Umm
      Kulthum." ( Tabaqat Ibn Sa'd, vol. I, p. 133 ). Ibn Hazam writes in Jawami' asSirah that from Hadrat Khadijah the
      Holy Prophet had four daughters, the eldest being Zainab, then Ruqayyah, then Fatimah and then Umm Kulthum ( pp.
      38-39 ). Tabari, Ibn Sa'd, Abu Ja'far Muhammad bin Habib ( author of Kitab al-Muhabbar ) and Ibn 'Abd al-Bart (
      author of Kitab al-lsti'ab ) state on the strength of authentic sources that before her marriage with the Holy
      Prophet Hadrat Khadijah had two husbands, Abu Halah Tamimi by whom she had a son named Hind bin Abu Halah, and
      'Atiq bin 'A'idh Makhzumi, by whom she had a daughter named Hind. Then she was married to the Holy Prophet and aII
      the genealogists agree that from his loins she had the four daughters as stated above. ( See Tabari, vol. ll, p.
      411: tabaqat Ibn Sa'd, vol. VIII, pp. 14-16; Kitab al-Muhabbar, pp. 78, 79, 452; .9l-Isti'ab, vol. II, p. 718 ).
      AII these statements are authenticated by the Qur'anic declaration that the Holy Prophet had not one but several
      daughters.

      *111) "... will thus be recognized" : will be recognized to be noble and chaste women from their simple and modest
      dress, and not w omen of iII repute from whom some wicked person could cherish evil hopes. ''.. are not molested
      ": will not be teased but Iet alone.

      Let us pause here for a while and try to understand what spirit of the social law of Islam is being expressed by
      this Qur'anic Command and what is its object which Allah Himself has stated. Before this in Surah An-Nur: 31, the
      women have been forbidden to display their adornments before others except such and such men and women, and " also
      that they should not stamp their feet on the ground lest their hidden decoration ( ornaments ) should be known. "
      If that Command is read with this verse of AI-Ahzab it becomes obvious that the intention of the Command for the
      woman to cover herself well with the sheet here is to conceal her adornments from others. And, evidently, this
      purpose can be fulfilled only if the sheet or the outer-garment itself is simple; otherwise wrapping up oneself
      with a decorated and attractive sheet will defeat the purpose itself. Besides, Allah does not onlv command the
      woman to conceal her adornment by covering herself with the sheet, but also enjoins that she should Iet down a pan
      of the sheet over herself. No sensible person can take any other meaning of this Command than that it requires to
      conceal the face along with the concealment of the adonunents of the body and dress. Then, Allah Himself states
      the reason for enjoining the Command, saying: " This is an appropriate way by adopting which the Muslim women will
      be recognized and will remain safe from trouble. " Evidently, this instruction is being given to those women who
      regard flirtation and stares and evil advances by men as annoying and troublesome and not as enjoyable, who do not
      want to be counted among ill-reputed, immodest societygirls, but wish to be known as chaste and modest domestic
      women. To such noble and pious women Allah says: 'If you really wish to be known as good women, and the men's
      lustful attention is not pleasurable but embarrassing for you, then you should not come out of your houses in full
      make-up like the newly-wed brides so as to display your beauty and physical charms before the greedy eyes of the
      people, but the best way for this would be that you should come out in a simple sheet fully concealing your
      adormments and covering your face and walking in a manner that even the jingle of your ornaments does not attract
      attention. The woman who applies herself to make-up and does not step out of the house until she has fully
      embellished and decorated herself with every adornment cannot have any other intention that to become the center
      of attention of aII the men, whom she herself allures. After this if she complains that the greedy looks of the
      people cause embarrassment to her, and she dces not wish to be known as a " society woman " and a " popular lady
      ", but wants to live as a chaste house-wife, it will be nothing but a fraud. It is not the word of the mouth of a
      person that determines his intention, but his real intention is manifested in his act and mode of behavior.
      Therefore, the act of the woman who appears before the other then attractively itself shows what motivates her
      behaviour. That is why the mischievous people cherish the same hopes from her as can be cherished from such a
      woman. The Qur'an tells the women: " You cannot be chaste women and society women at one and the same time. If you
      want to live as modest, chaste women, you will have to give up the ways that are conducive to becoming society
      women only, and adopt the way of life that can be helpful in becoming chaste women. " Whether a man's personal
      opinion is according to the Qur'an or opposed to it, and whether he wants to accept the Qur'anic guidance as a
      practical guide for himself or not, in any case if he does not wish to be intellectually dishonest in interpreting
      the Qur'an, he cannot fail to understand its real intention. If he is not a hypocrite he will frankly admit that
      the Qur'an's intention is what has been stated above. After this if he violates any Command, he will do so with
      the realization that he is violating the Qur'anic Command, or regards the Qur'anic guidance as wrong.

      *112) That is, " Allah will forgive the errors and mistakes that were committed in the pre-Islamic days of
      ignorance, provided that you reform yourselves now when you have received clear guidance, and do not violate it
      intentionally. "</p>
