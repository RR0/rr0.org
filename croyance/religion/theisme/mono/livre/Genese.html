<title>Génèse</title>

<p>La Génèse de la <a href="Bible.html">Bible</a> décrit la création du monde par Dieu. Il sous-tend ainsi la thèse du
  <a href="../../Creationnisme.html">créationnisme</a>.</p>
<p>En Interprétation littérale de la Bible, en particulier de la Génèse.</p>
<p>Selon cette croyance, Dieu créa la Terre en 7 jours, c'est-à-dire en 7 fois 24 heures.</p>
<p>Weirdly, although the whole issue had stemmed from an overly literal interpretation of the Bible, the second wave of
  creationists began madly embellishing the Biblical accounts of early man in an effort to get around some of the more
  undeniable evidence, such as dinosaur fossils.</p>
<p>The dwindling pool of modern creationists now tries to paint a picture of a Fred Flintstone-style Garden of Eden in
  which cheerful velociraptors traipse around with Adam and Eve like oversized puppies. According to these
  revisionist-literalists, pretty much any reference to a generic animal in the Bible is inclusive of dinosaurs.</p>
<p>The modern crop of creationists is often perceived as a bunch of harmless cranks, like Jerry Falwell and the Attorney
  General of the United States. Sure, harmless! They run wacky organizations like the "Institute for Creation Research"
  and the "Center for Scientific Creation," which contain arguments like "Evolutionists raise several objections. Some
  say, 'Even though evidence may imply a sudden creation, creation is supernatural, not natural, and cannot be
  entertained as a scientific explanation'" and "Teaching scientific evidence for creation has always been legal in
  public schools. Nevertheless, many teachers wonder how to do this."</p>
<p>If you're thinking that you don't know a lot of evolutionists who say evidence implies a sudden creation, or teachers
  who are wondering how to teach said evidence, welcome to the club. But then, it takes a special kind of thinking to
  keep ancient anachronisms alive and kicking.</p>
<p>A special kind of thinking of the sort perpetuated by the aforementioned Attorney General John Ashcroft, who launched
  a Justice Department investigation of a Texas professor for demanding that future medical students truthfully tell
  their opinions about the origins of human life before he would agree to write recommendation letters for them. But
  hey, who wouldn't want a doctor that believes women can be extracted from your ribs? </p>
