  <p lang="ar">بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمنِ الرَّحِيمِ. الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ وَالْعَاقِبَةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ
    وَصَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ خَاتَمِ النَّبِيِّينَ وَعَلَى جَمِيعِ الأَنْبِيَاءِ وَالْمُرْسَلِينَ.</p>
  <p lang="ar-Latn">bism allh alrrahmn alrrahimi. alhamd lillah rabb alealamin waleaqibat lilmuttaqin wasalla alllah
    ealaa muhammad khatam alnnabiiyn waealaa jamie al'anbia' walmursalina.</p>
  <p lang="en">In the Name of Allah, the Merciful, the Beneficent - All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds, and
    the [praiseworthy] end is for those who fear Him; and may Allah send blessings upon Muhammad, seal of the Prophets,
    and upon all the Prophets and Messengers.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p lang="en">As for what follows:</p>
  <p lang="en">Indeed you mentioned, may Allah have mercy on you, by the guidance of your Creator, that you were
    interested in an examination of what is known of all the transmitted reports on authority of the Messenger of Allah,
    peace and blessings upon him, regarding traditions of the Dīn, its rulings, and everything from it regarding
    rewards, punishments, motivations, admonishments, and other descriptive topics through chains of narration which
    were related by and circulated between Ahl ul-Ilm.</p>
  <p lang="en">Thus you wished, may Allah guide you aright, to be informed about all of [the transmitted reports] in the
    form of a calculated composition and you asked me to abridge [it] for you in writing without a great amount of
    repetition. You allege that [much repetition] would distract you from what you intended in terms of understanding
    and deriving rulings from [the reports].</p>
  <p lang="en">And because of that which you have asked, may Allah be generous with you, when I am attributed to its
    successful management and whatever condition can be construed by it, if Allah wills, (it will lead to) a
    praiseworthy ending and obtainable benefit.</p>
  <p lang="en">I thought at the time you asked me to undertake that [task]- if it was determined for me to do so, and
    preordained for me to complete it- that the first to benefit from that would be me specifically before anyone else
    and this is due to a great number of reasons which are too lengthy to describe except [to say] that in summary,
    having precision regarding a select few [narrations], and accuracy in them, is easier for a person than to undertake
    of a great number of them, and especially for one who is indistinguishable in it from the common people [in this
    matter] unless someone else informs him of the distinction.</p>
  <p lang="en">If the matter is just as we described, then focusing on the few authentic narrations is worthier for them
    than seeking an abundance of weak narrations. Although indeed it is hoped for that some benefit is attained by
    seeking after a large number [of Ḥadīth] of this type, and gathering the repetitions for them, but only for the
    elite who are endowed with some awareness and knowledge in their means [of ascertaining authenticity] and
    defects.</p>
  <p lang="en">Thus that, if Allah wills, will happen through whatever will be brought to bear of that [awareness,
    distinction, knowledge of the means, and defects] on the advantage in seeking large numbers of [the various
    categories of Ḥadīth]. And as for the common people who are different from the elite in terms of awareness and
    knowledge, then it is senseless for them to seek large numbers [of various categories of Ḥadīth], while they are
    unaware of the few [Sahīh].</p>
  <p lang="ar">أَمَّا بَعْدُ فَإِنَّكَ يَرْحَمُكَ اللَّهُ بِتَوْفِيقِ خَالِقِكَ ذَكَرْتَ أَنَّكَ هَمَمْتَ بِالْفَحْصِ
    عَنْ تَعَرُّفِ جُمْلَةِ الأَخْبَارِ الْمَأْثُورَةِ عَنْ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ فِي سُنَنِ

    فَأَرَدْتَ- أَرْشَدَكَ اللَّهُ- أَنْ تُوَقَّفَ عَلَى جُمْلَتِهَا مُؤَلَّفَةً مُحْصَاةً وَسَأَلْتَنِي أَنْ
    أُلَخِّصَهَا لَكَ فِي التَّأْلِيفِ بِلاَ تَكْرَارٍ يَكْثُرُ فَإِنَّ ذَلِكَ- زَعَمْتَ- مِمَّا يَشْغَلُكَ عَمَّا لَهُ
    قَصَدْتَ مِنَ التَّفَهُّمِ فِيهَا وَالاِسْتِنْبَاطِ مِنْهَا. وَلِلَّذِي سَأَلْتَ- أَكْرَمَكَ اللَّهُ- حِينَ رَجَعْتُ
    إِلَى تَدَبُّرِهِ وَمَا تَؤُولُ بِهِ الْحَالُ إِنْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ عَاقِبَةٌ مَحْمُودَةٌ وَمَنْفَعَةٌ مَوْجُودَةٌ
    وَظَنَنْتُ- حِينَ سَأَلْتَنِي تَجَشُّمَ ذَلِكَ- أَنْ لَوْ عُزِمَ لِي عَلَيْهِ وَقُضِيَ لِي تَمَامُهُ كَانَ أَوَّلُ
    مَنْ يُصِيبُهُ نَفْعُ ذَلِكَ إِيَّايَ خَاصَّةً قَبْلَ غَيْرِي مِنَ النَّاسِ لأَسْبَابٍ كَثِيرَةٍ يَطُولُ بِذِكْرِهَا
    الْوَصْفُ إِلاَّ أَنَّ جُمْلَةَ ذَلِكَ أَنَّ ضَبْطَ الْقَلِيلِ مِنْ هَذَا الشَّانِ وَإِتْقَانَهُ أَيْسَرُ عَلَى
    الْمَرْءِ مِنْ مُعَالَجَةِ الْكَثِيرِ مِنْهُ. ولاسيما عِنْدَ مَنْ لاَ تَمْيِيزَ عِنْدَهُ مِنَ الْعَوَامِّ إِلاَّ
    بِأَنْ يُوَقِّفَهُ عَلَى التَّمْيِيزِ غَيْرُهُ. فَإِذَا كَانَ الأَمْرُ فِي هَذَا كَمَا وَصَفْنَا فَالْقَصْدُ مِنْهُ
    إِلَى الصَّحِيحِ الْقَلِيلِ أَوْلَى بِهِمْ مِنَ ازْدِيَادِ السَّقِيمِ وَإِنَّمَا يُرْجَى بَعْضُ الْمَنْفَعَةِ فِي
    الاِسْتِكْثَارِ مِنْ هَذَا الشَّانِ وَجَمْعِ الْمُكَرَّرَاتِ مِنْهُ لِخَاصَّةٍ مِنَ النَّاسِ مِمَّنْ رُزِقَ فِيهِ
    بَعْضَ التَّيَقُّظِ وَالْمَعْرِفَةِ بِأَسْبَابِهِ وَعِلَلِهِ فَذَلِكَ إِنْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ يَهْجُمُ بِمَا أُوتِيَ مِنْ
    ذَلِكَ عَلَى الْفَائِدَةِ فِي الاِسْتِكْثَارِ مِنْ جَمْعِهِ. فَأَمَّا عَوَامُّ النَّاسِ الَّذِينَ هُمْ بِخِلاَفِ

<p lang="en">Then we, if Allah wills, will begin to extract and compose what you have asked upon conditions which we
  shall mention to you. We set ourselves upon the entirety of what is transmitted from the reports on authority of the
  Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings upon him. Then we divided it up into three sections and three levels of people
  without repetition except:</p>
<ol>
  <li lang="en">When coming to a point where it was essential to repeat a narration in which there is an addition that
    clarifies the meaning of the first one; or</li>
  <li lang="en">When there is a second chain that supports the first one in some hidden defect present since the
    additional significance in the second Ḥadīth assumes the position of a complete Ḥadīth.</li>
</ol>
<p lang="en">Repeating narrations which have the kind of ‘addition’ we described is inevitable [since it eliminates the
  perceived hidden defect of the first narration]; or that significance [of the addition] is separated from the entire
  narration by abbreviating it when it is possible [to understand the significance from a small part of the narration],
  however separating the relevant part of the narration from the rest might make it difficult to understand the link
  between them, so repeating it in its original form when that proves difficult is safest.</p>
<p lang="en">Thus when we find that it is avoidable to repeat the narrations in their entirety we take care not to do
  so, if Allah wills.</p>
<p lang="en">As for the first category, we aspired to advance the report which is safer from defects than any others,
  and is purified due to being related by people of integrity in Ḥadīth, and certitude for what they relate; there are
  no strong disputes found [compared to the reports of other Thiqāt] regarding their transmissions, and no excessive
  inconsistencies [in their own reports] - just as is the case regarding a great number of Muhaddithīn and which appears
  in their narrations.</p>
<p lang="en">Thus when we examined reports of this description from the people, we also came across reports in whose
  chains there fell some of those who are not described with memorization and precision, like those of the previous
  description before them. Although they fell below what we described [from the first group], they still have the
  designation of protection [from ill-repute] and truthfulness; and they acquired knowledge, included among them are the
  likes of Atā’ bin is-Sā’ib, and Yazīd bin Abī Ziyād, and Layth bin Abī Sulaym, from among the carriers of Āthār and
  the relaters of Akhbār.</p>
<p lang="en">So even though they possessed what we described of knowledge, protection and being known as scholars among
  Ahl ul-Ilm, their contemporaries who we mentioned as precise and sound in transmission were above them in status and
  rank because this [the first category] is a high rank and sublime characteristic according to Ahl ul-Ilm.</p>
<p lang="en">Do you not see that when you weigh these three people we mentioned- Atā’, Yazīd, and Layth- with Mansūr bin
  il-Mu’tamir, Sulaymān al-A’mash and Ismā’īl bin Abī Khālid in regards to precision in Ḥadīth and soundness in it, you
  will find them distinct from others and not near them [in rank?]- there is no doubt regarding that among the people
  knowledgeable in Ḥadīth since the soundness of the memorization of Mansūr, al-A’mash, and Ismā’īl, and their precision
  in Ḥadīth was well-known among [the people knowledgeable in Ḥadīth] and they were not aware of examples of that from
  Atā’, Yazīd, and Layth.</p>
<p lang="en">Upon the same course as the above, when you weigh between the two levels like Ibn Awn and Ayyūb
  as-Sakhtiyānī with Awf ibn Abī Jamīlah and Ash’ath al-Humrānī- and all 4 are companions of al-Hasan and Ibn Sīrīn-
  there is disparity between the two groups. Between these two groups is a distance in terms of perfection of virtue and
  soundness of reporting even though Awf and Ash’ath are not repelled from [the status] of truthfulness and honesty
  according to Ahl ul-Ilm, rather the situation is as we described regarding their position.</p>
<p lang="en">We only mentioned these examples by way of naming them specifically so that their examples might be an
  indication for whoever is ignorant of the path to return to understanding of Ahl ul-Ilm regarding the ranking of its
  people. Thus there is no shortchanging the men of elevated rank any amount of what is due his level, and there is no
  elevation of those who are lower any amount of knowledge above his position- and each who possesses the right is given
  his right and is settled in his rank.</p>
<p lang="en">It has been mentioned on authority of Ā’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that she said: ‘The Messenger
  of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah upon him, ordered us to afford people their (rightful) positions according to
  what the Qur’ān states: {And above all who possess knowledge is another who is knowledgeable}[Yūsuf: 76] . Thus based
  on the example of what we mentioned [regarding the narrators of Hifẓ and Itqān, and narrations which lack excessive
  inconsistency or strong contradiction], we compiled what you asked for of [those kind] of reports on authority of the
  Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah upon him.</p>
<p lang="en">As for anything of that wherein the people were charged [with some criticism] by the people of Ḥadīth, or
  by the majority of [the people of Ḥadīth], then we did not preoccupy ourselves with bringing forward their narrations,
  such as Abd Allah ibn Miswar Abī Ja’far il-Madā’inī, Amr bin Khālid, Abd il-Quddūs ash-Shāmī, Muhammad ibn Sa’īd
  il-Maslūb, Ghiyāth ibn Ibrāhīm, Sulaymān bin Amr Abī Dāwud an-Nakha’ī, and those like them whereof they were accused
  of fabricating narrations and manufacturing reports; and like that are those whose narrations are dominated with
  Munkar, or mistakes- we withheld from their narrations as well.</p>
<p lang="en">An indication of Munkar in the narration of a Muhaddith is when his transmission differs with the
  transmission of a Muhaddith from the people of memorization and acceptance, or does not agree with it when the two are
  compared. When the majority of a person’s narrations are like that, he is abandoned [Mahjūr] in Ḥadīth, and not
  accepted in it, and his narrations are not acted upon. The following are those Muhaddithīn who are among this group:
  Abd Allah ibn Muharrar, Yahyā bin Abī Unaysah, Al-Jarrāh bin ul-Minhāl Abūl-Atūf, Abbād bin Kathīr, Husayn bin Abd
  Illah ibn Ḍumayrah, Umar bin Suhbān, and those of the same type in terms of transmission of Munkar Ḥadīth. We did not
  pause upon their narrations or preoccupy ourselves with them due to the ruling of Ahl ul-Ilm.</p>
<p lang="en">That which we are aware of from their school of thought in accepting what is singularly reported by a
  Muhaddith from the narrations is that (the Muhaddith) took part along with the trustworthy narrators from Ahl ul-Ilm
  wal-Hifẓ in transmitting some of what they transmitted, and [the Muhaddith] is predominantly in agreement with them;
  when one is found like that, then if he adds to [the transmission] anything not found with his companions, then his
  addition is accepted.</p>
<p lang="en">As for those who you see resorting to the likes of az-Zuhrī due to his greatness, and due to the great
  number of his companions being among the precise Huffāẓ, [resorting to] his Ḥadīth and the Ḥadīth of those like him,
  or to the likes of Hishām ibn Urwah, then their Ḥadīth are extensively shared among Ahl ul-Ilm. The greater majority
  of their companions related their Ḥadīth in agreement with one another [with few having contradictions]. Thus to
  transmit from [Urwah and az-Zuhrī], or one of them, from among the multitude of Ḥadīth, what is not known among any of
  their companions, and [the Rāwī] is not of those who share in the Sahīh narrations [found] among them, then it is not
  allowed to accept the narrations of this category of people, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p lang="en">We have explained from the school of Ḥadīth and its people some of what those who wish to traverse the path
  of [the Muhaddithīn] should aim for, and be guided towards. We will, if Allah wills, add to the explanation and
  clarification in another place in this book upon the mention of defective reports [Mu’allalah] when we come to it, in
  the places where explanation and clarification are appropriate, if Allah wills.</p>
<p lang="en">And what follows:</p>
<p lang="en">May Allah have mercy on you, if not for that which we saw of an evil act, largely from those who claim to
  be Muhaddithīn, in what they were supposed to adhere to when putting forward weak narrations and abominable
  transmissions and their neglect for the investigation of famous Sahīh narrations related by the trustworthy narrators,
  well-known for their truthfulness and honesty, after knowledge of them and affirmation with their tongues, that a
  great many of [weak and abominable narrations] which were cast towards heedless people are denounced and spoken of as
  not acceptable whereof the A’immah of the people of Ḥadīth criticized their transmissions- A’immah like Mālik ibn
  Anas, Shu’bat bin al-Hajjāj, Sufyān bin Uyaynah, Yahyā bin Sa’īd al-Qattān, Abd ir-Rahman ibn Mahdī, and other
  A’immah- then the establishment of what you asked for of distinction [between the types of Ḥadīth] and collection [of
  those which were Sahīh] would be easy for us. However on account of what we informed you of regarding the people’s
  circulation of abominable reports with weak, unknown chains, and their casting them towards the common people who are
  not aware of their defects, responding to what you asked became lighter upon our hearts.</p>
