UFOLOGY: THE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT
AND SOCIAL CONTEXT OF THE STUOY OF
UNlDENTlFlED FLYING OBJECTS
3oseplz A. Blake
The UI;O Problem
TJIIS paper is conccrned with ufology. By ufology we mean the study
of unidcntified flying objects as elements in an indepndent theoreticalconccptiial scheme. This is a roundabout way if referriiig to
ufology as a 'science', necessitated by the tact that its status as a
'science' js questioned. Yet, ufology has devclopcd as a distinct body
of data siudied by distinctly 'crcdentialled' invesiigators, some of tlien~
affiliated with organisations devoted to the study of UFOs. Ufology
is also in the process of developing distinct theoretical schema
appropriate to its data base. l'he task of this pnper dl bc to explore
ufology 3s a developing sciencc, in comparison with and agûinst the
backdrop of convcntional or normal science.
The essential problem in nprd to uiiidentified îlyiiig objects has
always becn accountability. There are hvo general ways of accounting for them. The lirst is to dcfine them as naturnl phenornena, thus
including them within the bounds of normal sciencc. Indeed, we my
s~y that the definition of UFOs as natunl phcnomena follows from the
acceptance of one or another of the thcories of normil science. Those
within this category include the debunkers and the hopefuls. The
former arc convinced ihat UFOs are 'nothing more than' stars, birdq
swamp gas, hoaxes, or 'mass hystecia'.' The Iiopefuls are those who
mould argue, and hope to demonstrate, that UFOs are secret wcapoiis,
ertra-terrestrial vchicles or something else subsumable under normal
science.' Tiieir task is to marshall the cvidcnce. This tnsk appears
doomcll to frustration by virtue of the non-receptivciicss of estnblishmcnt science.'

~olisc<i by the cult groups and their leaders.' Accountability schemes
lave bcen notably idiosyncratic and hopelessfy inaccessibte to verificition procedures of any kind. Such schemes have aii fivatcd one basic
iact, howcver, and that is the essentially experientd nature of UFOs.
It is from this point that a second styk of accountability emerges.
Its proponents adopt what they cd a 'macrocosmic approach'* and
refer to what they do as either 'ufology' or 'paraufology'.
me experience of UFOs extends at lest two centuries into the
past.@ Records go that Far back with certainty. Equally certain is the
fact that such exFerience occurs in dispersed groups of people, either
~ublics or social networks. The phenomena consist of the reported reactions of the people involved to an ment or series of events, first in
smaii numbers, then increasing to a high point, finally decreasing again.
If plotted on a graph, the horizontal axis of wliich is in time units and
the vertical axis in numbers of people, the phenomena assume the
shape of a curve or wave.' Such a wave may occur once or it may recur.
If the wave, or one of the waves, is 'caught' at some point in its existence by the organisation of some of those who hclped to coiistitute
it, then it becomes an 'arrested' wave. At this point, traditional social
science language may fefet to a social movement.
The UFO as a category derives from, and specilicauy refers to, a
series of waves followiig one anothcr more or less continuously since
1947; it is also applied 20 a number of previous waves which were
recognised and interpteted at their timcs of orrurence as observations of 'strange' or 'mysterious' aerial objccts. Specifially rccognised
waves occurrcd in the hte 1890s in the United States, 1909 and 1913
in Great Britain, near the end of World \Var II in Europe and the
southwest Pacific, 1945 and 1946 in Scandinavia and 1947 '0 date
around the wor1d.l It is this last sct of wavcs, publicly initiated by the
famous Kcnneth Arnold sighting, which was 'arrested' or organised.
The organisation of devotees aiid iritercstcd people erisured the continucd c+stcnce of the phenomena by cnsuriiig continually generatcd
data and by p;oviding at least minimal rcsourccs for the study of such
data. Fr?m this basis emcrgcd ufology.
The UFO Experience and Enzergirrg Ufobgy
F. S. C. Northrop says that, 'Nature . . . as givçn by tiatural scicnn,
is prtly kiiomn cmpirically by immcdiate intiiititk arid the scnscs and
partly kiiown tlicorctically by the iiitcllcct :id tlic imagiiiation checkcd
indirecdy by expenmentai verifi~ation'.~ He adds, homever, that the
'immediately apprehended fact' which is intuited is 'independent of
aU conccpts and th~ry'.'~ Facticity jmplies meaiiing and to endow
that which is intuited or senscd with meaning is to bring to bear
theoretical presuppositions and conceptuaiisations. As Hanson puts it,
'eves, ~erception involres an aetiology and a prognosis'." As somcthing is immediately apprchended there is a tendency either to ignore
it or to integrate it into an already existent sociaiiy defined order of
tbings.
Yet some experiences are too jarring. They are strange enough to
rcsist integration and bold enough to defy being overlooked. The
social basis of the extension of such phenomena has becn referred to.
At this point we must address the phenomena. Our perspective
suggests that that which is experienced wiii either be ignored, integratcd, or form the basis of a new socially constmcted reality. We
are studying ufology as part of one of thcse new reaiities. To do so
mit1 require an examination of the developing theories of ufology, in
terms of those shared clcments callcd 'ufology'. It dso requires
addressing the experience and with this we shall begin.
The catcgory 'UFO' includes sightings of 'flyiiig saucers' and other
unknown aerial objects, as weU as close encounters, physical effects
(e.g., illness), and electromagnetic effects (e.g. interference with the
operation of automobiles and other machinery). As FIamm~nde~~
points out in'his history of the plienomena, these constitiite the body
of data to be accounted for. The catcgory also includcs abductions,"
contactee stories, animal m~tiIations,'~ biblical pl~enomena,'~ occult
phenomena," strange disappearances," including those in the socalled 'Bermuda' or 'Devil's' Triangle." Even more niarginaiiy included are accounts of the Yeti, Sasquatch ('Big Foot') and other
'strange animai' sightings."
What we have to deal widi here is the UFO as experienced, the
translation of thesc expericnces (siglitings) into reports and the cltegorisation of such reports by ufologists. Wiat we bcgin wirh is the
sighting report. Leaving out al1 the periphcral plicnomena and focusing on unidentified /lyirtg objects wc find rcportcr coiiccptiralistations
diffcriiig ovcr time. Reports coiinected with the first nlnjor mve, 1896
to 1897, are pl~rascd in tcrms of 'inystcry airsliips'. htcr wavcs up
tlirough the 1930s are characteriscd by rc-arts of 'ghost airplanes'.
Allicd airmcn near the end of fforld \Var II rcpitcd 'foo figlitcrs'.
Joseph A. Biake
Swcdcs, in 1946, rcportcd 'ghost rockets'. In the scries of waves beginning in 19-17 were to be found reports of 'flying saucers' and many
sirnilarly narned Rying objects.
Al1 these reports offcr us labcls. These labels werc of things familjar
applicd to things ~nfamiliar.~" As Hynek tells us in reference to his
interviews with UFO reporters :
'The expenence had the "reality" of a iangible physical event, on a per with, for example, the perception of an automobile accident or of m elcphant performing in a circus, except for one thing; whermr reporten
have an adcquate vocabulary to describe automobiles and elephants,
they are almost always at an embarrassing loss for words to deMbe
their UFO experiencc"1
A descriptive label 'both classic and original' was provided by one of
Fowler's rcspondents :
' "It was like two hamburger buns, one on top of the other, with a sandwiched piece of meat sticking out al1 around." Iiere was a penuinely
honest attcmpt to describe an inexplicable but very real event within the
context of the wimess's common vocabulary and cmyday experienœ."=
The suggestion here is that the UFO erpecience is uncommon, ir.,
iiot an everyday life experience. Clark and Coleman go even further,
suggesting that many UFO experiencn are cssentially altered states
of consciousness. Of one case, for example, they ask (and answer):
'Was Johannis's a "rd" experience? .4 question like this is almost im- possible to answer'. . . because in the UFO myth '*objcctivew and "sub- jective" elements are often indistinguishable. Perhaps significantly, however, Johannis relates that early in the cxpericnce he felt as if he werc "dre8*ng**.'zJ
That the 'UFO experience is Iaklled, howevcr objective or subjective,
is clear. That the labelling represerits the application of the faniiliar to
the unfamiliar is also clear. What is not clcar is, on the one hand,
a consistency of labelling among reports in a wavc and, on the other,
diversity in labelling among waves.
It is with the development of specific problcms that WC find the
developrncnt of a science and, in this regard, ufology is not an exception. The gencral problcm in rcgard to UFOs is accouiitability.
One of the first thcorctical problcms to erncrge is in relation to the
consistcdcy, yët divcrsity, of reportcd cx~cricnccs. Sitnply stated, the
naticre of UFOs secms to fit thc liistorical tirnc period in which they
are sighfed. This fact has bcen Eommented upon by scvcnl ufologi~ts.~~ Rclatcd to tliis is the question: why don't they nmke thcmsclvcs knom to lis? Thc ways of dcaling with these qiicstions
corrclate Iiiglily with diffcrent perspcctivcs. *
Therc are tlirce ways of dealing with these qiicstions. Two of these
ways treat the UFO phenornena as objective, one treats them as subjective phenomena. The over-al1 naturalist approach to this problem
is to phrase it in tenus of perception and misperception and correct
or incorrect conceptualisation; the latter assessrnent is made on the
basis of possible conceptuai schemes known to thc natud scientist
nther than those available to the witncss. One of the ôest accounts
of this type is by Hartmann:' who analysed oighting reports of the
reentry of satellite dcbris. Of those who tend to define UFOs as
objective phenornena, some sec the different liistorical waves as rep
resenting esscntiaily different phenomona, or at least see the phcnomena of pre-1947 waves as inaccessible. These are genedly the same
people, debunkers or hopefuls, who tend towards dcfining UFOs as
natunl phenornena. Othcrs who dcfine UFOs as objective phenomena
suggcst tlic differcnces over time as due to operator intcnt. Stringficld,
foiéxample, suggests that:
'Whatever the rcason, or non-rea~on, for the UPO actinns . . . rccorded
in the more thm eighty thousand rntries in Dr. Dwid Sniiiidcrs' data
bank, it appears tliat hurnan kind is at the mercy of a vanguard who, seemingly selfish in purpose, continue to reconnoticr Earrh, in clull
contentpi, to fulfil that purp~se.'*~
In reference to humanoid encounters he says:
'Rexarch records show again and apin, when Iiumanoids are-near, so is an odor. Sinnger than tlieir odor is tlicir diversity of six and features
and belinvior. Teil Dlnechcr and 1 have fr~.ucletiUy discussed the%

the time and place of tlieir siglitings.' Ire suggests tlmt, 'the UFOs

~uitncsses'.~~ The approach of hlisbury and Stringfield is a natural
science approach of hopefuis. One of the more consistent subjective
approaches is that of Clark and Colemado and aiIl be dealt with in
thc next section.
Tlzeoreiical Elemciits of Ufology

.coiifusion and ambiguity exists in this regard it is, nonethcless, the
area of most agreement among ufologists. By scope we refer to the
breadth of phenomena covered by various perspectives in ufology.
It is in this regard that we find the most diversity among ufologists
as different definitions of scope come to define different and competing
theorics of UFO. By methodology we refcr to those niles of proccdure and evidence used by ufologists in guiding their work and
detennining the credibility of their data. Here we find the greatest
collective emphasis among ufologists.
We have, inevitably, used certain concepts of ufology already in
this paper. An cxpandcd discussion is necessary, however. We have
first to note the distinction betwcen a sighting and a report. According to one ufologist :
tA "sighting" is any observation of Mme unexplained aerial phenornenon.
A "report" is tlie oral or wntten record of a qighting. A "case" refcn
to a report, plus other elementa that are associatcd with if, sucli as in- formation about the observer, an account of the investigation, rcferenca
to the report, or conclusions drawn from the inforinrition gath~red>'~
Such distinctions are simple, comrnon, but necessary. We nccd onlg
rcfer to a case in which the distinctions wcre not madc to sec why.
ïhe fact is that mani UFO sightings are not reportcd. A ~aÏlu~
public opinion poll relcased early in 1966 estimatcd that a total of
~,ooo,ooo Amcricans have seen UFOs; 5 per ccnt of the sample who
had heard 01 WOs reported a sightiiig to thc Gallup intervicwcr."
This compares to a total of 10,147 rcports to the Unitcd States Air
Force up to January 17, 1966." This is substantiatcd by IIynek:
'Whencvet 1 give a prescntation to Mme gtoup 1 frequcntly will ask them,
wcll, how many of you have scen 'somcthing in tlie skics you couldn't
explain; that is, a UliO . . . 1 have been surprised to fid tht IO to 15
per cent . . . [indiate that thcy have]. Tlicn 1 ask the second one,
did pou report ic to the Air Force? And maybe one or nvo wiii Say tluit
thcy , ,
Furthcr vefification of this fact is providcd by an attitude survey
donc for the Scihific Shiy of Unidcnfified FIyirtg Objects, which
rcvcalcd th? 87 pcr ccnt of those. in the sample who Iiad sccn a
UPO reportcd it only to family and f;iend~.~'
Failurc to distingiiish bctwccn a sighting and a rcport nlay obscure
important difircnccs hctwccn those who answcr 'yes' to a qucstionnairc itcm and those wlio take the tiinc, troitblc and risk of offering
a report to an official ogency. Warren:' for example, overlooks this.
distinction. He utilised the Gallup poli data rcferred to above to
test his hypothesis that UFO sightingS are linked to status frustration
and status deprivation. He found a positive relationship. His findings
may hold in cornparhg sighters and non-sighters who respondcd to
the poll. They may even say somcthing about a society that generates
such problems. But they constitute a social science debunking and
moral putdown of those who report UFOs, as weli as many of those
studying the phenomena. The Gallup sarnple represented a cross
section of the nation's population. Those who actually report sightings
constitute a very select group, evidently diffcring from sighters in
tenns of occupation, status, education, etc. Findings in relation to
the fint group cannot be generaüsed to the second.
That there is some loose usage of the terms among ufologists is
also cvident whcn they are used to define otlier concepts. Rloecher,J'
for exarnple, defincs a 'wave' as, 'any sudden and pronounced increasc of UFO sightings on a national scale, abovc what is ordinady
considered an average daily rate.' I;1ammonde'"dcfiiies a 'concentration' as, 'an uniisudly high number of sightings in one location,
or over a larger geograpliical am in a vcry short period of timc.' That
those authon refer to the temporal and spatial pnramctcrs of aggreptcd rcports, rather than sightings, is obvious from thcir discussion.
The basis of confusion here lies in the fact that, in any wavc or concentration, different numbers of rcports may be made to different
agcncics. For example, Hall," rcpresentiiig the National Investigations
Committce on Aerial Phenomcna, lists tweiity reports for 1947; the
United States Air Force Project Blue Book rclca~e'~ lists 122;
Bloccher'' searclied 142 ncrvspapers in 93 citics of 49 States, 2 Canadian provinces and the District of Columbia and foiind 843 rcports.'"
me relationship of 'wavesy 31d 'conccntratioiis' to 'flaps' is apparent. A flap is the result of a wave-conceiitration. Bloecher" gives
us the Air Forcc definition of flap as an 'advancd state of confusion'.
Both Flanmonde'.' and Stringfieldqs indicatc the media gencrated
nature of a 'fiap'. According to Flammonde:
'The iriiporrancc of knowving the Jiffcrcnce bctwcrn "coticrntration" and
"nap" lies in the fact tlint oltçn a single pcctrliar zigliring or allcgçd landing rnay stir uy the reporters, who rush 011, wriie their 'tories, and
crcnte a "f13p1', wIde a con<idcrnble numbcr of lcss scnsationnl siplitinps
    may occur in 3 given region, crçnting a Uconcelitration", but bC ahl0St
igiiorerl hy the press."'
It is also apparent that lhere is an affinity betroeen the concepts 'wave'
and tflap' depending upon the iooseness or tightness of the conceptual
distinction betneen 'sighting' and 'report'. And, despite some looscness as to what is actudy subsumed by the concept 'unidentified
Qing abject'," it is coming to be clear that, as Hynek puts it, 'We
an define a flying saucer as an acrial phenomena [sic] or sighting
that remains unexplained to the viewer at least long enough for him
tp write a report about it.'" This is the conceptual kemel of UFO
research althouyh many non-aenal phenomena may become part of
à 'case' and, eventudy, a theoreticai development.
scope
The second theoreticai element to be addresseci is scope. The scope
of ufology is determined by attempts to define boundaries and subjcct
matrer. Since boundary and subject matter varics by investigator,
clearly ufology in general is of wide and diverse scope. Nonetheles,
there are clearly emerging trends. First, thcre is what WC might cal1
a rigorous natunlist approach. IIere, the empliasis is ai unidentifid
flying objccts in the strictest sense of that tenu (sec Hynek's ddinitioa
eariier) and on modem (i.e., post-1947) Prnves. Other material is
induded only to the extent of constnicting a case for each report.
This is ufology as practised by the naturalists. It is characterised by
an approach emphasising elementnry fact gathering and, in son= cases,
the propagatiod of a prirnary opcrnting hypothcsis (e.g., thc ETHExtra;terrestrid hypothcsis). Its mcthodology is borrowed to a large
extent from the established sciences.
A second approach differs from the first mainly by including
historical experience (mystery airships, gliost rockets, foo fighters) as
pan of the UFO phenomeoa. In fact, this is an overlapping category,
characterising, on the one hand, dl but the most 'rigorous' of the
objective and subjective naturalists, on the other hand, most macrocosrnic ufologists. The latter are most clcarly recognisable by their
inclusion ihto VFO phenornena of al1 the sorts of material refcrred to
by the naturalists as periphenl or iyclcvant.'* HistoricaUy, of course,
this was the position of Charles Fort."' The most consistent recent
attempt at this approach is by Clark and Colcman and deserves
furthcr attention.
The work of Clark and Coleman." comprises most of the clcrncnts
of ufology with which WC have bccn dcnling so far. Clark and Coleman consider the 'central problem' of UFO to bey 'the absence of
redy conclusive evidencc that the abjects are what they appear to
be-namely, spaceships from other plan et^'.^^ This 'sentrûl problem', however, is set within the contest oE modern sightings. In fact,
the thcory developed by Clark and Coleman is macrocosmic, as revealed in their table of contents and discussion. Their discussion of
fairyland, voices from heaven, rnystery airships and UFOs-couched
in terms of magical, religious, and technologial impulses and the
'mystcry in the machiney
- covers contactee reports, humanoid encounters and abducton, sightings of mystcry animals ('Bigfoot),
visions and occult phenomena, and mysterious aerial objects across
the centuries and in various cultures. Thus, it is clear that the theoretical problem is, for them, to find consistency arnid diversity. To
distinguish themselves from what we have called the naturalists they
coin a label for nrhat they are about: paraufology. They refer to panufology as a ivay of 'understanding thc incomprehen~ible'.~~
Clark and Coleman discover similaritics in stories of fairy contact,
rcliious visions and contacts, encounters and abductions involving
UFO oprators. AU, they claim, have dream element~.~' The reporter
of the erperience taiks in terms of fcelings of floating; al1 report a
kind of dream perception in mliich fcw details are visible, and there is
a vague scenic description, as of a ticbuIous reah or area. Many Kport paralysis or immobility. There is timc distortion.
Tliis au tends to suggest tliat UFO contacts, with their attendant -visiw to otlier planets", anse out of aie same rnechanism [as fairp visions];
chat is, they, too, are hallucinatory uancc visions u.hose accompanying "objective" paranormal manifestations serve IO reinforcc the notion that
these visions are of a real phcc 4th real inl~abitants.''~
The UFO cnpecience, then, is essentially an altercd state of consciousness, akin to dreams, trances, hypnagogic and hypnonomic
pli~nornena.~~
Tiiis altered statc of consciousriess (the 'UFO cxperience'), according to Clark and Colemari, serves as a way of revealing basic and
universal human needs and feelings. ïïiese unconscioui needs and -
feelings are expresscd through the altcrcd statcs of conscioitsness as
mythic elemcnts or 'ardictypcs'. Clark and Coleman discuss some of
thcse mythic clcrnciits, borroming Iicavily from Jung. Iley spcak,
for cxxnple, of the clcment of rc?undticr.s that continiially reappenrs
(c.g., the shape oE the UFO), reprcsenting psychic nholcness, the
ubiquitousncss of the number tlirce, the csistcncr: of 'Iicrmapliroditic,
Yoseph A. Blake
- yet "strangcly bcautifui" beings', etc.'' Nthough they devote a good
deal of dixussion to these archetypical elements, it seerns that they
could be eliminated from thethçory without serious disjuncture.
Clark and Colcman have made an intcresting case for the UFO experience as essentiaily an altered state of consciousness. They also
argue that the 'impulses' tisted in their table of contents-magic, and
fairies, religion, technology and mysterious machinery-reptesent
conscious rationalisations of the phenomena, eacii appropriate to iw
historical-cultural time and place. These rationalisations are conscious,
collective atnmpts to d&e what Flammnde caiis 'undeîked sensory
experience'."
Yet in another sense it is clear that the Jungian archetypes ma an
essential aspect of the theory. Dropping such a discussion ltaves a
viable question : what are UFOs? Without the Jungian archetypes we
are left with a discussipn of the celationship of theory and experience;
of the rationalisation of experience. Such a discussion would, in itself,
be valilable by onenting Our perspective to an examination of the
interworking of sensory experience-phenornena-and colIcctive
attcmpts to structure and organise that expcrience. It orients us to the
social practice of accounting and accountability. But it dso leaves open
a question as to the cause of the phenomcna. mat prccipitates the
experience? This allows sevenl kinds of answers. Clark and Coleman
provide one. The altercd states of consciousness are internally generated by huvn needs. Clark and Coleman ask, 'Of what can we
possibl), be certain when liars, lunatics, drcamers, and honest sober
citizcns al1 appear to be talking in the samc language?'." Their answcr
is :
'If at their core UFO events are subjective, products of unmnxious
aeds, the UFO fact and fiction may be inscpanble, for they draw on the samc creative source; the human psyche and the archetypes of the
collcctive unçondou~'*~
Hence, the rclatjonship among altcred stnte of consciousness, archetype and rationalisation.
Tm to tlieir task of thcory-building, Clark and Colcman offer two
'laws' of 'panufology'. They are,:
i. T$C UFO mystcry is prima;ily subicctive and in contcnt primari19
~yrnbolic.'~~

This 'otherworld' of whicli thcy speak, the symbolic rcpresentation
of the unconscious, has its dark side as weU as ip bright side. Not al1
hurnan needs and feelings, however univcrsal, are decmed good, beneficial or altruistic. In this iight thcy quote <span class="people">Peter Rogerson</span>:
'This idea of the UFO and Fortean phenomcm [unexplained physigi and paraphysical evcnlsl as symholic of the unconsdous forces within
oursclver allows us to undcrstand same of the ferveur behind the sccpticism of government and dence. The [U.S. Air Force] Project Blucbook and Condon Enquiry [the miich-criticised University of Colorado

In the process of building their own new science, pâraufology, they
criticaily bare a weakness of nomai science, by exposing its operations as essentiauy hum.111.
Whcn we speak of methodology WC cefer to rules for the condua
of inquiry. We can analytidy distinguish rules of procedure from
rules of evidence. The former rcfers to ways of genciating data, the
latter to the evaluation of the data that are generated. The general rule
of procedure is that only that which is obtained by proceeding according to specifiable niles can be accorded the status 'data'. The general
rule of evidence is that oniy thosc data that ffieet certain criteria can
be accordcd the status 'good data', or 'credible data'.
'Methodologies' clcarly differ. Those mhom we have caiied the
naturatists prefer to follow the canons of noml scicnce. This rcsults
in an emphasis on methodology, with perhaps sorne liypothesis testing but littie emphasis on theory building. The 'paraufologists' are
more likcly to adopt a 'macrocosmic' approxh eniphasising thcory
construction and de-emphasising methodology. It becomes, at times,
dificult to dctermine des of procedure and evidence. Nonetheless,
tlicre is a rncthodology iinplied by the macrocosmic approach. Clark
and Coleman tell us, for instance, that:
'If at thcir core UFO evcnts are subicctive, producn of unconscious
nceds, the UFO fact and fiction may he inwparnble, for they dnw on the wmc crcative soiircc; the human psychc and the nrclietypcs of the
collcctive unconscioua'*'
Sincc the approach fociiscs on the cotiiertt of UF0 accouiits us giuen,
the proccdut31 ride rnust bc thnt oliy story reliltitig to UFOs con-
stittdes data. Good data, we may assume, are those which have cnough
points of incredibility to allow comparison among apparencly similar
cases.
It seems at times that the overriding concern of the naturalists is
~vith developing methods adequately to determine the nature of UFOs.
The naturalists themselves provide a strong lorce for defining ufology
as a science. Many have natural science credentials. By bringing
themselves and their tools to the studp of UFOs they strive to bring
respeaability to the phenornena. niey attempt to do this .thmgh
an emphasis on methodologicd ngour.
Among the naturaiists we find the expeaed injunaions of ciear
definition;" prcferable acceptance of first hand reports;'* cicar interview strategies;" and generally close investigation of each case using
thc available tools of the social and naturd sciences. The author has
persond experience in this regard from having hezrd an investigation
reported by a member to the Chicago Area Subcommittee of the
National Investigations Cornmittee on Aerial Phenomena. The investigator used a questionnaire, as well as informa1 interview techniques, scouted and measured the terrain, calculated altitude by use of
trigonometry, etc. Whatever else it was, the result was a well conducted investigation. Where appropriate, the naturalists use othei
techniques, such as photo dnalysis,18 and laboratory forensic techniques.
WC also find thc naturalists prepared to bc methodologically
crcative. 'Rie report of the Condon group on the unworthiness of
UFOs for study occxisioned such crcativity. Both Saunden and
Harkins and Hynekag proceed from a critique of the Condon grnup.
Both claim that the Condon grotip violated a cardinal le of procedure by failing to definc the problem correctly. Saunden and
IIarkins note that : . 'mhen the Univcr~ity of Colondo Proicct bcgan, the ET1 [Extra-Terrestrial Intclligencc] Hypothcsis did not Imk vcry promising. This was not

According to 1-Iynek:

obarvations" um not considered."'
He adds tlmt, 'The only hypothesis the committee could have productively testcû was: There exists a phertomenon, described by the
content of UFO reports, which presently is not physicully expiainab&."*
From this point Saunders and HarEns and FIynek take us to the
construction of rules of evidence. The test of good data for Saunden
and Harkins is thcir 'remarkability'.
'We may mcasurc thc rcniarknbiüty of any sample of first-clnss (obi&ye) statistical data about UFOs in order to sec if the sample contains
enough disnepancies to justify an effort nt hctter explanation. If it

These 'remrkables' can tlieii bc used to construct hypotheses and
theory.
Hynek" constructs an S-P diagram, whcre an index of Stnngencss constitutes onc axis and a ratine of Probability constittitcs the
other ais. Each is scoreti otie to ten.
'The Smngcness Rnting is . . . n nieasurc of liow "odd-balln a report is . . . More precisely, it caii be oken as a incasiire of the number of

Probability refers to the degrec of cotifidence one lias as to 'whcthcr

6ccupations dcmandiiig professional, scientific or technicd expertise,
good perception, and obsen~ationai skilis such as familiarity with the
sky and/or flight technology are presumed to bc good wiuiesses. To
this are added citizens of good standing or 'reputation'. Robert L.
HaP suggests as elements of 'credible testimony' reputation in the '
community, lack of 'motive for prevarication or distortion', familiarity
with UFO phenomena (and presumably attitude toward UFO), and
severai factors already considered as elements of report nliability.
Once having determined S-P rating for each case, it is possible to
separate the 'signai' from the 'noi~e'.'~ It is noteworthy that much of
the work of the naturalists consists of programmatic statements rather
than constructed theories. An exception lies in the work of VaUee,
whose four books, as noted by Durantya1 have proceeded from a
naturalist to a macrocosmic perspective similar to that of Clark and
Coleman.
The Social Coritext of Ujology
Any attempt to explore ufology as a developing science must
address the social context of that development. It is only rhen tliat we
wiU understand the forces that conditioned ufology and tliose that
deiay its being fuiiy accordcd.scientific status. There are thrce major
elements to consider: the journaListic press, the Unitcd States Air
Force, and the scientific community. It is fitting that we begin with
the press, since itswas fhe press that first took note of the phenomena
and offered a conceptualisation of importance.
Tbe UFO sighting and report that publicly initiatcd the modern
senes of UPO waves was by Kenncth Arnold in early 1947. According to Jacobs :
The Arnold sighting [tg471 was vital for modern UFO Iiistory in the
United Smtes. As a resuic of his dacription d tlx objectr, the ne*
papa hcadline writcrs coincd the term flying sarrcer, which rapidiy
spread amund the world,as the rnost popular phnse to describe UFOs.
The phrasc nllowcd pcoplc to place xcrniiigiy incxpliwble observations
in a new catcpory. Witncsses mnning the sky couid now report that the9 saw somethi& idcfitifinble: a flying saucer. hlorcovcr, the tcrm subtiy
connored an artificially consnuctcd piccc of lnrdware; a saucer is not r natural obicct. Consequcntly whcn a witness said at that the that he saw a flying Auccr, hc implied by the ils& of the tcrm itsel that he liad secn sornething stnnge and cvcn othcrwnrldly. The icm also set a tone of ridicu!~ for the phenomcna. The idn of snuccrs flying nn thcir oan volition wns nbwrd. The tcrm allorvçd pcoplc 10 lnugh af the very
notion of an unus~i:il obicct in the sky without Iinving tp coiifmnt the
circum\tanccs hchintl tlic cvcnt. Snuccrs do not fly. It was luclicrous for a
witness, using the only phrase available to him, to say that he saw one. Therefore, he obviously did not see one. The tcrm itself made the actual
event ocun in~alid'~~
This conceptualisation was set in the context of a journalistic 'theoty'
that 'flying saucers' constituted 'silly season' phenomcna. For a
scientist to engage the phenomcna seriously was to risk damaging his
professionai reputation.
At the same time, the United States Air Force took an interest,
based on the possibility that UFOs rnight constitute a tfireat to the
nation." The Air Force began investigating reports in 1947, arid
from 1948 to 1949 and 1g51 to 1969 maintailied spefial investigative
projects." There were nvo main perspectives represented in the Air
Force in its early ycars of investigation, those who believed UFOs to ' be extra-terrestrial and those who believed them to be natural, tcrrestrid phenomena. The former group rnaintlined a tenuous domination
of the early effort. This tcnuous domination ceased entirely with the
dcliberations and recommendatioris of tlic Robertson Panel in 1954.
Th; Robertson Panel, named after its cliairman, consistcd of a
srnall group of eminent scicntists convend by the United States Air
Force and the Central Inteliigence Agcncy to consider the UFO
problcm. Jacobse5 refers to the Robertson Panel as 'the moa influentid
governtnent-sponsored, non-military UPO investigation of the 1g5os.'
It 'spcnt a total of twelve hours studying the UFO phenomenon'. The
Robertson Panel was more concerned with public rcaction towards
UPO phenomeiia than with the nature of the plienometla themselvcs.
This was quite in line both ait11 the scientific establishment's
definition of UiWs as 'zmss hysteria', and with an earlier Cold War
conditioned Air Force position th aw'cnemy' could use the UFO
phcmenomenon as a 'weapon' in psychological warfarc by creating
confusion and inducing 'panic' and 'mass hyste~ia'.'~ The result mas
thc initiation of a long standing Air Force policy of ridicule and
silence on the subject.
This policy was fore-shadowed by enrlier Air Force treatment of
tlic phenorneria. As Larsen"' documents, the United Statcs Air Force
issucd a document labeUed 'Projcct Sign', clnssified 'Secret', in 1949;
at the same time, a substantiaily altcred document labclled 'Project
Saucer' was rclcasçd to the press. Vie docurneiits wcrc different in
sribstnnce aiid tone, and the lattcr ittilisc<l (nppnreiitly with succcss)
    tlic journalisticnlly constructcd concept of ridicule.
    o ose pli A. Blake
    . Fiammonde" alleges the imposition, by the Air Force of 3 'canopy
of silcnce' over the media presentation of UFO material. He daims
that, 'the pcriodicat index ... listed no matcrial on the subject from
October 1947 to January 9, 1950, aithough Titne and the Saturday
Evening rost did return to the puzzle at ieast once'." In fact, there
were listings for that time period in The Reader's Guide To Periodical
Literature but under the headings 'Iilusions and Haiiucinations',
'Aeronautics', 'Airplanes', and 'Baiioons-use in Research'. This does
raise an important question, however, about the role of the media in
rclation to the UFO phenornenon. Jacobs' reports on the serious
attention given to UFO phenomena in four major magazine articles
in 1953 (one in Life, two in Look, one in Time) and on Air Force
fcars that such attention would increase the number of reports. He
cites Ruppelt" to the effect that, upon examination of statistics, no
such one way relationship could be found.
On the other band, both Jacobs9' and flamm~nde'~ suggest a
rclationship bctween the Air Force position on UFOs ad its poliq
of ridicule and silence and the amount of attention given the phenomena by the media. We offer a test of this by comparing the nutiiber
of reports made yedy to Projcct Blue Book (the Air Force investigalive project) from 1947 to 1969 to the number of listings in l'ha
Reuder's Guide to,Periodicd Literati~re for the same pend of tiae.
ïhis appears as Table 1. We find that the ratio oE Reader's Gttida
listings to Blue Book reports fluctuates in the early yems, ccaching
high poinfs'of .96 in 1950 and .os3 in 1951 (Le., 5.3 articlcs for
each ioo reports). The ratio drops nther precipitously and remains
low until 1966, when it begins climbing to 3 high in 1969 (the year
of thc Condon Report). In 1961, for example, the ratio was .o~o;
there were no articlcs in major magazines dcspite the fact that 591
reports were made to Pro,ject Blue Book. The incrcnsing ratio of
magazine articles to reports from 1966 to 1969 retlects growing conCern about sigh$ng reports and increasingly jerious prcsentations by
the major magazines. It also parallels the pcriod of study of UFOs
done by the Condon group and fundcd by the Air Force. It appcan
that the 'canopy of silence' hypothcsis has merit.
Why thcn, has ufology not:becn fully accordcd scicntific status?
WC suggcst that journalistic ridicule, then oficial silence and ridicule,
fostcrcd dcfinitions of UFO phenoincna as irnsiiitiible for serious
scicntilic study. Thc sciciitific cstablislimcnt,in turn, siipportal the

official policy. The Robertson Pancl put its stamp of approval on
oficial policy in 1954; the Condon Group, whose findings and
methodology were approved by the National Acndeiny of Sciences,
did the same thing in 1969.)' UFOs became intcllectually excluded

that those who would pursue its study are Likcly to be excluded from
the-mcans of producing science. This means that data generation and
collection wiii be dificuit (the U.S. Air Force, e.g., for years refused
to release information on UFO cases); there wili bt no basis for career
construction, recognition and validation (the gates of aczdemia have
bcen largely closed to UFO researchon); and thex wiii be a lack
of material rcsources, i.e., money, equipment and organisation."
It was undcr these conditions that private individuais began to
combine interests and to develop research oriented organisations. The
Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) began in the &dWest in 1952, Civilian Saucer Intelligence (CSI) began in New York
, in 1952, Civiiian Research, Interplanctary Flying Objects (CRIFO)
existed in Ohio from 1954 to 1957, and the Nationai Investigations
Comrnittee on Aeriai Phenornena (NICAP) began in Washington,
D.C in 1957. There were, and are, uthcrs. Stringfield" lists seven
major UFO research groups, Flammonde9' lists five in the United
States and thirty-three in fifteen othcr countries, and Valle+'"without
clearly distinguishing research from other orientations, lists twcntytwo 'current' and eight 'defunct' groups. These privately funded rcscarch groups provide an organisatiod basis for utologg.
Through tnost of the early years of their existence they not only
scrved as data collection points but also battlcd for respectability. This
was particularly true of NICAP, wliich rnaintained a many-yearslong lobbying effort in Washington, D.C. In the period 1957 tO
1969, 'NICAP had become a forcc as a public pressure and education
group that no qtlier UFO organisation could match. Its power and
pressure wkre'a major concern to the Air Potce, and it had helped
keep the UFO issue alive for the public and in Congress." The cardid
goal of these groups was the scientific analysis of UFO phenomena.
Through the organisational basc bcgan to develop 'spccialists', not
only in ufolagy, but in various aspects of it. There are, for example,
speùdists in photo, analysis, physical traces, elcctro-rnagnaic eflects,
encounters, the govcrnment role in UFO investietion, and UFO
history, includiitg spccific 'fiaps' (such as the 1890s nirship). According to Jacobs : * -
The new thcocy [sic] arnong UFO investiptors wm that individuel
scholqs would have to study selected aspects of the plienotncnon and corne to indepcndent conclusions.'The sliift !vas away [rom asking the
"ocitsidc" coni~iiunity to considcr thc origins of UFOs nnd toward encouraging the growin:: nuniber of individiisl scicntists interected in the
subicct to condun thir own interna1 irivcstigations free from the en- cumbrances of the "szkntific e~îabtishrnent"."~~
This came to be most strongly emphnsiscd foilowing the Condon
report in 1969. In 1974 the first UFO research organisation was
formed that was completely under the direction of scientists (i.c.,
'natunlists'); it %.as called the Center for UFO studies, and directly
collected data, as well as getting case information from NICAP,
APRO and MUFON (Aiidwest UFO Network, formed in 1969)."'
Ufology is the study of unidentitied fiying objects. We have arguai
it to be a science in derelopment, in terms of the coalesciiig of Srspectires on UFOs. These perspectives have been identified as the
naturaiist and cke mncroscopic, distinguished in terms of theoreticai
scopc, methodology and emphasis, but similar in problem and conceptualisation. We have also pointed to the essentially moral and
power bases of modern science, government and popular thought as
represented by the journalistic press and the effect of conceptual exclusion on ufology. Ufology is an intellectual product of socin1 group-
- ings irot of the inteliectual elite. Its social base lies outside the intelligentsia and its organisational arena. Nonetheless, UFO phenomena
have been persistent enough and incredible enough to occasion the
emergence of sociai tics among the curious and interested, end thn>ugh
their activities to result in the emergence of ufology.
