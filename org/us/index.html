<p>
  Les <em>United States of America</em>, ou Etats-Unis d'Amérique sont souvent décrits comme le pays où l'on voit
  des ovnis. Il est vrai qu'ils recensent à la fois le plus grand nombre de cas, les plus fameux
  (<a href="../../enquete/dossier/Roswell">Roswell</a>), et les démarches officielles publiques
  (<a href="dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>) ou secrètes les plus conséquentes sur le sujet.
</p>
<p>Fidèlement à la tradition américaine de méfiance face au gouvernement fédéral, nombre d'américains accusent
  régulièrement leurs propres dirigeants et services secrets de cacher la vérité au sujet des ovnis.
</p>
<h2>Géographie</h2>
<h3>Fuseaux horaires</h3>
<p>Les "Etats-Unis" comptent les heures par 8, distinguant les heures Avant Midi (AM pour <em>Ante Meridiem</em>) des
  heures aPrès Midi (PM pour <em>Post Meridiem</em>). Ils désignent ainsi midi par 12:00 PM, et minuit par 12:00 AM. Par
  souci d'efficacité, les militaires utilisent cependant généralement le système de notation sur 24 heures, les notant
  souvent sans espace (<q>1230</q> par exemple).

<p>Par ce qu'ils constituent un très grand territoire, ils sont répartis sur 7 fuseaux horaires. On distingue en effet,
  de l'Est vers l'Ouest, les :
</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Atlantic Standard Time</em> (AST)</li>
  <li><em>Eastern Standard Time</em> (EST)</li>
  <li><em>Central Standard Time</em> (CST)</li>
  <li><em>Mountain Standard Time</em> (MST)</li>
  <li><em>Pacific Standard Time</em> (PST)</li>
  <li><em>Alaskan Standard Time</em> (AST)</li>
  <li><em>Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time</em> (HST).</li>
</ul>
<p>Le <time>1942-02-02</time>, en temps de guerre, <a href="/people/RooseveltFranklinDelano">Franklin
  Roosevelt</a> institue le <em>Daylight Saving Time</em> jusqu'au <time>1945-09-30</time>. De cette date à
  <time>1966</time>, aucune loi n'est en vigueur sur le <em>Daylight Saving Time</em>, de sorte que les états et localités sont
  libres de choisir si elles respectent le <em>Daylight Saving Time</em> et peuvent choisir quand il commence et quand
  il finit.
</p>
<p>En <time>1966</time>, quelques 100 millions d'américains suivent un<em> Daylight Saving Time</em> conforme à leurs propres lois et
  coûtumes. Le Congrès décide de mettre fin à la confusion et d'établir un schéma unique à travers le pays. C'est
  l'année de l'<em>Uniform Time Act</em> (15 U.S. Code Section 260a) qui est signé en Loi Publique 89-387 le 12 avril
  par le président <a href="/people/JohnsonLyndonBaines.html">Lyndon Johnson</a>, et stipule que l'heure d'Eté
  commencera le dernier dimanche d'avril et finir le dernier dimanche d'octobre. Cependant, tout état souhaitant
  s'exempter de l'heure d'été peut le faire en faisant passer une loi d'état.
</p>
<p>En <time>1972</time>, le Congrès revoit la loi pour indiquer que, si un état se trouve dans 2 fuseaux horaires ou plus, il peut
  exempter la partie de l'état qui se trouve dans un des fuseaux si l'autre partie respecte l'heure d'été.
</p>
<p>Le <time>1974-01-04</time>, le <a href="/people/NixonRichardMilhous">président Nixon</a> signe l'<em>Emergency
  Daylight Saving Time Energy Conservation Act</em> de 1973 et, à partir du 6 janvier, toutes les horloges sont avancées
  pour une période de 15 mois jusquau <time datetime="1975-04-27"></time>.
</p>
<p>Finalement en <time>1986</time> l'heure d'Eté sera spécifiée pour commencer à 2 h (heure locale) le <em>1er</em> (et
  non plus le dernier) dimanche d'avril. Les noms des fuseaux horaires changent alors de <q>Standard</q> à
  <q>Daylight</q> (par exemple <em> Eastern Standard Time </em>(EST) devient <em>Eastern Daylight Time </em>(EDT), et
  ainsi de suite). Le dernier dimanche d'octobre les régions en heure d'Eté retournent au temps standard à 2 h (heure
  locale). L'Arizona, des parties de l'Indiana, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, les Iles Vierges U.S. et American Samoa ne suivent
  pas le l'heure d'Eté.
</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Le président américain est accompagné d'un vice-président.</p>
<p>Le gouvernement américain utilise les termes de "Secrétaire" pour désigner les postes que les français qualifient de
  Ministre (Secrétaire à la Défense pour le Ministre de la Défense par exemple) et désignent le poste de ministre des
  affaires étrangères sous le terme de "Secrétaire d'Etat" (<em>Secretary of State</em>).
</p>
<p>Le parlement américain ou "<a href="https://thomas.loc.gov">Congrès</a>" est composé</p>
<ul>
  <li>du <a href="https://www.senate.gov">Sénat</a> (chambre fédérale)</li>

<h2>1947</h2>
<p>C'est l'année de la première vague massive d'observations d'ovnis aux Etats-Unis, qui débute en Avril. Début Juillet,
  des soucoupes volantes en forme de disque ont été signalées dans tous les états à l'exception de la Georgie et la
  Virginie Occidentale. D'après les témoins, les objets voyagent à des vitesses fabuleuses, s'arrête fréquemment pour
  stationner en l'air, et font parfois des manoeuvres incroyables qui détruiraient tout appareil conventionnel.
</p>
<p>En plus des larges observations du public, de nombreux militaires observent des objets inconnus volant près des zones
  de recherches les plus secrètes, dont des bases aériennes, des sites d'essais de fusées, et des centres de
  développement d'armes atomiques. Mais les faits entourant tous ces incidents restent hautement classifiés. Plusieurs
  années vont passer avec que les enquêteurs du <a href="asso/nicap">NICAP</a> apprennent leur existance via des anciers
  officiers. Pour calmer l'inquiétude du public à la suite des nombreuses observations rapportées, le Pentagone publie
  un communiqué de presse indiquant que les "soucoupes volantes" ne sont que la combinaison de :
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Réflexions solaires sur des nuages à basse altitude ;</li>
  <li> De petits <a href="../../enquete/meprise/rentree/meteore.html">météores</a> se désagrégeant ; et</li>
  <li>des grêlons applatis par des conditions de givre.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cependant en interne les militaires ne sont pas d'un tel avis. Le mémo du général <a href="../../tw">Twining</a>
  indique la réalité des ovnis et note également que diverses observations ont été faites de formations rigoureuses de 3
  à 9 objets. <a href="../../tw">Twining</a> conclut son mémo en recommandant qu'une enquête complète sur les ovnis soit
  menée immédiatement. Au <a href="state/wa/pentagone/index.html">Pentagone</a>, les Q-G de l'USAF répondent par une
  étude de haute
  priorité sur les disques volants, de nom de code <a href="dod/af/amc/atic/projet/sign">Sign</a>.
</p>
<h3>Roswell</h3>
    <p><a href="/time/1/9/4/7">1947</a>, c'est aussi bien sûr l'année de <a href="../../enquete/dossier/Roswell">l'incident
      de crash</a> près de <a href="../../enquete/dossier/Roswell/Roswell">Roswell</a>, au <a
        href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/amer/n/us/nm">Nouveau-Mexique</a>.
    </p>
<h2> Sign</h2>
<p>En <time>1948-02</time> le projet Sign démarre une enquête intensive de 6 mois sur les ovnis. Au départ on suspecte
  que les russes développent un appareil à réaction récupéré chez les allemands en une nouvelle arme secrète hautement
  supérieure, mais c'est finalement une explication écartée par les agents de renseignement américains en Europe.
</p>
<p>Le <time>1948-08-05</time> les officiers du projet envoient leurs conclusions sur les objets inconnus aux Q-G de
  l'<a href="dod/af">USAF</a> dans un rapport connu comme "Une Estimation de la Situation". La situation en question est
  les observations répandues, l'estimation que les ovnis sont des vaisseaux interplanétaires engagés dans une
  surveillance systématique de notre monde dans quelque but inconnu.
</p>
<p>Cette conclusion incroyable n'a jamais été officiellement admise par l'<a href="dod/af">USAF</a> ou toute agence du
  gouvernement américain, mais l'ancien directeur du projet <a href="dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>, le
  capitaine <a href="/people/r/RuppeltEdwardJ">Edward Ruppelt</a> et deux autres officiers confirmeront les conclusions
  du projet Sign au <a href="asso/nicap">NICAP</a> et à d'autres enquêteurs. D'après <a href="/people/r/RuppeltEdwardJ">Ruppelt</a>,
  l'<a href="dod/af">USAF</a> avait peur que le dévoilement de la conclusion interplanétaire provoque une panique
  massive au niveau national. Seulement 10 ans après que la pièce radiophonique réaliste de Orson Welles "La guerre des
  mondes" ait amené des milliers de personnes incrédules à quitter leurs foyers terrorisés croyant que les martiens
  avaient envahi et détruisaient la civilisation de la Terre.
</p>
<p>A la vue de cet incident l'<a href="dod/af">USAF</a> pense n'avoir d'autre choix que de garder les conclusions de
  Sign secrètes. Peu après, les Q-G publient un communiqué de presse qualifiant les ovnis de <q>canulars,
    hallucinations, et erreurs d'interprétations d'objets connus.</q></p>
<h2>1952</h2>
<p> Une autre grand vague d'observations d'ovni eut lieu en <time>1952</time>. Le 16 juillet Garde-Côtes
  des Etats-Unis publient officiellement <a href="../../enquete/dossier/Salem">une photographie</a> prise par un membre
  de leur personnel de 4 points lumineux semblant voler près d'un installation électrique de Salem, dans le
  Massachusetts. Le <a href="asso/nicap">NICAP</a> apprend que l'<a href="dod/af">USAF</a> a essayé sans succès de
  stopper la publication de cette photo et est furieuse envers le Commandant des Gardes-Côtes responsable de sa
  publication. 3 jours plus tard le 19 juillet, <a href="../../enquete/dossier/Washington">des ovnis sont observés
    manoeuvrant au-dessus de Washington</a>, DC et à un moment pénètrent l'espace aérien très restreint au-dessus de la
  Maison Blanche. Des intercepteurs F-94 sont lancés à leur poursuite, mais sont facilement distancés par les objets qui
  selon les radars ont foncé à des vitesses allant jusqu'à 7000 miles/h.
</p>
<p>This widely publicized case and a nearly identical incident the following week generated intense public curiosity and
  speculation about the UFOs and this greatly worried the Air Force.
</p>
<p>Le <time>29</time> <span class="mois">juillet</span> le général John Sanford, head of intelligence, held a press
  conference at the Pentagon and announced that the Washington sightings were the result of an "atmospheric illusion
  caused by a temperature inversion." But this attempt to explain away the unexplainable did little to dampen public
  interest in the phenomenon and a National fascination with flying saucers was rapidly developing.
</p>
<p> Alarmed by the developments of the previous year the Central Intelligence secretly took charge of UFO policy in
  1953. On January 18 a CIA sponsored group of scientists known as The Robertson Panel issued a classified
  recommendation calling for the debunking of the flying saucers in order to reduce public interest in them. This was to
  be accomplished by planting articles in magazines and arranging media programming which would attempt to convince
  Americans that UFOs were either misidentified man-made objects or natural phenomenon. This recommendation was approved
  and the secret debunking campaign has been in effect ever since.
</p>
<p>Some months after the Robertson Panel met, the Air Force quietly issued regulation 200-2 which established formal
  procedures for reporting UFO sightings made by it's personnel and further forbade the release of such information to
  the press or public.
</p>
<p>As the year ended the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a far more comprehensive regulation on UFOs known as JANAP-146.
  This secret order established a top priority communications channel for all military pilots to use to report airborne
  UFO sightings. Previous to this pilots had filed their reports once they had landed. Now however, they were ordered to
  immediately transmit a service report to the nearest Air Force Base which would allow jets to be rapidly launched to
  intercept the objects. But JANAP-146 did not apply to military pilots only. Because many commercial pilots were also
  seeing UFOs a decision was made at the Pentagon to impose the order on the airline companies. Some years later that
  move was publicly protested by a group of veteran pilots as noted in this news account wherein one called the new
  policy "A lesson in lying, intrigue, and the Big Brother attitude carried to the ultimate extreme." The airlines
  themselves however agreed to comply with the order.
</p>
<p>Because JANAP-146 is covered by the espionage laws and stipulates severe penalties for revealing UFO sightings, very
  few pilots, military or commercial, have publicly reported their airborne encounters.
</p>
<p>Collectively the policy decisions of 1953 established a program of official censorship and covert manipulation of
  public opinion regarding UFOs. Throughout the 1950s this program reinforced the already skeptical attitudes of most
  Americans who believed the idea of alien spaceships was utter nonsense. But unknown to the public an extremely
  important event was about to take place.
</p>
<p>In the Fall of 1961 there occurred an incident involving alleged contact with UFO occupants that would later gain
  international recognition. Such stories had been heard before of course. During the 1950s UFO cultists known as
  "Contactees" openly claimed to be in communication with beings from other worlds who are visiting Earth in their
  flying saucers. Not surprisingly, nearly all of these claims proved to be hoaxes or were made by mentally disturbed
  persons.
</p>
<p>But the Case of Betty and Barney Hill was different. Late one September night the couple was driving a deserted
  stretch of road in rural New Hampshire when they spotted a UFO approaching their car. They then heard a beeping sound
  and immediately became drowsy. [Beep Beep Beep Beep] Eventually they found themselves several miles further down the
  road with no memory of having driven there and had lost 2 hours they could not account for.
</p>
<p>Troubled by this strange experience the Hills finally consulted a nationally known psychiatrist, Dr. Benjamin [Si??]
  and agreed to undergo time-regression hypnosis. This is a memory retrieval technique regularly used by doctors for
  therapeutic purposes and by law-enforcement agencies to reconstruct crimes. Under hypnosis, Betty and Barney vividly
  recall the events of the missing two hours and later drew pictures of what had happened. Slowly, and with mounting
  fear each of them relived a frightening encounter with alien beings who took them from their car and led them aboard
  the now landed UFO. They were then separated and given lengthy medical examinations. Afterwards, one of the aliens
  approached Betty and began to communicate with her in broken English, she responded by asking the location of the
  Alien's planet. At this, the being led her to a large star map which he indicated showed their home base as well as
  other solar systems that they had visited either to trade with or explore.
</p>
<p>Finally, Betty was told that she and Barney would not remember their experience. They were then led back to their car
  where they watched the UFO rapidly depart.
</p>
<p>As fantastic as this story seems, many researchers now consider it to be a genuine case of contact with beings who
  are alien to this planet. One final note about this incident: In 1969 a radar report was obtained from [Peas ?] Air
  Force base which indicates that a UFO was indeed tracked on the night, at the time, and in the area where the Hills
  claimed have had their close encounter.
</p>
<p>The largest wave of UFO sightings occurred in 1965. From coast to coast strange low flying flying objects were
  reported almost nightly by people of all ages and walks of life. These sketches compiled by a NICAP researcher
  represent a small sample of hundreds of investigated cases in which truly unknown objects were judged to have been
  involved. As the year progressed the number of reports rose dramatically. On the night of August 2 thousands of people
  in 4 midwestern states witnessed spectacular aerial displays by large formations of UFOs. That same night a
  multicolored disc was photographed in Tulsa Oklahoma while several persons watched it perform low altitude maneuvers.
  This picture was extensively analyzed, pronounced authentic, and later published by Life magazine and many newspapers.
</p>
<p>But the year's most incredible development was yet to come. On the evening of November 9 hundreds of UFO sightings
  were reported throughout the northeast. In New York State luminous objects were seen hovering over 3 very significant
  locations.
</p>
<ul>
  <li> A Niagara Falls power plant</li>
  <li> A [Syracuse] relay station</li>
  <li> and the heart of New York City</li>
</ul>
<p>Within moments of the [Syracuse] sighting 9 northeastern states and parts of Canada experienced the largest power
  failure in history. Media accounts including those by NBC news, The Associated Press, and some local papers openly
  reported the UFO sightings and in a few cases suggested that they be investigated as a possible cause of the blackout.
  However, before this speculation could gain much momentum the Federal Power Commission announced that the problem had
  been caused by a broken relay in a Canadian power plant. This answer was accepted by the press and public and the UFO
  angle was quickly forgotten. But, the official explanation was untrue. Major [Keyhoe ?] reports that a private
  investigation by the utilities industry later concluded that the relay had NOT broken, but had been tripped by a huge,
  unexplainable surge of power. The only major paper which attempted to follow up on a possible UFO connection with the
  outage was the Boston Record America. But the paper's editors told a NICAP investigator that shortly after publishing
  this account of the Niagara Falls sighting they had been called by an Air Force officer at the Pentagon and severely
  reprimanded for printing the story.
</p>
<p>In any event, the public at large remained unaware of the presence of UFOs during the great northeast blackout.</p>
<p>In 1966 and 67 UFOs were repeatedly sighted and tracked on radar as they maneuvered near our Nuclear Missile
  installations in 3 western states. Although these incidents were highly classified NICAP soon learned of them through
  it's contacts within the military. Public sightings meanwhile were making headlines. In March 1966 dramatic UFO
  reports in Michigan captured national attention and thereby threatened to undermine the official coverup. Responding
  to this crisis, the Air Force ordered it's civilian consultant Dr. J. Allen Hynek to hold a press conference and
  carefully explain the sightings. Dr. Hynek began by cautiously suggesting that at least some of the objects may have
  been luminous balls of marsh gas [local audience snicker] since a few of the UFOs had been seen over a swamp.
</p>
<p>Without waiting for him to finish indignant reporters broke for the phones to tell their papers what they considered
  to be One Official Debunking Answer Too Many. Apparently their editors agreed, because general press reaction was
  openly hostile and cartoonists had a field day. [Big laugh at a comic where caveman observer sees UFO/abduction and
  remarks: Whoa, the swamp gas sure is restless tonight.] [Diddly beeping]
</p>
<p>A short time later in the face of mounting criticism from the press, public, and congress.. Secretary of the Air
  Force Gerald Brown appeared on Capitol Hill and insisted that there was no evidence that the UFOs were interplanetary
  space craft. But while this raging controversy held the public's eye, behind the scenes, the mystery itself was
  continuing to unfold. In 1967 a Nebraska policeman had an encounter which was similar to that of Betty and Barney Hill
  which also resulted in a subsequent loss of memory. Later under time-regression hypnosis Patrolman Herbert [Schurmer]
  fearfully relived a confrontation with 3 alien beings who had emerged from a landed UFO.
</p>
<p>::According to the hypnotic transcripts one of the beings apparently communicated with the trooper both verbally and
  telepathically telling him that they were intentionally showing off their craft and occasionally contacting
  individuals to slowly prepare the world when they would reveal themselves completely. The alien also said that people
  should have no fear of them because their intentions are not hostile.::
</p>
<p>In addition to hundreds of sightings researchers note that there were over 50 cases involving reliable people who
  reported being abducted by UFO occupants. While nearly all of these incidents went unmentioned in the press one of
  them managed to gain international attention.
</p>
<p>On October 11 in [Pasagoula] Mississippi two shipyard workers, Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker told authorities
  that an egg shaped UFO suddenly landed near them as they fished from a pier. 3 silvery suited creatures then floated
  from the craft and carried the terrified men aboard where they were given medical examinations. After several minutes
  they were released and the UFO rapidly departed.
</p>
<p>"You just cant make people believe", Hickson was later quoted as saying. "But they better wake up and start
  believing. We are not alone and that's all there is to it." [Scary sound]
</p>
<p>In 1975 there occurred a second rash of sightings at our nuclear related military facilities. Over a two week period
  UFOs maneuvered near missile sights and bomber bases in Montana, Michigan, and Maine. As with similar incidents in the
  mid 60s all of these sightings were classified and the public and the press remain, for the moment, unaware of their
  existence.
</p>
<p>In the fall of 1978 a large international wave of sightings suddenly erupted. The most dramatic of these occurred
  near New Zealand and involved an airborne television crew who filmed a UFO that flew alongside their plane for several
  minutes. This object and 4 others were also tracked on radar. Then in December, several UFO related Defense Department
  records were secured through a freedom of information suit brought against the government by various research groups.
  Among other things, the records detailed the classified missile and bomber base sightings which had occurred in 1975.
  According to the Washington Post the documents described the UFOs as brightly lighted, fast-moving vehicles that
  hovered over nuclear weapons storage areas and evaded all pursuit efforts.
</p>
<p>In 1982 the Supreme Court refused to hear a case in which a research group called Citizens Against UFO Secrecy had
  sued the National Security Agency in effort to obtain its classified UFO documents. In a lower court The Agency
  admitted that it had over 150 UFO related files but refused to release them claiming it's intelligence gathering
  methods and the National Security of the United States would be jeopardized if the documents were made public. The
  Federal Judge hearing the case ruled in the NSAs favor. Eventually heavily censored copies of the documents were
  released. Although these revealed virtually nothing this episode nevertheless illustrated the US Governments repeated
  use of the National Security laws to withhold information about UFOs from the public.

</p>
<p>In 1985 two former Air Force officers, Lieutenant Robert M. Jacobs and Major Florenz L. [Mansmen], publicly disclosed
  their involvement in a highly classified incident that had occurred over 20 years earlier. Jacobs revealed that an Air
  Force missile test launched on September 15 1964 from [Vandenburg] Air Force base in California had a bizarre
  encounter with a UFO high over the Pacific Ocean. The former lieutenant was in charge of a photographic team that was
  filming the launch through a high powered radar guided telescope. Both Jacobs and his superior, Major [Mansmen],
  confirmed that when the film of the test was examined it revealed that the missile dummy nuclear warhead had been
  approached by a disc shaped object as it raced down the range towards it's target. The former Major has stated that
  analysis of the film demonstrated that the UFO was a classic disc. The center seemed to be a raised bubble. The entire
  lower saucer shape was glowing and rotating slowly. Said [Mansmen], "The assumption was that it was extraterrestrial."
</p>
<p>Analyzing the film frame by frame an Air Force team was amazed to find that the UFO began to pace the dummy warhead.
  Abruptly, 4 beams of light flashed from the disc in rapid succession. Seconds later, the warhead began to tumble and
  soon fell into the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles short of it's target. According to Major [Mansmen] the film of this
  UFO incident was quickly confiscated by the CIA and everyone with knowledge of it was sworn to secrecy.
</p>
<p>In 1990, the findings of an important UFO study were published. Researchers Kevin Randall and Don Schmidt had spent 3
  years investigating the so-called Roswell Incident. This case involved the secret recovery of a large quantity of very
  strange wreckage by the Army Air Force in July 1947 in a remote part of New Mexico. At first, the military issued a
  press release stating that a crashed flying disc had been recovered. Shortly thereafter, however, the chief of the 8th
  Air Force held a press conference and claimed that the supposed flying saucer was only a downed weather balloon. But
  that explanation contradicts the testimony of former Colonel Jesse A. Marcel who was the first military man to arrive
  at the crash site. Marcel stated that the debris which was strewn over an area 3 quarters of a mile long was metallic
  and extremely light weight, but could not be cut or dented.. and when bent quickly returned to it's original shape.
  Researchers Randall and [Schmidt] tracked down other eye-witnesses who stated that 50 to 60 uniformed men spent nearly
  3 days combing the crash site trying to retrieve every last piece of wreckage. It was also learned from retired
  military sources that 7 secret Air Force flights took the debris and a large mysterious crate to various destinations
  immediately after the recovery operation. In all, over 200 persons have provided testimony that contradict the
  official weather balloon explanation. One of these, Retired Colonel Thomas [DuBoughes ??] who was General [Reighmes ?]
  agitant in 1947 now flatly states that the weather balloon announcement was a cover story designed to deflate media
  interest in the crash.
</p>
<p>And so we must ask, Did a flying saucer crash in New Mexico in 1947? The quest for the facts continues. Finally, it
  must be noted that 6 witnesses connected with the Roswell incidents have stated that they had seen the bodies of dead
  alien beings that were recovered from the wreckage.

<p>Nov 17 1994 [Anything wrong is my fault. I Made a lot Of Mis-capitalization mistakes as well as uther errors. Im

</p>
<p>HASTINGS: Ok, id like to begin this portion of the program not with a document, but rather a news count. And.. U.S.
  News and World Report is considered by most people to be a fairly conservative, relatively respectable news weekly.
  Every issue contains a feature called 'Washington Whispers' in which a variety of subjects are covered very briefly
  based on information in the hand's of this magazine's reporters and yet at time of publication have not received
  widespread attention.
</p>
<p>In the spring of 1977 shortly after the Carter administration came to office, U.S. News made the prediction that
  before the year was out someone in the new administration, perhaps President Carter himself, would release information
  on UFOs to the public. Information this magazine chose to characterize as 'unsettling disclosures'. Now this in fact
  never took place; there was no official release of information on UFOs by the Carter regime. However, at about the
  same time a number of documents began to come forward, become available to the public, through the freedom of
  information act. Those documents indicate that at least as early as January of 1953 the group in our agent, uh, the
  group, rather, in our government having overall responsibility for coordinating UFO research is indeed the Central
  Intelligence Agency. So in my opinion this prediction by U.S. News was dead-on target.
</p>
<p>As I indicated earlier. As I speak I would like to share with you excerpts from some of the documents upon which this
  program is based. I will be the first to admit that reading documents on a screen is not terribly exciting, in and of
  itself, but ive made some rather dramatic assertions in the course of the program and I think its incumbent upon me to
  be able to document at least a few of them in this program. Again, at the conclusion of the program I will provide an
  address that will allow any one of you to acquire up to 600 pages of these documents to read at your leisure. I will
  state at this juncture that some of the reproduction quality of the documents, in this case a CIA memo from 1952, the
  legibility is rather marginal. Unfortunately, the document appears exactly as it was released to researchers from the
  agency and we cannot therefore improve upon the quality. Most of what Im going to show you will be entirely legible.
  This type of venue with a flat floor CD plan makes it difficult to read type. If those of you who cant see clearly
  would like to shift chairs thats fine by me.
</p>
<p>In the next few minutes I will be presenting items relating to:</p>
<p>One(1), the takeover of the official policy of secrecy on UFOs by the CIA. Two(2), documents relating to repeated UFO
  sightings decade after decade at nuclear weapons related facilities. Three(3), a document from September of 1976 that,
  believe it or not, concerns nothing less than a blow by blow account of an aerial dogfight between a UFO and a F-4
  Phantom Aircraft. Copies of this particular document were sent to everyone from the White House to the Secretary of
  State and the highest levels of the U.S. government. And Finally(4), a document that was sent to FBI director J. Edgar
  Hoover in March of 1950 that states in black and white that the U.S. government has secretly recovered crashed flying
  saucers.
</p>
<p>------- This internal CIA memorandum is from December of 1952. It was written by one Dr. Marshal Chadwell who was the
  assistant director of a component of the CIA called the Office of Scientific Intelligence. This memo we're about to
  read was directed to the then director of CIA, General Walter B. Smith.
</p>
<p>Halfway down, this same page in paragraph 4.. We now know that the then director was informed by Dr. Chadwell that
  during the proceeding few months CIA had been apprised of, informed of, numerous overflights by unknown aerial objects
  at some of this nation's most sensitive research and development facilities, specifically nuclear weapons related
  areas.
</p>
<p>Picking up paragraph 4, third line down, quote: :: At this time, the reports of incidents convince us that must have
  immediate attention::
</p>
<p>One sentence further along it states, quote: :: Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and travelling at
  high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such nature that they are not attributable to
  natural phenomenon or known types of aerial vehicles::
</p>
<p>Consequently, this memo concludes with Dr. Chadwell recommending that the Director of CIA approach the NSC, the
  National Security Council with this matter.
</p>
<p>Quote: :: Attached hereto is a draft memorandum to the National Security Council and a simple draft NSC directive
  establishing this matter as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development
  community::
</p>
<p>The attached National Security Council directive itself invokes at the top what is called the National Security Act
  of 1947 and goes on to spell out how the CIA is to coordinate covert UFO research with other agencies within the U.S.
  government. The National Security Council by the way is made up of the President, Vice President, Secretaries of State
  and Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and director of CIA. There is no group higher in the United States
  government in terms of national security policy formulation.
</p>
<p>[Transcriber's note: Please note the next paragraph is one big honking mongoloid of a sentence.]</p>
<p>Now, ...very... dry....stuff.. Very bureaucratic.. The point is: this document lays bare for the first time, decades
  later, for public inspection, the fact that while the Pentagon through official press releases and other announcements
  were dismissing UFOs as hoaxes, hallucinations, misidentified man-made or natural phenomenon year in and year out, in
  reality, behind the scenes, the U.S. government was fully aware of and highly alarmed by sightings of unknown aerial
  objects that flew higher, faster, were more maneuverable than anything we had flying, anything our intelligence agents
  said the Russians were flying.. these objects could come and go at will through American air space and if that were
  not enough from a National Security standpoint, we did not know the intent of the uh.. persons flying, or beings
  flying these whoever the pilots were.. if that were not enough the government knew that at least as early as 1948
  these objects seemed to have a distinct interest in our nuclear weapons facilities.
</p>
<p>------ I'd like to show you now two FBI memoranda from this period that describe UFO sightings from my home state of
  New Mexico in a little greater detail.
</p>
<p>This FBI memo is from January of 1949. It was directed to the then director of CIA, er excuse me, FBI, J. Edgar
  Hoover. It was authored by the special agent in charge of the San Antonio FBI office. The subject of this memo is,
  quote: :: PROTECTION OF VITAL INSTALLATIONS ::
</p>
<p>I think the first paragraph is worth reading in its entirety, quote: [Hastings in parenthesis] :: At recent weekly
  intelligence conferences of G2, : (which was Army Intelligence) : ONI, : (that is, the office of Naval Intelligence) :
  OSI, : (which is a counter intelligence component of the Air Force to which my father belonged) : and FBI in the 4th
  Army area, officers of G2 4th Army have discussed the matter of unidentified aircraft or unidentified aerial
  phenomenon; otherwise known as flying discs, flying saucers, and balls of fire.: (the next sentence was underlined
  presumably for emphasis) : This matter is considered top secret by intelligence officers of both the Army and the Air
  Forces. ::
</p>
<p>At the bottom of this same page in the last fairly lengthy paragraph we now know that the director of the FBI was
  informed that during the preceding two months there had been numerous sightings of unidentified flying objects near
  the Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratories where only some 4 years earlier our government had secretly developed this
  planet's first nuclear weapons which we used against Japan. If you choose to read this memo, halfway down, para.. at
  the last fairly lengthy paragraph you can see that persons at Los Alamos who were reporting the UFOs to their security
  personnel included, quote: :: special agents of the office of special investigation : (which was Air Force
  counterintelligence) : airline pilots, military pilots, and Los Alamos security inspectors ::
</p>
<p>A second FBI memorandum from approximately a year and a half later indicates that the UFO sightings around Los Alamos
  and other sensitive highly classified research facilities in New Mexico had occurred with alarming frequency in the
  preceding 18 months or so.
</p>
<p>In the next slide please, halfway down the same page there is a brief one or two sentence description of what persons
  at Los Alamos and elsewhere were reporting as having witnessed. They included, One(1) ::Green fireballs, objects
  moving at high speed in shapes resembling half-moons, circles, and discs emitting green light.::
</p>
<p>We know from other documents that these green fireballs were described as performing maneuvers, obviously were not
  meteors or meteorites on a straight line trajectory but indeed were doing all sorts of maneuvers suggesting they were
  either under intelligent control or remote control. Also reported were two(2) :: discs, round flat shaped objects or
  phenomenon moving at fast velocity and emitting a [bright?] white light or reflected light::
</p>
<p>The memo goes on to say that some of the objects were meteor in appearance, meteorlike in appearance, and were later
  in fact judged to be so. But approximately 150 sightings of these objects were observed by personnel near very
  sensitive facili..
</p>
<p>...included that of these 150 or so sightings 75 or 50% were judged to be of.. uh.. objects that were in fact not
  natural or man made phenomenon. Now in addition to this document and in addition to the sightings at Los Alamos many
  other documents from this era, late 40s early 50s, um.. available to you, too numerous for me to show you one after
  the other in this type of presentation, indicate that in addition to Los Alamos other UFO sightings were concentrated
  around the Oakridge National Laboratories in Tennessee, a facility at that time second only to Los Alamos in terms of
  its developm.., importance to the development of nuclear weapons in this country. Other documents deal with UFO
  sightings repeatedly occurring around the Hanford military reservation in Washington State [my friend whispers
  something about Twin Peaks] which was at that time the world's largest nuclear weapons grade plutonium production
  facility.
</p>
<p>To summarize, late 40s early 50s, the Pentagon began dismissing, at least publicly, UFO sightings as nothing to be
  alarmed by, nothing out of the ordinary, in reality, behind the scenes, the highest levels, and I mean up to the
  National Security Council were extremely concerned by these objects coming into American air space and repeatedly
  maneuvering near our nuclear weapons related facilities.
</p>
<p>------- Moving on to the decade of the 1970s. In my slide show I note the fact that during the fall of 1975 a number
  of strategic air command bases in Maine, Michigan, and Montana experienced a rash of UFO sightings near nuclear
  weapons related installations. Either what are called weapons storage areas, bunkers containing nuclear bombs or
  missile warheads for storage, or at weapons deployment sights such as missile silos. I would like to share with you
  now parts of an officially released Air Force letter detailing UFO sightings near nuclear missile silos outside of
  [Maustrum] Air Force base, Great Falls, Montana, in early November 1975.
</p>
<p>There are far too many entries in this 4 page letter for me to read them all. I would like to quote a few to give you
  a sense of what security alert teams called SATs, these are heavily armed military police who guard the missile silos
  were reporting to command personnel at [Maumstrum] Air Force base in November of 1975. These excerpts are verbatim,
  that is word for word excerpts from what are called commander's logs. In this instance commander of [Maumstrum] Air
  Force base compiling data detailing summaries of these incidents to be sent up the chain of command to Washington.
  Picking up at the top.
</p>
<p>:: 7, November 75. Received a call from the 341st Strategic Air Command post saying that the following missile
  locations reported
</p>
<p>seeing a large, red to orange to yellow object :: It then lists the missile silos by their coded designations, M1
  etc. The next entry,
</p>
<p>[too difficult to discern Hastings commentary from quote simply by tone of voice so I chunked the following bit
  together]
</p>
<p>: SAC, (in this case Strategic Air Command) advise that the Launch Control Facility, LCF, (thats the blockhouse that
  has the electronics that actually would launch nuclear missiles) at [Harleton?] Montana observed an object which
  emitted a light which illuminated the site driveway. :
</p>
<p> Later that same evening:</p>
<p>: SAC advise missile sight K1 says very bright object to their east is now southeast of them and they are looking at
  it with binoculars. Object seems to have lights, several on it, but no distinct pattern. The orange-gold object
  overhead also has small lights on it :
</p>
<p> And then the last entry from the same evening:</p>
<p>: Missile sight L1 reports that the object to their northeast seems to be issuing a black object from it - tubular in
  shape. In all this time surveillance : (meaning radar) : has not been able to detect any sort of track except for
  known traffic. :
</p>
<p>Shortly, we'll see that that in fact changed, and ultimately radar contact was established with these objects in the
  air simultaneous to the observations of them from the ground by the security alert team members.
</p>
<p>Next slide please.</p>
<p>A couple of entries from 8, November 75.. and if you could [rack?] through focus on that for me, Paul..</p>
<p>:: A security camera team at missile sight k4 reported UFO with white lights, one red light 50 yards behind white
  light. Personnel at k1 seeing same object. ::
</p>
<p>There are then some entries which you may read for yourself if you wish indicating as I have said that ultimately
  radar contact with the UFOs was in fact established at [Maumstrum] and other radar facilities across the western
  United States. Once that occurred and these object's positions were known, Jets were launched from [Maumstrum] Air
  Force base to attempt an intercept of them not the least because they were maneuvering in near air space above nuclear
  missiles very sensitive strategic offensive weapons sites.
</p>
<p>In the second to the last entry we read, quote: :: From SAC command post. From 4 different points : (meaning missile
  locations) : observed objects and fighters. When fighters arrived in the area the lights went out. When fighters
  departed the lights came back on. : (and then it says, and this is important..) : To NCLC. :: Indicating that the
  commander of [Maumstrum] Air Force base was so concerned about the incursion into sensitive air space near these
  sights by unknown aerial objects, unknown origin, unknown intent, that the commander flashed information via teletype
  to what is called the NORAD combat operations center in Colorado Springs to inform them of what was taking place. This
  is precisely the action the commander would have taken if he had some evidence or concern that hostile intent,
  sabotage perhaps, was being directed against these missiles.
</p>
<p>In the last entry, from the same evening, :: From SAC command post. Missile sight L5 reported object increased in
  speed, high velocity, raised in altitude, and now cannot tell object from the stars ::
</p>
<p>That is almost a word for word description to one provided me at [Maumstrum] some 8 years earlier, except in the case
  when I was there it was an air traffic control radar account, a height finder radar tracking of 5 unknown targets
  performing a high speed vertical ascent. In this instance apparently you have a single object observed by one or more
  security guards at the silos either by naked eye or through binoculars witnessing the same object or type of object
  ascending and disappearing against the background of stars very quickly.
</p>
<p>Now the entry directly below the one that I just read I think is perhaps the most revealing in this entire 4 page
  letter. In that apparently the actual shape of the object could be discerned by security personnel on the ground, it
  was not a bright light or series of lights. Quote,
</p>
<p>:: SAC command post reports UFO 20 miles southeast of Lewistown. Orange white disc object. 24th NORAD region
  surveillance checking area, surveillance unable to get height check. ::
</p>
<p>Next slide please. Uh.. one more. Next slide please. There we go.</p>
<p> One last document relating to nuclear weapons cases. You'll note that the appearance of this slide is markedly
  different than the preceding slides. Thats because this is not a part of the officially released Air Force letter that
  I have been excerpting from. This in fact is a leaked document. Now I do not and never have advocated the leaking of
  U.S. government documents on the subject of UFOs or any other subject. But in 1977 someone within the Defense
  Intelligence Agency, DIA, released this teletype message and two related documents to a number of news organizations
  including the Washington Post. Indeed this documentation provided enough leading information to researchers to allow
  them to file freedom of information requests, that generated the documents that I have been showing you previously.
  This deals with cases similar to those that I have been discussing, same time frame, November of 1975, except at other
  locations. Picking up fourth line down, part 3.
</p>
<p>:: [Mynot?] Air Force Base : (which is in North Dakota) : on 10 November reported that the site was buzzed by a
  bright object the size of a car at an altitude of 1,000 to 2,000 feet. There was no noise emitted by the vehicle. ::
</p>
<p>And finally, part 4.</p>
<p>:: This morning, 11 November 75, Canadian Forces Station Falcon Bridge : (which is in Ontario) : reported search and
  height finder radar pings on an object 25 to 30 nautical miles south of the site. Ranging in altitude from 26,000 to
  72,000 feet. : (For point of reference commercial airliners fly at approximately 30,000 feet) : the site commander and
  other personnel say that the object appeared as a bright star but much closer. With binoculars the object appeared as
  a 100 foot diameter sphere and appeared to have craters around the outside. ::
</p>
<p>Now first let me emphasize that what I have presented here is a very small part of the total documents relating to
  nuclear weapons incidents involving UFOs. I think the obvious question is 'What is going on here?' and in my opinion
  the honest answer is that researchers simply do not have enough information, enough pieces of the puzzle, to draw any
  final conclusions.
</p>
<p>I will however bring to your attention the fact that over the past two decades dozens, literally dozens, of former
  and retired security alert team members or individuals who were assigned to missile and maintenance squadrons have
  been interviewed by researchers such as myself, I have interviewed nearly 20 of these gentlemen, what they have told
  us is startling to say the least. These individuals who provide us service records and other documentation
  corroborating their prepense in the squadrons at the bases they maintain they were in and at have stated that when
  these disc shape objects were sighted and tracked on radar hovering near our missiles, missiles lost all electrical
  power. All electronics went off line. Depending case to case. In some instances for simply a few minutes, in one case
  for which we have multiple sources, individuals talking about this one particular case, over 24 hours elapsed during
  which there was no power available to these missile systems. They were in effect unlaunchable. Our sources further
  state, if that were not enough, that all efforts on the part of missile maintenance squadron personnel, these are
  missile technical persons, as well as civilian utility company personnel, power company personnel, to attempt to
  reinstate power to these missiles, to get them back on line, proved fruitless. Our sources state that nothing that was
  done based on their expertise had any effect whatsoever to get these missiles functioning once again and YET, without
  any outside intervention, and our sources are adamant about this, without any outside intervention, power suddenly
  reinstated itself to these missile systems.
</p>
<p>Now my opinion is that these individuals are truthful and sincere. Indeed one document has become available
  corroborating one of these power losses at [Mynot] Air Force base in August 1966 and I believe in time additional
  documents and sources will become available to corroborate these individuals assertions.
</p>
<p>For those of you who may have seen approximately 2 months ago the ABC prime time program on Thursday evenings hosted
  by Sam Donaldson umm.. there was a segment in which former Soviet KGB, that is state security police, and former
  Soviet military personnel, allowed themselves to be interviewed by western journalists for the first time, discussing
  UFO sightings in the former Soviet Union. One of the individuals interviewed on this ABC news program indicated that
  the Soviets were having their problems with UFOs at their nuclear silos. This one former military person stated that
  at one point in the early 1980s the entire electronics involving launch sequence at one facility began to function on
  its own with no human intervention, began going through what would have been a launch sequence, and according to this
  man while the technicians were running around terrified that this could be a launching of an actual missile toward the
  United States, the system suddenly shut itself down.
</p>
<p>Now this is something I predicted 10 years ago. I was confident based on the testimony provided me and other
  researchers about these types of incidents at our nuclear missile installations. Im not psychic but Id seeme.. it
  seemed logical to me that if these things were indeed occurring here I was willing to bet that the Soviets were
  experiencing the same type of bizarre incidents. And apparently if these former Soviet military and KGB persons are to
  be believed, that indeed did take place.
</p>
<p>Now my opinion is that perhaps one of the reasons our government has chosen to keep its rather extensive knowledge of
  the UFO phenomenon from public view year after year is perhaps its uncertainty or apprehension as to what public
  response, what reaction would be, if this type of information were widely and openly disseminated. Thats simply a
  personal opinion.
</p>
<p>-------- In my slide show I mentioned that in July of 1952 literally dozens of UFOs overflew this nation's capital on
  two successive weekends. These objects were tracked on military and civilian radar in the greater Washington D.C.
  area. Tracking data indicated they were in essence at times hovering at other times they performed speeds, performed
  maneuvers at speeds in the neighborhood of 7,000 miles per hour. These incidents were highly publicized. Uhh..
  newspapers such as the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times carried detailed stories about
  them. Shortly thereafter these same newspapers and in this case the Associated press published articles suggesting
  that as a result of these overflights of the nation's capitol by these unknown aerial objects the Pentagon had
  implemented a shoot order to intercept the pilots to in effect fire upon UFOs should the opportunity present itself.
  [?]
</p>
<p>Now I have heard and other researchers have heard hundreds and hundreds of rumors. Stories largely unsubstantiated,
  stories about alleged aerial intercept attempts of UFOs by military interceptors. There is to my knowledge however
  only one document currently in the public domain that describes one of these intercept attempts in any kind of detail,
  it is intriguing to say the least, and I would like to share it with you now.
</p>
<p>Next slide please.</p>
<p>This is the top half of the first page of a 3 page teletype message called a [Twix?] This that we are about to read
  was sent from the U.S. embassy in Tehran, Iran in September of 1976. Copies of this teletype were directed to, this is
  the actual routing of the message, beginning at the top the..
</p>
<p>:: JCS : (Joint Cheifs of Staff who are the heads of the military services received a copy. Reading one line at a
  time..) : Sec State : (That is to say Secretary of State Henry Kissinger received a copy) : CIA, National Security
  Council, White House, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Chief of Naval Operations, : (Navy operations) : Chief of Staff
  of the Army : (further along) : Sec Def : (which is to say, Secretary of Defense Harold Brown received a copy) ::
</p>
<p>In short, the creme of the creme of the intelligence community and national security apparatus in this nation
  received a copies of what we are about to read. Now, before we actually look at this I have to give you a little
  background. In September of 1976 when this memorandum or teletype message was sent from our embassy in Iran to
  Washington, the Shaw was still in power, this is prior to the embassy hostage crisis, and the Ayatollah Khomeni's
  regime. At that time our government had what were called MAGs.. military assistance and advisory groups in Iran
  training the Shaw's military forces. This incident involved two American trained Iranian Air Force pilots flying two
  American built F-4 Phantom aircraft and describes what occurred when they attempted to intercept an unidentified
  flying object north of the nation's capitol of Tehran. Now, the actual transmission of this teletype begins at the
  bottom of the first page, there were only two lines on that first page so I did not devote a slide to it. It indicates
  that persons at a place called [Cheroke?] Air Force Base had received calls from citizens in the [Chemaron?] district
  of Tehran reporting that they had seen strange objects in the sky. Some reported a kind of bird like object while
  others reported a helicopter with a light on. There were no helicopters airborne at that time. The black gap in the
  next paragraph was a reference to one of these Iranians at [Cheroke] Air Force base. This individuals name was
  censored by the U.S. state department when this document was released through the freedom of information act. In any
  event this individual told the citizen it was only stars and had talked to the [Miribad] air traffic control tower. He
  decided to look for himself. He noticed an object in the sky similar to a star but bigger and brighter. He decided to
  scramble, that is launch an F-4 from [Cheroke] Air Force base to investigate.
</p>
<p>:: B) At 01:30 (hours) on the 19th the F-4 took off and preceded to a point about 40 nautical miles north of Tehran.
  Due to it's brilliance the object was clearly visible from 70 miles away. As the F-4 approached a range of 25 nautical
  miles he lost all instrumentation and communications. He broke off the intercept and headed back to [Cheroke]. When
  the F-4 turned away from the object and apparently was no longer a threat to it the aircraft regained all
  instrumentation and communications. :: :: At 01:40 (hours) a second F-4 was launched. ::
</p>
<p>There are then some lines devoted to navigational jargon.</p>
<p>Next slide please.</p>
<p>Picking up a paragraph C which is two lines below the top white dot.</p>
<p>:: C) The size of the radar return was comparable to that of a 707 tanker. : (thats the military version of a Boeing
  707 jetliner.. quite large) : the visual size of the object was difficult to discern because of its intense
  brilliance. The light that it gave off was that of flashing strobe lights arranged in a rectangular pattern and
  alternating blue, green, red, and orange in color. The sequence of the lights was so fast that all the colors could be
  seen at once. ::
</p>
<p>And now the action intensifies significantly...</p>
<p>:: The object and pursuing F-4 continued on a course to the south of Tehran when another object brightly lighted
  object estimated to be one half to one third the apparent size of the moon came out of the original object. This
  second object headed straight toward the F-4 at a very fast rate of speed. The pilot attempted to fire an A9 (that is,
  air to air missile) at the object but at that instant his weapons control panel went off and he lost all
  communications. At this point the pilot initiated a turn and negative G (or gravity dive) to get away. As he turned
  the object fell in trail at what appeared to be about 3-4 nautical miles. As he continued in his turn away from the
  primary object the second object went to the inside of his turn and then returned to the primary object for a perfect
  rejoin. ::
</p>
<p>:: D) Shortly after the second object joined up with the primary object another object appeared to come out of :
  (next slide please) : the other side of the primary object going straight down at a great rate of speed. The F-4 crew
  had regained communications and the weapons control panel and watched the object approach the ground anticipating a
  large explosion. This object appeared to come to rest gently on the Earth and cast a very bright light over an area of
  2-3 kilometers. ::
</p>
<p>There are then some lines devoted to the pilot returning to [Cheroke] Air force base. Upon debriefing it was
  determined that this pilot and indeed the pilot who had returned to base earlier had to land their aircraft by
  instruments because their night vision was severely impaired by the brilliance of the UFO. But the aerial encounter
  wasnt over yet. Picking up 3 lines above the lower white dot.
</p>
<p>:: While the F-4 was on a long final approach the crew noticed another cylinder shaped object about the size of a
  T-Bird at 10 meters : (A TBird is a small military jet training aircraft) : with bright steady lights on each end and
  a flasher in the middle. ::
</p>
<p>Again, upon debriefing it was determined that this reference to a T-Bird at 10 meters was based on the pilot and the
  backseater, as hes called, radarman on this aircraft, stating to their debriefers that as they were approaching the
  base for a final touchdown this object, cylinder shaped object, in effect buzzed their aircraft narrowly missing it at
  an estimated distance of 10 meters or some 30 feet.
</p>
<p>Next slide please.</p>
<p>And finally this teletype concludes with paragraph E which is about 5 lines below the top white dot.</p>
<p>:: E) During daylight, the F-4 crew was taken out to the area in a helicopter where the object apparently had landed.
  Nothing was noticed at the spot where they thought the object landed : (a dry lakebed) : but as they circled off to
  the west of the area they picked up a very noticeable beeper signal. At the point where the return was loudest was a
  small house with a garden. They landed and asked the people within if they had noticed anything strange last night the
  people talked about a loud noise and a very bright light like lightning. The aircraft and area where the object is
  believed to have landed are being checked for possible radiation. ::
</p>
<p>And then finally, this last gap in the final paragraph is a reference to the defense attache' at the U.S. embassy
  indicating he will forward more information to Washington as it becomes available. Again, the U.S. State department
  censored this individual's identity at the time this was released.
</p>
<p>Now, it has been determined that the defense intelligence agencies, the military CIA, did conduct a exhaustive
  analysis of this case. They have admitted that they did issue a report relating to their investigation. They maintain
  however in response to freedom of information requests by researchers that information in this report is exempt from
  provisions of the freedom of information act and to my knowledge have these many years thus far refused to release
  this particular report to the public. And so we as researchers and you the public cannot know much more about this
  case then what I have presented here.
</p>
<p>Interestingly, the FOX program Sightings which does UFO segments actually had taped for the first time to my
  knowledge a number of the military personnel at [Cheroke] Air Force Base including some pilots who were involved in
  this incident. Theyve all fled Iran and the Ayatollah regime. They now live in Western Europe or the United States.
  And the individuals corroborated in this program precisely the events that were presented here. And one of the
  individuals were asked by the interviewer 'Could this have been a spy plane?' and his response was "Perhaps a spy
  plane from outer space."
</p>
<p>------- One last document.</p>
<p>I noted earlier that the reproduction quality of some of the documents in the public domain was rather poor. This one
  wins a prize in that regard I think. But what it has to say is rather interesting.
</p>
<p>This FBI memo was sent to the then director J. Edgar Hoover on March 22, 1950. It was written by one Guy [Ontel?] who
  was the special agent in charge of the Washington FBI office. The subject of this memo is quote: :: Flying Saucers
  Information Concerning ::
</p>
<p>The first sentence and other parts of the memo have been censored by the FBI when this was released in 1976 through
  the freedom of information act.
</p>
<p>As much of it as we can read, as is, is as follows:</p>
<p>:: The following information was furnished especially for : (whoever) : by : (whoever) : An investigator for the Air
  Force stated that that three so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico. They were described as being
  circular in shape with raised centers. Approximately 50 feet in diameter. Each one was occupied by 3 bodies of human
  shape but only 3 feet tall. Dressed in metallic cloth of a very fine texture. Each body was bandaged in a manner
  similar to the blackout suits used by speed flyers and test pilots. According to Mr. : (whoevers) : informant the
  saucers were found in New Mexico due to the fact that the government has a very high power radar setup in that area
  and it is believed that the radar interferes with the control mechanism of the saucers. No further evaluation was
  attempted by special agent : (whoever) : concerning the above. ::
</p>
<p>Now, at first glance this is very intriguing stuff. Some have called this the smoking gun document, the document that
  proves that the government has in its possession craft and bodies confirming the extra-terrestrial nature of the UFOs.
  In my opinion, however, it falls far short of that. In the first instance the name of the original source of the
  information and the FBI special agent to whom the information was given; those individual's identities remain unknown.
  Assuming optimistically that they are still alive 44 years after the writing of this document, researchers cannot
  approach them to attempt to illicit additional information that would either tend to confirm or refute the statements
  made in this memorandum. Beyond that very fundamental problem the document is very vaguely worded. It does not for
  example identify the specific location of this radar installation in New Mexico, it does not indicate clearly whether
  these alleged crashes occurred simultaneously or over some period of time, it does identify what component or
  components of the military or the government were involved in the recovery of these alleged craft, crashed craft, and
  it gives no hint whatsoever as to what became of these craft and bodies if indeed they were recovered.
</p>
<p>So, if one is to be conservative all one can say is that in March of 1950, J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI, was
  privately informed that the government had secretly recovered crashed flying saucers and if you read this I think the
  inference is that we are dealing with craft piloted by beings whos origin is not of this planet. Let me assure you
  this is absolutely authentic, any one of you could write to the FBI tomorrow, direct your letter to the freedom of
  information officer at the bureau, mention the date of this memorandum, you can get a copy directly from Washington if
  you wish.
</p>
<p>This may or may not relate to the so-called Roswell incident which occurred some 3 years earlier. Now Ive covered
  that briefly in my slide show, this particular episode has gotten quite a bit of national attention in recent years
  through programs such as Unsolved Mysteries. I would only add at this juncture that two researchers; one named Kevin
  Randall, the other Don Schmidt have interviewed and gotten on record over 200 former and retired military personnel
  including two retired Air Force generals making statements finally for the first time as to what really occurred in
  southeastern New Mexico in July of 1947. I mentioned General Thomas [DuBoughes ?] who stated he knew for a fact that
  the weather balloon story was a cover story designed to get media attention and public attention away from the
  recovery operation back in New Mexico. The second person worth mentioning I believe is retired Air Force brigadier
  general Arthur Exxon. In 1990 researcher Kevin Randall got general Exxon to state in a recorded interview that he,
  Exxon, was at Wright Field, later Wright Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton Ohio, when according to later General
  Exxon stated literally planeloads of debris from this object arrived at the base for analysis. There are at that base
  even to this day components of aeronautical engineering teams which are engaged in various technology assessments of
  foreign aircraft. According to general Exxon in the months that he was at Wright field before being transferred
  elsewhere he was told by persons involved in these attempts to analyze this recovered debris, that no headway could be
  made, they could not determine its origin or of method of manufacture; that it was extraordinary to say the least and
  uny, uhh.. unlike anything that either we or the then Soviet Union was known to have.
</p>
<p>At one point during this taped interview with Kevin Randall, general Exxon refers to the object recovered at Roswell
  as quote: :: A craft from space :: endquote.
</p>
<p>For those of you who may have seen the Larry King UFO special that aired this past October 1st, you may have seen a
  brief taped segment with former U.S. senator Barry Goldwater. Goldwater, for those of you too young to remember was
  the republican presidential candidate in 1964 running against Lyndon Johnson. He was in the senate for many many
  years, had very many high level positions involved with the senate, oversight operations of the intelligence
  community, this individual was also the [?] general in the Air Force reserves for decades.
</p>
<p>Goldwater for years has stated that he had heard from persons within our government whom he considered reliable that
  at Wright Patterson Air Force base there was a facility commonly known as Hanger 18, Senator Goldwater refers to it as
  The Blue Room, in which Goldwater sources told him was physical evidence confirming the existence of alien spacecraft.
  General, or excuse me, Senator Goldwater in this taped segment with Larry King uh.. acknowledged on tape for the first
  time that indeed he had asked every chief of staff of the Air Force for 20 some years to gain access to the Blue Room
  in that he was U.S. senator, he was a general in the Air Force reserve.. Goldwater states in this taped interview that
  every chief of staff he asked rebuffed him and he quotes a man named general Curtis [Lamey ? (sounds like La Mey) ] in
  the early 60s as saying "Hell no, you cant go, I cant go, and dont ask me again."
</p>
<p>When the interview concludes the interviewer asks Goldwater 'Do you think our government knows that UFOs are real and
  are keeping this fact from the American public?' His response was: "Yes."
</p>
<p> [Local: Ping, 'stop it', ping, 'stop it'] Now what I emphasize to my audience is even though finally we have on the
  public record persons of the stature of Goldwater, the two generals I mentioned, and literally dozens of other former
  high ranking military people testifying as to what actually occurred at Roswell, it sure wasnt a weather balloon, it
  wasnt a spy balloon as is the Pentagons latest version of the events, but something quite extraordinary. This is all
  still circumstantial evidence, this is not physical proof that the object recovered at Roswell was indeed a craft from
  space as Exxon has stated.
</p>
<p>But at the very least I think one has to ask onesself why persons of these stature ..uh.. would now come forward and
  make what seem to be, on their face, rather bizarre claims. My opinion based on what I know about the Roswell case is
  that indeed it will be found in time, at some point in the future, that our government has had in its possession
  absolute proof, physical evidence, that indeed UFOs are craft from another world. [Local whisper: Steven Speilburg
  might do the movie. (laugh) No, Im serious.]
</p>
<p>For those of you who would like to acquire up to 600 pages of these now unclassified documents on UFOs..</p>
<p>[I talk overtop of him: Fund for UFO Research P.O. Box 277 Mt. Reiner, Maryland 20712 ]</p>
<p>... The fund for UFO research is a registered non-profit research organization in the state of Maryland. This group
  currently sells sets of documents, 3 sets.. 200 pages each, the funds generated by the sales of the documents go to
  fund various research projects into the UFO phenomenon. If you wish to acquire these documents simply write to the
  fund and ask for their list of publications.
</p>
<p>Now I am not affiliated with the fund, Ive not made a nickel off the sales of these documents, but Ive publicized
  this because in my estimate this is the most direct, efficient, way for the average person to acquire these now
  declassified documents.
</p>
<p>And now a very brief conclusion.</p>
<p>---------- At this point in time...</p>
<p>[I repeated the address at this point overtop of Mr. Hastings statements..]</p>
<p>... wealth of evidence proving the existence of an official, high level, ongoing, policy of secrecy on UFOs on the
  part of the U.S. military and intelligence community. Whether or not this deception of the public was and is
  justifiable, I believe, is open to debate. The fact that it has occurred now, however, is irrefutable. In my opinion
  it is simply a question of time, whether it be tomorrow or twenty years from now, before all of this will be
  officially acknowledged. Probably not only in this country, but all over the world. And in my estimate, the best thing
  that we all can do in the meantime is to set aside our prejudices, our preconceived notions, about UFOs, our tabloid
  mentality concept of what they are and are not, and begin to consult credible sources of information as to what the
  U.S. government has had to confront, in secrecy, for the past 4 decades.
</p>
<p>In short I think we are all in for a very rude awakening.</p>
<p>And finally Ill say this :</p>
<p>On the subject of UFOs noone has all the answers, I sure dont. But I guarantee what you have seen and heard here
  tonight is far closer to the truth than anything the U.S. government has told you about UFOs.
</p>
<p>Could we have the house lights up please..</p>
