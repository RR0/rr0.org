<p>In a <time>1952-06</time> reorganization, Ackerman became Deputy Director for Collection &amp; Dissemination of AF
  Intelligence, AFOIN-1. He had no direct connection with Project Blue Book but was very much interested, according to
  <span class="people">Edward J. Ruppelt</span>, and used to stop in and visit. According to Ruppelt, he had definite
  ideas as to what Blue Book had and what they should be doing. "He would tend to get all excited about individual
  sightings. He got copies of the UFO reports and several times he was on the phone wanting to know what we planned to
  do even before he had time to digest what was in the report." Ackerman had a "direct channel" to the top, to the
  Secretary of the Air Force and people in the Department of Defense. </p>
