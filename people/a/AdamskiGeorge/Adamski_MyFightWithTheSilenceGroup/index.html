<p class="exergue">Call us Silence Group if has to be. In silence we progress. Silence follows were we have gone. Our
  footsteps echo round planets when we march. <span class="source">Adonai Vasu</span></p>
<p>Throughout my public life in the promotion of the teachings of the Space Brothers, I have been visited by many
  agencies, including the <a href="/org/us/ic/fbi">FBI</a>, <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">Central Intelligence Agency</a>,
  Air Force Intelligence, the U.S. State Department and people from other government agencies. Now I am not saying that
  these particular people tried to silence me. There are many facets of the Silence Group, and many of these I am afraid
  that neither I nor the general public know about.
</p>
<p>What is and who is the Silence Group? There is likely an informal organization, that
  <span class="people" title="Donald E. Keyhoe">Keyhoe</span> spoke about, and a formal organization which is more top
  secret than any of our intelligence departments.
</p>
<p>During a recent trip to <span class="people">Washington, D.C.</span> last year I learned that the Silence Group which
  is opposing the truth about <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/FlyingSaucers.html">flying saucers</a> would like to see some
  kind of mystical religion spring up. Then they could say, <q>Didn't we tell you it was all mysticism, with the purpose
    of building up this religion, and there is no foundation of reality to it as we told you before?</q> In other words,
  they could then use this excuse to pigeon hole the entire subject of saucers. And I do know definitely that the men
  who came with the motive of hushing me were not space men. They were Earth men, born in this world and of this world.
</p>
<p>It is odd that this Silence Group does not bother anyone who is in the occult or psychic field. Such people can say
  what they want to say and have no one threatening or silencing them, as is done to them with concrete information.
</p>
<p>They have even tried to distort my experience by referring to my former group in which I served as instructor on
  philosophy. The name of this organization was The Royal Order of Tibet, just as he said. But the order did not adhere
  to the teachings of mysticism as he implied. The lessons I gave in lecture form and many of them were broadcast over
  radio stations in Long Beach and Beverly Hills. I believe that if it were important, copies of these broadcasts could
  be obtained from the stations. These lessons consisted of purely philosophical talks on the laws of life from a
  universal concept which every person should know. But ignorance leads to distortion.
</p>
<p>Judging from my mail, Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Orientals, all religions and people from all walks of life are
  interested in and are supporting the thesis of space visitations from the physical, mechanical point of view, while
  few of them would be interested if it were thrown into the mysterious.
</p>
<p>This is the factor the Silence Group knows to exist and fears. When the people of the world began thinking in accord
  on such a subject, the foundation of the money changers began to weaken. When people's eyes are turned upward,
  searching the skies for friendly space visitors, and their minds filled with longing for peace and happiness on Earth,
  it becomes difficult to fill their minds with hatred for their fellow men, wherein war finds a fertile field. And
  youthful minds filled with challenging thoughts of space travel are not easily diverted toward the rather questionable
  honor awaiting in bloody battlefields. Is this one of the things the financers see and fear?
</p>
<p>It is because they fear the event which might bring peace and understanding among men of Earth, whereas war has
  become a financial investment that pays well for certain investors. Reports of personal contacts are being discussed
  by innumerable people of many languages and throughout the world.
</p>
<p>This knowledge of interplanetary visitors who are friendly to Earth people, and who themselves have learned to live
  in peace with one another seems to have given new hopes to many who have lost hope, and a new purpose to life for
  untold numbers. It is this which those who control the purse strings of the world fear. Acceptance of the reality of
  interplanetary visitors would have far-reaching effects upon the present-day economic system of Earth. Everybody would
  be affected in a far greater degree. I believe they see this and are fighting it with everything they have, and at the
  same time endeavoring to remain conspiciously absent from the scene.

  <h2>Visited by three men</h2>
  <p>Shortly after the publication of <em>Flying Saucers Have Landed</em> I was visited by three men, two of which I had
    met previously, but the third was a stranger. It was he who took the role of authority and direly threatened me,
    demanding certain papers I had, for one thing. Some of these I have him, and was promised their return, but this
    promise was never kept. Since I did not exactly understand to what he had reference, I did not give him some of my
    important papers. There is no need denying that I was frightened. Before they left I was told to stop talking or
    they would come after me, lock me up and throw the key away.
  </p>
  <p>With these personal experiences to serve as a foundation, I wonder if Wall Street might be the central faction
    behind all the battling to keep the phenomenon of interplanetary visitation in the field of the occult, and
    combatting those of us who know and announce that the space people are physical beings, travelling in mechanical
    space craft. They would like nothing better than to have this whole thing thrown into the field of the psychic,
    called a cult, and discredited in the minds of sincere people throughout the world.
  </p>
  <p>I still say, and I hope I am wrong, but indications seem to show that <span class="people">James Moseley</span> and
    some others are tools in the hands of the group. For it takes money to do what they are doing. <em>Flying Saucers
      Have Landed</em> sold well, but I have received comparatively little from it. I cannot travel on my own and do the
    things they do, without sponsorship. So, in the case of <span class="people">Moseley</span> and some others who is
    paying? Of course some may be working themselves right into the hands of this Group, without knowing it, but surely
    some are fully aware of the whole picture, but know where their meal are coming from
    <span class="note">N.D.T.: <span class="James people">Moseley</span> verra dans ce texte un relan d'<a href="/croyance/conspirationnisme/enquete/dossier/juifs">antisemitisme</a>, voir <span class="people">Moseley, James</span> & <span class="people">Pflock, Karl</span>: <em>Shockingly Close to the Truth!</em> <em>Confessions of a
Grave-Robbing Ufologist</em>, Prometheus, 2002, p. 69.</span>.
  </p>
  <p>Of course it could also be true — for I am sure that we on Earth here are not the poorest in the Universe— that
    there could be some influence of this sort coming from space. But so far as I am concerned —and I receive mail from
    all parts of the world — no evidence is showing up that could be interpreted to the effect that space men are trying
    to hush up people on this Earth.
  </p>
  <p>If any hostile situation appears, as in some places it has, it seems to be a case of fear on the part of the
    Earthlings. For once in a state of fear, people can see almost anything, or can conceive almost anything. So I have
    not the slightest evidence that such has taken place, although there seems to be plenty of evidence that the powers
    of this world have their hands in it.
  </p>
  <p>I was quite surprised to find the drawing showing faces peering from the portholes of the flying saucer I
    photographed at Palomar Gardens which appeared in <em>The Saucerian</em>.
  </p>
  <p>I have heard the story that faces can be seen, upon examining the portholes in the photograph very carefully, since
    my book was first published. But try as I might, I have always failed to find those faces. However, I did get a
    passing glimpse of my friends face as he dropped the message through the porthole to me. It is amazing how many
    faces can be seen there, according to reports, but upon later inquiry I was told by the space people that there was
    only the normal crew that craft present, two people in it, the time they came over <span class="place">Palomar Gardens</span>
    on <time>1953-12-13</time>. Isn't it amazing what imagination can do for a person?

  <h2>Karl Hunrath</h2>
  <p>I now wish to discuss <span class="people">Karl Hunrath</span> and Jerrold Baker, who were used as witnesses
    against the authenticity of my story and photographs in <span class="people">Moseley</span>'s <time>1955-01</time>,
    issue of <em>Nexus</em> <span class="source">Moseley, J.: "<a href="/time/1/9/5/5/01/Nexus07">Some New Facts About "Flying Saucers Have Landed</a>", Nexus n° 7</span>.
  </p>
  <p>You will recall that <span class="people">Hunrath</span>, along with a man named Wilkenson, mysteriously
    disappeared in <time>1953</time>, after claming to be in contact with space people who were going to take them to
    another planet in a space ship.
  </p>
  <p>I believe, incidentally, that Jerrold Baker knows where <span class="people">Hunrath</span> is — and that does not
    include another planet. According to the rumors that have persisted since his disappearance, <span class="people">Hunrath</span>
    might be in <span class="place">Mexico</span>, not far from the border. My reason for thinking Baker knows of his
    whereabouts is that about 2 years ago Baker and another man came up to see me one evening at Palomar Gardens. During
    the conversation which ensued Baker, showed me an ad cut from a newspper which stated that anyone wishing to contact
    <span class="people">Hunrath</span> should write to a certain post office number. I neglected to obtain the name and
    date of the paper, however, for at the time I wasn't interested.
  </p>
  <p>My knowledge of <span class="people">Hunrath</span> goes back several years. When <em>Fate</em> magazine carried an
    article about my efforts to photograph space craft, along with some of my earlier photographs, I received mail from
    all over the nation, while people in all walks of life and from many places stopped in to visit me as part of their
    visit to the big observatory on top of Mt. Palomar. One of these visitors was from Wisconsin. He was a scientist and
    upon his return home, dicussed the conversation he had with me with 2 of his associates, 1 of whom was
    <span class="people">Karl Hunrath</span>.
  </p>
  <p>Later <span class="people">Hunrath</span> wrote to me personally, and we carried on quite an extensive
    correspondence. He seemed to have a fine scientific mind, and I enjoyed our correspondence. Later his letters
    developed that he seemed to be having troubles of one kind or another, losing one job after another, as he said,
    without a reason being given to him. Then I received a letter stating that he was on his way out to see me, and late
    in <time>1952-12</time>, he arrived at Palomar Gardens, bag and baggage, with intentions to stay indefinitely, but
    no money to pay for his expenses.
  </p>
  <p>Jerrold Baker had also arrived under similar circumstances, late one night in <time>1952-12</time>. He was still
    there behaving as one of the family, helping himself to everything, freely and in abundance, but without money to
    pay for anything.

    <h3>Hunrath's strange machine</h3>
    <p>A day or two after <span class="people">Hunrath</span> had arrived he revealed to me that he had constructed a
      magnetic machine which he said would produce all the electricity we could use at Palomar Gardens (at that time we
      did not have outside electrical service, depended upon our own small power plant). He said he had left this
      machine in storage back in his home town, but would have it shipped to California. He would bury the machine in
      the side of the mountain where it could not be found easily. My curiosity and suspicions were instantly alerted,
      but not quickly satisfied. It took much careful questioning on my part to learn what I was seeking.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, during a casual conversation on the subject, <span class="people">Hunrath</span> volunteered that <em>his
      machine would not only attract the saucers, but would bring them down!</em></p>
    <p>Immediately it dawned on me that if it could bring down the saucers, it might be able to do the same to our
      planes, and many of them fly over Palomar daily. Asked about this point, <span class="people">Hunrath</span>
      admitted that it might also bring down planes, and this is where I balked, telling him that in such a case we
      would be responsible for the lives lost.
    </p>
    <p>To this he replied, <q>Who cares? We want the saucers!</q></p>
    <p>I then forbade his bringing the machine to Palomar Gardens. That, of course, started the trouble which Baker is
      now carrying on. Up until then everything was fine, but when I told <span class="people">Hunrath</span> that he
      would have to move without further delay, Baker went with him. Yet within the hour before their leaving,
      <span class="people">Hunrath</span> ordered me off my own property, adjoining Palomar Gardens, and for a few
      moments I thought he might attempt force to accomplish his order. Then he seemed to gain control of himself and
      left without further trouble.
    </p>
    <p>I consider <span class="people">Hunrath</span>'s conduct unethical and his proposal unpatriotic, so I informed
      the <a href="/org/us/ic/fbi">FBI</a>. These Government representatives agreed with my opinions, thanked me for
      calling them in. They took precautions that no physical retaliations would come to any of us at Palomar Gardens.
      Unfortunately they had no control over other avenues Baker would use in his attempt to damage me.
    </p>
    <p>Rumor has it that when Wilkinson came from Wisconsin to California he brought <span class="people">Hunrath</span>'s
      machine with him. I have never tried to verify this, but it was shortly after their arrival in California that
      <span class="people">Hunrath</span> and Wilkinson disappeared. If they are indeed across the border, they could
      have the machine there with them. I have been promised more information on this matter, but so far it has not been
      forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>If <span class="people">Moseley</span> and others like him continue to use Baker in their attacks against me, let
      the barrage come. I am not afraid!
    </p>
    <p>Meanwhile I shall still raise my small and perhaps inconsequential voice in an attempt to acquaint the people of
      the world with the true mission of the space peoples.
