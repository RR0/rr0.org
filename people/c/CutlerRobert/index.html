<p>araNet Alpha 0825 -- The Majestic-12 documents recently released by a team of researchers led by William L. Moore,
  have come under considerable fire from UFO skeptic Philip Klass of CSICOP.</p>
<p>In a dramatic press release issued August 20, CSICOP chairman Paul Kurtz stated that "The evidence clearly shows that
  these are hoax documents."</p>
<p>The documents, in the form of a purported briefing given to President-Elect Dwight Eisenhower prior to his taking
  office in <time>1952</time>, tell of a special panel set up to advise the President on matters of crashed saucers and
  recovered alien corpses. Moore and his associates claim to have received the documents from an anonymous source in
  <time>1984</time>, and to have discovered an independent corroborative document in the National Archives, a memo from
  Ike's special assistant Robert Cutler to Gen. Nathan Twining. The document makes reference to the "NSC/MJ-12 Special
  Studies Project."</p>
<p>"For the first time," according to Moore, "we had an official document available through a public source that talked
  about MJ-12."</p>
<p>Klass, relying heavily on a letter from the National Archives regarding this memo, proceeds to sow considerable doubt
  as to its authenticity. "Cutler could not possibly have written this July 14 [1952] memo," says Klass, "because Cutler
  had departed Washington 11 days earlier on an extended trip to visit military facilities in Europe and North Africa
  and did not return to Washington until July 15."</p>
<p>Other inconsistencies in the document, pointed out by Archivist Jo Ann Williamson, include the lack of a proper
  register number as assigned by the Archives, the lack of a watermark in use at the time, and the use of a security
  classification that did not exist until the Nixon Administration. Moore and his associate, TV producer Jaime Shandera,
  had claimed that they were the first to have access to the group of documents containing the controversial Cutler memo
  after they were declassified in 1985. "It may be no more than coincidence," says Klass, "that this Cutler/Twining memo
  was first discovered at the National Archives by Moore and Shandera." In a previous interview with Klass, he noted
  that it would be a "simple task" to sneak a document into a folder at the archives. While in Washington attending the
  MUFON conference, this reporter made a cursory search at the National Archives Maryland Facility, and was given access
  to newly declassified materials of the same record group as the purported Cutler memo (RG 341) without being searched
  beforehand.</p>
<p>Another document included with the package received by Moore was a letter marked TOP SECRET from Pres. Truman to
  James Forrestal, authorizing the MJ-12 group to "proceed with all due speed and caution..." and makes reference to
  "Operation Majestic Twelve." But Klass claims this, too, is a forgery, "created by superimposing a spurious message on
  a photocopy of an authentic Truman letter."</p>
<p>"Fabrication of counterfeit US Government documents is illegal," the press release continues, "and [Klass] believes
  that those who concocted the MJ-12 documents to dupe the public and fool the news media should be brought to
  justice."</p>

<p>As Robert Sheaffer reported here earlier, one of the MJ-12 documents has finally been shown - CONCLUSIVELY - to have
  been hoaxed. Included with the package of documents received in photographic form by Jaime Shandera was a letter from
  Harry Truman to James Forrestal giving his formal approval to the MJ-12 project.</p>
<p>I have to hand it to Phil on this one...the evidence is plain. The Forrestal letter is a hoax.</p>
