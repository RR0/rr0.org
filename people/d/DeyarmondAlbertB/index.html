<p>Albert Deyarmond was an "old hand" with the UFO's, in on the first of Project Sign. From the old memos signed by him
    it could be determined that he was once a firm believer, along with Alfred Loedding, John "Red" Honaker and the rest
    of the veterans or Project Sign. But by the time Ruppelt got into the picture Deyarmond, at least on the surface,
    was lined up with the scoffers. Ruppelt had said that, "once, when I began to knock the UFO's, he raised the devil
    and chewed me out for not keeping an 'open mind'." Ruppelt had called him a "scoffer" because he was a "disciple" of
    Col. Watson's. Deyarmond later became chief of structures at Ryan Aircraft Company.
