<p>General Exon is a pilot with 135 combat missions and over 300 hours of combat flight time during World War II. His
  aircraft was severely damaged by an exploding ammunition dump and he was forced to bail out over enemy territory.
  Captured, he spent just over a year in German prisoner of war camps. He was liberated in April, 1945. After the war he
  completed an industrial administration course at the Air Force Institute of Technology and was then assigned to the
  Air Materiel Command (AMC) Headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. (It should be noted that General Nathan F.
  Twining was the commander of the Air Materiel Command which controlled various intelligence functions. Twining's
  letter of September 23, 1947 has been quoted by many. It was Twining's conclusion then that flying discs were real.)
  Over the next several years he held a variety of positions finally arriving at the Pentagon as a full colonel in 1955.
  In 1960 he became Chief of Ballistic Missiles and was responsible for establishing the Jupiter Ballistic Missile
  system for NATO in Italy and Turkey. In July, 1963, he left Europe for an assignment at Olmsted Air Force Base in
  Pennsylvania. In August, 1964, he was assigned as commander, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. On August 20, 1965, he
  was promoted to brigadier general. General Exon has had a most impressive military career. Officers are not promoted
  to flag rank (general officer) without having proven themselves as competent. Those who make it while on active duty,
  who are not rewarded with the promotion on retirement, are in a small minority. Only the top officers achieve the
  privilege of wearing stars. General Exon, as a lieutenant colonel, was assigned to Wright Field in July of 1947. He
  was there when the wreckage from the Roswell crash came in and was aware of the recovery in New Mexico. He knew that
  it was brought in and knew where it was sent. A few of his colleagues performed the tests on the metal, trying to
  determine what it was. And he learned from other colleagues that the bodies had arrived on the base. All in July,
  1947. </p>
