<p>Le lieutenant-colonel Goll est spécialiste du renseignement à l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc">AMC</a> sous le colonel
  Mack McCoy durant la 2nde guerre mondiale. After the war he remained in the service briefly, but then retired, staying
  on to work as a civilian in the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/T2.html">T-2</a> intelligence group. Goll could be considered
  the third ranking officer (under McCoy [MCI] and <span class="people">William Clingerman</span> [MCIA]) during the <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/sign">Sign</a> era, acting as chief of the Analysis Section [MCIAT] and often
  signing for Clingerman. Goll entered UFO legend as he was a contact officer for the famous Battelle Memorial study
  during the <span class="people">Edward J. Ruppelt</span> years, and was the recipient of the famous [infamous?]
  memorandum to Battelle, called by some as the "Pentacle_Memorandum", and interpreted very controversially as
  indicating something deeply conspiratorial going on at Wright-Patterson AFB as regards UFO information.</p>
