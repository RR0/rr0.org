<p>Frederick Hooven was a senior automotive engineer at Ford Motor Company during the time of the Colorado project. He
  and his colleague, David Moyer, volunteered to consult with the project on matters related to UFO effects on
  automobile engines. They worked on one case which was reported in the final report, one case which essentially was
  not, and were not employed to do other work on cases even though Hooven volunteered to do so. Hooven continued to be
  interested in the phenomenon after the Project's end and believed that it deserved good study. <span class="people">Roy F. Craig</span>'s
  own handling of a vehicle interference case from California is an embarrassment to science when the file is read,
  rather than only Craig's summary in the text. And yet, Colorado had a fully qualified expert willing to do analyses
  for them, who was ignored. (Swords)</p>
