                        <div class="articletext"><p style="text-align: left;"><i>  Long ago, in days of yore, I was part
                          of a team which called itself the Independent UFO Network. As well as producing the best UFO
                          magazine in the business (</i><i>UFO Brigantia), the IUN staged a series of successful
                          conferences in Sheffield that showcased some of the biggest names in world UFOlogy, including
                          Bill Moore, Stan Friedman, Budd Hopkins and Jenny Randles. But for the conference we organised
                          in August 1992 we had the biggest name of all: American journalist and author John A. Keel. As
                          far as I know this was his one and only UK appearance. Ever since I was a child I had been a
                          fan of his writings, particularly his account of investigating the bizarre "Mothman" and
                          sinister Men In Black flap in West Virginia during 1966-67. Although Keel's presentation at
                          the IUN conference was centred upon that modern UFO cause célèbre, Roswell, rather than the
                          anticipated Mothman, it gave us the opportunity to interview the man we felt had been one of
                          the key influences of a UFOlogical generation. The transcript of the interview that follows
                          was originally published in </i><i>UFO Brigantia, issue 53/54, 1992.</i></p>
                          <p style="text-align: right;"><i>––David Clarke<br></i></p>
                          <p><i><br></i></p>
                          <p><i>Ever since I was about 11 years old and read Keel’s first book, </i>Jadoo<i>, I was
                            obsessed by him. I later found out that others felt like that too. He's one of the few
                            people to have revolutionized how we think about ufology and strange phenomena generally,
                            and I’d long wanted him to speak at a UK UFO conference. Although debilitated by jetlag, the
                            effects of diabetes and the unwanted attentions of the Men in Black from BUFORA, Keel still
                            managed to give a stirring speech to the troops which left many people leaving the hall
                            shaking their heads and muttering, "That's wiped the floor with Bill Moore's explanation for
                            Roswell." This was the first time he had ever publicly spoken in the UK. I spoke to Keel at
                            length over the three days he spent in Sheffield and learned many things, some of which I
                            agreed with, some of which I didn't. But what struck me overall was Keel’s grasp of ufology,
                            his perspective and his sense of humour. When the conference was over I managed to get a
                            ‘formal’ interview with John - here it is.  </i></p>

                          <p><br></p>
                          <p><i><b>Andy Roberts:</b> John, could you tell me how you first became interested in Fortean
                            subjects, and UFOs in particular?</i></p>
                          <p><b>John Keel:</b> It was so long ago. You know, I read Charles Fort when I was very young,
                            when I was about 14 or 15 years old. I was reading <i>Amazing Stories</i> in those days too,
                            and they were getting letters to <i>Amazing Stories</i> about thing people had seen in the
                            sky – this is before 1947 – and I was writing a newspaper column at that time for my home
                            town newspaper and I did a couple of columns on that kind of thing, lights in the sky and
                            people who saw contrails high over head and thought that that was some kind of spaceship or
                            something. In those days, in the Forties, contrails were very rare; an airplane usually has
                            to be high altitude to leave a contrail. Anyway, I was around when the whole UFO thing broke
                            and I remember I was standing in a carnival in my home town and I was in the middle of the
                            midway and a friend of mine came up and said, "Hey Keel, have you seen this newspaper story
                            about this guy out West who saw some strange things over the mountains?" and it was like a
                            shock to me, I thought, "Oh my God, it's starting." I remember thinking that, that it's
                            starting now, and of course that was the beginning, that was the Arnold story but I hadn't
                            yet seen it in the papers. The Kenneth Arnold report did not get much play in the papers in
                            the North-East; it was mostly in the West. It took a while for it to reach the East in the
                            magazines and so on.  </p>
                          <p><i><b>AR:</b> Do you think the Arnold sighting and the subsequent UFO hysteria was a bit of
                            a reaction to WWII? The world had been used to Earth-threatening excitement for several
                            years and then peace broke out. Do you think we were waiting for 'something' perhaps and
                            that the Arnold sighting triggered that 'something'?  </i></p>
                          <p><b>JK:</b> Yeah, but it was also what we called the silly season. In the newspaper business
                            in those days the summer months were very slow news-wise. So they would seize on something
                            like that. One year it would be Loch Ness Monster sightings, the next year it would be UFOs.
                            We don't really have a silly season any more, we have a silly season the year round now.

                          <p><i><b>AR:</b> What did you believe UFOs were at that time?</i></p>
                          <p><b>  JK:</b> I assumed, after reading Fort, that they must be spaceships. Fort didn't
                            really come right out and advocate the ET thesis but he said there was something there and
                            that it had been around for a long time because he'd traced reports all the way back and
                            Fort was very persuasive if you could get through his style. He had an odd style of writing,
                            a humorous style which a lot of people to this day don't quite comprehend.  </p>
                          <p><i><b>AR:</b> Do you think you've copied your style in any way from Fort's? You have also
                            got a very distinctive writing style which I think 'tricks' people intentionally into
                            believing...</i></p>
                          <p><b>JK:</b> I sort of sometimes satirise Fort. Fort used to use certain phrases like, “I
                            have a theory, that the stars are hanging from strings and the sky is only 800 feet up,” and
                            that would be a joke and people would seriously quote that and say, "Well Charles Fort
                            thinks the stars are hanging on strings." But I think my own style sort of evolved over the
                            years. I was writing a humorous column as a kid. The way I got into the writing business was
                            I wrote a letter to the editor of my hometown newspaper – I was about 12 years old – he
                            thought it was a very funny letter and he called me into his office and he asked me to write
                            a column and we called it 'Scraping the Keel': it was a column of alleged humour and I would
                            make little kind of childish jokes and it was quite popular, so in my little hometown of
                            about 5000 people, in a very short time I was the most famous person in town. Then I started
                            the high school newspaper there and I called it <i>The Jester </i>because I was making fun
                            of the school, let's face it. Then when I turned sixteen I got so bored with school because
                            in this town’s school there were no courses left for me to take. I took all the science
                            courses in one year, courses that were considered the toughest courses, chemistry and
                            physics and so on. I passed them like that, and the only courses left were an agricultural
                            course, but I wasn't about to become a farmer, and a business course, but I wasn't really
                            interested in business, and so I left school when I was sixteen and I started writing full
                            time, or as much as I could, I was working on the farm too. I started sending stories to the
                            magazines in New York City and sooner or later people started sending me cheques! My first
                            cheque was for two dollars. And I was really thrilled by that and by the time I was
                            seventeen I had sold quite a few short pieces for a very small amount of money and I decided
                            that I was going to go to New York and make my fortune. So I left my family - they didn't
                            believe I was going to go to New York, they thought, "Well, he'll be back tomorrow." I
                            arrived in New York with 75 cents, and didn't know a soul except editors that I'd
                            corresponded with but didn't know well enough to socialise with. I was just a country
                            bumpkin in the big city, but there was one magazine editor that owed me some money and I
                            went to see him and I thought I'd be able to live on this money for a while because they
                            owed me quite a lot of money. Quite a lot was like 30 dollars. But they were going broke and
                            they paid me off 50 cents at a time and so I would go up there every day and get my 50 cents
                            and I slept on park benches, I did all the homeless things but in those days you were safe,
                            today you'd get murdered the second day. Can you imagine a seventeen-year-old boy in a big
                            dangerous city like New York? I quickly settled in Greenwich Village where all the artists
                            and writers were, and within two weeks I knew everybody and I became editor of a poetry
                            magazine, had a little office there in Greenwich Village, and that's how it all started.</p>
                          <p><i><b>AR:</b> When did you start travelling?</i></p>
                          <p><b>JK:</b> That was years later, when I was drafted into the army during the Korean War.
                            Instead of shipping me to Korea they shipped me to Germany , which was a very good move on
                            their part, ’cause they were shooting people in Korea! They assigned me to a radio station
                            in Germany – I’d done some work in radio in New York, and in TV, which was just beginning
                            there – and the army, believe it or not, they saw my record there and they assigned to a
                            radio station: in fact, the biggest radio station in the world at that time, American Forces
                            Network. I started writing radio programmes for them and within one year I was promoted to
                            the chief of productions for the whole network; 20, 21 years old and I'm practically running
                            the whole network! Then when my two years in the army were up they offered me a civilian job
                            and I had a choice – return to New York or stay with the army, and I stayed another year as
                            a civilian in Frankfurt and they gave me a nice apartment and a very good salary and so on.
                            But I used to dream up my own assignments. I sent myself off to Egypt to do a broadcast from
                            the Great Pyramid! We had a soldiers’ singing contest where I had to go around to all the
                            army camps in Europe and pick out the best singer in each army camp and so I took a tour of
                            France! I had a chauffeured limousine that took me around France and I judged this singing
                            contest, but that was just one of the many, many scams that I had going.</p>
                          <p><i><b>AR:</b> Sounds like Sergeant Bilko!  </i></p>
                          <p><b>JK:</b> I also did a radio broadcast from the Castle of Frankenstein – there really is a
                            Castle Frankenstein – I did a Halloween broadcast from there, which was a very big success,
                            the newspapers and magazines like <i>Time</i> compared me to Orson Welles because Orson
                            Welles had pulled off this famous Halloween programme of 1938. So by now <i>Stars and
                              Stripes </i>was always writing about me and running pictures of me and I was suddenly the
                            most famous soldier in Germany! But after being there as a civilian for a year they offered
                            me a better contract to stay on and then I had a big decision. Whether to stay there,
                            forever – I could still be over there! But I decided that I would take a wild chance and
                            take the money I had saved and go around the world, which I had always wanted to do. I
                            especially wanted to visit India. So I took my savings and I left Germany and I went first
                            back to Egypt where I'd done the broadcast from the Great Pyramid.  </p>
                          <p><i><b>AR:</b> Any particular reason why you went back to Egypt? </i></p>
                          <p><b>JK:</b> Because I felt a strong relationship to Egypt, a lot of people feel that, it's
                            rather mysterious, you almost feel like your ancestors are from Egypt. I've heard other
                            people talk about it too, although I felt no kinship at all to the modern Arabs, the modern
                            Egyptians, but I felt something about the land of Egypt. I really felt a strong relationship
                            to it. So I lived there for almost a year.</p>
                          <p><b> <i>AR:</i></b><i> Was it during this time that you saw the UFO at the Aswan
                            Dam? </i><br><b></b></p>
                          <p><b>JK:</b> I saw a UFO at the old Aswan Dam, they later built a new one, but there was an
                            old Aswan Dam and I was down there and there were a lot of people around, there must have
                            been a scattering of like a hundred people all visiting the dam and so on, and we saw this
                            circular thing that was spinning. It appeared in a clear blue sky and this was in 1954.
                            Later I found out there were sightings all over the Middle East at that time, and of course
                            1954 was a very big year in France and I think Britain was also included. That was a major
                            year. This thing that I saw was like the Saturn-shaped objects you've seen drawings of. In
                            other words, it appeared the centre of it was not moving but the outside was spinning. A
                            very odd thing and various people were looking at it with me and I asked some of them what
                            they thought it was and what the altitude was.... and everyone had a different answer. You
                            had 200 witnesses and you had 200 different answers! I thought it was about 200-300 feet in
                            the air, but some people thought it was 1000 feet, 5000 feet and because you don't know the
                            size of the thing you can't judge the altitude of it. Right there, in two seconds, I was
                            convinced that flying saucers existed! There was no way anybody could ever tell me after
                            that that there's no such thing as flying saucers. <br></p>

                          <p><b>JK:</b> I lived in Egypt for a while, and then I moved on across the desert. I went to
                            Baghdad and I arrived broke in Baghdad which had become my normal condition because I had an
                            agent in New York who would send me money and sometimes the money would be delayed or some
                            SNAFU. I was broke in Baghdad and I quickly learned, whenever I was broke, to check into the
                            most expensive hotel and because I was an American and had that famous green passport they
                            never questioned me and just thought, "Hey, he's an American, he must be filthy rich!” So I
                            would check into the best hotel and eat in their restaurants until the money came through
                            and I never got questioned once! From Baghdad I took the long trip down through the Persian
                            Gulf on some kind of funny boat and ended up in India and then I spent a great deal of time
                            in India because it's a fascinating country.</p>

                            find street magicians they were all doing card tricks! Which they had bought by mail from
                            London! It was very hard to find anyone doing the famous Indian tricks. I searched for the
                            Indian Rope Trick and I found various forms of it being performed but they were not the

                          <p><b>JK:</b> Snake charming had always fascinated me as a kid on the farm. I started studying
                            herpetology and reading books on the subject and I had a neighbour who used to go out and
                            catch rattlesnakes and sell them to some company that needed rattlesnakes. I used to go out
                            with him and so at a very early age I learned quite a lot about snakes and reptiles. So I
                            actually studied snake charming with some of these snake charmers except there's not much to
                            study because the charmer is blowing a pipe and moving his hands back and forth and the
                            snake is trying to strike at his hands. The snake can't hear so it's all showmanship, the
                            people watching think the snake is dancing to the tune of the pipe but the snake is just
                            trying to kill the piper!  </p>

                          <p><b>JK:</b> I had many fortean-type experiences in India. One strange thing that happened
                            more than once was strange people would come up to me and say that they’d been waiting for
                            me to appear – this was probably baloney and they were saying, "There's an American tourist,
                            let's take him for big bucks". I got very sophisticated very fast. I went into the Himalayan
                            Mountains because at that time, in the Fifties, there was a lot of publicity about the
                            Abominable Snowman. There were a number of expeditions into the mountains looking for the
                            Snowman, I think the <i>Daily Mail</i> in London sent an expedition, and I figured I might
                            be able to get a photograph of the Abominable Snowman and sell it to <i>Life</i> magazine or
                            something. So I went into the mountains and to the little country of Sikkim and I crossed
                            the border into Tibet, not very far though ’cause I'm six feet tall and Tibetans are four
                            feet tall, and the Chinese were in there and they would see this six foot tall guy and say,
                            "That is not a real Tibetan." At least I could say I'd been to Tibet.  </p>

                            you see the footprints you say "Well maybe I don't wanna meet this guy". <br></p>
                          <p><i><b>AR:</b> Do you believe Yeti exists in the physical realm? </i><br></p>
                          <p><b>JK:</b> Then I did, yes. Although all of the stories about the Yeti which I heard from
                            different people seemed very demonic. They believed it was bad luck to see one of them.
                            Everybody had a story to tell about the Yeti in those days, everybody who lived in those
                            areas. But now I'm not so sure the Yeti is a real animal. At that time I was absolutely
                            convinced. <br></p>
                          <p><i><b>AR:</b> I know you don't want to talk about the Mothman but I'll just ask one
                            question. I'm still puzzled by one bit of </i>The Mothman Prophecies<i>, the chapter
                            entitled ‘Beelzebub Visits West Virginia’ where you relate the story of how you called at a
                            house to make a phone call and because you were not from the area people misidentified you
                            as the Devil! Is this part of your tricking device which continues through the book – to
                            make people see that everything isn't as it seems?</i><br></p>
                          <p><b> JK:</b> As you know, the book was written several years after the events and it was
                            very difficult to get a New York publisher interested in it. I needed a strong opening and
                            this was a true story. My car had run off the road on a very rainy night and I was dressed
                            in a necktie and a full suit – you didn’t see that very often on back roads in West
                            Virginia, a black suit – and I went around pounding on doors to get somebody to call a truck
                            for me. It turned out that the people who finally made the call were among the people that
                            were on the bridge that later collapsed. The day after I knocked on their door, they told
                            everybody they knew that a strange man in a black suit and a beard, which was rare in those
                            days, had called and he must have been the devil, so that made me part of folklore and I
                            found years later that people were still telling that story of the devil who had come around
                            to these houses on this back road. <br></p>

                            are you saying, then, that we live in an environment which still has many hidden, but
                            natural, mysteries which we interact with and interpret? </i><br></p>

                            us in any way. In fact, I just had a letter before I left New York., from a man named Henry
                            Belk. His family are very rich, they own a chain of 400 stores in the south, and Henry for
                            many years has been investigating psychic surgery, that's his thing. I was astonished to get
                            this letter the other day: he said that after all these years investigating psychic surgery,
                            he had decided that the psychic surgery was being done by an invisible force. The surgeon
                            was just an instrument for it and Henry is evolving now a whole theory about invisible
                            entities and so on and for him, he's very scientifically oriented, it's a surprising thing
                            for him to come out with. <br></p>

                            phrase which caught on, by the way, and people all over the world are using that phrase,
                            'Cosmic Jokers', now. You get involved in a situation which seems very real at the time and
                            then as it progresses, if you're smart enough, you realise somebody's playing a joke on you
                            and it has no meaning at all. Now some people are too dumb to realise that and then it just
                            keeps growing and developing because this phenomena sort of feeds on it.</p>

                            find this gold cross I would save the world! And for a while I was playing these games. A
                            very well-known American ufologist named Ted Bloecher spent 30 years of his life… he's in
                            the theatre, he's a song and dance man, but he spent 30 years of his life spending all his
                            spare time researching UFOs and he would be with a dance troupe in a small town and he'd go
                            to the newspaper and go through their files and get all their UFO reports. Well he finally
                            got involved in some contactee stories in New York State where there were landings and UFOs
                            supposedly contacting people and so on, and he got deeper and deeper into these and then it
                            finally occurred to him that somebody was playing with him, that it wasn't real, that it was
                            a joke that they were playing on him and that whatever his interpretation was the phenomenon
                            would then mould itself to it. So he quit ufology, and he's made statements to people that
                            he's very sorry that he spent 30 years on it, he regrets now that he wasted 30 years when he
                            could have been out chasing women or whatever.  </p>

                            interrelated events; for example, there was a family in West Virginia with the rather
                            unusual name of Walmsley, who were an integral part of the Mothman mystery because several
                            people in this family had seen the Mothman – as you know, in small towns in America one
                            family will have 300 different units in the area, cousins and grandparents and so on. Well
                            in Budd Hopkins' first book he talks about the first UFO sighting in New Jersey that he got
                            interested in and it's the Walmsley family in New Jersey! And a couple of the Walmsley
                            people in West Virginia went down with the bridge. There does seem to be a lot of things

                            with our New Age movements and things. Now this doesn't mean the whole human race, it means
                            a fragment of the human race has gotten an understanding they didn't have before. It really
                            started in 1848 with the Fox sisters and spiritualism. That was the first real new age
                            movement. A lot of other things happened in 1848, but it was like that one was the beginning
                            and whatever the phenomenon is it's outside of us, so each generation is carried a step
                            further but our generation doesn't matter. As you know, many of our ufologists are now dead
                            and they died without knowing anything about all of this. Some of them carried it a little
                            step forward. It may take another hundred years or another five hundred years before we know
                            what this ultimate goal is.</p>

                          <p><b>JK:</b> Well, a very smart fellow, an Englishman by the way, named Arthur C. Clarke,
                            wrote a book called <i>Childhood's End</i> which is about this very thing, about the
                            evolution of the human race until the logical end of evolution, a spiritual state and no
                            longer a physical state. I have come to think that that's true too, that our physical bodies
                            are very limited and very fragile and not worth very much, but our spiritual existence,
                            whatever it is - we don't understand it, is the key, and if there's such a thing as
                            evolution and reincarnation and so on it's the endurance of this fragment of energy that we
                            each carry around with us.</p>

                            think that's probably true. I think the Indians and a lot of these so-called primitive
                            people had a great understanding of all this and it was unfortunately lost when the white
                            man came over. Look what happened to the Indians in South America, we destroyed their
                            written records in the name of religion. On Easter Island they had written records and the
                            first thing that the Spanish priests did when they arrived there was destroy the written

                            Question</i>. I also went into the problem of mystical illumination which has always
                            fascinated me because it happened to me when I was eighteen. When I was living in New York
                            as an eighteen year old, I was living in a furnished room and I woke up one night and the
                            whole room was bathed in this very peculiar light. I thought the building was on fire! Then
                            I started having… you can't call them hallucinations… a flood of material was coming into my
                            mind, and suddenly I understood everything. I swear I understood the meaning of everything,
                            how the world was created, how it was going to end. I knew it all! And I said, "This is
                            terrific, boy, I'll write this all down tomorrow when I wake up," and the next day, of
                            course, when I woke up I couldn't remember anything! I remember the experience and I
                            remember the room being bathed in the light but I couldn't remember any of this material, it
                            must have entered into my unconscious mind. And for thirty years I thought I was the only
                            person in the world that had had this experience, I never mentioned it to anybody, and then
                            I started reading some of this stuff about cosmic illumination and started meeting other
                            people who'd had the same experience, and I realised that many people in each generation
                            have this experience and many of them don't necessarily do anything with it, and for others
                            it changes their whole life.  </p>

                            lot of people in religion who have this experience and put it to good use. It’s the reason a
                            lot of priests and nuns and holy people get into religion, they have this experience and
                            they spend their lives helping other people. Mystical illumination is a very important key
                            to this and there are books on it, books written by people who've had the experience, books
                            by people who've studied the experience. A Dr. Bucke wrote the first book on it in the early
                            1900s and after he wrote the book he slipped on ice, hit his head and killed himself. There
                            are many people who have the experience and don't necessarily remember seeing a light or
                            seeing anything, it just happens to them and they change overnight and they don’t know
                            why.  </p>
                          <p><i><b>AR:</b> What do you think about the current fascination in the USA for the
                            extraterrestrial hypothesis?  </i></p>
                          <p><b>JK:</b> Well, it's been a propaganda campaign, it's been a very small group of people
                            propagandising this, proselytising a new religion – the new religion is this notion that
                            there are extraterrestrials out there. Now science, on the other hand, has backed away from
                            the whole extraterrestrial thing. In the Sixties, many scientists thought that there was a
                            very good chance that there were extraterrestrials – Carl Sagan, for example, founded
                            exobiology. Arthur C. Clarke has made a number of statements in the past few years saying
                            that he no longer believes there is any chance for extraterrestrials to exist. The ET
                            premise has been promoted by the movies and by the UFO buffs, and the average person in the
                            street now sort of accepts it, because they haven't given much thought to it and they've
                            seen the movies or they've heard UFO buffs on the radio or TV and they say, “Well that makes
                            sense, we're being visited by extraterrestrials.” They just simply accept it. </p>
                          <p><i><b>AR:</b> Do you think the US government has the faintest idea about UFOs or is the
                            only cover-up one of ignorance?</i></p>
                          <p><b>JK:</b> I think they're pretty dumb about this. I've spent a lot of time trying to find
                            files that would really have significant material in, and I've known a lot of people in the
                            government and in the military, and there are a lot of people who are interested in the
                            subject but there's never been any unified effort to study it or discover anything, and how
                            do you study it without actually making contact with the UFOs? So the UFO buffs have kind of
                            dreamed up a whole fantasy world where they think the government has made deals with the
                            UFOs. That's just the UFO buff’s way out, of protecting himself – if he didn't think that,
                            then he would be in a very vulnerable position as a UFO buff, so he says that the reason
                            that we don't know anything about UFOs is because the government is keeping it quiet. The
                            alternative to that is the reason we don't know anything about UFOs is they don't exist.  
                          </p>
                          <p><i><b>AR:</b> In </i>Operation Trojan Horse<i> you issue a warning to people wishing to
                            become ufologists, basically warning them off the whole idea. What brought this on, and do
                            you still hold the same position?</i></p>
                          <p><b>  JK:</b> Yeah, in a lot of my speeches I usually end up with a statement like that. I
                            usually point out that individuals and civilian organisations don't have the expertise or
                            the money to do anything, and that it's a waste of time to try to investigate these things.
                            The best they can do is go and sit on a hill and watch the lights in the sky, and say, “Hey,
                            there goes one!” In order to really investigate this you might need twenty million dollars,
                            to build the right instruments. This is a big project and I don't think even the government
                            has ever undertaken that. I don't think any government has ever undertaken that. The
                            governments around the world all assumed the American government was going to do it. You may
                            remember in the Seventies Idi Amin – remember good old Idi Amin? – well in Uganda they were
                            seeing UFOs all the time and Idi Amin had his ambassador to the UN stand up in the UN and
                            say, “Hey, do something about this!” It was a famous speech at the UN, and of course the UN
                            officials said, “What are we going to use for money?” and “Where are we going to find the
                            experts?” When you think about it, there isn't a single real expert on UFOs in the world,
                            because nobody has had that kind of experience to be an expert. You can be an expert on
                            submarines because they’re tangible, you can study the structure of submarines and you can
                            ride in a submarine and all that, but nobody can really do that with a UFO. So if a UFO
                            landed tomorrow in Trafalgar Square, who would the British government call in to study it?
                            It would be a big problem. As I said, they would probably have to call in first of all
                            aeronautical designers – you wouldn't call in physicists and astronomers – and if there were
                            beings on board you would call in your very best medical people, forensic pathologists and
                            biologists. The last person you would call in would be a ufologist, ’cause he'd be useless,
                            he'd stand there and stare and say, “My god, it's real!”  </p>

                            seen them myself, but I don’t think they are machines.  </p>
                          <p><i><b>AR:</b> One final question John, which I’m sure an awful lot of British ufologists
                            have wanted to ask you for a long time. Just why didn’t the moon come up on the night of
                            April 3rd 1967? (Note to baffled readers: consult your copy of </i>The Mothman Prophecies<i>).  </i>
                          </p>
                          <p><b>JK:</b> (laughs) Yeah, I got the information from the local newspaper; I put that in
                            almost as a joke because it was a humorous incident. I’d seen the moon the night before and
                            then that night there was no moon – and also one night I saw the moon come up and I thought
                            it was a flying saucer. A lot of people have done just that I’m sure.</p>
