<p>James Lipp was the <a href="/org/us/RAND.html">Rand Corporation</a>'s guided missile expert, and he was violently
  anti-saucer, according to Ruppelt's notes. Lipp wrote an analysis of UFO reports in <time>1948-12</time> for <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/sign">Project Sign</a> to see if they could be space visitors, but concluded
  UFO's were probably not extraterrestrial. Ruppelt stated that early in 1952 Col. Don Bower and he tried to enlist the
  Rand Corporation's aid, on a contract basis, to try to develop some way of getting more positive answers but, at the
  recommendation of Lipp, Rand refused to touch it. “Too hot,” was their reason. Ruppelt: "I think controversial would
  have been a better word than 'hot'."</p>
