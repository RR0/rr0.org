<h2>Catalogue de traces physiques de Ted Phillips</h2>
<p>
  Je suis très reconnaissant à Mark Rodeghier du <a href="/org/us/asso/cufos">Centre pour les Etudes sur les Ovnis
  (CUFOS)</a> de <span class="people" title="Josef Allen Hynek">J. Allen-Hynek</span> pour nous avoir autorisé à
  reproduire les cas suivants du célèbre <em>Catalogue de Traces Physiques </em>de Ted Phillips. Le catalogue a été
  publié en 1975 par le <a href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a> et son titre approprié est <em>Physical Traces Associated
  with UFO Sightings, A Preliminary Catalogue</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Ted Phillips est né en <time>1942</time> et a vécu toute sa vie dans le Missouri. Il est toujours vivant aujourd'hui
  et sa carrière dans la recherche sur les ovnis s'est étendue de la fin des années 1960s au milieu des années 1980s.
  Phillips a eu une carrière variée et a à divers moments été inspecteur du Département Autoroutier de l'Etat du
  Missouri, photographe professionnel et également musicien de jazz amateur. Selon l'<em>UFO Encyclopedia</em> de Ronald
  Story, Phillips a enquêté sur plus de 500 cas d'ovnis dans ses 12 premières années de recherche sur les ovnis. Sa
  déclaration de position (écrite au milieu des années 1970s) s'est conclue par : <q>Je pense, après 13 ans d'enquête,
  [que] les données indiquent une origine non terrestre.</q>
</p>
<p> This summary is based on only a partial listing of the catalogue as many of Phillips' cases appear extremely dubious
  in nature. Cases from the early 1950s are particularly unreliable because many of the early UFO books were written by
  people who automatically assumed that they were describing encounters with alien spaceships. Jenny Randles tells me
  that cases reported in the "hysterical" Spanish and South American media should be treated even more skeptically
  because these cases were often complete fabrications! Furthermore many of the early cases have no proper source, e.g.
  Phillips quotes Vallee describing cases which appear to have been anecdotally reported to Vallee. This means that we
  often have no idea whether or not a specific case was investigated by anyone, let alone whether it was a contemporary
  investigation or whether the investigator was in any sense someone capable of undertaking an objective scientific
  evaluation.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to these problems we have a major definitional problem concerning cases which feature circular ground
  traces because of the current confusion which exists over the authenticity of the archetypal crop circle. Doug and
  Dave claimed to have actually created the phenomenon of a sharply-defined swirled circle, but they apparently based
  their hoax on the Tully reeds circles, which themselves were sharply-defined swirled circles. Given this regrettable
  fact, what do we include in our definition of a crop circle? Do we include roughly circular shapes of depressed but
  not swirled circles or do we stick to sharp-edged circles? How about burned circles or circles where the crop has been
  denuded or completely removed? Given these problems its probably wise to merely highlight all cases involving circular
  traces but not assume that they are necessarily caused by the same causal mechanism. It is quite possible that there
  may be several natural circle-forming mechanisms which all create different types of circular ground trace. One of
  these mechanisms could still be Meaden's postulated plasma-vortex but it is wise not to assume that any particular
  category of circular ground trace must be caused by the postulated plasma vortex. In any event we will be trying to
  track down case material referred to by Phillips and will report back in a future issue.

  <h3>Cas 013 : 12 Juin 1790, France, Alencon. Heure : 05.00</h3>
  <p>
    Several farmers caught sight of a large globe which was surrounded by flames. A whistling sound was heard. The
    object slowed, made some oscillations and moved toward the top of the hill, unearthing plants along the slope. The
    heat was so intense that grass and small trees started burning. In the evening the sphere was still warm. Witnesses:
    2 mayors, a doctor, 3 other authorities, in addition to the dozens of peasants who were present. A kind of door
    opened and a person came out of it. The person was dressed in a strange way, wearing a tight-fitting suit and,
    seeing all the people, said some words that were not understood and ran into the woods. The sphere exploded
    silently, throwing pieces everywhere, and these pieces burned until they were powder. This report [is based on an
    earlier report made] on June 17, 1790, by Police Inspector Liabeuf. Source: <b>Vallee III</b>, p60.
  </p>
  <p> [<b>PF Notes</b>: This case has always attracted more than the usual amount of skepticism, although we are not
    aware that it has been exposed as a hoax. Quite a few of Vallee's original folklore cases were later exposed as
    dubious or hoaxed, but this case sounds like something straight out of Jules Verne - perhaps we have a retrospective
    hoax? Also, were there really Police Inspectors in 18th century France? I thought Peel didn't found the first police
    force in Britain until the 1830s so how can we have a French Police Inspector in 1790?]

    [<b>PF:</b> Another weird case! Sounds a little bit like the infamous First Fourth Norfolk Regiment that allegedly
    disappeared inside a strange cloud during the siege of Gallipoli in 1916. This too was a retrospective hoax that has
    only recently been admitted to. On the other hand Charles Fort's books were full of 'strange clouds' that did
    peculiar things. Its a pity there isn't more information. Difficult to evaluate.]

  <h3>Case 014: December 7th, 1872. ENGLAND, Banbury. Time: 10.00</h3>
  <p>
    At King's Sutton an object resembling a haystack flew on an irregular course. Sometimes high, sometimes low, it was
    accompanied by fire and dense smoke, and produced the same effect as a tornado, felling trees and walls. It vanished
    suddenly. (<b>VALLEE III</b>)
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>PF:</b> Phillips was perceptive to state that the King's Sutton event produced the same effects as a tornado, as
    this event almost certainly was a tornado.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alan Watson of Banbury decided to track down the original newspaper accounts of this event. In doing so he contacted
    Banbury Library, Oxfordshire County Council Leisure and Arts, and the Banbury Guardian/Central Counties Newspapers
    Limited. The latter have given copyright permission for Alan to reproduce these accounts in <b>The Crop Watcher</b>.

    <h3>Extraordinary Phenomenon Near King's Sutton<br> Great Destruction of Property and Narrow Escape of a Man</h3>
  </center>
  <blockquote>
    <p>One of the most extraordinary things that perhaps ever fell to our lot to chronicle took place near King's Sutton
      on Saturday, when Walton Grounds, Astrop and Newbottle were visited by a phenomenon of a most remarkable
      description, and which carried great destruction before it, tearing up seventeen trees by their roots, damaging no
      less than thirty-six others, throwing down 116 yards of stone wall, removing parts of the thatch of a hovel and
      rick, and nearly resulting in a fatal accident to a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears that shortly before one o'clock on Saturday the weather became very overcast and cloudy, with a heavy
      rainfall. There was a vivid flash of lightning instantly followed by a loud thunderclap, and immediately
      afterwards the phenomenon came upon the scene. An eye-witness says it was "something in the shape of a haycock,
      accompanied with fire and dense smoke, revolving through the air, making a noise similar to a railway train in
      motion, but a great deal louder, and travelling much faster. Sometimes it was high in the air, and sometimes near
      the ground." The first appearance of the phenomenon seems to be upon Mr. Rogers' farm at Walton Grounds, where it
      felled two or three trees. It proceeded from S.W., to N.E. and almost took a straight line for some distance, but
      turned N.W., towards the end of its career. In the field adjoining Mr. Rogers' farm, and which belongs to Sir
      William Brown, a number of trees were struck, the limbs of some carried away, the tops of others, and two
      completely torn up. After knocking down some rails, three large elm trees skirting Mr. Cartwright's spinney were
      torn up and a quantity of earth with them. There does not appear to have been any damage done to the spinney,
      which is planted with ash poles, but it is something extraordinary that on each side of it there has been much
      destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man named William Adams, who was breaking stones on the road leading from King's Sutton to Newbottle, and just
      on the outside of the spinney, says that he heard a whizzing noise coming through the spinney - a noise like a
      train coming up - accompanied with dense smoke. Immediately he heard a greater noise, and a tree that he had been
      standing under for shelter for a short time before was torn up by the roots. Just before this took place, he says
      there was a heavy shower of rain, and a vivid flash of lightning, which frightened a boy who was working with him
      a few yards off, and at his request he went with him, and he had no sooner reached him than the tree he had been
      standing under was thrown down with great violence. Another tree on the same side of the road, and but a short
      distance off, shared the same fate, and here branches are scattered about in every direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the opposite side of the road, a beech tree, said to be one of the largest on Sir William Brown's estate, was
      torn up by the roots, taking many tons of earth with it. The length of the earth facing the road removed is about
      ten or eleven yards. An adjoining beech was split in two, one portion being left standing. The thatching of a
      hovel near was disturbed, and some cattle in the hovel were frightened, and rushed out into the field. A little
      further on a large hedge has been thrown down, and the fire ball has made great havoc at Newbottle Park, 116 yards
      or more of the wall of which was thrown down. The wall is thrown down at intervals, and at one place seventy or
      eighty yards of it had been razed to the ground. Some trees in the park were struck, but it is strange that of a
      number of trees standing in a line, the first was struck, the second and the third were not, whilst the fourth
      was. The ball seems to have spent itself a short distance beyond Mr. Cartwright's boundary wall, where the ground
      has been torn up, trees knocked down, and branches scattered about for a considerable distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people who saw the fire ball and watched its progress, say they saw the last of it here, that it disappeared
      all at once, and there was even no trace of smoke, nor did they hear an explosion of any kind. The noise it made
      was, it is said, terrific, it being accompanied by a whirlwind that carried everything before it, the smoke rose
      high in the air, and the people thought the earth was about to open. Stones from Mr. Cartwright's wall, several
      pounds in weight, were carried many yards, and some men at work a mile away saw the contents of a pool carried
      away by the whirlwind. The distance traversed by the ball was about two miles, and it will be seen that at the
      outset of its career, it was no so destructive as towards the close.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of those who saw the phenomenon, to use their own words, say, "there was as much smoke as would come from
      five or six engines, but not much fire, and the noise it made was awful." It created much consternation amongst
      them and one man rushed away from the place in a state of great trepidation. The scene has been visited by numbers
      of people, the phenomenon having, of course, caused much comment in the neighbourhood.

      <h3>ANOTHER ACCOUNT</h3>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <blockquote>
    Sir, - May I ask you to insert the following account of a curious atmospheric phenomenon which occurred here to-day!
    <p>
      About 12 o'clock we had a heavy storm of rain and hall, in the middle of which was a very vivid flash of
      lightning, with almost instantaneous thunder of a very peculiar rattling sound. About five minutes after this, as
      I was leaving the house, my gardener called me to come quickly and see the fireball. I was unfortunately half a
      minute too late, but I have seen four persons who saw it from different points, and all agree they heard a hissing
      roaring sound, like a passing train, which attracted their attention, and then saw a huge revolving ball of fire
      travelling from six to ten feet off the ground. The smoke was whizzing round and rising high into the air, and a
      whirlwind accompanied it, carrying a cloud of branches along and destroying everything in its way. The damage is
      very considerable - large trees bodily uprooted - others broken off about ten feet from the ground, others with
      all their branches snapped off; in one place a wall laid flat, and the remainder knocked over at intervals, as if
      the wall had rebounded, and some of the stones carried ten yards off. I rode this afternoon along the whole line
      of its journey - about 2 miles in length. The direction was first from S.W. to N.E., and then it turned N.W. Where
      it first begun the breadth of ground travelled over was very narrow, but increased as it proceeded, till in the
      last field the debris covered a space quite 150 yards wide, and here it seems to have exhausted itself, as all the
      witnesses agree that the ball of fire seemed to vanish at this spot without any explosion. Here the ground had
      been out in places as if by a cannon ball, but I could find no cause for this and I saw no signs of fire on its
      route. One man, however, says there was a strong sulphurous smell after it had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<b>PF:</b> The sulphurous smell is almost certainly the mis-identification of ozone and nitrogen oxides - which
      are created by the effect of electricity on air. Tornadoes which are highly electrically-active are often reported
      as being accompanied by such smells.]
    </p>
    <p>
      About the time of this occurrence my farm men at work about a quarter of a mile in quite another direction saw the
      water of a pond carried into the air by a whirlwind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind was light all day from SS.E. My pocket aneroid (made by Bryson, of Edinburgh) stood this morning at 28.48
      [inches]. At this moment it stands at 28.27, showing that the atmospheric disturbance has not yet begun to
      subside.
    </p>

      I am yours obediently,<br> T. L. M. Cartwright,<br> Newbottle Manor, Banbury, Nov 30th, 1872

      <h3>THE LATE PHENOMENON NEAR KING'S SUTTON</h3>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <blockquote>
    As was to be expected, the phenomenon which lately occurred at King's Sutton, and which we referred to at length
    last week, has attracted the attention of a number of scientific gentlemen, and amongst them Mr. G. . Symons, the
    eminent meteorologist, and Mr. Thomas Beesley, of Banbury, who visited the neighbourhood last week, and after an
    enquiry extending over several days, we understand they are of opinion that the place had been visited by a cyclone.
    The appearance of fire is explained for by the friction of the branches of trees caused by the rapid evolutions [sic
    (?) revolutions?] with which they were carried through the air. Photographs have been taken of the various damages,
    and in all probability the subject will be dealt with by Mr. Symons in the <b>Meteorological Magazine</b>, of which
    he is the editor. On Sunday four or five hundred persons visited the place, and every day adds to the number of
    those who have been attracted to the spot, some of them coming seventy or eighty miles.
    <p></p>
    <h3>THE GALE</h3>
    Here as elsewhere on Sunday evening a terrific gale was experienced, accompanied with heavy rainfall. Throughout the
    night the wind never ceased, and fearful gusts blew occasionally - gusts of tremendous power and force which seemed
    as if they would carry everything before them. In this neighbourhood a good deal of damage was done. A large elm
    tree in front of the Horton Infirmary was blown down, a popular in Prospect Terrace, another elm in the Causeway,
    and walls in various places. The roofs of hovels and cottages suffered considerably, the thatching of a cottage at
    Grimsbury being partially removed, to the consternation of the occupants. Two trees were knocked down at North
    Aston, knocking down telegraph posts and wires and creating other havoc. The telegraphic communication was stopped,
    and the road was blocked up, so that the mail from Woodstock was greatly behind time. The engine-shed at Bletchley
    was blown down, doing much damage, but no person was injured."

      <h4>THE GALE</h4>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <blockquote>
    Oxford was visited on Sunday night by one of the most violent gales which has been experienced for many years past,
    and considerable damage has been to property. An extensive goods shed at the Great Western Railway Station, which
    was approaching completion, was blown down, doing damage to the extent of between two and three hundred pounds. It
    was 250 feet long, and the walls were 20 feet high. They were built of brick, and were 14 inches in thickness, with
    piers 18 inches thick, at intervals of 9 feet. There were 26 cast-iron girders in the building, all of which were
    smashed to pieces by the fall of the walls. The contractor was Mr. Bishop of Reading. Several signal and telegraph
    posts have been blown down on the Great Western line near Oxford, but fortunately the telegraph wire had not been
    broken. At Christ Church about 60 feet of the ornamental parapet wall over the Vice-Chancellor's residence was blown
    on the lead roof, which was seriously damaged thereby. Some of the University barges on the Thames were driven from
    their moorings, and rafts were sunk. Two or three of the large elms in the avenue known as the Broad Walk, were
    blown down, and large branches of other broken off. The end wall of a house at Cowley St. John fell, but fortunately
    the occupants escapen [sic] unhurt. Garden walls in several places fell, and some ornamental stonework was blown off
    from All Saints College. A large number of chimney pots and slates from roofs were also blown off, but fortunately,
    so far as we can learn, no accident [to persons] has occurred."
  </blockquote>
  The <b>Banbury Guardian</b> goes on to refer to damageat St. Aldgate's Church, where the tower has already been
  demolished,and to the Spire of All Saints Church, which has been left in a "verydangerous condition". There is alsoan
  account of the earlier tornado from the <b>Pall Mall Gazette</b>, which isquoted in full :-
  <blockquote>
    There has been an extraordinary, and, it may be added, singularly unpleasant atmospheric phenomenon near Banbury.
    About one o'clock in the afternoon "something in the shape of a haycock and of great size" was seen revolving
    through the air. At first people naturally thought it was the "Claimant," but speedily to their cost discovered that
    it was something even more alarming and mysterious. It was accompanied by fire and smoke, and sometimes was high up
    in the air and at other times close to the ground. Its noise was terrible, and resembled that of an express train
    running with extreme rapidity. It tore up no fewer than seventeen trees, injured thirty-six more, and threw down 116
    yards of stone wall, besides frightening everybody out of their wits. For a mile and a half this disagreeable thing,
    whatever it was, pursued its destructive career, and was accompanied in its progress by a whirlwind almost as
    mischievous as itself, for this latter nuisance, it is stated, swept everything before it - dried up a pond over
    which it passed, carried stones for a distance of forty yards, and knocked down hosts of railings. Altogether a more
    troublesome couple than the thing like a haycock and its attendant whirlwind have rarely visited a quiet
    neighbourhood, nor are we surprised to hear that the inhabitants thought "the earth was about to open and swallow
    them up." It is a touching trait in the character of this simple folk that in the hour of peril they were fully
    prepared to share the fate of the Banbury cakes which have made their district so famous. -- <b>Pall Mall
    Gazette</b>

  <h3>Commentary</h3>
  David Reynolds of the U.K.-based <b>TORRO</b> (Tornado and Storm Research Organization) tells me that this event is
  recorded as two separate and definite tornado events in the TORRO tornado database. The case is noticeable for the
  extraordinary damage reported - particularly to the newly constructed railway shed at Oxford and to the 116 yards of
  stone wall. The event involved typical tornado acoustics - "a railway train in motion", "a whizzing noise", "a noise
  like a train" and the tornado sometimes hovered and sometimes touched the ground surface. The "fireball" gave off a
  "hissing, roaring" sound and was revolving rapidly. The "smoke" effect may simply have been a misperception of
  swirling water condensation inside the vortex funnel. The original account in the <b>Banbury Guardian</b> cites the
  tornado sucking away the contents of a small pond. Of course this is a clue to cases where small fish are seen to fall
  from the sky. Finally we see how some members of the local population interpreted what they saw in a religious sense,
  thinking that "the Claimant" (the devil?), was responsible for the phenomenon. This is not unusual but is more typical
  of accounts of medieval tornadoes, rather than those of the 19th century.

      David Muckle and W.R. McKay heard a sudden loud report. They turned to see a cloud of stones flying upward from a
      spot in a field. They examined the spot, which was circular and about 16 ft. across. There was no sign of an
      eruption nor anything to indicate the fall of a heavy body there. The ground was simply swept clean. (<b>Scientific
      American</b>, July 10, 1880).

      Police officers John Collins and Joseph Kennan saw an object 6 ft. in diameter float to earth in an open field.
      They approached the object with flashlights. Collins tried to pick the object up, the part touched by his hand
      dissolved leaving a stick, odourless residue. Within a half hour the entire object had evaporated. A spot remained
      at the site. (<b>News slips</b>).
      <p>
        [<b>PF:</b> This sounds to me more like some kind of industrial pollutant rather than a spaceship! Jenny Randles
        has informed me of some fascinating work by Louis Frank (summarised in a paper by Frank, Sigworth and Craven,
        <b>International Geophysical Research Letters</b>, 1986). Frank was intrigued by abnormally high water vapour
        levels in the upper atmosphere as well as by UFO reports and reports of strange things falling out of the sky.
        He postulated that every day the earth's atmosphere is struck by thousands of mini comets - comets composed of
        inter-stellar ice but only a few metres in size. Such comets would presumably evaporate in the upper atmosphere,
        where they might be mistaken for UFOs. A few might conceivably reach the lower atmosphere where they might
        behave in the manner described in this case. Frank's controversial theory has been widely debated in the
        scientific press and has attracted a good deal of skepticism. I've not heard of Frank's theory before so perhaps
        it is wise to reserve judgement.]

      A woman was in her driveway when she heard a humming sound. She glanced across the road and saw strange lights
      flying low over a field about 1,000 foot away. The object [sic] hovered and descended to the ground; the lights
      went out. Another object [sic] crossed the field and hovered above the landed UFO. The objects were disk-shaped
      with blue lights around a central rim. The landed object ascended and the two flew away at high speed. A small
      area of singed grass was found the next morning. (John Fuller, <b>Incident at Exeter</b>)

        [<b>PF:</b> It is interesting to compare the behaviour and appearance of these UFOs with those mentioned in the

        two. The Turner case was part of a more complex sequence of UFO events spanning several weeks but in this
        particular case the witnesses were obviously too far away to experience any of the effects described in the

  Readers will know that in issues 16-18 of <b> The Crop Watcher</b> I re-published selected cases from Ted Phillips'
  well-known catalogue of alleged physical ground traces associated with unidentified flying objects. The purpose of
  doing so was to draw attention to alleged historical accounts of crop circles as well as to examine whether Meaden's
  atmospheric vortex theory can be applied to explain some of the more challenging UFO reports.
  <p>
    I think readers will agree with me when I state that many of the early cases described in Phillips' catalogue are
    far from satisfactory. Of course, this was not Phillips' fault, rather the fault of his contributors, who frequently
    accepted what they were told by witnesses without the slightest degree of critical thinking or logic. Some cases -
    eg the Alencon landing from 18th century France - have been dismissed by skeptical researchers as outright frauds,
    whilst others - such as the car stop case at Tuscon (case 790) - suggest that there may be valuable data lying
    around waiting to be discovered and re-inter preted as unusual natural phenomena by liberal-minded scientists. The
    real problem is this - how do we sort out the wheat from the chaff ???
  </p>
  <p>
    We now move on to examine just a few cases from the mid 1960s. Readers may note an increase in the number of
    circular ground trace cases listed as well as a corresponding improvement in detail. Whether this makes the cases
    any more valuable is, of course, open to speculation.

      scorching. Tracks were found leading from the site, oval and about 8 inches long and 8 inches apart in single
      file. The tracks led into a wooded area and ended. (<b>Vallee</b> and <b>UFO-INFO</b>).
      <p>
        [<b>PF:</b> I have mixed feelings about this case. The presence of "tracks" could indicate the involvement of
        hoaxers, yet the account of the light sounds very intriguing. Did the UFO really appear on radar ? I find that
        difficult to believe. This is a difficult case to evaluate without a proper case summary to examine.]

      Farmer noted three rings which were much greener and about 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The outer circles [rings,
      <b>PF</b>] were not more than 2 foot in width. They were not fairy rings or fungus growth. The grass was dark
      green and 4 inches taller than the rest. (<b>Saucers, Space and Science</b>).

      Man saw a light on the beach near Penguin Street, got out of his car to observe it. He heard a whistling sound and
      saw an object, 25 foot wide, rise from the beach to an altitude of about 600 feet. He returned to the site with
      other persons and a dog that became restless at a spot where grass was flattened. Another witness, driving near

        to chase this story up. If photographs exist of these "circles" we will have to assume that Doug and Dave were
        not the first people to make circles to support the UFO mythology. Of course these circles may not be crop
        circles, but that is a secondary issue.]

      Jim Flynn, 45, saw a lighted object while hunting. 88 feet in diameter, windows 21 inch wide. A humming sound was
      heard. Flynn got to within 8 feet of the object, a beam of light was projected towards him, he was unconscious for
      24 hours. He had lost vision in the right eye, saw poorly with the left. In the hospital five days. Sawgrass was
      burned in a circle 72 feet in diameter. The ground was turned up. Trees were burned. (<b>NICAP</b> and <b>VALLEE

      J.W. Tilse, a senior commercial pilot, and two other men saw in front of Mr Tilse's hotel, a large (30 foot by 1
      foot) dark-grey metallic disc-shaped machine [!!!] hovering about 15 feet from the ground. There were two lights
      near the ends of the object and "banks of floodlights" in rows seemed suspended from it. Three legs could be seen
      below the flood-lights with another light on each. The undersides of trees were illuminated by the lights, as the
      object hovered about 300 feet away for about 45 minutes [!!!]. "On departure, rose slowly to approx. 300 feet,
      then accelerated more than extremely rapidly in a NE to E direction. Would have been flying horizontally. (?)"
      <p>
        "A circular impression was found on the ground two days later by the local policeman. The centre of the circle
        was untouched, the outside impression was 20 feet from inside to inside, and extended 3 foot 2 inches outwards.
        It was a perfect circle. Diameter did not vary. It was practically under a telephone line. No evidence of damage
        can be seen. (To the phone line or poles)". (<b>CUFOS</b>)

  All these cases highlight the issues that face UFOlogists as we grapple with accounts of the unexplained. How much
  weight can we place on such accounts? Are all these cases hoaxes - as the "dry" super skeptics claim - or do some of
  these cases represent encounters with objectively real but poorly understood natural phenomena? -- <b> Paul Fuller,
  1997</b></p>
