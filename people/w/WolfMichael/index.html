<p> Wolf naît en <time>1942</time>. Issu d'une famille de juifs russes émigrés aux USA ayant adopté le nom de famille de
  Kruvant. Selon Wolf, son père l'emène à la <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/AndrewsAFB.html">base aérienne d'Andrews</a>,
  à l'occasion de réunions de l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/ARDC.html">ARDC </a><span class="note">cité par Boylan comme Air Research and Development <em>Council</em></span>,
  ayant kui-même des contacts avec des "gris", qu'il appelle les "catchers of heaven".
</p>
<p>À l'âge de 12 ans, Wolf fonde la <em>Flying Saucer Research Association</em> du New Jersey. La nuit il tente de
  communiquer avec ses amis extraterrestres, en utilisant des signaux lumineux. Le <time>1954-12-24</time>, un tel
  effort est observé par <a href="../../h/HuntWilliamsonGeorge">George Hunt Williamson</a> (que Wolf identifie comme
  travaillant pour la <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a>) qui décrira dans son livre le jeune Wolf, l'année précédent sa
  bar-mitzvah, transmettant des messages aux intelligences de l'espace en utilisant des rayons de lumière modulés <span
      class="source">Williamson 1975, p. 150</span>. Wolf tente aussi des communications télépathiques, demandant aux
  ETs qu'ils survolent sa maison dans une direction donnée en réponse à ses messages de pensée. Il raconte : <q>5 mn
    plus tard, 2 soucoupes volantes volaient au-dessus de ma maison, en direction du Nord, comme je l'avais demandé.</q>
</p>
<p>Wolf raconte qu'il alors alors commencé à avoir des contacts avec la communauté du renseignement, qui aurait finit
  par le recruter. Le gouvernement aurait alors orienté et payé des études impressionnantes, parce qu'il aurait été le
  plus brillant et eut de bonne relations avec les ETs.
</p>
<p>Wolf travaille avec Federico Fellini comme extra dans le film <em>8 1/2</em> et vécu à au Sporting hotel à <span
    class="place">Parioli (Italie)</span>.
</p>
<p>Durant la guerre du Viet-Nam, Wolf aurait servi comme colonel de l'Air Force, pilot, chirugien de vol, et officier de
  renseignement des I-Corps pour la <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> et la <a
      href="/org/us/ic/nsa">NSA</a>. Il aurait également passé un MD en neurologie, un doctorat en physique théorique,
  un ScD en informatique, un JD en droit, un MS en influences électromagnétiques sur les organismes, et un B.S. en
  biogénétique. Boudhiste à la base, Wolf embrasse les vérités de l'Islam, le Christianisme, Judaisme, la spiritualité
  des indiens d'amérique, et autres principales traditions spirituelles. Il déclare : <q>la vérité est un mensonge qui
    n'a pas encore été dévoilé.</q></p>

  <img src="WolfMichael.jpg" alt="Michael Wolf"/>
</figure>
<p>Wolf déclare s'être engagé de <time>1972/1977</time> dans de la recherche gouvernementale secrète sur la technologie
  extraterrestre : <q>Je rencontrais des individus extraterrestres tous les jours dans mon travail, et partageais les
    quartiers de vie avec eux</q>, alors qu'il se trouvait dans des laboratoires de recherche souterrains du
  gouvernement. Il déclare, <q>Les Zetas travaillent dans des installations souterraines, comme demandé par le
    gouvernement U.S.. Les ETs ne violent pas les traites entre le gouvernement U.S. et les Zeta, mais le gouvernement à
    violé des traités en traitant mal les ETs, et essayant de tirer sur des ovnis</q>. Des extraterrestre serait
  notamment captifs : <q>Des scientifiques du gouvernement ont découvert que les ETs ne peuvent se dématerialiser et
    s'échapper quand un champ électromagnétique extrêmement puissant les entoure.</q> (...) <q>Certains dans le
    gouvernement veulent de meilleures relations diplomatiques, mais d'autres chez les militaires veulent les
    abattre.</q> C'est ironique, dit Wolf, <q>parce que la technologie <a href="../../../SDI.html">SDI</a> fut donnée au
    gouvernement par les ETs. </q></p>
<p>A partir de <time>1979</time> il aurait servi comme conseiller scientifique pour les Présidents et le <a
    href="/org/us/NSC.html">NSC</a> sur les sujets relatifs aux extraterrestres. Il aurait notamment fait partie du
  sous-comité de gestion de l'information ovni du <a href="/org/us/NSC.html">NSC</a>, le panel de scientifiques du <a
      href="../../../enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a>. <q>Les noms de code que j'utilisais là-bas étaient
    "Griffin" et "Nu Kappa Eta".</q> Le <a href="../../../enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> lui aurait alors
  confia l'Equipe Alphacom, son 1er groupe sur les sujets extraterrestres, qui aurait également inclut un amiral du
  renseignement naval.
</p>
<p>Toutes ces déclarations de Wolf émergent en <time>1995</time> lorsqu'il sort du bois. Lorsque des enquêteurs
  indiquent ne trouver nulle trace de la la plupart de ces diplômes dans les universités qu'il cite, Wolf répond que
  c'est parce qu'ils ont été obtenus dans le cadre de programmes "d'opérations noires", et que lesdites universités ont
  supprimé ses diplômes de leurs archives.
</p>
<p>Les révélations qu'il fait le seraient à la demande de son chef au <a href="/org/us/NSC.html">NSC</a>, dans le cadre
  d'un plan de levée progressive du secret.
</p>
<p>Un accident de voiture tuera sa femme enceinte et Daniel, son fils de 17 ans. Wolf est en phase terminale de
  dégéneration spinale.
</p>
<p>Le <time>1998-08-08</time> il est interviewé chez lui dans le Connecticut par Adriano Forgione (rédacteur pour <em>Notizario
  UFO</em>) et <a href="../../h/HarrisPaola">Paola Leopizzi Harris</a>. Sa maison est pleine d'encyclopédies médicales,
  de 2 microscopes à électrons, plusieurs ordinateurs, tubes à essais, oscilloscope, etc. Il leur parle de son imitation
  du peintre italien Modigliani dans une peinture de nu sur la porte de son laboratoire. Il dit avoir un QI de 200 (140
  est déjà bien).
</p>
<h2>"Mesoalien"</h2>
<p>Wolf est atteint du diabète. Il prétend être un "hybride" humain/extraterrestre et que la chimie de son sang est
  inhabituelle (Cholesterol 933 ; Triglicerides 3769). Il veut montrer à ses visiteurs combien il est différent en
  plaquant une lampe torche contre ses pupilles vert sombre. Sa nature particulière l'aurait particulièrement adapté à
  un rôle d'interface diplomatique entre le gouvernement des USA et les extraterrestres.
</p>
<p>Il déclare qu'il n'y aurait jamais y avoir du de séparation entre la vieille science et notre spiritualité, de
  dichotomie entre les mondes physiques et métaphysiques. Il prone de quitter "le 4ème monde de technologie avancée" et
  d'entrer dans la "5ème dimension de croissance spirituelle comme nous le disent les prophéties Hopi".
</p>
<p>Le <time>1998-11-22</time> il est invité par les indiens d'amérique à la Conférence de l'Etoile Sedona pour parler,
  an event which will unite many Indian tribes and Ufologists in a continuing dialogue about the forth coming Earth
  Changes.
</p>
<p><a href="../../b/BoylanRichard/BoylanRichardJ.html">Richard Boylan</a>, ami de Wolf, can stay loyal to his country
  and be so intensely committed to saving the planet. How can these two ideas coincide?" Dr. Wolf sees no intellectual
  contradictions here , he replied. He excels at straddling difficult boundary lines. " Richard Boylan is right.
</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Wolf déclare avoir travaillé dans des laboratoires de la <a href="../../../S-4.html">S-4</a>, et près de la <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/base/Area51">Zone 51</a> où il aurait vécu un moment, ceux de la <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/sc/FTD.html">FTD</a> à la <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB">base aérienne de
  Wright-Patterson</a>, et l'ancien laboratoire de Dulce (near the New Mexico-Colorado border). Wolf also was aware that
  extraterrestrials work with government scientists at Haystack Air Force Laboratory, deep under Haystack Butte at
  Edwards Air Force Base, California. And when the subject was brought up of the complex at Indian Springs Auxiliary Air
  Field near the Nevada Test Site, Wolf quickly responded, "I can't say anything about that."
</p>
<p> Wolf observes that the generals he worked with feel impotent in the face of the overwhelming superiority of
  extraterrestrial technology and mental abilities. Because of those feelings of powerlessness, anathema to military
  officers, the generals had authorized an intense and extensive disinformation campaign (the UFO cover-up), to
  discourage any attempts by civilians to acquire even the limited understanding of extraterrestrials which the generals
  have managed to gain.
</p>
<p> But a far most disturbing revelation from Dr. Wolf concerns the emergence of a renegade group within the military
  and intelligence agencies which comprise the UFO Cover-Up. Wolf has labeled this conspiratorial group of plotters "The
  Cabal". Made up of extremist, fundamentalist, xenophobic, racist, and paranoiac officers, the Cabal fears and hates
  extraterrestrials. And, without any Presidential or Congressional authorization, the Cabal has commandeered Star Wars
  weaponry to shoot down UFOs, taken surviving extraterrestrials prisoner, and attempted to extract information by
  force. A high military officer, who is considered a "friendly" by the Cabal, but who secretly dislikes it, passes on
  information about Cabal planning and activities to Dr. Wolf.
</p>
<p>The Cabal controls some well-known UFO investigators. Wolf said that the director of one major U.S. civilian UFO
  organization "is up to his ass in the Cabal." And he added that another ufologist in Canada "gets paid for taking
  swipes at various UFO researchers." That ufologist's high reputation for UFO research is undeserved, because he was
  getting a stream of leaks and tips from a well-placed official inside the intelligence community. Thus, he knew
  precisely what UFO data to look and ask for. Now that ufologist is getting frequently upset, because his source
  "inside" is no longer available, having recently died.
</p>
<p> As a Presidential consultant, Dr. Wolf has visited Mr. Clinton in his White House private chambers, and even dropped
  the remark that "Mr. and Mrs. Clinton sleep in the same bed", thus scotching rumors to the contrary. When Mr. Clinton
  was visiting Hartford, Connecticut for a Presidential debate, the presidential candidate took a side trip to consult
  with Dr. Wolf. And to this day, Wolf continues to provide advice to the President by encrypted phone and National
  Security Council courier. Possessing some of the highest security clearances, this man is in an extremely-qualified
  position to know what the government knows about UFOs and ETs. He wants to tell President Clinton everything, "But I
  can't; my [NSC] bosses won't let me."
</p>
<p> Wolf says that "<q>President Clinton does not know much about Area 51. And he does not know about S-4</q>", He
  added, "<q>The President has ABOVE TOP SECRET and Need To Know clearances, but does not have the UMBRA ULTRA TOP
    SECRET clearance to have access to upper-level MAJIC [MJ-12] secrets, and KEYSTONE [ET research] documents." </q>
</p>
<p>Like many federal bureaucracies, MJ-12 has tripled in size. Wolf reports, "<q>It now numbers 36 members, including
  [former Secretary of State] Henry Kissinger and [father of the hydrogen bomb] Edward Teller. MJ-12 meets at various
  confidential locations, including the Battelle Memorial Institute [at Columbus, Ohio]."</q> As an aside, Dr. Wolf
  confirmed that it was Dr. Edward Teller who recommended physicist Robert Lazar for his position at the secret S-4
  government base south of Area 51, where Lazar helped on back-engineering the propulsion systems of extraterrestrial
  spacecraft.
</p>
<p>When I asked who was MJ-1, the head of the MJ-12 subcommittee, Dr. Wolf declined to identify that person. He did say,
  "<q>MJ-1 answers to no one, not even the President!"</q> When I offered the surmise that Michael Wolf himself was yet
  another MJ-12 member, he hurriedly pointed out that he "<q>could not disclose such a thing</q>." And when I proposed
  that a notable scientist with a government background, residing in Arizona, was yet another MJ-12 member, Wolf
  responded with an uncharacteristic silence, which I took to mean that he did not contradict that identification.
</p>
<p>Wolf dit connaître le Dr. <span class="people">Hal Puthoff</span> (dont les recherches incluent l'énergie de point
  zéro, qui pourrait remplacer le pétrole pour fournir une source propre de l'énergie du monde), et avoir travaillé sur
  des recherches concernant la vision à distance pour le gouvernement au même moment où Puthoff le faisait au <a
      href="/org/us/university/stanford/sri">SRI</a>. Darrell McMillan of the Union of Concerned Scientists is another
  scientist Wolf says he knows, as is Stephen Hawking, the British theoretical astrophysicist.
</p>
<p> the recent movie Peacemaker : <q>The women in that movie was based on a real person I worked with, Dr. Jessica Stern
  of the National Security Council</q>." And, of course, he has met Edward Teller. Wolf characterized Teller as "a
  nuclear humbug", referring to Teller's deception of making a presentation to President Reagan about an X-ray <a
      href="../../../LASER.html">laser</a> Star Wars weapon as almost operational, when in fact the system had never
  been tested, and was subsequently discarded as impossible by other Lawrence Livermore Laboratory scientists.
</p>
<p> Another UFO notable with whom Wolf is familiar is Admiral <a href="/people/i/InmanRobertRay.html">Bobby Ray
  Inman</a>, former head of NSA, and currently chairman of Science Applications International Corporation. SAIC was
  identified by USAF Colonel Steve Wilson as the company which makes antigravity engines for U.S.-copycat UFOs. When I
  commented to Dr. Wolf that USAF Colonel Wilson had identified Inman as also in charge of Decision Science Applications
  Inc. (DSAI), (made up of the heads of corporations involved in classified military weapons development based on ET
  technology,) Wolf commented that <q>Inman doesn't know as much as the UFO community thinks he does. He doesn't know
    everything that DSAI is up to.</q></p>
<p>Wolf also verified that the former head of the Air Force Special Forces' <a
    href="../../../detection/projet/Pounce.html">Project Pounce</a> [UFO retrievals unit], Colonel Steve Wilson, and Air
  Force Technical Sergeant/NSA analyst Dan Sherman, assigned to an NSA unit conducting telepathic communications with
  the ETs, are who they say they are.
</p>
<p> Dr. Wolf provided a revisionist history about the beginning of the modern UFO era. <q>Le 1er ovni tomba en 1941 dans
  l'océan à l'Ouest de San Diego, et fut récupéré par la Marine</q>. La <a href="/org/us/dod/navy">Marine</a> has held a
  leadership position in UFO matters ever since. Un crash d'ovni plus célèbre suivit en <time>1947</time>, au Nord-Ouest
  de Roswell (Nouveau Mexique), et fut récupéré par les Army Air Corps, comme la rapporté le colonel <a
      href="../../c/CorsoPhilipJ">Corso</a> dans son livre, <em>Le jour après Roswell</em>. Dr. Wolf confirms the truth
  of Corso's disclosures, and added that LED (light-emitting diodes) and superconductivity are among the technologies
  which came from Roswell. The U.S. was in possession of a Grey, dubbed "EBE" [Extraterrestrial Biological Entity", from
  1948 until he died in 1953. Government scientists first communicated with him using pictographs. About Corso's book's
  alien-threat tone, Wolf commented that <q>it was co-author William Birnes who did the anti-alien gloss on Corso's
    manuscript,</q> and that Colonel Corso did not personally view the extraterrestrials as enemy invaders.
</p>
<p>Within months of the Roswell UFO crash, the Army Air Corps became the Air Force; the National Security Act was passed
  (partly to deal with the extraordinary secrecy the Administration felt UFOs required); and the CIA was created.
</p>
<p>He personally pioneered a mental-expansion process he called "the Gateway Treatment", which "<q>allows utilization of
  a vastly-increased percentage of the brain, in order for humans to mentally engage the extraterrestrials in full
  telepathic mental exchange."</q> The Treatment involves <q>"a way of opening the brain up, a way to stimulate the
  neurons. It allows billions of synapses to form." </q></p>
<p>Another project Wolf was involved in was subatomic-particle physics research. Discoveries by Wolf were <q>"utilized
  by my [Ph.D. dissertation-advising] professor to develop the neutral particle-beam weapon for the Star Wars
  program." </q></p>
<p> Drawing on information from his work in genetics research, Dr. Wolf revealed that the entire human genome has been
  mapped secretly by government scientists. (This contradicts current government press releases, which describe the
  completion date as early in the next century.) He says that he has found an extraterrestrial marker gene in some
  humans' genetic samples. Other humans do not have these ET marker genes. He went on to say, "I have found non-coding
  [extraterrestrial] genetic sequence genes in my own genetic material, more than the In-Betweens have. [The In-Betweens
  is Wolf's term for humans with hybrid ET-human genetics, due to ET intervention with their parents' reproductive
  material before the human was born.] Wolf revealed that he has been around a research project where government
  scientists created human-extraterrestrial hybrids, attempting to replicate ET genetic engineering.
</p>
<p> He explained the harvesting of tissue from so-called cattle mutilations "is to prepare organelles to adapt to human
  bodies, to filter out particulates that are killing us, as we pollute our planet." He said, <q>"The
    'Betweens'(human-ET hybrids) will help us, and will bring the organelles." </q></p>
<p> The ETs have other concerns, too. They discussed God and death with Wolf. And they pointed out that all worlds are
  connected. "One Hiroshima atomic bomb can affect millions of cultures in the galaxy."And they told him, "Thought is
  energy. It doesn't stop at a galactic 'barrier', and is received on other worlds." Because of what he learned, Wolf
  stated, <q>"We are at a crossroads. The issue is to give a viable future to our children."</q> He notes, <q>"Humans
    are beginning to change, to evolve, and are looking for spiritual roots. There is more to God than people get in
    church." </q></p>
<p>A fourth ultra-secret project, mentioned in Wolf's book, was a Department of Defense project having to do with
  cloning a human being, in order to create the perfect soldier who would obey orders without question. A General
  "Bunting" was in charge of that project. The clone turned out to have been born with ethical thinking, and intuitively
  knew that life was sacred. When the clone disobeyed a test order to kill an innocent dog, Wolf says that "the project
  officer ordered the clone 'terminated'.It was my judgment that the clone had a soul. So, instead, I blew up the
  building [containing the clone project]", and surreptitiously allowed the clone to escape.
</p>
<p>Naturally, Wolf keeps aware of significant individuals and developments within the civilian UFO-investigation
  community. One such figure is former Army Command Sergeant-Major Robert Dean, who was assigned to NATO Headquarters in
  the 1960s. There Dean read NATO's secret Assessment of extraterrestrials. Wolf states that he "has seen that same
  Assessment." Dr. Wolf also revealed that "the NSA and CIA regularly provide the members of MJ-12 with tapes of major
  meetings of civilian UFO groups," for example, MUFON conferences. Some other notable UFO investigators who have talked
  with Dr. Wolf include Robert Bletchman, James Courant, <span class="people">Linda Moulton Howe</span>, William
  Hamilton, <span class="people">Michael Hesemann</span> and Dr. <span class="people">Steven Greer</span>.
</p>
<p>Some years ago documents were leaked purporting to constitute a Presidential Briefing for Jimmy Carter on
  extraterrestrial matters. Dr. Wolf affirmed that the information contained therein <q>"is substantially true, but one
    page was missing from the leaked set. That page describes an individual of joint ET-human heritage, who emerged 2000
    years ago to try to end human violence."</q> When I proposed that the page was referring to Jesus, Wolf confirmed
  that identification.
</p>
<p> Dr. Wolf describes various extraterrestrial races. "<q>One race has orange skin, very large heads and large dark
  eyes with no irises or whites, and six-fingered hands. During dissection their brains have been found to have four
  brain lobes, different optic orbs and nerves, and a sponge-like digestive system. ET brains are more developed and
  connected, and have no corpus callosum."</q> He also described a race dubbed the Semitics, of average height and a
  generally human-like appearance, except for their very large hooked nose. <q>"This was the race which landed at
    Holloman Air Force Base, [New Mexico, in the Sixties], and conversed with some generals there."</q> Wolf also
  described a very human-appearing race called the Nordics. He said, <q>"The Semitics and Nordics come from Altair 4 and
    5 and from the Pleiades." </q></p>
<p>He noted, The extraterrestrials eat vegetation and mushrooms, and have different requirements. They absorb energy
  from the air and [certain] particulates. They don't absorb enough water to need to void; they process thoroughly."
  Wolf said that "cattle mutilations" tissue harvesting is not related to cloning, but rather is done to acquire
  nutrients for the hybrid fetuses the ETs create. Dr. Wolf noted that embryonic fluid contains an anti-rejection
  factor. He is aware that not all cattle tissue harvesting is done by extraterrestrials; some is done by Special Forces
  teams.
</p>
<p>Crop circles "<q>were originated by extraterrestrials, and then badly copied by the military, using <a
    href="../../../SDI.html">Strategic Defense Initiative</a> weapons emitting a <a href="../../../LASER.html">laser</a>
  pulsed beam."</q> Wolf noted that "<q>with crop circles made by ETs, the plants were still live and grew, [after being
  bent into pictographic patterns.] With SDI-weapon crop circles, the plants die. These SDI weapons are operated from a
  secret base in the Himalayas." </q><br/> <br/> Concerning extraterrestrial contact, Dr. Wolf stated that the ET race
  commonly referred to as Zeta Reticulans, or Greys, have engaged in diplomatic negotiations with the U.S. Government.
  When I asked him which extraterrestrial races he worked with in government labs, he pointed out that the two
  illustrations on the covers of his book Catchers of Heaven are actual photographs of extraterrestrials taken by an
  Admiral friend of his. The ET on the front cover is named K*L*T, (which Wolf phoneticizes to Kolta for convenience),
  is the extraterrestrial with whom Wolf has met most frequently, and is a Zeta Grey. The ET on the back cover is a
  human-appearing Pleiadean named Anon [Prince] Sa Ra.
</p>
<p>In the course of his close association with extraterrestrials in scientific laboratories, Dr. Wolf was given a piece
  of extraterrestrial alloy by them. This alloy looked like melted silicon and has peculiar energy properties. It is
  99.99% silicon, and .01% non-Earth isotopes. When he placed it in water and drank the water, it provided healthful
  benefits.
</p>
<p> Wolf is convinced that it was psychotronic directed-energy devices which were directed by rogue elements within the
  UFO Cover-Up organization at certain UFO researchers pushing very strongly to end the UFO Cover-Up. These include: the
  Director of Committee for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI), Steven Greer, MD, his principal
  assistant, Shari Adamiak, Congressman Steve Schiff, who demanded UFO documents from the Air Force, and USAF Col. Steve
  Wilson, who revealed his heading Project Pounce, the UFO retrieval unit. Already Colonel Wilson and Shari Adamiak have
  died of their cancers, and Congressman Schiff has had to terminate his political career. Now Dr. Wolf has received a
  medical report which suggests a possibility that he may have cancer. It is not yet clear whether he will still have
  access to a certain extraterrestrial honey-like substance, which he took several years ago for his metastasized colon
  cancer, and which brought that episode into remission.
</p>
<p> Concerning the famous 1947 Roswell UFO crash, Wolf states that <q>"it was actual two UFOs which collided in
  midair</q>" during an intense electrical storm. "<q>One contained Orange ETs and the other Greys.</q>" One
  crash-landed near Corona, northwest of Roswell; the other crashed onto the Plains of San Agustin, over a hundred miles
  to the west. Army Intelligence units soon secured both sites and removed the craft and their mostly-dead ET crews.
</p>
<p> Another later ET-military encounter recounted by Dr. Wolf was similarly grim. <q>"An extraterrestrial on the ground
  had traveled from Fort Dix, New Jersey to [adjacent] McGuire Air Force Base, where he died on the tarmac." </q></p>
<p>Michael Wolf worked in several projects, making discoveries with which in hindsight he now regrets being involved. He
  particularly had misgivings after he saw what applications these discoveries were put to. He says he now "has immense
  qualms about those misapplications", repudiates them and is repentant for them.
</p>
<p> Lorsque Wolf s'engage dans des études subventionnées par le gouvernement pour sa maîtrise à l'Université McGill, il
  entame une recherche sur les neurotransmetteurs et leur rôle dans le fonctionnement et le contrôle mental. Parmis les
  projets secrets sur lequel Wolf travaille se trouvent la "vision à distance", un terme militaire/de renseignement pour
  la <a href="/science/para/psi/pes/claivoyance">clairvoyance</a> appliquée. Il dira, <q>99 % de la recherche sur la
    télépathie et la vision à distance est classée secret.</q> Wolf ira plus loin que les simples expériences <a
      href="/science/para/psi">psi</a> du Renseignement Militaire du Général Bert Stubblebine, du colonel <a
      href="../../a/AlexanderJohnB">John Alexander</a> et du Major Ed Dames, en développant des techniques d'extraction
  et suppression de souvenirs. Some of his findings "were later incorporated into the infamous MK-ULTRA mind control
  projects of the CIA, and used on captured KGB agents [to extract information]." He also worked in research on
  dolphins, which he called "<q>a highly-intelligent alien lifeform on this planet."</q></p>
<p> While Dr. Wolf was studying at MIT for his Ph.D. in physics, he "<q>discovered a new theory of wave-particle
  duality, which led to the development of the neutral particle-beam Star Wars weapon."</q> Because of these classified
  projects, his NSC bosses forbade him to identify his dissertation advisor professors, and MIT and McGill are forbidden
  to acknowledge that he studied there.
</p>
<p> Having access to NSA and CIA information, Dr. Wolf revealed some secrets that he was notinvolved in. One, among the
  ugliest aspects of the Viet Nam War, was the U.S.'s Project Arc Light, "the bombing of already shot-down B-52s with
  Hellfire incendiary bombs, totally incinerating any survivor crewmen, in order to destroy the secret documents carried
  on the B-52s." President Bill Clinton told Michael Wolf that he learned about Project Arc Light while a student in
  England, and that it had deepened his opposition to the Viet Nam War.
</p>
<p> Wolf also learned that the assassination of President Kennedy involved multiple parties and interests. "<q>Many
  Cuban expatriates hated Kennedy for the Bay of Pigs invasion's failure. The Mafia hated JFK because of his brother,
  Attorney-General Robert Kennedy,'s relentless prosecutions of high-level mobsters. Hard-liners in CIA hated Kennedy,
  because he wanted to pull the U.S. out of an escalating war in Viet Nam, and because he wanted the CIA to disclose UFO
  information." </q></p>
<p> Wolf disclosed that famed scientist "<q>Albert Einstein had contact with extraterrestrial intelligence.</q>" And
  that a more recent understanding of Zero-Point energy "<q>has to do with a white hole-black hole scenario."</q> The
  ETs told Wolf that the Void is filled with energy to be tapped. Wolf further stated that experiments by the U.S.
  Government using exotic technology "ripped holes in time."
</p>
<p>Wolf worked briefly on assignment to the Mossad. He commented that <q>"The Mossad [an Israeli intelligence
  organization] has very good relationships with the extraterrestrials." </q></p>
<p>Dr. Strecker's published research report, identifying HIV/AIDS as caused by a manmade virus, was correct according to
  Dr. Wolf. Furthermore, the government has learned that viruses are crystalline in structure, and that the correct
  frequency can destroy them.
</p>
<p>Wolf also reported, "<q>President Clinton has had a briefing on the Aurora [SR-33A] space plane </q>," which operates
  out of Area 51. The Aurora <q>"runs on liquid <a href="/science/discipline/hard/nat/mat/chim/mol/methane">methane</a>,
    and has antigravity on board,"</q> [information identical to what retired Air Force Colonel Donald Ware also passed
  on to this writer from a three-star general.] Wolf says that the Aurora goes the Stealth planes one better. <q>"It
    carries an electro-magnetic-pulse weapons system on board, which can knock out tracking radar."</q> He also
  disclosed, "<q>It can go to the Moon!</q>" And added a tantalizing further hint, <q>"The U.S. has 'something' on Mars
    [besides the Rover]."</q> <br/> <br/> Wolf also revealed that the U.S. government is working on prototypes of
  extraterrestrial antigravity discs. He says that the extraterrestrials traverse the galaxy by manipulating space and
  time to pull their destination towards them. <q>"Time is reduced to zero, and acceleration is increased to
    infinity.</q>" And that the military are experimenting on having pilots use their mind to guide an advanced plane.
  Some government scientists found that "<q>some UFOs are living conveyances, and can divide and re-form.</q>" Those
  "living conveyances" are apparently also responsive to thought commands.

<p> Wolf disclosed an incident on the Carribean island of Puerto Rico, that occurred during the Bush Administration.<q>
  "A UFO piloted by extraterrestrials, with F-16 fighter escort overhead, landed in a Puerto Rican community in 1990.
  The purpose of this exercise was to test the public reaction of a select portion of the American people.</q>" (Puerto
  Rico is U.S. territory.) The Mayor of the community contacted President Bush, excitedly told the President that <q>"extraterrestrials
    got out of the ship and walked around,"</q> and asked Bush what he should say to his citizens. Bush referred the
  inquiry to Dr. Wolf at MJ-12 to formulate a response for the mayor.

<p> Concerning the U.S. government's slow pace of disclosure about UFO reality, Wolf commented, <q>"The government is
  doing a balancing act, because if Free [Zero-Point] Energy and all the ET technology come out all at once, it'd hurt
  the stockholders [in obsolescent industries]. The multinational corporations don't want to lose their power."</q> The
  last time Wolf heard a timetable from the government for frank disclosure of UFO reality was somewhere in the period
  of 2001-2005.

<p>To this end he has directed that all royalties from his books go to the Daniel Wolf Memorial Foundation For Children,
  Inc., a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization. He says, "<q>The children are the future.</q>" He looks forward to when the
  secrecy about extraterrestrial contact with Earth is stripped away, so that we, our children and grandchildren can
  move forward to the next phase of our history, now cosmic in scale.
