<h2><a id="Triangle"></a>Triangle maudit ?</h2>
<p>Le "triangle du diable" est région du nord de l'océan atlantique où un certain nombre d'appareils et de navires ont
  disparu dans des circonstances réputées inhabituelles. Certaines de ces disparitions ont été attribuées par la culture
  populaire au paranormal, à une suspension des lois de la physique ou une activité extraterrestre.</p>

          <li>17 U.S.S. CYCLOPS - This is one of the classic Bermuda Triangle disappearances. Volumes have been written
            about this vessel, and the more that come to light, the more confusing and mysterious it becomes. Two of her
            sister ships the PROTEUS and the NEREUS disappeared on almost the same route in 1941. The loss of those two
            ships was overshadowed by the onset of World War II. Click here for a list of the 21 officers and 285
            enlisted men officially listed as dead on June 14th, 1918.The ironclad steamer KICKAPOO carried the name
            CYCLOPS from 15 June to 10 August 1869, then was renamed KEWAYDIN.The second Cyclops, a collier, was
            launched 7 May 1910 by William Cramp and Sons, Philadelphia, Pa., and placed in service 7 November 1910, G.
            W. Worley, Master, Navy Auxiliary Service, in charge. Operating with the Naval Auxiliary Service, Atlantic
            Fleet, the collier voyaged in the Baltic during May to July 1911 to supply 2d Division ships. Returning to
            Norfolk, she operated on the east coast from Newport to the Caribbean servicing the fleet. During the
            troubled conditions in Mexico in 1914 and 1915, she coaled ships on patrol there and received the thanks of
            the State Department for cooperation in bringing refugees from Tampico to New Orleans. With American entry
            into World War I, Cyclops was commissioned 1 May l917, Lieutenant Commander G. W. Worley in command. She
            joined a convoy for St. Nazaire, France, in June 1917, returning to the east coast in July. Except for a
            voyage to Halifax, Nova Scotia, she served along the east coast until 9 January 1918 when she was assigned
            to Naval Overseas Transportation Service. She then sailed to Brazilian waters to fuel British ships in the
            south Atlantic, receiving the thanks of the State Department and Commander-in-Chief, Pacific. She put to sea
            from Rio de Janiero 16 February 1918 and after touching at Barbados on 3 and 4 March, was never heard from
            again.Her loss with all 306 crew and passengers, without a trace, is one of the sea's unsolved
            mysteries. </li>

          <li>5 FLIGHT 19 - Five Grumman TBM Avenger Torpedo Bombers. - At about 2:10 p.m. on the afternoon of 5
            December 1945, Flight 19, consisting of five TBM Avenger Torpedo Bombers departed from the U. S. Naval Air
            Station, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on an authorized advanced overwater navigational training flight. They
            were to execute navigation problem No. 1, which is as follows: (1) depart 26 degrees 03 minutes north and 80
            degrees 07 minutes west and fly 091 degrees (T) distance 56 miles to Hen and Chickens Shoals to conduct low
            level bombing, after bombing continue on course 091 degrees (T) for 67 miles, (2) fly course 346 degrees (T)
            distance 73 miles and (3) fly course 241 degrees (T) distance 120 miles, then returning to U. S. Naval Air
            Station, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In charge of the flight was a senior qualified flight instructor,
            piloting one of the planes. The other planes were piloted by qualified pilots with between 350 and 400 hours
            flight time of which at least 55 was in TBM type aircraft. The weather over the area covered by the track of
            the navigational problem consisted of scattered rain showers with a ceiling of 2500 feet within the showers
            and unlimited outside the showers, visibility of 6-8 miles in the showers, 10-12 otherwise. Surface winds
            were 20 knots with gusts to 31 knots. The sea was moderate to rough. The general weather conditions were
            considered average for training flights of this nature except within showers. A radio message intercepted at
            about 4 p.m. was the first indication that Flight 19 was lost. This message, believed to be between the
            leader on Flight 19 and another pilot in the same flight, indicated that the instructor was uncertain of his
            position and the direction of the Florida coast. The aircraft also were experiencing malfunction of their
            compasses. Attempts to establishcommunications on the training frequency were unsatisfactory due to
            interference from Cuba broadcasting stations, static, and atmospheric conditions. All radio contact was lost
            before the exact nature of the trouble or the location of the flight could be determined. Indications are
            that the flight became lost somewhere east of the Florida peninsula and was unable to determine a course to
            return to their base. The flight was never heard from again and no trace of the planes were ever found. It
            is assumed that they made forced landings at sea, in darkness somewhere east of the Florida peninsula,
            possibly after running out of gas. It is known that the fuel carried by the aircraft would have been
            completely exhausted by 8 p.m. The sea in that presumed area was rough and unfavorable for a water landing.
            It is also possible that some unexpected and unforeseen development of weather conditions may have
            intervened although there is no evidence of freak storms in the area at the time. All available facilities
            in the immediate area were used in an effort to locate the missing aircraft and help them return to base.
            These efforts were not successful. No trace of the aircraft was ever found even though an extensive search
            operation was conducted until the evening of 10 December 1945, when weather conditions deteriorated to the
            point where further efforts became unduly hazardous. Sufficient aircraft and surface vessels were utilized
            to satisfactorily cover those areas in which survivors of Flight 19 could be presumed to be located. One
            search aircraft was lost during the operation. A PBM patrol plane which was launched at approximately 7:30
            p.m., 5 December 1945, to search for the missing TBM's. This aircraft was never seen nor heard from after
            take-off. Based upon a report from a merchant ship off Fort Lauderdale which sighted a "burst of flame,
            apparently an explosion, and passed through on oil slick at a time and place which matched the presumed
            location of the PBM, it is believed this aircraft exploded at sea and sank at approximately 28.59 N; 80.25
            W. No trace of the plane or its crew was ever found. </li>

          <li>21 SCORPION, USN SUBMARINE -Number SSN 589, Skipjack class. This was the sixth Scorpion. It was laid down
            on August 20th,1958, at Groton, Connecticut at the General Dynamics Corp. Electric Boat Division. The
            Scorpion launched on the 19th of December, 1959. The ship was sponsored by Mrs. Elizabeth S. Morrison and
            was commissioned on July 29th, 1960 under Commander Norman B. Bessac.The Scorpion displaced 3,075 tons on
            the surface and 3,500 tons when submerged. The ships beam was 31' 7" and it's length was 251' 9". The
            armament consisted of 6 torpedo tubes with a payload of ?? torpedoesAssigned to Submarine Squadron 6,
            Division 62, Scorpion departed New London, Conn., on 24 August for a two-month deployment in European
            waters. During that period, she participated in exercises with units of the 6th Fleet and of other NATO
            [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] navies. After returning to New England in late October, she trained
            along the eastern seaboard until May 1961, then crossed the Atlantic again for operations which took her
            into the summer. On 9 August, she returned to New London and, a month later, shifted to Norfolk, Va. With
            Norfolk her home port for the remainder of her career, Scorpion specialized in the development of nuclear
            submarine warfare tactics. Varying her role from hunter to hunted, she participated in exercises which
            ranged along the Atlantic coast and in the Bermuda and Puerto Rican operating areas; then, from June 1963 to
            May 1964, she interrupted her operations for an overhaul at Charleston, S.C. Resuming duty off the eastern
            seaboard in late spring, she again interrupted that duty from 4 August to 8 October to make a transatlantic
            patrol. In the spring of 1965, she conducted a similar patrol in European waters.During the late winter and
            early spring of 1966, and again in the fall, she was deployed for special operations. Following the
            completion of those assignments, her commanding officer received the Navy Commendation Medal for outstanding
            leadership, foresight, and professional skill. Other Scorpion officers and men were cited for meritorious
            achievement.On 1 February 1967, Scorpion entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for another extended overhaul.
            In late October, she commenced refresher training and weapons system acceptance tests. Following type
            training out of Norfolk, she got underway on 15 February 1968 for a Mediterranean deployment. She operated
            with the 6th Fleet, into May, and then headed west for home. On 21 May, she indicated her position to be
            about 50 miles south of the Azores. Six days later, she was reported overdue at Norfolk. A search was
            initiated, but, on 5 June, Scorpion and her crew were declared "presumed lost." Her name was struck from the
            Navy list on 30 June.The search continued, however; and, at the end of October, the Navy's oceanographic
            research ship, Mizar (T-AGOR-11) located sections of Scorpion's hull in more than 10,000 feet of water about
            400 miles southwest of the Azores. Subsequently, the Court of Inquiry was reconvened and other vessels,
            including the submersible Trieste were dispatched to the scene and collected a myriad of pictures and other
            data.Although the cause of her loss is still not ascertainable, the most probable event was the inadvertent
            activation of the battery of a Mark 37 torpedo during a torpedo inspection. The torpedo, in a fully ready
            condition and without a propeller guard, then began a live "hot run" within the tube. Released from the
            tube, the torpedo became fully armed and successfully engaged its nearest target, Scorpion. Alternatively,
            the torpedo may have exploded in the tube owing to an uncontrollable fire in the torpedo room.The
            explosion--recorded elsewhere as a very loud acoustic event--broke the boat into two major pieces, with the
            forward hull section, including the torpedo room and most of the operations compartment, creating one impact
            trench while the aft section, including the reactor compartment and engine room, created a second impact
            trench. The sail is detached and lies nearby in a large debris field.Owing to the pressurized-water nuclear
            reactor in the engine room, deep ocean radiological monitoring operations were conducted in August and
            September 1986. The site had been previously monitored in 1968 and 1979 and none of the samples obtained
            showed any evidence of release of radioactivity. </li>
