    <td colspan="7"><p>REMARKS</p>
      <ol>
        <li>On 2 Sept 80, SOURCE related on 8 Aug 80, three Security Policemen assigned to 1608 SPS, KAFB, NM, on duty
          inside the Manzano Weapons Storage Area sighted an unidentified light in the air that traveled from North to
          South over the Coyote Canyon area of the Department of Defense Restricted Test Range on KAFB, NM. The Security
          Policemen identified as: SSGT STEPHEN FERENZ, Area Supervisor, ATC MARTIN W. RIST and AMN ANTHONY D. FRAZIER,
          were later interviewed separately by SOURCE and all three related the same statement; at approximately 2350
          hrs., while on duty in Charlie Sector, East Side of Manzano, the three observed a very bright light in the sky
          approximately 3 miles North-North East of their position. The light traveled with great speed and stopped
          suddenly in the sky over Coyote Canyon. The three first thought the object was a helicopter, however, after
          observing the strange aerial maneuvers (stop and go), they felt a helicopter couldn't have performed such
          skills. The light landed in the Coyote Canyon area. Sometime later, three witnessed the light take off and
          leave proceeding straight up at a high speed and disappear.</li>
        <li>Central Security Control (CSC) inside Manzano, contacted Sandia Security, who conducts frequent building
          checks on two alarmed structures in area. They advised that a patrol was already in the area and would
          investigate.</li>
        <li>On 11 Aug 80, RUSS CURTIS, Sandia Security, advised that on 9 Aug 80, a Sandia Security Guard, (who wishes
          his name not be divulged for fear of harassment), related the following: At approximately 0020 hrs., he was
          driving east on the Coyote Canyon access road on a routine building check of an alarmed structure. As he
          approached the structure he observed a bright light near the ground behind the structure. He also observed an
          object he first thought was a helicopter. But after driving closer, he observed a round disk shaped object. He
          attempted to radio for backup patrol but his radio would not work. As he approached the object on foot armed
          with a shotgun, the object took off in a vertical direction at a high rate of speed. The guard was a former
          helicopter mechanic in the U.S. Army and stated the object he observed was not a helicopter. </li>
        <li> SOURCE advised on 22 Aug 80, three other security policemen observed the same aerial phenomena described by
          the first three. Again the object landed in Coyote Canyon. They did not see the object take off.</li>
        <li> Coyote Canyon is part of a large restricted test range used by the Air Force Weapons Laboratory, Sandia
          Laboratories, Defense Nuclear Agency and the Department of Energy. The range was formerly patrolled by Sandia
          Security, however, they only conduct building checks there now.</li>
        <li>On 10 Aug 80, a New Mexico State Patrolman sighted an aerial object land in the Manzano's between Belen and
          Albuquerque, NM. The Patrolman reported the sighting to the Kirtland AFB Command Post, who later referred the
          patrolman to the AFOSI Dist 17. AFOSI Dist 17 advised the patrolman to make a report through his own agency.
          On 11 Aug 80, the Kirtland Public Information office advised the patrolman the USAF no longer investigates
          such sighting unless they occur on a USAF base.</li>
        <li> WRITER contacted all the agencies who utilized the test range and it was learned no aerial tests are
          conducted in the Coyote Canyon area. Only ground test are conducted.</li>
        <li>On 8 Sept 80, WRITER learned from Sandia Security that another Security guard observed a object land near an
          alarmed structure sometime during the first week of August, but did not report it until just recently for fear
          of harassment.</li>
        <li>The two alarmed structures located within the area contain HQ CR 44 material.</li>

    <td colspan="7"><p> REMARKS </p>
      <ol>
        <li>On 13 Aug 80, 1960 COMMSq Maintenance Officer reported Radar Approach Control equipment and scanner radar
          inoperative due to high frequency jamming from an unknown cause. Total blackout of entire radar approach
          system to include Albuquerque Airport was in effect between 1630-2215 hrs. Radar Approach Control back up
          system also were inoperative. </li>
        <li>On 13 Aug 80, Defense Nuclear Agency Radio Frequency Monitors determined, by vector analysis, the
          interference was being sent from an area (V-90 degrees or due East). On DAF map coordinates E-28.6. The area
          was located NW of Coyote Canyon Test area. It was first thought that Sandia Laboratory, which utilizes the
          test range was responsible. However, after a careful check, it was later determined that no test were being
          conducted in the canyon area. Department of Energy, Air Force Weapons Laboratory and DNA were contacted but
          assured that their agencies were not responsible. </li>
        <li> On 13 Aug 80, Base Security Police conducted a physical check of the area but because of the mountainous
          terrain, a thorough check could not be completed at that time. A later foot search failed to disclose anything
          that could have caused the interference.</li>
        <li>On 13 Aug 80, at 2216 hrs., all radar equipment returned to normal operation without further incident.</li>
        <li>CONCLUSION: The presence of hostile intelligence jamming cannot be ruled out. Although no evidence would
          suggest this, the method has been used in the past. Communication maintenance specialists cannot explain how
          such interference could cause the radar equipment to become totally inoperative. Neither could they suggest
          the type or range of the interference signal. DNA frequency monitors reporeted the interference beam was wide
          spread and a type unknown to their electronical equipment. Further checks of the area was being conducted by
          Technical Services, AFOSI.</li>
        <li>High command interest item. Briefings requested IAW AFOSIR 124-4 be completed at HQ AFOSI/IVOE. HQ CR 44 and
          51 items.</li>

        <li>Subject Negatives/Film were analyzed by HQ IVT and 7602 AINTELG, it and the following results were found:
          <ol type="a">
            <li value="a">A. Negative #1: Deplicting C-5A aircraft on approach and streaking unidentified aerial object
              in lower right portion of film. Film found to be unaltered. Size differential was not consistent with size
              of aircraft. Conclusion: Inconclusive </li>
            <li>B. Negative #2: Deplicting cylinder shaped unidentified aerial object in upper left portion of photo.
              Film found to be unaltered. Film showed object to be consistent with field depth and consistent with
              relative size of fixed objects. Conclusion: Legitimate negative of unidentified aerial object.
              Bolton/Reinfeld method did not reveal visible markings on object. </li>
            <li>C. Negative #3: Deplicting irregular shaped unidentified aerial object in seven frames of 8MM film.
              Because of the size and apparent speed of object no further classification or conclusion could be drawn.
              Film shown to be unaltered. </li>
            <li>D. 34 inches of 8MM film: Deplicting apparent colored object moving in front of still camera. Film found
              to be unaltered. Spectrography revealed colors to be basic prism features. Depth analysis revealed object
              to be within 152MM of camera. Object was not consistent with relative size of fixed objects observed for
              several seconds in film. Conclusion: inconclusive. </li>
            <li>E. Original Negative Deplicting Unidentified Object: Film found to be unaltered. Because of a lack of
              fixed objects in the film, no depth analysis could be performed. Bolton, Reinfeld method revealed object
              to be saucer shaped, approximate diameter 37 feet. Object contained a trilateral insignia on the lower
              portion of object. Conclusion: Legitimate negative of unidentified aerial object. </li>
