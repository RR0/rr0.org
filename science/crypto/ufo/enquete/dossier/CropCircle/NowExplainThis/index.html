<p>Despite the disinformation campaign performed by the British government to quell public interest in crop circles in
  <time>1990</time>, the formations continued to appear throughout southern England in greater numbers, larger dimensions and
  intricate designs. The first set of 'insectograms' appeared in the field next to Stonehenge, seemingly undetected by
  the ever-vigilant security teams. Several sets of pictograms involving 'keys' also manifested in the now legendary
  Alton Barnes area. One was a staggering 360 feet long.</p>
<p>Then came even more bizarre shapes- dolphinograms, six-pointed stars, threefold dumb-bells and other strange symbols.
  In one surveillance operation an entire field was rigged with perimeter laser alarms, super-sensitive microphones and
  overhead cameras. In the middle of the night a fine mist descended over the field. When morning broke, a perfect crop
  circle lay in the field and none of the sensitive equipment was triggered. It literally materialized out of thin
  air.</p>
<p>During the summer of <time>1991</time> some 600 new crop circles appeared. One of the most celebrated cases involved the British
  Prime Minister's country residence. This location, consisting of several dozen acres, is guarded against terrorist
  attack by Britain's most expert crack troops. It is a maximum security zone patrolled 24-hours a day. Yet despite
  these precautions, a Celtic cross design appeared in a field in from of John Major's house, one of the circles
  transformed into an arrow pointing directly at the residence. The media were quick to ask the Prime Minister if a
  serious breach of security had taken place. "No," he replied, "it was all merely the result of poor soil
  conditions."</p>

<p>This was the summer when serious contamination of formations began to take place. Some of the hoaxing was done by
  pranksters looking for attention, some by mischief makers. But, more sinisterly, it was also carried out by known
  government infiltrators who purposely added man-made features to genuine formations in a attempt to throw the
  researchers into total confusion. At the height of the hoaxing, an American tourist etched out huge letters on the
  side of a hill, 'Talk to us'. A reply came back a few days later when a most bizarre-looking formation resembling
  Hebrew script appeared at Milk Hill. Thought to be a hoax at first but since confirmed to be genuine, it was
  deciphered as a form of post-Augustan Latin and etched in Freemasonic script, creating two words: OPPONO ASTOS&shy; "I
  oppose acts of craft and cunning." How appropriate given the circumstances. To this day this formation represents the
  closest the Circlemakers have come to communicating in recognizable script.</p>
<p>Then on the morning of July 11 the British tabloids announced, 'NOW EXPLAIN THIS!'</p>
<p>At the foot of a Neolithic hill fort named Barbury Castle lay an enormous design, some 12,000 sq. yards in area.
  Local residents had reported mysterious lights the night before, accompanied by a loud rumble more intense and
  prolonged than thunder. A nearby town had also reported total loss of power, and its military base scrambled all
  helicopters. In the morning, the military sealed off all access roads, citing 'military exercise' as an excuse
  (incidentally, Salisbury Plain, which lies barely twenty miles further south, is a sealed-off military area of several
  thousand acres where the military always conduct their exercises. It is unheard of for them to seal off civilian areas
  in peace time).</p>
<p>One thing was certain- the government's official line that this phenomenon was a manifestation of mini-tornadoes was
  now seriously ill. For here was an unmistakable symbol, a design that is perhaps one of the most important in Hermetic
  philosophy (<em>top of page, centre</em>). It is a cosmic law, a collection of numeric, musical and geometrical
  harmonies which founded the prevailing order in every ancient civilization. It is literally a depiction of the realm
  of God: it embodies the principle of the Three In One- the Father, son and Holy Ghost, with the Godhead at the centre;
  it is representational of the cosmic egg, symbol of creation where the three elements- mercury, sulphur and ether- are
  given substance by the breath of God and made into matter. The central circle contains the total area of the
  surrounding three circles. The sum of all circular areas comes to 31,680 sq. feet which, 3168 being the gematrian
  number representing Lord Jesus Christ. The same number was also revered by pagan religions as the number of the
  highest principle- the Creator.</p>

<p>A month later, yet another unmistakable symbol appeared, this time at the opposite end of the country near Cambridge
  University. It was a replica of a Mandelbrot Set, an important element of chaos theory which was discovered by Benoit
  Mandelbrot who, ironically, had taught at Cambridge. Even more coincidental was that this crop circle had appeared one
  year to the day when a lead article in New Scientist Magazine had admitted that it was impossible to draw this diagram
  without a computer.</p>
<p>Then, as if on cue, Today newspaper announced, 'THE MEN THAT CONNED THE WORLD'.</p>
<p>An article described how two elderly - and presumably extremely active - pensioners had made all the crop circles.
  Doug and Dave had sneaked out under cover of darkness, without either of their wives suspecting for 15 years, and
  constructed all the circles with a plank of wood, a rope and a baseball cap fitted with a ludicrous apparatus to,
  supposedly, help them construct straight lines in the dark by aligning the sight with distant objects (in the
  dark!).</p>
<p>The two men proceeded to demonstrate for all the world's cameras how they had done it. After several hours, the
  result was an embarrassing mess. A second attempt proved just as pathetic.</p>
<p>Doug and Dave were challenged to a TV debate with several researchers, including an authority on the subject, Colin
  Andrews. "Had they hoaxed the first formations in <time>1978</time> ?" "Yes," said Dave. Then Colin pulled out photos
  of patterns going back to <time>1971</time>. "Who then had made these?" "No," they answered, sheepishly, "we didn't
  make those." And if they had faked 200 circles, as they claimed, by whom were the remaining 2300 or so circles
  created? They had also claimed never to have been active in the Avebury area, but this had in fact been the prime
  circle-making area since <time>1988</time>. Who made the the Barbury Castle tetrahedron? And the Mandelbrot Set? Who
  made those in other parts of the country? And since the countryside was swarming with people on the lookout for
  hoaxers, how come they had never been caught? No answer. How had they created the anomalies, the mathematical
  precision? The more questions were asked the more they backed down their claims. In the end, even Doug and Dave were
  not sure which ones they had done. But something in their soundbite-style replies gave the impression that their whole
  scheme had been orchestrated.</p>
<p>A newspaper article credited the Doug and Dave story to MBF Services. After much reluctance from the newspaper staff,
  it was explained that a freelance press agency had passed on the story to the newspaper. When asked for the phone
  number of MBF, the phone was hung up. Investigations eventually led to a 'research and development' lab in Somerset
  where work is conducted on classified government defense projects.</p>
<p>Just before the Doug and Dave incident, a French government scientist had warned researchers not to risk their
  reputations on the crop circles, for shortly the British Government would engage two artists and would present them to
  the press as the crop circles creators, to "put an end to all the wearisome fuss."</p>
<p>But in the end the damage was done. The event demonstrated how quickly public interest in crop circles- or any
  unexplained phenomenon- could be deflated simply by presenting a pair of alleged hoaxers. Once again the public was
  given a logical reason to believe the whole thing was a joke.</p>
