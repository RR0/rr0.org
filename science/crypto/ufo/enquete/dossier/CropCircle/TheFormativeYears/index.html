<p class="exergue">Suddenly, I heard a noise. It seemed as if something pushed down the wheat. That night the air was
  completely still. I looked around. The moon had just appeared, shining brightly. In front of my eyes I could see a
  great imprint taking shape. The wheat was forced down in a clockwise direction. <span

</p>
<p>So, by the appearance of a modest, elegant circle of pressed wheat some 30 ft in diameter in southern England began
  the study of crop circles in our era. Two and a half decades and some 10,000 formations later, crop circles have grown
  into complex mathematical fractals, in lengths up to three quarters of a mile, and covering areas as large as 200,000
  square ft. Crop circles- or agriglyphs- can now be found in most countries around the globe. </p>
<p>Since then, hundreds of simple, sporadic events have surfaced from around the world dating back to 1890; several
  cases even date to the time of Newton. Initially, the phenomenon was attributed to freak wind vortexes, although why
  these created such perfect shapes in crop fields remained unexplained, after all, wind vortices and tornadoes
  generally rip things out of the ground. </p>
<p>One very crucial piece of evidence from the 1970s posed an interesting dilemma for researchers and scientists trying
  to pin the blame on pranksters armed with rope and pieces of wood. In those days the fields did not have the hallmark
  tractor ruts (tram lines) that today cross the fields in parallel lines every 60 feet or so. This is very important in
  establishing the cause of crop circles, by virtue that a person trying to lay a perfect design upon the wheat would
  have had to do so by levitating. It could be argued that a balloon was used, although nobody has satisfactorily
  explained how a balloon could be maintained perfectly still four feet off the ground, around a wooden peg which,
  presumably, would enable a person to lean out of the basket while he moved the wheat in a perfect spiral, without
  damaging the plants and leaving no hole in the middle. And all this in the middle of the night. The debate raged on
  and all kinds of agencies were given credit for these mysterious circles- wind vortexes, little green men, poor soil
  conditions, sex-mad hedgehogs and, most popular of all, the plasma vortex theory. </p>
<p>But it was in 1980 that the phenomenon caught everyone's interest. Suddenly there were two circles in a field, lying
  symmetrically side-by-side. Freak weather condition advocates were suddenly dealt a blow. The following year, signs of
  intelligence were manifested when a 52-foot circle was flanked by two smaller circles exactly half its size, aligned
  perfectly north-south. This formation at Cheesefoot Head was also the first to attract serious media interest. By now,
  dozens of single, double and triple circular formations were being documented, all manifesting perfect spiral
  movement, with plants unharmed or broken, in circles etched with surgical precision from the standing crop. </p>
<p>Then in 1983 the first quintuplet design appeared- a large central circle surrounded by four smaller circles within
  the standing crop, precisely aligned to the four cardinal points. Four of the circles were rotated clockwise, the
  fifth counter-clockwise. Now even the army was devoting serious helicopter time to these occurrences, for here was
  something that was simply inexplicable. Unusual anomalies seemed to accompany the formations- dogs in the vicinity
  would bark incessantly from 2am to 4 am, just hours before a crop circle was spotted nearby; animals that ventured
  into new formations vomited, orange balls of light were observed; strange noises- like the rustling of electricity-
  were heard and recorded; and UFO reports preceded the appearance of formations. More importantly, the phenomenon
  showed intelligent reaction to the thoughts and theories of the researchers, either to communicate or lead them in a
  pre-meditated direction: when they said formations were caused by freak winds on sides of hills, the crop circles
  moved to flat, open areas; when men armed with planks of wood were suggested as the culprit, circles developed in oil
  seed rape (canola), one of the most brittle plants; if balloons were to blame, they appeared under high voltage
  wires. </p>
<p>By 1988, hundreds of crop circles had been documented and researched. And every year they had grown exponentially,
  always developing and splitting in structure as if suggesting some sort of language, more complex as the years
  progressed and at the pace in which the research teams picked up on the subtle clues left on the fields. Circles
  developed a simple ring, then double rings. Then Celtic crosses, where the four 'satellite' circles were connected by
  a thin band, too narrow even for a small child to thread without disturbing the crop. In 1988, during a BBC interview
  inside a new formation, the cricket-like warble that had been heard several times throughout the years was captured on
  tape. Eventually analyzed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, it was measured as 100 bpm, at a frequency of 5.2kHz,
  and mechanical in nature. A bird or insect was also out of the question. </p>
<p>More formations began appearing in closer proximity to ancient monuments; Silbury Hill, Europe's own "pyramid'
  received forty visits. </p>
<p>In one bizarre case at Corhampton, three single circles were placed mathematically correct within an equilateral
  area, making it the first crop formation to exhibit a musical diatonic ratio (above). Furthermore, its physical
  features were extraordinary. Here was a series of circles that had been previously flattened but now the stems were
  lifting back to the light of the sun in a selective manner, in three separate groups. In the first group, plants were
  bending on the node nearest to the ground. In the second group plants were lifting up on the node half-way up the
  stem, and plants in the third group were bending at the node nearest the head. From the air, they'd grown into a
  pattern consisting of seven concentric rings and forty-eight spokes. </p>
<p>Circle fever began to break out among the public. Even the Queen put the acclaimed Circular Evidence book on her
  reading list. 305 known formations had now appeared and they were becoming more and more complicated, some even
  developing tails. Then on August 12 1989, the final blow was dealt to the favored meteorological theory- the
  "Swastika' at Winterbourne Stoke (left) became a quantum leap in crop circle language. Here was a formation whose crop
  was bent in four quadratures, exactly aligned to the magnetic compass points; at the centre the crop rotated and
  counter-rotated in three movements. At the boundary edge, another thin band rotated clockwise with crop weaving over
  and under the central combed quadratures. A hoax was out of the question, and an "ouside force' began to be accepted
  as the creator of crop circles. </p>
<p>But nothing would have prepared anyone for the surprises in store for 1990. </p>
