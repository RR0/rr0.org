<p>The season of <time>1990</time> began early with a surprise at Bishops Cannings. Two celtic cross designs with three
  pencil-thin rings stood side-by-side in the wheat. Amazingly, one developed a fourth ring that intercepted the other
  formation. This addition of elements also began occurring in other formations.</p>
<p>Surveillance groups began to get organized above fields in an attempt to catch the circlemakers 'at it'. In one
  situation a shining object was filmed hovering above a field when several small red lights were seen emanating from
  it. They operated slowly above the heads of the crop and disappeared at phenomenal speed when approached. Wherever
  these balls were seen, small 'grapeshot' circles later appeared in the crop.</p>
<p>The next surprise signaled a major step in the design of crop circles. At Chilcomb Farm two circles were connected
  with a straight line and flanked by four rectangular boxes- the pictogram was born. This set the standard for the next
  month as one dumbell design came after another. Soon they developed haloes, many of which were recognized as
  variations of ancient symbols of the Sun God in cultures throughout the world. The Circlemakers appeared to be calling
  all parts of the human race.</p>

<p>The connecting line feature, along with the boxes, allowed the phenomenon to develop an intense diversity and
  progression almost overnight, not to mention size- some were now as long as 150 ft. But then came the true sensation.
  On the night of July 10, 1990, the inhabitants of the village of Alton Barnes heard a peculiar buzzing sound which
  caused all dogs in the village to bark incessantly throughout the night. As the dawn light bathed the Vale of Pewsey,
  none of the farmers' cars would start. And as they approached their fields no one could believe their eyes- a 603 ft
  pictogram lay majestically in the wheat. It consisted of nine circles in a row- five single circles and two dumbells,
  one flanked by two boxes and encompassing a three-fingered claw. Only a few miles away, an almost identical design had
  also materialized. Photos of the Alton Barnes pictogram made the front pages of the world's press. Thousands of
  visitors flocked to the area, almost in a sense of pilgrimage. Inside the formation people behaved as if they were on
  drugs- there was a sense of giddiness about, as if a long lost family had suddenly reunited. Complete strangers talked
  with one another, smiling, even skipping along the path of the formation.</p>
<p>It was later discovered that the 'trident' design in this and other formations of the year bore a close resemblance
  to traditional and esoteric symbols associated with transformation. How appropriate this explanation becomes in light
  of the circumstances, for here at last was a crop circle that single-handedly transformed thousands of people of all
  races practically overnight.</p>
<p>In light of these important new events, a second, large surveillance project was organized. And this time the Army
  also decided to join in.</p>

<p>The project was planned to cover three weeks, but to everyone's surprise a discovery was made only on the second day.
  Ironically, during the night that key researchers had not been present, a primitive-looking formation appeared below
  the ancient hill fort of Bratton Castle. With a heavy media presence at hand, excited researchers entered the
  formation only to be faced with a mess- the typical vortices were missing, the wheat appeared trampled and broken, and
  right in the centre lay a ball of wire, and a horoscope game with a wooden cross. The formation was obviously a
  well-orchestrated hoax, a crude attempt at deception to humiliate and discredit researchers thoroughly. Later,
  information was leaked from a high- ranking official in the Army that the crop circle had been constructed by a well
  trained top military unit with special clearance from the Ministry of Defense. Whatever the motive, the damage had
  been done and the public was turned off the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Apparently, the exercise had been carried out to get 'circle fever' under control and to diffuse the surveillance
  before anything explosive might be caught on film. It was only ten days later, within view of a much reduced media
  presence, that the researchers back at the surveillance unit secured a real event taking place at night on camera. The
  film showed a whirl motion, some 15-seconds in duration, snaking through the crop forming a question mark. The copy of
  the film was handed to the BBC but has since 'disappeared'.</p>
<p>Further forays into proving that circles were made by man were announced by several British tabloids, each of whom
  paid large sums of money to people who came forward claiming ownership of these works of art. Naturally, all kinds of
  opportunists came forward with the most ridiculous of stories to collect handsome rewards. A German film crew went a
  stage further and paid four locals to create an embarrassing hoaxed formation using clothelines. Even though the
  formation was quite obviously a mess they proceeded to screen it on German TV and disillusion the whole German viewing
  public.</p>
<p>During several ministerial conferences involving the British government, it became obvious that the Army should still
  keep the phenomenon under close scrutinity, using 'appropriate steps' where necessary, and 'disinformation' should the
  matter get out of hand in the public sector. Under a CIA directive, farmers were even approached and paid to cut down
  any fields containing crop circles, whether the crop was ripe or not.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another huge double pictogram materialized near Silbury Hill, followed three days later by a design that
  Hopi natives called 'Mother Is Crying'. The pictogram appeared as Saddam Hussein was laying waste the oil fields in
  Kuwait.</p>
