<p class="abstract">Quand témoins multiples, trace d'atterrissage, résidus et radioactivité ne font pas pour autant un
  cas solide</p>
<p>Le <time>1971-11-02 ~19:00</time>, <span class="temoin">Ronald Johnson</span> (16 ans) was tending the sheep on his
  father's farmn ear the small town of Delphos, Kansas. At about 7:00 p.m. Ronald and his dog Snowball were suddenly
  surprised to see an object hovering about two feet off the ground in a grove of trees some twenty-five yards from
  where he stood. The object, which he later estimated to be about nine feet in diameter and ten feet tall, was shaped
  like a mushroom with a short stem and was covered with multi-colored lights. It made a sound that Ronald described as
  like that of an old washing machine which vibrates. As he watched, it suddenly became very bright at the base and then
  it took off at an angle, temporarily blinding him. Ronald would later say that the dog was noticeably "very quiet",
  but that the sheep were bleating nervously.</p>
<p> Some minutes later, as Ronald's eyes once more adjusted to the light, he went into the house and told his parents,
  Durel and Erma Johnson, what he had seen. They got outside in time to see the object, which was now about half the
  full moon in size, before it vanished into the sky to the south.</p>
<p> ...her fingers went numb. </p>

<p>Ronald and his parents then went to examine the place at which the object had been first seen. They were astonished
  to find a glowing ring on the ground, and some sort of glowing material on nearby trees. When Mrs. Johnson touched the
  glowing area, which had a crust-like texture, she found that her fingers went numb. She tried to wipe the substance
  off onto her leg, and her leg became numb where the material touched it. Her fingers reportedly remained slightly numb
  for about two weeks, although she never sought medical attention for the problem. Mr. Johnson fetched his camera and
  took a photo of the ring and then phoned the local newspaper, The Delphos Republican. </p>
<p>The next day, Durel and Ronald drove into town and spoke to a Delphos Republican reporter, Thaddia Smith. Mrs. Smith,
  her husband, and her son-in-law then accompanied the Johnsons back to their farm, where she found: </p>
<p>The circle was still very distinct and plain to see. the soil was dried and crusted. The circle or ring was
  approximately 8 feet across, the center of the ring and the outside area were still muddy from recent rains. The area
  of the ring that was dried was about a foot across and was very light in color. </p>

<p>The object had crushed a dead tree to the ground either when it landed or took off, and from appearance had broken a
  limb of a live tree when it landed. the broken limb was most unusual, it would snap and break as though it had been
  dead for quite some time, yet it was green under the bark, and the upper area still had green leaves clinging to its
  branches. However the lower area looked as though it had been blistered and had a whitish cast. </p>
<p>That afternoon, Sheriff Enlow, Undersheriff Harlan Enlow, and Kansas State Highway Patrolman Kenneth Yager
  investigated the ring after being called by Thaddia Smith. Harlan Enlow's report of the investigation stated:</p>
<p> ...we observed a ring shaped somewhat like a doughnut with a hole in the middle. The ring was completely dry with a
  hole in the middle and outside of the ring mud. There were limbs broken from a tree and a dead tree broken off, there.
  There was a slight discoloration on the trees. </p>
<p>The soil sample taken was almost white in color and very dry. </p>
<p>...he had observed a bright light descending in the sky... </p>
<p>Enlow's report also stated that: </p>
<p>Le 1971-11-03 M. Lester Ensbarger of 416 Argyle St. in Minneapolis advised Deputy Sheriff Leonard Simpson that at
  approx 19:30. 1971-11-02 he had observed a bright light descending in the sky in the Delphos area. </p>
<p>L'anneau est toujours clairement, visible 32 days plus tard, lorsque <span class="people">Ted Phillips</span>
  l'examine. Le sol dans l'anneau lui-même est toujours sec jusqu'à une profondeur d'au moins 12 pouces, même si à cette
  époque il est recouvert par la neige, alors que le sol à l'extérieur de l'anneau est humide et noir. Phillips prends
  plusieurs photos de l'anneau et recueille des échantillon du sol au niveau de l'anneau ainsi qu'à l'extérieur de
  celui-ci. </p>
<p>Un certain nombre d'analyses sont effectées de ces échantillons issus de l'anneau et de ses alentours. On trouve que
  le sol de l'anneau est résistant à l'eau, contient plus de calcium et plus de sels solubles, et est plus acide que le
  sol à l'extérieur de l'anneau. De plus, on trouve que le sol de l'anneau contient un hydrocarbone non-identifié ainsi
  qu'un matériau organique composé de fibres blanches semblables à du crystal. </p>
<p><span class="people">Une substance filamenteuse que Jacques Vallée, en 1974-03, </span>s'étonne que <q>personne ne se
  soit embêté à identifier dans les années qui ont suivi l'atterrissage</q> <span class="source">Vallée, J.: Forbidden Science Vol II, p. 242 &lt; ""<a

  Il le fait alors analyser par un biologiste français <span class="note">Ayant demandé à rester anonyme.</span> qui y
  trouve un champignon Norcardia, qui semble avoir été stimulé par une radiation inconnue <span class="source">Vallée, J.: p.250</span>.
  De l'ordre des Actinomycetales, sa croissance peut amener un motif circulaire à se former au sol. De plus, ce
  biologiste, qui a demandé à rester anonyme, a indiqué que ce champignon est souvent trouvé croître avec un autre
  champignon de l'ordre des Basidiomysetes, qui peut être fluorescent dans certaines conditions <span class="source">Vallée, J.: <em>Dimensions</em></span>,
  .</p>
<p>Only if you're one of those debunkers who thinks that if you find an explanation for part of an incident, then you
  have "debunked" the entire incident. Remember, three witnesses saw a UFO, not just the ring, and their sighting was at
  least partly corroborated by a fourth witness eleven miles away in Minneapolis. The ring itself may not be directly
  related to the UFO sighting, and the presence of a fungus in the soil does not explain how the fluorescent material
  got onto the surrounding trees, nor how the branches got broken and the dead Chinese elm tree knocked down.</p>
<p> Both Thaddia Smith and Sheriff Enlow told Ted Phillips in 1972 that the Johnsons were well respected in the area and
  that they did not believe that it was possible that the family could be perpetrating a hoax. </p>
<p>The dog would furiously try to get into the house at nightfall. </p>
<p>The day after the incident, Ronald's eyes became red and watered as though from irritation. For a week after the
  incident he had nightmares from which he awoke screaming. </p>
<p>Even the animals were traumatized by the sighting. Vallee says: </p>
<p>For about two weeks, every evening at sunset, the sheep would jump out of the pen and run wildly. The dog would
  furiously try to get into the house at nightfall. He practically destroyed the screen door, and the only way to keep
  him outside was to replace it with a stronger metal door. </p>
<p>An adequate explanation for the Delphos incident has never been found. </p>
