<h2 align="justify"> Lost Over Lake Superior</h2>
<h3 align="justify"> Probe Crash Fatal to Two in U. Arboretum</h3>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">A second Truax Field F-89C Scorpion jet plane was         reported missing today with two occupants, even as searchers continued         efforts to recover the bodies of two other fliers who died Monday when         their plane plunged into the mud in a marshy area near Lake Wingra.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">Occupants of the second plane, which disappeared Monday         afternoon over Lake Superior, were 1st Lt. Felix E. Moncla, Jr., 27, of 12         Sherman Ter., the pilot, and 2nd Lt. Robert L. Wilson, 22, of 301         Huntington Ct. the radar observer.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">Killed in the Wingra crash were 1st Lt. John W.         Schmidt, 28, the pilot, and Capt. Glen E. Collins, 30, radar observer. Lt.         Schmidt, a native of Del Rio, Tex., lived at 10 Sherman Ter., and Capt.         Collins, native of Indianapolis, Ind., lived at 24 Craig Ave.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">Lt. Col. Henry W. Shoup, Truax base commander, said the         jet interceptor involved in the second crash had taken off from Kinross         Air Base near Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., Monday at 5:22 p.m. to investigate         an unidentified plane over the lake. The Truax jet was at the Michigan         base as a replacement for regular teams from the field sent to Yuma, Ariz.         for gunnery maneuvers.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">The spot of disappearance was about 70 miles northeast         of Keweenan Point in Upper Michigan an 40 miles southeast of the Ontario         shoreline. Air Force planes and most guard boats joined in a hunt for the         missing fliers today, but snow and cold were hampering search. Shoup said         he doubted if the fliers could remain alive overnight if they fell into         the cold water.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">Moncla, married and the father of two children is a         native of Moreauville, La. Wilson, who was single, was a son of Renne         Wilson of Ponca City, Okla.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">Crews of both Truax planes were members of the 433rd         Fighter-Interceptor squadron according to Col. Shoup.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">An Air Force clamshell crane was being used today to         lift wreckage of the crashed Scorpion in the mud-filled hole of the         University Arboretum in an attempt to find the bodies of Schmidt and         Collins.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">Col. Shoup said he was convinced that the men had stuck         with their plane in an attempt to keep it crashing into densely-occupied         areas of Madison. He praised the co-operation of police, firemen, members         of the press and radio and others in trying to find the men.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">He added that an all-out effort will be made to salvage         every bit of the wreckage to present to an investigating board of experts         so that the cause of the mishap may be determined.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">Wreckage was scattered over a wide area, some of it         blown into Lake Wingra by an explosion which ripped the ship immediately         after it plunged into the marsh. A salvage crew from Truax Field used a         boat on the lake today in search for debris.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">Officials were inclined to believe that a sudden         mechanical failure caused the crash and the two occupants of the plane had         no opportunity to radio that they were in distress or to bail out of the         speeding craft.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">The plane, aloft on a routine training flight, sped         northwesterly across the southern outskirts of Madison, and crashed into         the marsh at the edge of Lake Wingra and about one fourth mile west of the         bridge across Murphy's Creek at the end of South Mills street.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">The explosion hurled mud and plane parts over trees,         broke upper limbs of some trees, shook buildings in the area, and cracked         a storm window in one home in the vicinity.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">Police and firemen sped to the scene to aid Truax Field         rescue squads and airmen volunteers from the field in attempts to recover         the bodies of the fliers and the wreckage of the plane.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">Shortly after the crash site was located, two torn but         unopened parachutes were fished from the marsh with pike poles.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">Numerous persons witnessed the F-89C Scorpion jet. They         heard the roar of the low-flying plane, then saw it tip downward. The         plunge was followed by an explosion which tore a huge hole in the marsh         and sent mud and plane parts flying into the air.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">Among those reporting seeing the crash of hearing the         explosion are Mrs. Warren Young, 2201 Woodland Way; Mrs. Pauline Adams,         2401 Balden St., in whose home a window was cracked; R. A. Scheiber, 5404         Pleasant Hill Rd.; Mrs. Donald Alme, 920 Dane St.; Mrs. Juanita Gray,         Syene Road; George Parks, 309 Russell St.; Andrew Grosse, Route 1, Cross         Plains; David Welch, 2027 Madison St.; Lloyd R. Burr, 937 Dane St.; and         Atty. John Riley, 1526 Vilas Ave.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">The hole gouged out by the exploding plane is about 50         feet in diameter and about 10 feet deep.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="en-ca">Workers in rubber suits entered the muddy pond to         search for the bodies and wreckage. They were aided by Martin Lemberger,         513 S. Brooks St., former Navy diver.</span>
