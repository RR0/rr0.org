<h2> Lake Superior Hides Jet's Fate During Storm</h2>
<h3>Men Presumed Dead; Cause of City Crash May Stay Mystery</h3>
<p><span lang="EN-US">By June         Dieckmann</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">(State Journal         Staff Writer)</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">Two more Truax Field fliers were presumed dead Tuesday         night after their F-8C Scorpion Jet crashed in Lake Superior Monday night         just five hours subsequent to another F-89C crash which killed two Truax         officers here.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">The victims of the Lake Superior accident were the         pilot, First Lt. Felix E. Moncla Jr., 27, of 15 Sherman Terrace, a native         of Moreauville, La., and the radar observer, Second Lt. Robert L. Wilson,         22, from Ponca City, Okla., whose Madison home was 301 Huntington Ct.</span>
</p>
<h3 align="justify"> On Investigating Mission</h3>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">The two lieutenants disappeared while on a mission from         Kinross air base Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to investigate an unidentified         plane over Lake Superior during a snowstorm.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">Their F-89C vanished suddenly from the radar screen as         they approached the other plane, later identified as a Canadian C-47         transport 30 miles off its course. No radio or radar contact has been made         with them ever since.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">Lt. Col. Harry W. Shoup, Truax commandant, said it was         believed the F-89C crashed into the lake and both Lts. Moncla and Wilson         are dead.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">Air Force officials in Chicago said Tuesday night that         F-89C jets will not be grounded despite the two crashes of planes from         Truax.</span>
</p>
<h3 align="justify"> Cause Here Unknown</h3>

<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">The exact cause of the crash Monday afternoon on the         Lake Wingra shore here probably will not be determined because salvage         crews were not able to retrieve parts of the plane that were blasted deep         into the lake bed and marsh by the plane's explosion, Col. Shoup said.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">Killed in the Madison crash were the pilot, First Lt.         John W. Schmidt, 28, a native of Del Rio, Tex., who lived at 10 Sherman         Terrace, and the radar operator, Capt. Glen E. Collins, 30, of 24 Craig         Ave. a native of Indianapolis, Ind.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">Mrs. Schmidt, an expectant mother was consoled by her         neighbor, Mrs. Moncla, Monday night while neither of them knew that at the         same time Lt. Moncla's plane had crashed in Lake Superior, 400 miles away.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">Lts. Moncla and Wilson were members of part of the         Truax 433rd fighter-interceptor squadron which is temporarily         stationed at Kinross field while squadron members from there are taking         gunnery re-training at Yuma, Ariz.</span>
</p>
<h3 align="justify"> During Snowstorm</h3>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">At 5:22 pm Monday, Lts. Moncla and Wilson were         dispatched during a snowstorm to investigate the unidentified plane some         100 miles north of Sault Ste. Marie.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">As the radar screen revealed they were approaching the         other plane, they disappeared.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">Col. Shoup said he believed Lts. Moncla and Wilson must         have suddenly overtaken the slower transport plane and "peeled off" to         avoid a collision. The jet perhaps stalled and went into a spin, crashing         into the lake, he said.</span>
</p>
<h3 align="justify"> No Distress Signal</h3>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">No distress signal was radioed by the lieutenants.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">Air-sea rescue crews from Canadian and U.S. Air Force         and Coast Guard bases continued their searches for the fliers Tuesday         night, but were hampered by snow and poor visibility.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">The nearest land to where the Truax jet is believed to         have crashed is Keweenaw Point, Mich., 70 miles to the southwest, and the         Canadian shore line which is 40 miles to the northeast.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">Kinross field officials reported that the jet had two         hours of fuel when it took off Monday night. The plane was equipped with         two rubber rafts and each of the lieutentants wore a life jacket.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">Col. Shoup said that even if Lts. Moncla and Wilson         were able to inflate and board the rafts, it is not believed they could         have survived the night on the frigid, snow-swept Lake Superior.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"><span lang="EN-US">Lt. Moncla came to Truax field in July, 1952. He and         Mrs. Moncla have a daughter, Sharon, five months, and a son, David, 20         months. Lt. Wilson, who is unmarried was assigned to Truax last June.</span>
