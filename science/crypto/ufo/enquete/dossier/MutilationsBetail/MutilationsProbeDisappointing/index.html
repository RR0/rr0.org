<p>Examination of the first quarterly report submitted in our famous $50,000 <a href="../index.html">cattle
  mutilation</a> probe would indicate results to date can be described at best disappointing. The worst might be to
  suggest it's a waste of the taxpayers' money.</p>
<p>In summary, chief investigator <a href="/people/r/RommelKennethM/index.html">Ken Rommel</a>, at a salary of $25,000 a
  year, gave interviews to television stations and newspapers, talked with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation,
  confirmed support from a number of state agencies (which he had already) and checked out three suspected mutilations
  in his first five weeks on the job.</p>
<p>That cost about $2,500 in salary plus unknown expenses. </p>
<p>The report says the investigations into the three cattle deaths (one each in Milaga, Coyote and Tres Piedras) were
  not complete, although one Albuquerque newspaper quoted <a
      href="/people/r/RommelKennethM/index.html">Rommel</a> as saying all three were caused by predators. </p>
<p>But lo and behold, a mutilation reported in Truchas Saturday morning, only several hours after the animal's death and
  probably the freshest incident to date, had yet to be checked out by 4 p.m. Tuesday — more than four days later. Our
  "Desert Fox" hadn't made it to Truchas, the state police hadn't responded, the livestock inspector was not to be seen
  and the only explanation our district attorney (he's the one who got the $50,000 grant) had was "it was a
  weekend." </p>
<p>We must advise our cattle mutilators that the game is played only five days a week — we rest on weekends. </p>
<p>Now fellows, there is a tremendous amount of interest in this subject as evidenced by the turnout for the
  Alburquerque conference conducted by New Mexico's Sen. Harrison Schmitt. Additional proof is the fact that the feds
  coughed up $50,000 to look into it.</p>
<p>While the public can't expect a solution in the first six week of activity, for pete's sake they can expect more than
  that skimpy one-page report issued last week. And they can expect, for the money they are putting out, for someone to
  show up to investigate reported mutilations. But as one optimist remarked cheerfully: "Look at it this way; it's only
  $50,000. It could have been half a million." </p>
