<!--#include virtual="/header-start.html" --><title>La sorcière de
  Bell</title><!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<p>En 1817 dans le Tennessee, la famille Bell, des fermiers prospères. </p>
<p>La maison est plagued with knocking and rapping noises and scratching sounds. Blankets were pulled from beds, family
  members were kicked and scratched and their hair pulled. Particularly tormented was a 12-year-old Betsy Bell, who was
  slapped, pinched, bruised and stuck with pins. At first, John Bell was determined to keep the events secret, but soon
  confided in a friend , who then formed an investigative committee. John Bell's friends soon learned that the strange
  force in the house had an eerie intelligence. It soon found a voice and from that day on. . .was seldom silent.</p>
<p>The spirit identified itself as the "witch" of Kate Batts, a neighbors of the Bell's, with whom John had experienced
  bad business dealings over some purchased slaves. "Kate" as the local people began calling her, made daily appearances
  in the Bell home, wreaking havoc on everyone there. People all over the area of soon learned of the witch and she made
  appearances, in sounds and voices, all over Robertson County.</p>
<p>The ghost became so famous that even General Andrew Jackson decided to visit. He too experienced the antics of the
  witch and his carriage wheels refused to turn until the witch decided to let them.</p>
<p>John Bell fell victim to bouts of strange illness, to which "Kate" claimed responsibility. While he was sick in bed,
  the spirit cursed and prodded him, never allowing him to rest. One day, he went to bed and never recovered. He was
  found senseless in his bed one morning and a strange bottle was found nearby. Bell's breath smelled of the black
  liquid in the bottle, so a drop of it was placed on the tongue of a cat. . .the animal dropped dead. John Bell soon
  followed suit and "Kate" screamed in triumph. She even made her presence known at his funeral, laughing, cursing and
  singing as the poor man was buried.</p>
<p><img alt="Betsy Bell" class="right side" src="BellBetsy.jpg">"Kate" didn't vanish immediately after the death of her
  proclaimed enemy though. She stayed around, threatening Betsy Bell to not marry the man that she truly loved, Joshua
  Gardner. The witch would never say why, but she did allow the girl to later marry the local schoolteacher, Richard
  Powell. "Kate" soon left the family but promised to return in seven years. She did come back and plagued the family
  again for two weeks. Before departing, she appeared at the home of John Bell Jr. and made a number of predictions that
  Bell recorded. The warning proved true, reflecting the Civil War and the later World Wars of the next century. "Kate"
  said that she would return again 107 years later, in 1935, but the year came and went without incident.</p>
<p>Who was the Bell Witch? Was she really a ghost, who claimed to be connected to a living person? Or did the
  resentment and the hatred of the real Kate Batts create an entity of it's own? Or could the haunting have been
  poltergeist activity linked to Betsy Bell? No one will ever know for sure. . .but whoever, or whatever, the Bell Witch
  was, many believe that she has never left Adams, Tennessee at all. </p>
<p>THE BELL WITCH CAVE</p>
<p>The sinister Bell Witch Cave lies hidden on <br> the side of a bluff on the former property of the <br> fated John
  Bell family</p>
<p>Located near where the Bell Farm once stood and near the old family cemetery, where many of the Bell's still rest,
  is what has become known as the Bell Witch Cave. The cave has no real connection to the legend of the witch but it is
  located on property once owned by the Bell family. Many in Robertson County believe that when the witch departed, she
  fled to the sanctuary of this cave. Whether the Bell Witch is here or not.... the cave is a very haunted place.</p>
<p>The former owner of the cave, a man named Bill Edens reported that strange events still went on in the cave and near
  the home that he had built on the bluff where the cave can be found. The steep incline over the Red River hides a
  narrow path that leads down to the cave. Strange figures have been reported here and knocking sounds and
  poltergeist-like events still take place in the house.</p>
<p>The current owners, Chris and Walter Kirby, still open the cave for tourists and they too report that eerie events
  sometimes take place in the house and in the cave itself. Chris Kirby recalls several occasions when she and visitors
  in the cave have seen strange apparitions and have heard unexplained sounds, coming from deep in the hidden corners of
  the cave. </p>
