# RR0 Sources

Sources can be references in different ways:

- A traditional link toward some external page on the Internet, with the `source` class.\
  For instance: `<a class="source" href="https://some/path">Some content</a>`
- An empty link toward an internal RR0 page, with the `source` class.\
  For instance: `<a class="source" href="/some/path"></a>`
