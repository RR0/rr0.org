  était plutôt un disque, vu par la tranche. The jolt it imparted
  to the DC-3, however, is not surprising. I should say that the plane felt a 
  light energy blast, a product of radiation pressure motor operation. <a href="/people/k/KlassPhilipJulian/index.html">Philip

<p>Another of the many airline-crew sightings of highly unconventional aerial 
  devices were Cases 1 and 2, widely reported in the national press (for a day 
  or two, and then forgotten like the rest). La nuit du 20 janvier <time>1951</time> est claire
  et froide à Sioux City au moment où le DC-3 de Mid-Continent Airlines
  piloté par Lawrence W. Vinther s'apprête à décoller
  pour Omaha et Kansas City, à 17 h 20 (CST). Dans la tour de contrôle
  de la CAA, John M. Williams remarque une lumière bizarre manoeuvrant
  haut vers l'Ouest. Soudain la lumière accélère brutalement,
  d'une manière excluant clairement toute origine météoritique
  ou aérienne, et Williams alerte Vinther et son co-pilot, James F. Bachmeier.
  The incident has been discussed many times, but to check details of these reports, 
  I searched for and finally located all three of the above-named men. Vinther 
  and Bachmeier are now Braniff pilots, Williams is with the <a href="/org/us/FAA.html">FAA</a>
  in Sacramento. From them I confirmed the principal features of previous accounts 
  and learned additional information too lengthy to recapitulate in full here. 
  The essential point to be emphasized is that, shortly after Vinther got his 
  DC-3 airborne, under Williams' instructions to investigate the oddly-behaving 
  light, the object executed a sudden dive and flew over the DC-3 at an estimated 
  200 ft. vertical clearance, passing aft and downward. Then a surprising maneuver 
  unfolded. As Vinther described it to me, and as described in contemporaiy accounts, 
  the object suddenly reversed course almost 180-degrees, without slowing down 
  or slewing, and was momentarily flying formation with their DC-8 off it's port 
  wing. (Vinther's dry comment to me was: <q>This is something we don't see
  airplanes do.</q>) Vinther and Bachmeier agreed that the object was very
  big, perhaps somewhat larger than a B-29, they suggested to newspapermen who 
  interviewed them the following day. Moonlight gave them a good silhouetted view 
  of the object, which they described as having the form of a fuselage and unswept 
  wing, but not a sign of any empennage, nor any sign of engine-pods, propellers, 
  or jets. Prior to its dive, it had been seen only as a light; while pacing their 
  DC-3, the men saw no luminosity, though during the dive they saw a light on 
  its underside. After about five seconds, the unknown object began to descend 
  below them and flew under their plane. They put the DC-3 into a steep bank to 
  try to keep it in view as it began this maneuver; and as it crossed under them, 
  they lost it, not to regain sight of it subsequently. There is much more detail, 
  not all mutually consistent as to maneuvers and directions, in the full accounts 
  I obtained from Vinther, Bachmeier, and Williams. The dive, pacing, and fly-under 
  maneuvers were made quickly and at such a distance from the field that Williams 
  did not see them clearly, though he did see the object leave the vicinity of 
  the DC-3. An Air Force colonel and his aide were among the passangers, and the 
  aide caught a glimpse of the unknown object, but I have been unable to locate 
  him for further cross-check. Discussion. - The erratic maneuvers exhibited by 
  the unknown object while under observation from the control tower would, by 
  themselves, make this a better-than-average case. But the fact that those maneuvers 
  prompted a tower operator to alert a departing aircrew to investigate, only 
  to have the object dive upon and pace the aircraft after a non-inertial course-reversal, 
  makes this an unusually interesting UFO. Its configuration, about which Vinther 
  and Bachmeier were quite positive in their remarks to me (they repeatedly emphasized 
  the bright moonlight, which checks with the near-full moon on 1/20/51 and the 
  sky-cover data I obtained from the Sioux City Weather Bureau), combines with 
  other features of the sighting to make it a most significant case The reported 
  shape (tailless, engineless, unswept aircraft of large size) does not match 
  that of any other UFO that I am aware of; but my exposure to the bewildering 
  range of reported configurations now on record makes this point less difficult 
  to assimilate. This case is officially carried as Unidentified, and, in a 1955 
  publication, was one of 12 Unidentifieds singled out for special comment. A 
  contemporary account, taking note of a then recent pronouncement that virtually 
  all UFOs are explainable in terms of misidentified Skyhook balloons, carried 
  a lead caption. <q>Le <a href="/org/us/dod/navy/ONR.html">Bureau de la Recherche Navale</a>
  indique que les ballons de rayons cosmiques expliquent tous les rapports de 
  soucoupes. Si c'est le cas, qu'est-ce qu'a vu ce pilote ?</q> Certainly it
  would not be readily explained away as a balloon, a meteor, a sundog, or ball 
  lighting. Rather, it seems to be just one more of thousands of' Unidentified 
  Flying Objects for which we have no present explanations because we have laughed 
  such reports out of scientific court. Bachmeier stated to me that, at the time, 
  he felt it had to be some kind of secret device, but, in the ensuing 17 years, 
  we have not heard of any aircraft that can execute instantaneous course-reversal. 
  Vinther's comment to me on a final question I asked as to what he thinks, in 
  general, about the many airline-pilot sightings of unidentified objects over 
  the past 20 years, was: <q>We're not all having hallucinations.</q></p>

<p> Le 12 Janvier 1965, un avion de transport DC-3 décolle de Whenuapai
  (Nouvelle Zélande) pour un vol vers Kaitaia. As the twin-engined propeller
  plane flew over Kaipara Harbour, a broad estuary 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest 
  of Auckland, the pilot, Captain Kirkpatrick, spotted an unusual gleam in the 
  water below -- an unidentified submerged object or USO. <q>He was about one-third
  of the way across Kaipara Harbour when he saw what he at first believed to be 
  a stranded gray-white whale in an estuary.</q>"<q>As he veered his
  DC-3 for a closer look at the object, it became evident to him that he was observing 
  a metallic structure of some sort.</q>" Captain Kirkpatrick "noted
  that the thing was perfectly streamlined and symmetrical in shape... had no 
  external control surfaces or protrusions... appeared metallic with the suggestion 
  of a hatch on top...was resting on the bottom of the estuary and headed toward 
  the south as suggested by the streamlined shape... was harbored in no more than 
  30 feet of water... was not shaped like a normal submarine but approximately 
  100 feet in length with a diameter of 15 feet at its widest part." After
  he filed his flight report, the Royal New Zealand Navy told Captain Kirkpatrick 
  "that it would have been impossible for any known model of submarine to
  have been in that particular area, due to the configuration of harbour and coastline."</p>

<p>Le  27 avril <a href="/time/1/9/5/0/index.html">1950</a> à 20 h 25 (L) au-dessus de UC Goshen, Indiana. Cette observation interressante à reçu une couverture non négligeable de la presse, probablement parce que les passagers furent alertés de la présence de la lumière non identifiée près de leur vol commercial. Le vol 117 de la <em>Trans World Airways </em>(DC-3) volait vers l'ouest en direction de Chicago à environ 2000 pieds d'altitude au-dessus de l'Indiana du centre-nord. L'officier de vol Robert F. Manning fut le 1er à voir une <q>lueur rouge étrange</q>
  sous et derrière eux sur leur côté droit. Elle grimpa rapidement en grandit en taille angulaire, ressemblant à un <q>blob rond non métallique... rouge-orange...</q>. <q>Ca avait la même apparence qu'une Lune rouge montante, et semblait se rapprocher de nous à une rythme de convergence relativement faible.

<p>2. July 29, 1950 2200L UP 10 mi. N. Springfield, Illinois</p>
<p>Mr. Jim Graham, Chief Pilot for Capital Aviation Company was flying from Chicago 
  to Springfield when he spotted something strange looking slightly above his 
  aircraft. He was above Williamsville at the time, 13 miles NE from his destination. 
  He described the object as a "blue streak about ten feet long and shaped
  like a sausage... it was trailing yellow fire." Suddenly it dove toward
  him and collided with his propeller. It "...exploded like a bomb"
  but no damage could be found to any part of the aircraft. Graham landed at Capital 
  Airport safely. Several witnesses on the ground reported seeing the same object 
  that night. (United Press wire, July 30, 1950; New York Times, July 31, 1950)</p>
<p>3. November 7, 1950 1915L UM E. of Lakehurst NAS, New Jersey </p>
<p>This frightening series of near-air misses took place over the Atlantic Ocean 
  but within sight of land under an exceptionally clear and dark sky. The heaven 
  was filled with bright stars. Lt. jg Robert Haven was flying a Navy AD-4Q on 
  a routine night radar navigation flight out of NAS Atlantic City, NJ. He was 
  at 3,500 feet altitude on a westerly heading back to land. To his right-front 
  side an estimated five miles away and somewhat above him was a steady white 
  light which he thought was the fuselage light of another aircraft. He thought 
  it was at 4,000 feet altitude at the time and was moving to the SE. Lt. Haven 
  instructed a crewman to turn on their airborne radar to "intercept"
  mode and also began a slight climbing turn to the left "...in order to
  get on this object&#146;s tail." The motion of the other object was clearly
  visible in relation to the many background stars. As he rolled out on the same 
  course as the object it turned somewhat more southerly so that the pilot thought 
  he was directly behind it now. What follows is the pilot&#146;s narration of 
  what happened next.</p>
<p>"In less time that (sic) it takes to tell, this light, without making
  any kind of reversal turn, bore down on me in a slight dive, passing directly 
  over my canopy, at an incredible speed, about 100 to 200 feet above. Puzzled 
  at this, my first reaction was that we had originally met head-on, and that 
  this was some aircraft without running lights and that it had been a close miss 
  for both of us." Lt. Haven deliberately pulled up into the flight path
  of the light just after it had passed to see if he would experience its wash 
  or slipstream "...but there was none." The pilot then told the other
  crewman onboard what had just happened and he "...disregarded his radar
  operation and proceeded to witness the following events. I pulled into a tight 
  "flipper" reversal turn in order to see this light again. As before,
  it was till (sic) slightly higher than I, and this time I was positive we were 
  on his tail. Pushing to normal rated power and climbing, I attempted to hold 
  the light in front of me, this object made another head-on pass, veering slightly 
  port and below so that my crewman could see it too. Still nothing but a single 
  white light, close to 10 to 12 inches in diameter, it moved with fantastic speed."
  The pilot then tried (twice) to radio Lakehurst on 142.74 MHz but without any 
  success. The pilot then used another frequency to ask for assistance from any 
  other Navy aircraft in the vicinity. "The Commanding Officer and his wingman
  in two F9F-2 (Panthers) answered, and set course for Lakehurst."</p>
<p>During his radio transmissions the light made five to six passages by his aircraft 
  and then the light and the pilot&#146;s aircraft began a left-hand orbiting 
  flight. He began a 60 degree climbing port (left) bank at 130 - 135 knots airspeed 
  in order to gain altitude. But, much to his consternation, "This light
  continued to turn about me in wider climbing turns, making about two orbits 
  to my one. " The pilot abandoned his climb upon reaching 11,500 feet altitude
  and only maintained his orbit so as to keep the light in sight. By the time 
  his Commanding Officer arrived over McGuire AFB at 14,000 feet Lt. Haven turned 
  his landing lights on bright and told the other air crew that the light was 
  at about 18,000 feet and still climbing. When the other two jets arrived the 
  object had risen to about 25,000 feet. Only the wingman of the other two jets 
  saw the light. (USAF investigation file; handwritten note by pilot)</p>
<p>4. January 20, 1951 2030L UC Sioux City, Iowa</p>
<p>Captain Lawrence Vinther, 32, and FO James Bachmeier were flying their Mid-Continent 
  Airlines DC-3 from Sioux City, Iowa to Omaha, Nebraska under a moonlit sky. 
  Just after takeoff of flight 9 from runway 31, the tower operator asked them 
  if they could see a bright light visually aligned with the NW corner of the 
  airport (from the tower&#146;s vantage). They both spotted it, a red or orange 
  light, and changed their course slightly to the NNW to better see what it was. 
  Later, Captain Vinther said the light seemed to be about four miles distance 
  at 8,000 feet altitude, perhaps 7,000 feet higher than their own altitude at 
  that time. The airplane turned left in a slow arc and so did the light, still 
  well above the two engine aircraft. They continued their left turn to near due 
  south and the light was now in the SE at about their 11 o&#146;clock position 
  when it blinked on and off several times. When the light eventually reached 
  their 9 o&#146;clock position all that could be seen was a single, continuous 
  bright white (like a landing) light. Then as the airplane continued a 360 degree 
  left turn (now proceeding more northerly) "...the object made a sharp 90
  degree turn and descended toward our plane at a terrible speed, crossing over 
  and in front of our plane." As Captain Vinther said, "The next thing
  I knew, the object was on our left, travelling in the same direction, about 
  200 feet from our left wing and at the same speed." It stayed at this location
  for 2 or 3 seconds "...and then disappeared below our plane and was not
  seen again... The tower advised that the object was following just below our 
  plane but we could not maneuver our plane so as to observe it again, and continued 
  on our scheduled flight to Omaha."</p>
<p>Both pilots saw a huge cigar-shaped fuselage pacing them. It also had a long, 
  slender "wing" mounted well forward on the fuselage. No (engine) nacelles
  were seen. The unidentified object remained right beside them at their own airspeed! 
  Vinther was in near shock and almost couldn&#146;t answer when Captain Bachmeier 
  asked him what it was. It was at least as large as a B-29 bomber and had a small, 
  short stabilizer on each end. He (allegedly) muttered, "I, I can&#146;t
  believe it." After a total of about three minutes the object departed to
  the NW at a tremendous speed without producing any air turbulence.</p>
<p>One of the passengers who saw the object from his window was an Air Force Colonel 
  who asked the flight crew to radio the sighting to ground authorities. Upon 
  their landing they were met by several Air Force officers who interrogated them 
  and went over their aircraft with some instruments. The official Air Force evaluation 
  of the object was a B-36! Captain Vinther said (later), "It definitely
  was not a B-36." If this huge strategic nuclear bomber can hover at low
  altitude over an airport and fly at very low altitudes near a commercial aircraft 
  with passengers then the United States had a truly marvelous weapon system indeed 
  that never should have been phased out. Details of the control tower&#146;s 
  visual sighting of the original object will be omitted due to space limitations.

<p>5. July 9, 1951 1340L UM Augusta, Georgia</p>
<p>Lt. George Kinman was flying an F-51 fighter plane over Augusta, Georgia on 
  a sunny, clear day. He had flown for seven years, including jets, in the military 
  at the time. He described his close call in these words. "I was cruising
  at about 250 mph (when) all of a sudden I noticed something ahead, closing in 
  on me, head on. Before I could take evasive action - before I even thought of 
  it, in fact - this thing dipped abruptly and passed underneath just missing 
  my propeller. The thing was definitely of disc shape... white... pretty thick... 
  it looked like an oval... it was about twice as big as my plane. It had no visible 
  protrusions like motors, guns, windows, smoke or fire." Lt. Kinman banked
  rapidly to try to keep the object in sight. The object was nowhere in sight. 
  Then, about fifteen seconds later the disc came at him again, dipping at the 
  last minute; the unidentified object repeated this maneuver several more times 
  over the next five to ten minutes! On its final pass the object zoomed upward 
  instead of down, just missing his canopy. (Cleveland Press, July 30, 1951; UPI, 
  July 30, 1951)</p>
<p>6. August 27, 1951 2000L UP Vandalia, Illinois</p>
<p>Private pilot Raymond Williams had just taxied out onto the runway to takeoff 
  for a night flight around the city when he spotted "a big orange light
  with a blinding intensity." It was then at the SW corner of the airport.
  After he radioed CAA officials in the tower the light disappeared. Later he 
  wrote, "Shortly after I had taken off I noticed the light again, approaching
  my plane. It came directly at me and then circled my plane twice before heading 
  for Greenville. I followed it and it made a circle around that town and came 
  back toward Vandalia." A commercial flight flying at 20,000 feet over Vandalia
  at the time was contacted and said he, too, saw the object.</p>
<p>"It was all very spooky," Williams said. "It wasn&#146;t an
  airplane but whatever it was the light was on the tail of it, and there was 
  a small red light on top. Probably it was some military craft from Scott Field 
  making a test run." The Air Force did not investigate the case further
  but relied upon several newspaper articles. (Vandalia Leader, August 30, 1951;

<p>7. September 15, 1951 Twilight UM 50 mi. W of Knoxville, Tennessee</p>
<p>Pilot A.S., 34, was flying an Air Force C-45 from Standiford Field, Louisville, 
  KY to Elgin AFB, Florida on an IFR flight plan with his FO and five passengers 
  on board. They were cruising at 6,000 feet altitude west of Knoxville heading 
  south when both pilots sighted "three large glowing orange colored "balls"
  (approaching) in a (equilateral) triangular pattern, (there was) no apparent 
  connection between objects. (They were) first observed dead ahead (and) then 
  suddenly observed along side, moving at the same (forward) speed as my aircraft. 
  (They) streaked off as I dipped my left wing toward (the) formation." They
  were brilliant, emitting off their own throbbing or flickering light, and their 
  edges were fuzzy in appearance. Each object subtended an angle of over twenty 
  degrees at one point and never changed shape. They did not break up into parts, 
  give off smoke or vapor or change color. They all disappeared from sight by 
  becoming smaller and smaller. This incident is not in Project Grudge files.

<p>8. October 21, 1951 1250L UP 20 mi. E Battle Creek, Michigan</p>
<p>The following near-air miss <a href="/org/us/dod/af/adc/CIRVIS.html">CIRVIS</a> report was evaluated by the Air Force as
   a balloon and lasted only from 3 to 5 seconds. Mr. N. Manteris was flying
  a 
  Navion propeller-driven aircraft (N-91424) in the central lower Michigan peninsula
   at an altitude of 4,000 feet. The weather was bright and clear with unlimited
  
  visibility horizontally but heavy haze underneath him. Then he saw an oval-shaped,
   disc-like, highly polished object which was closing with his aircraft at an
  
  extremely high rate of speed. As it passed beneath his aircraft he estimated
   its altitude at about 3,000 feet. He noted an indentation in its top surface
  
  which outlined a dome or crown. He immediately did a 180 degree turn but did
   not see the object upon completing his turn. Four hours after the encounter,
  
  Mr. Manteris was giving an interview to an Air Force investigator and (allegedly)
   said, "...in the past, he has often laughed at reports of strange flying
    objects, but is "through laughing since his experience." Mr. Manteris
     was reluctant to tell his story "for fear people will think I have
     lost  my marbles." He also said he was impressed the high degree of
     polished  brilliance of the object&#146;s surface. He saw no exhausts or
     vents on the  object or vapor emanating from it. The investigator determined
     that there were 
  no known Air Force aircraft in the vicinity at the time. (USAF Project Grudge

<p>  9. November 24, 1951 1553L UM Mankato, Minnesota</p>
<p>A Civil Air Patrol flight of two 5-51 Mustangs were at 25,000 feet heading 
  west in clear air. They were over Mankato in south-central Minnesota flying 
  at 210 kts. airspeed. One of the two pilots (Capt. William Fairbrother) spotted 
  a small white object which seemed to hang motionless in the air. Is shape was 
  similar to the Northrop flying wing but of considerably smaller dimensions (estimated 
  at eight feet). No trail or exhaust was seen coming from the object. Neither 
  the second pilot (Capt. Douglas Stewart) i.e., the "wingman" on his
  left side nor ground control intercept radar detected the object. The UAP passed 
  about 100 feet over and 100 feet to the left of the flight leader&#146;s aircraft. 
  The pilot executed an immediate 180 degree turn but, after doing so, could not 
  see the object again. A check with ground authorities showed that there were 
  no classified or other aircraft flights in that area and no meteorological conditions 
  reported that could explain this incident. The Air Force classified this case 
  as "Unidentified." (USAF Blue Book file)</p>
<p><br>
  10. March 1952 1430L UC Kirksville, Missouri</p>
<p>This 16 minute-long encounter took place en route to Kansas City, MO in the 
  afternoon with the cargo aircraft flying above a solid undercast. The Captain 
  of the TWA C-54 aircraft was the first to sight the silvery, disc-shaped object 
  out his left window. It was located several degrees above his left wing but 
  it was "...too far out to get a really good look at it." The object
  held its position for five to six minutes at a higher altitude before the pilot 
  decided to bank gently toward it (to try to find out what it was). The range 
  between them decreased for about 30 seconds but then the object began its own 
  left-hand turn. The FO felt that the object was nothing more than a balloon 
  of some kind. A third pilot in the cockpit also witnessed the object. "The
  pilot agreed halfway (with this assessment) - and since the company wasn&#146;t 
  paying them to intercept balloons, they got back on their course to Kansas City. 
  After resuming their original course, however, the object was still visible 
  off their left side but it wasn&#146;t falling behind them as a free-flying 
  balloon would do. The pilot then banked right 45 degrees. Then the object dropped 
  back a small angular amount and then seemed to accelerate forward, still flying 
  above their altitude. The pilot then flew the aircraft in a tight 360 deg. (right-hand) 
  circle "...and the UFO had followed, staying outside" (all the way
  around the circle!). Then the object seemed to be descending so the pilot added 
  full power and climbed several thousand feet to get above it. Then he banked 
  toward the object, now below the aircraft. With the C-54 in a long and accelerating 
  glide, the UAP descended even faster than before and finally disappeared into 
  the cloud layer below. The crew last saw the object climbing steeply past their 
  right wing and disappearing in several more seconds. (Ruppelt, E., The Report 
  on UFOs. Pp. 80-81, 1956)</p>

  11. April 9, 1952 1430L UM Shreveport, Louisiana</p>
<p>The witnesses to this near-air miss were the flight crew of an Air Force C-46 
  flying near Barksdale AFB, Louisiana. They were flying at 9,000 feet on a heading 
  of 90 degrees. They sighted a "disc-shaped, cream-colored" object
  about 30 to 40 feet in diameter ahead of them at about 4,000 feet altitude. 
  At one point during their approach the object seemed to "...turn into the
  easterly wind" and its velocity was estimated to be between 200 and 400
  mph. The Air Force&#146;s Project 10073 Record Card states, "As object
  closed on C-46 pilot made 360 deg. turn ... and climbed into clouds which were 
  at 12,000&#146;." The Air Force quickly scrambled two F-84 jet interceptors
  to investigate but their pilots reported negative results. (USAF Blue Book file)</p>
<p>12. April 14, 1952 1834L UM Memphis, Tennessee</p>
<p>This brief Air Force file report states that U.S. Navy pilots Lt. jg Blacky 
  and Lt. jg. O&#146;Neil reported seeing a UAP while flying over the NAS Range 
  Station near Memphis for between 45 and 60 seconds. They were on a heading of 
  18 deg. at 2,000 feet altitude when they first saw the other object approaching 
  them on their left side. It flew straight and level on a 300 deg. heading and 
  at 2,000 feet altitude beneath an overcast at 4,200 feet (visibility 15 miles). 
  Its shape was similar to an inverted bowl with slots running vertically from 
  top to bottom. It was glowing bright red. The two passed within about 100 yards 
  of each other! No further information is available. (USAF Air Intelligence Information

<p>13. May 8, 1952 0227L UC 600 mi. off Jacksonville, Florida</p>
<p>Pan-American Airlines Flight 203 from New York city to San Juan, Puerto Rico 
  (heading 180 deg.) had just passed over the San Juan Oceanic Control boundary 
  at 8,000 feet altitude well off the coastline of Florida. At the controls of 
  the DC-4 was Captain Cent and FO Gallagher. A solid overcast above 10,000 feet 
  and the sky was unusually dark because of it. Since they had been informed that 
  there were no other aircraft flying in the area they were not being particularly 
  alert for other traffic. The FO spotted a white light ahead and slightly to 
  the left of them as he turned to look out at their number four engine. It looked 
  like a taillight on an airplane and he was very surprised at its presence. It 
  seemed much whiter than a normal tail light. Then he looked at the number four 
  engine and back at the light which had not changed appearance in any way. Then 
  he checked the propeller controls, synchronized the engine rpm, and looked outside 
  again. As Ruppelt writes, "In the few seconds that he had glanced away
  from the light, it had moved to the right so that it was now directly ahead 
  of the DC-4, and it had increased in size." The FO then alerted the Captain
  to the light by pointing toward it. "Just at that instant the light began
  to get bigger and bigger until it was "ten times the size of a landing
  light of an airplane." It continued to close in and with a flash it streaked
  by the DC-4&#146;s left wing" by an estimated 1/8th to 1/4 mile. Then two
  smaller (orange) "balls of fire" streaked by them. The two men just
  sat there with a "...sort of sick, empty feeling" all over. Captain
  Cent (later) told the Air Force investigator, "I always thought these people
  who reported flying saucers were crazy, but now I don&#146;t know." The
  Air Force investigator on this case could not find any records of missile, aircraft, 
  or ocean going traffic at that time or location. Meteors also were ruled out 
  because of the overcast and low altitude. (Ruppelt, The Report on UFOs, Pg. 
  133-135, 1956)</p>
<p>14. June 20, 1952 2026L UM central Mississippi</p>
<p>Airplane Commander Lt. Milo Roberts and Lt. Julius Prottengeier (bombardier) 
  were assigned to the 380th Bombardment Squadron, 310th Bombardment Wing M at 
  Forbes AFB, Topeka, Kansas when this encounter occurred. They were in an Air 
  Force B-29 (No. 44-62204) on a routine training flight at 17,000 feet altitude 
  and flying at 190 mph. An object was seen approaching them at their 2 o&#146;clock 
  position "... at a high rate of speed." As the Air Intelligence Information
  Report states, "Airplane Commander attempted a left turn to avoid a collision,
  but aircraft was on C-1 autopilot and before action could be taken, object executed 
  sharp left turn and passed from line of sight." The other object was seen
  distinctly with sharp edges. It was a brilliant white and cone-shaped at the 
  rear and its body was about three times longer than it was thick. Its size was 
  estimated at from eight to ten feet long (if at 400 to 500 yards) or 100 feet 
  (if at 15 miles distance.) The nearest thunderstorms were 50 miles away and 
  a light haze lay beneath them. (USAF Blue Book file, IR-37-52)</p>
<p>15. July 11, 1952 Night UM Osceola, Arkansas</p>
<p>Two U.S. Navy aircraft based at Millington NAS near Memphis were participating 
  in a night training flight about ten miles NE of Osceola when they spotted an 
  object in the distance. Lt. J. Martin was flying one of the aircraft and said 
  (later) that he thought what they were seeing was a jet airplane distorted by 
  the glare off its aluminum body. He was the first to see the other object, then 
  about two miles away. It appeared to him to be a round ball. Over the course 
  of the following three minutes both aircraft got within about a mile of the 
  object. The other pilot was Lt. R. Moore who was flying with Mr. D. Wehner, 
  an electronics technician who caught the other object on his airborne radar 
  set. He claimed, "It was on our left and traveled across in front of us
  and disappeared in the distance to our right. I think it would be about 25 to 
  45 feet across and about seven feet high." They thought the object "...
  looked like a WW-1 helmet as seen from the side or a shiny shallow bowl turned 
  upside down. We wanted to follow it, but our training ships couldn&#146;t keep 
  up with the saucer, or whatever it was." The object was moving at an estimated
  200 mph and an altitude of 8,000 feet. (United Press wire story, July 12, 1952)</p>

  16. July 13, 1952 0300L UC SW Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>National Airlines DC-4 flight 611 was under the command of Captain W. Bruen 
  and was some sixty miles SW of National Airport and northbound from Jacksonville, 
  FL. The sky was clear with 15 miles visibility and only slight winds. The flight 
  crew saw a "round ball of bluish-white light... hovering to the west of
  the aircraft." The light then rose to the same altitude as the aircraft
  (11,000 feet) and stopped its climb; it then began moving parallel with the 
  aircraft&#146;s direction of flight off its left wing at the same speed. There 
  were separated by about two miles distance. When Captain Bruen turned on all 
  of his lights the object "...took off up and away like a star" at
  an estimated velocity of 1,000 mph. Neither the FAA nor the Air Force identified 
  other air traffic in the area nor other conditions which might account for the 
  sighting. And according to the official Air Force report of this incident, "no
  attempt to intercept or identify the object, has been reported." The flight
  crew made this report in accordance with JANAP 146. (USAF Air Intelligence Report 
  IR-410-52)</p>
<p><br>
  17. July 20, 1952 0330L UC Richmond, Virginia</p>
<p>Captain William Bruen, 37, and his FO, N. Dixon, were flying a National Airlines 
  flight toward Washington National airport and they had just begun their descent 
  when they spotted a "whitish-bluish light... hovering" over dark woods
  below them. As the captain said later, then the light rose up "to about
  our altitude and maneuvered around a little bit... it went out to our left side. 
  I thought it was some crazy airplane up there playing around with one light 
  on.... It stopped several times and hovered. Then I knew it wasn&#146;t any 
  airplane. It came back toward us, and I was worried that the thing might ram 
  us. I flashed on my lights, signaling to it. If you see another plane at night, 
  it will acknowledge that signal. But when I flashed at it, it turned and zipped 
  upward and disappeared off to the southwest. Went right up until it looked like 
  a star. I&#146;d say it was doing 1,500 to 2,000 miles an hour when it left 
  us." He estimated its nearest distance to the airplane to be about a mile
  and its size "somewhat smaller than a DC-4." At first the object looked
  round but during its later approach the witnesses could make out a "star-blue
  color" in its middle with a white surround. Its body had no wings but was
  round and flattened. The total sighting duration was about four minutes. (Fort 
  Walton (Florida) News, July 24, 1952; The Savannah Georgia Press, July 24, 1952)</p>
<p><br>
  18. July 22, 1952 2200L UP 10 mi. W. of Crossett, Arkansas</p>
<p>Private pilot A. Hanks was flying a light aircraft from Little Rock, Arkansas 
  to Monroe, Louisiana and had reached the state border almost due north of his 
  destination. There he sighted a "blood red star" some 2,000 feet higher
  than his own altitude approaching on his left-hand side. It traveled in a generally 
  SW direction at about 100 mph but unexpectedly changed its course to parallel 
  that of his aircraft (approx. heading of 175 degrees). He said (later to a reporter), 
  "I thought at first it was an illusion. To test my theory, I made a 90
  degree right turn. The "flying saucer" did the same. The thing followed
  my course for about 10 minutes, then suddenly swooped down approximately 2,000 
  feet below my plane. At first, I believed it to be a jet. After that swift drop, 
  I changed my line of thinking." The red light followed his airplane flying
  beneath it, then, several minutes later, it suddenly rose back 2,000 feet above 
  him. Then "it" began to accelerate at a tremendous rate of speed in
  its original SW heading. (Monroe, La. World, July 25, 1952)</p>

  19. July 24, 1952 1540L UM Carson Sink, Nevada</p>
<p>The two Air Force officers who reported this near-air miss were Lt. Col. John 
  McGinn, 34, Deputy of Operations, Fighter Branch, USAF Headquarters and Lt. 
  Col. John Barton, 34, USAF Headquarters, AFOOP-OP-D. They were flying in a B-25 
  bomber (No. 8860) having taken off from Hamilton AFB, California on Green 3 
  Airway; they were just east of Carson Sink, Nevada at 11,000 feet and 185 kts 
  air speed. It was a clear day with excellent (50 mile) visibility when they 
  both sighted a tight grouping of three "arrow-head" shaped objects
  in "perfect formation" at their one o&#146;clock position. Each was
  silver white and slightly larger than an F-86 jet fighter and had a ridge running 
  along its upper surface and each was seen clearly and sharply. They flew directly 
  in front of the B-25 in a continuous bank only from 400 to 800 yards ahead! 
  Both observers said that they are familiar with "... the latest U.S. experimental
  aircraft and these objects do not conform to any of them." (USAF Blue Book
  file)</p>
<p><br>
  20. August 13, 1952 Night UP near Dallas, Texas</p>
<p>This encounter was reported by Max Jacoby, Chief Pilot for Pioneer Airlines 
  who, with Captain J. McNaulty, FO, was flying an empty commercial aircraft on 
  a routine test flight. Unfortunately, not many details are given. When his aircraft 
  was 15 to 25 miles from Love Airfield, Jacoby spotted a strange looking light 
  in the distance. He decided to chase it to find out what it was. But each time 
  he drew near to it "it eluded him and finally disappeared." The light
  turned and dove down but the appearance of its body "...did not change
  when it turned... I couldn&#146;t tell whether it was just a light or a light 
  coming from some object," he said. Jacoby said he delayed telling about
  the incident "because he feared he would be ridiculed." (United Press
  wire story, August 15, 1952)</p>
<p><br>
  21. Autumn 1952 2200L UC Trenton, New Jersey</p>
<p>An Eastern Airlines (Martin 404) flight from Washington, D.C. to Boston, MA 
  was at 9,000 feet on a NE heading in very clear weather (the western sky was 
  still very light). Its airspeed was 225 kts and everything seemed normal. Then 
  both Captain John Warner, 33, and his FO sighted a yellowish light at their 
  9 o&#146;clock position about ten miles away. It seemed to be heading toward 
  them (approximate heading to SE) at their altitude and speed. As it drew closer 
  the captain radioed New York Airways Traffic Control Radar at Islip, Long Island 
  about the possibility of other unscheduled air traffic. Ground radar succeeded 
  in detecting the other object but could not contact it by radio. Now both pilots 
  could make out an "incandescent yellow elliptical shape" without any
  firm detail. The other object had no red or green navigation lights and simply 
  passed in front of their aircraft about a mile ahead and, shortly thereafter, 
  began a 30 degree vertical climbout on the same heading as before. Its color 
  changed from yellow to a blue-white as it accelerated upward. Radar confirmed 
  that the object was accelerating (about 800 mph) as it climbed over Fort Dix. 
  The entire near-air miss lasted three or four minutes. Neither Warner nor his 
  FO reported the event either to his company or the Air Force "...because
  of the climate of ridicule prevalent at the time." (Webb, W. 1952 Radar
  - Visual. The APRO Bulletin, Vol. 27, No. 7, pg. 1, January 1979)<br>

<p>22. 13 Septembre 1952 1940L UP Allentown (Pennsylvanie)</p>
<p>Le pilot d'un Beechcraft Bonanza volait à 10000 pieds d'altitude de Allentown
  vers la station OMNI de Caldwell-Bright. La visibilité était de 12 miles environ avec la présence de quelque brume au sol. Soudain il voit un <q>gros</q> objet en forme de <q>ballon de rugby</q> (de football américain)  (environ 3 pieds de long) en face de lui à la position haute de ses 11 h.
  It was "flaming orange-red in color." Its distance was judged to be
  from 150 to 200 yards and descending at a 30 degree angle. In the pilots own 
  words, "My first impression was that it was a "falling star"
  and that I was on a collision course with it. I immediately pulled up into a 
  sharp climb to avoid hitting it; but the object, instead of continuing on it&#146;s 
  (sic) downward course, very suddenly pulled up into about a 65 deg. climb and 
  went directly over my windshield. I quickly made a 180 to the right but could 
  no longer see the ball of fire. If the object was at the distance and was of 
  the size that it appeared to me to be, I would estimate it was travelling at 
  better than 700 miles an hour." This sighting lasted less than 15 seconds.

<p>23. December 4, 1952 2046-2053L UM 8 mi. SW, Laredo, Texas</p>
<p>This very near-air miss event took place after Lt. Robert Arnold, piloting 
  an Air Force T-28 aircraft had been carrying out a training flight for two hours. 
  He was tired and radioed Laredo tower for permission to land. But due to other 
  conflicting air traffic he had to circle at 6,000 feet outside of the traffic 
  pattern several miles away. Then he saw a bright bluish-white glowing light 
  source below him (at about normal traffic altitude) which climbed rapidly to 
  his level. It had no position or navigation lights of any kind. In order to 
  keep it in sight he "steepened his turn to the left." Then it suddenly
  rose to about 9,000 feet in several seconds and dove back to his level. The 
  astonished pilot then added full power and tried to chase the light. At one 
  point he realized that the object was flying straight toward him at such a high 
  rate of speed he didn&#146;t have time to turn out of the way. As author Keyhoe 
  (Pg. 26, 1954) described the event, "Three hundred feet away, the machine
  wavered for a split second. Then it flashed to one side, hurtling past his right 
  wing, so fast it was only a blur." According to the Air Force&#146;s investigative
  report, at one point, "The object then turned Eastward and immediately
  descended to the pilot&#146;s altitude of 6,000&#146; again and proceeded Eastward 
  until approximately 6 miles SE of the base again and it seemed to stop as if 
  it were hovering, going straight away or coming straight toward the pilot&#146;s 
  aircraft. At this time the pilot added full power and proceeded directly SE 
  toward the object. The pilot&#146;s intentions were merely curiosity. Approximately 
  2 seconds after this action was taken by the pilot, the object appeared to close 
  at a terrific rate in a head-on approach. At approximately 100 yards in front 
  of the pilot&#146;s a/c the object seemed to waver slightly in a vertical plane 
  as if determining on which side of his aircraft to pass. The object passed very 
  closely off the left wing of the a/c within 50 yards distance and the pilot 
  noted a blurred reddish-bluish haze of undetermined size and shape but definitely 
  no larger than his a/c. This action happened so rapidly that the pilot was unable 
  to take any evasive action.... At this point, out of sheer fright, the pilot 
  turned off all his running lights and spiraled steeply to the left, keeping 
  the object in sight and leveled off at 1500." The object then appeared
  to level off from a descent towards the pilot&#146;s aircraft, turned sharply 
  to the right and then rose up into the atmosphere until it was out of sight. 
  Other intriguing details are omitted here except to point out that the Air Technical 
  Intelligence Center&#146;s conclusion was that the pilot had seen another aircraft! 
  In a letter dated April 12, 1961 from the skeptic and noted astronomer, Dr. 
  Donald Menzel, to Maj. Robert Friend (ATIC) he wrote, "... I think he (the
  pilot) was still seeing Venus." (USAF Blue Book file; Keyhoe, D., Flying
  Saucers from Outer Space. Hutchinson, London, 1954)</p>
<p>24. December 10, 1952 1915L UM Hanford, Washington</p>
<p>The pilot and radar observer of an Air Force F-94 interceptor on patrol over 
  the Hanford Atomic Plant were at 26,000 feet altitude when they sighted a light 
  in the darkened sky. When they reported the light to their air intercept officer 
  they learned that no aircraft were known to be in the area; then they initiated 
  a standard approach. Upon closing with it, they saw a "large, round, white
  "thing" with a dim reddish light coming from two "windows."
  They also established a radar (ARC-33) lock-on but lost visual contact with 
  it. As they attempted to approach it "...it would reverse direction and
  dive away. Several times the plane altered course itself because collision seemed 
  imminent." (USAF Blue Book file; Ruppelt, E., The Report on UFOs. pg. 43,
  1956).</p>
<p>25. February 13, 1953 2030L UM Vichy, Missouri</p>
<p>The three witnesses to this pacing incident were Captain Robert Bailey, his 
  FO, and the crew chief of their C-47 Air Force aircraft. They were at 7,000 
  feet altitude, 170 kts. airspeed, and on a heading of 43 degrees. The captain 
  first sighted a small diameter, round light as they neared the Vichy Radio Range 
  Station. The light changed intensity and looked like it was on a converging 
  course (238 degree bearing from aircraft&#146;s position) and would (eventually) 
  collide with their aircraft. He turned his landing lights on to try to signal 
  to it and pointed it out to the other two men present. The light then stopped 
  its approach and flew off their left wing at an estimated range of one mile 
  while changing color from red through amber to green. After between five and 
  ten minutes the light dropped back, increased its speed, "... and made
  three dives and zooms on a course parallel to that of the aircraft before disappearing."
  When contacted about the sighting Vichy radio indicated no aircraft in that 
  area. The official Air Force explanation was that the three trained observers 
  had been misled by the planet Venus. (Gross, L. UFOs: A History, 1953, January 
  - February, Pg. 83; USAF Blue Book file)</p>
<p>26. August 6, 1953 1700-2400L UM Barbers Point, Hawaii</p>
<p>An estimated seventy five objects with lights on them were seen by many witnesses 
  on the ground around Barbers Point Naval Air Station, Pearl Harbor, from the 
  airport control tower, and from the air. Many of the objects also were detected 
  by radar. At 9 o&#146;clock the crew of a Navy patrol aircraft reported three 
  head-on passes by a UAP. These close calls alarmed the pilot so much he landed 
  immediately at Barbers Point airfield. Jet fighters were also scrambled and 
  the same night the pilot of a TV-1 interceptor saw a "glowing blob"
  rising rapidly toward him. It came to a sudden stop just behind his aircraft 
  then accelerated briefly until it was beside him for four more seconds before 
  accelerating away out of sight at several times his own top speed. (Keyhoe, 
  The Flying Saucer Conspiracy. Henry Holt &amp; Co., NY. Pp. 63, 182, 1955)</p>
<p>27. August 9, 1953 n/a UM Moscow, Idaho</p>
<p>This near-miss incident involved three USAF F-86 jet fighters flying near Moscow, 
  Idaho. The pilots saw a large (estimated 200 foot diameter) disc descending 
  toward them on a head-on approach. Just as it would have struck at least one 
  of the aircraft the object jerked aside out of the way. (Hall, The UFO Evidence, 
  pg. 41, NICAP, 1964)</p>
<p>28. October 19, 1953 0010L UC 33 mi. NE Baltimore, Maryland</p>
<p>An American Airlines DC-6 was en route to Washington, D.C. from Philadelphia 
  at cruise altitude (8,000 feet) just after midnight. The lights of Baltimore 
  were clearly visible below and to their right side. The FO first saw a light 
  ahead of them which was alternately covered by wisps of cloud and then visible 
  again. It seemed to gleam in the moonlight. The object had no running lights 
  and was closing rapidly at their own altitude. Captain J. Kidd yelled, "Give
  him the landing lights!" He also reduced his power. As soon as the FO had
  switched on their own landing lights the oncoming object sent a "blinding
  light back at the DC-6." Now temporarily blinded by the intense light the
  captain pushed forward on the control wheel and the aircraft went into a rapid 
  dive. "Caught unaware, the passengers were tossed about the cabin, several
  suffering (minor) injuries." After he pulled out of the dive (at 5,000
  feet) he angrily radioed to Washington National Airport air traffic control 
  to complain about the near miss. He was told that "...no known air traffic
  was supposed to be in his vicinity and said medical personnel would meet the 
  plane upon arrival." Both crewmen said that the object was huge, at least
  as large as their own aircraft. (Washington Post, October 20, 1953; Keyhoe, 
  Flying Saucer Conspiracy, Pp. 60-62)</p>
<p>29. March 24, 1954 Afternoon UM Fresno, California</p>
<p>The Secretary of the Air Force was in an airplane en route to Palm Springs, 
  CA when this pacing incident took place. The aircraft was above Fresno at cruise 
  altitude (at least 5,500 feet) when everyone on board saw a "large metallic-looking
  object following their plane in a position about a 1,000 feet below and a like 
  distance behind." Secy. Talbot ordered the pilot to turn around, but when
  the aircraft banked the UFO made a "tight little orbit and streaked away
  at an incredible speed." No report on this important event could be found
  in the USAF Blue Book files. (Gross, L. E. , UFO History 1954: January-May,

<p>Capt. Dan Holland, 33, was flying a U.S. Marine jet of the Third Marine Aircraft 
  Wing at an altitude of about 26,000 feet over the Air Force&#146;s guided missile 
  range near Banana River in the afternoon. The flight of three aircraft he was 
  a part of were passing to the east over the Atlantic Ocean coast at Ft. Lauderdale 
  when he sighted a "round unidentified object" about twice the size
  of his own aircraft. It seemed to descend vertically out of the sky "like
  a falling star." Later he said, "I moved out of the way - thought
  the thing was going to hit us, and called to the others to look... It startled 
  me by suddenly stopping 3 or 4 thousand feet above us. It looked like a gleaming 
  white ball with a gold ring around the lower 1/3 of the ball... Then the thing 
  accelerated faster than anything I&#146;ve ever seen before and disappeared 
  to the East at an amazing speed in about 15 seconds. We were doing over 400 
  and it made us look slow. I always thought anyone who said he saw a flying saucer 
  should have his head examined, but I&#146;m damned convinced now that saucers 
  exist."</p>
<p>At one point he allegedly banked toward it and activated his gun camera but 
  the UAP suddenly flew away toward the east "at a tremendous speed."
  The other pilots in his flight who were flying ahead of him did not see it.

<p>Captain J. Schidel and his crew on United Airlines flight 193 were at an altitude 
  of 5,000 feet in clear weather when he reported a near-miss with an "unidentified
  craft." He testified to the Civil Aeronautics Board that a "huge bulk
  came at him out of the blackness." It had one red light on its right side
  which appeared just before what he felt was an "unavoidable head-on collision."
  The frightened pilot put his aircraft into a rapid, steep bank causing some 
  of his passengers and a stewardess physical injuries. "It was in sight
  just two seconds and made no movement to avoid me," he said. Local ATC
  personnel said there were no other aircraft in the area at the time. (Gross,

<p>32. June 23, 1954 2100L UM 10 mi. SE of Columbus, Ohio</p>
<p>The pilot of an Ohio Air National Guard F-51 fighter, Lt. Harry Roe, Jr. was 
  flying from Dayton to Columbus, Ohio at 240 mph on routine training flight when 
  he said he was "followed in close formation by a (round, white) light for
  more than 30 minutes. He performed various maneuvers in an attempt to either 
  lose the light or collide with it; however, it remained in relatively the same 
  position to the aircraft ("a little above and behind him")."
  The sky was still illuminated by some twilight but there was no moon. The unidentified 
  light eventually departed to the SE. During the sighting Lt. Roe thought he 
  was seeing a jet aircraft but he never observed any exhaust flame or light. 
  The Air Force investigators concluded that he had seen a light reflected into 
  his eyes off the surface of his own canopy. Due to intense interest in the case 
  shown by the local press the Air Force carried out "a complete investigation."
  The results of this complete investigation are not a part of the official Blue 
  Book file, however. If the light had been an Air Force aircraft they would have 
  likely offered that explanation to the press. (USAF Blue Book file)</p>
<p>33. September 26, 1954 2104L UC Altoona, Pennsylvania</p>
<p>This pacing incident involved a United Airlines DC-6 (flight 606) at FL190 
  and a ground speed of 382 mph. The crew sighted one object approaching them 
  that was flat on its bottom and rounded on top. It was the color of "fire."
  Captain Picune reported that it flew parallel with his aircraft for about a 
  minute and then pulled forward at "tremendous speed" disappearing
  from sight in the east. Unfortunately, the estimated separation distance from 
  the airliner was not given. The Air Force&#146;s speculation was that it was 
  a "possible aircraft" but also concluded there wasn&#146;t enough
  data for an evaluation to be made. (USAF Blue Book file)</p>
<p>34. November 19, 1954 2104L UC 130 mi. SE New Orleans</p>
<p>A National Airlines flight (Aircraft N918) was at 17,500 feet altitude flying 
  direct to Tampa, FL. on a heading of about 105 degrees. The night was dark but 
  forward visibility was not particularly good (about 10 miles) when the flight 
  crew saw a light flashing blue and white and moving up and down and remained 
  directly in front of their aircraft at an unknown distance. They watched this 
  phenomenon from between three to five minutes when it then disappeared by moving 
  to the NE until it was out of sight. Later the captain was contacted by Air 
  Force investigators and he claimed he had seen a star. This explanation is found 
  wanting if the light actually moved to the NE as the captain claimed. (USAF 
  Blue Book file)</p>
<p>35. January 1, 1955 0544L UM 30 mi. W of Cochise, New Mexico</p>
<p>This display of aerial maneuverability certainly captured the attention of 
  two Air Force pilots in their B-25 bomber. The instructor pilot sighted the 
  object first and pointed it out to his student. The object looked like "two
  pie tins placed together at their rims... metallic, and large" (est. 120
  - 130 feet across). During the seven minute-long sighting the UAP flew along 
  with the aircraft it changed its attitude. It rolled so that they could see 
  its top surface and also its side view. Finally it disappeared. The Air Force 
  investigators labeled the object "Unidentified." (USAF Project 10073
  Record Card and file)</p>
<p>36. January 29, 1955 2107L UM Winterset, Iowa</p>
<p>This sighting involved two air national guard pilots, Major A. Packer (132nd. 
  Fighter Bomber Group) and Lt. D. Myers in a T-33A jet (52-9590). It was a clear 
  (100 mile visibility), dark night. The Iowa ANG report stated that they were 
  travelling on a heading of 030 degrees at 290 kts. near Des Moines, Iowa when 
  they sighted a white light which varied in intensity at a constant frequency 
  and which subtended an angle of about 1.5 degrees arc. It made a direct, head-on 
  pass at the jet in level flight at 20,000 feet altitude. At the last instant 
  the object rose and flew over the jet, "climbing rapidly to 35,000 feet."
  When the pilot tried to chase the object it out climbed and out turned him. 
  The sighting lasted about 25 seconds. An Air Force investigator wrote, "It
  would appear in retrospect that the object was able to maintain contact with 
  the observer aircraft by other than visual means...". "The object
  was highly maneuverable and showed some understanding of tactical maneuvers 
  and used the excess speed and altitude to his advantage in every case."

<p>37. February 1, 1955 0655L UM 20 mi. E. Cochise, Arizona</p>
<p>An instructor pilot and his student in a TB-25 bomber (44-86894) were in level 
  flight at 13,000 feet altitude on airway Green 5 under a bright moonlit night 
  sky. Their ground speed was 238 mph. Then they saw a very bright, round object 
  showing red and white hues about five degrees arc above the local horizon. At 
  one point it subtended an angle of between six and ten degrees arc diameter. 
  It approached them and hovered off their left wing for about five minutes before 
  departing at an "extremely high speed" in a steady climb maintaining
  its parallel track (it took about three minutes to disappear from sight). This 
  is another USAF Unidentified object. (USAF Blue Book file)</p>
<p>38. June 16, 1955 2300L UC 40 mi. NE Springfield, Missouri</p>
<p>A Flying Tiger Airlines scheduled flight was at cruise altitude northeast of 
  Springfield, Missouri when this event took place. The sky was dark; the flight 
  crew sighted a blue-white disc travelling at "tremendous speed." At
  first it only looked like it was moving toward their aircraft but then ended 
  up circling the airliner "in a tight turn." Then the object tilted
  up steeply and accelerated out of sight. His radio report to CAA authorities 
  was to be only one of dozens that night from Chicago to Baltimore. (Keyhoe, 
  The Flying Saucer Conspiracy, pg.270-271, 1955)</p>
<p>39. December 11, 1955 2100L UC,UM Jacksonville, Florida</p>
<p>The crews of two separate airlines and witnesses on the ground saw a "fast-maneuvering,
  round, orange-red object." When two U.S. Navy jets (on a practice night-flying
  mission) were vectored to the area by a Jacksonville NAS controller they tried 
  to approach it. But the object suddenly rose up to 30,000 feet altitude and 
  then dove back down in a circle, buzzing the jets. Everything was detected on 
  military radar. (Hall, The UFO Evidence, pg. 32, 1964)</p>
<p>40. May 22, 1956 2305L UM 50 mi. NW of Monroe, Louisiana</p>
<p>Earl Holwadel, 25, USAF, was in the front seat of a T-33 jet and an unnamed 
  officer in the back seat during a night flight. Their heading was 50 degrees 
  at 18,000 feet altitude when they both noticed a bright light due east of them 
  travelling in a southerly direction. Holwadel decided to investigation the object 
  and banked right toward the SE somewhat behind the object which was now seen 
  in the SE from their location. The UAP looked like it was a great distance away 
  at this time. "Suddenly it came straight at the observer (sic) at a rapid
  rate of speed.... The witness (sic) stated they crossed the rear of the object, 
  experienced no wash, and then moved to the south of it. The object moved away 
  and then returned at high speed on a westerly course. As the aircraft cruised 
  in front of the object, odd and extremely bright lighting which did not resemble 
  lighting of any known aircraft was observed. The shape (of the object) could 
  not be clearly determined at that time....". The object&#146;s maneuverability
  was "fantastic and it never appeared to change its flight attitude at any
  time during the encounter. "Mr. Holwadel stated that his aircraft passed
  under the &#145;nose&#146; of the object at a distance of approximately 75 yards 
  and on a heading of 330 deg., at which time an intensely bright white light 
  flashed from the object, lighting up the canopy of the aircraft." A sketch
  of the UAP made by the main witness showed a bulky, squat cross-section, shorter 
  than a C-47 aircraft but wider. the overall length of the elliptical-shaped 
  object seemed to be about 30 to 40 feet. It had no visible wings but only stubby 
  protrusions extending out from the edge of the object perhaps three to four 
  feet long and 25 feet long on each side. Its bottom surface looked like it was 
  made of steel with "ribs extending (downward) two to four feet and creating
  a wave-like impression." The meaning of this is unclear. The bright white
  light came from what looked like a "greenhouse-shaped dome" or cockpit
  window at its front end. One small, steady red running light was seen centered 
  on the main body of the object. (USAF Air Intelligence Information Report 2D-UFOB-2-56)</p>
<p>41. August 16, 1956 0145L UC Azores (Atlantic)</p>
<p>This near miss incident took place at 4,000 feet altitude while Eastern Airlines 
  flight 49 (DC-4) was en route to Laguardia, NY from POU. Their westerly heading 
  carried them over the Atlantic Ocean. The flight crew sighted the strange light 
  for from 20 - 25 minutes time and then radioed a near miss with the "bright
  white light" which was seen initially to the west of their course. According
  to the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/adc/CIRVIS.html">CIRVIS</a> report (No. 170232Z) received through New York ARTCC," the
  object passed within 40 ft. of aircraft coming in from above and below. The 
  meaning of this is unclear but suggests multiple passes made by the UAP. The 
  pilot took "evasive action" according to the report.</p>
<p>42. November 1956 2300L UC Hickory, North Carolina</p>
<p>This near-miss with a UAP took place with a commercial aircraft flying from 
  Laguardia Airport, NY to Atlanta at FL130 in a dark sky. Captain Dick Russell, 
  FO, provided this (abbreviated) account of what happened. "He (the Captain)
  told me that he had seen UFOs a number of times before, but I&#146;d almost 
  forgotten, and all at once, he said, "Dick, look there!" And I looked
  up, out his windscreen and I saw an object which was saucer in shape, in fact 
  like two saucers, one on top of the other, and ... uh... it was kind of an indefinite 
  milky-green type of shape, almost an indefinite type of shape, and it was sitting 
  there motionless. And I looked at him, wondered, ... I was stunned, and I said, 
  "What is that?" And about that time it zoomed across the front of
  my windscreen and stopped and then flew off at about a forty-five degree angle. 
  Very high speed. I could not understand what it was. I said, "What in the
  world was that?" He said, "Well, now you&#146;ve seen one." He
  says, "You can&#146;t tell anybody because they think you&#146;re nuts."
  Well, I was about as convinced today as I was that night." "I&#146;ve
  not seen one since." ("Pilots in Peril," interview for Fox TV
  production, Hollywood, CA, March 6, 1994)<br>

<p>43. November 14, 1956 2210L UC 60 miles from Mobile, Alabama</p>
<p>This close encounter received wide press coverage and intensive investigation 
  and still remains as a classic example. Captain W. Hull had 17 years of flying 
  experience and 15,000 hours flying time when he and his FO Peter MacIntosh were 
  flying Capital Airlines flight 77 from Laguardia Airport, NY to Mobile, Alabama 
  in a Viscount aircraft. Their heading was to the SSW and they were above a cloud 
  layer only broken occasionally. Then they saw what looked like a "brilliant
  meteor" falling diagonally downward from left to right. The light decelerated
  rapidly but did not burn out or explode as they had expected. Rather, it came 
  to an abrupt halt directly ahead of them. Hull said, "It was an intense
  blue-white light, approximately 7 or 8 times as bright as Venus when this planet 
  is at its brightest magnitude. Pete shouted, "What the hell is it, a jet?"
  His first thought, of course, was that the object was a diving jet fighter which 
  had turned sharply away from us and in departing, was giving us a view right 
  up its glowing tailpipe. Instantly I knew that could not possibly be an airplane. 
  "</p>
<p>Captain Hull then radioed Mobile Control Tower asking about their visibility 
  of his aircraft and the strange light. They cannot due to the cloud cover. He 
  went on, "It is directly ahead of us and at about our altitude, or slightly
  higher. We are right over Jackson, Alabama and have descended to 10,000 feet."
  He then requested that Mobile contact the USAF tower at Brookley Field some 
  20 miles to the SE to see if their military radar showed anything. "Just
  after this exchange, the object began to maneuver. It darted hither and yon, 
  rising and falling in undulating flight, making sharper turns than any known 
  aircraft, sometimes changing directions 90 degrees in an instant. All the while 
  the color remained constant, a brilliant blue-white, and the object did not 
  grow or lessen in size. MacIntosh and I sat there completely flabbergasted at 
  this unnerving exhibition." Very soon thereafter the light "...began
  another series of crazy gyrations, lazy 8&#146;s, square chandelles, all the 
  while weaving through the air with a sort of rhythmic, undulating cadence, the 
  likes of which neither Pete nor I had ever seen." The light then "shot
  out over the Gulf of Mexico, rising at the most breathtaking angle and at such 
  a fantastic speed that it diminished rapidly to a pinpoint and was swallowed 
  up in the night." Captain Hull completed his signed statement with these
  words, "I am seeking no publicity. I didn&#146;t report this sighting to
  the press and not a word has ever been printed about it until this moment."

<p>44. March 8, 1957 2145L UC Pasadena, Texas</p>
<p>Victor Hancock was piloting a DC-3 aircraft belonging to the Tennessee Gas 
  Transmission Co. from Beaumont to Houston on a heading of about 250 degrees 
  and an altitude of about 1,500 feet when this incident took place. In the right 
  seat was Guy Miller, FO. Unexpectedly, an object with three very bright lights 
  on it crossed in front of them travelling from south to north. Then the object 
  came to a stop and maintained station with their aircraft (within a quarter-mile 
  distance) for an undisclosed period of time before continuing on its way in 
  the night sky. Its lights were so bright that the two men could not see its 
  outline shape and it had no navigational lights at all. It did not move like 
  an airplane moves. Miller said, "When it wanted to, it kept ahead of us
  easily. It would stop, or seem to stop, just under us. We would bank around, 
  get close to it and it would be gone again." Hancock estimated its size
  to be "at least the size of our plane." The pilots watched as the
  object then flew toward the main runway at Ellington Air Force Base, cutting 
  across military traffic. When it reached a point about 200 feet above the runway 
  it then departed out of sight to the south. The encounter was also allegedly 
  picked up by airport radar at Houston International Airport. (The Times, NY,

<p>Capt. Matthew A. Van Winkle, First Officer (FO) Dion W. Taylor, and Flight 
  Engineer (FE) John Washuta were flying Pan-American DC-6 flight 257 with forty 
  four passengers from New York to San Juan, Puerto Rico. They were on autopilot 
  flying at 19,000 feet altitude, 290 kts. airspeed and were about 350 miles NE 
  of Jacksonville, FL [ 32 deg. 35&#146;N; 80 deg. 30&#146; W]. Bound for a stop 
  in Miami, the aircraft was on a southerly heading. Suddenly to their right front 
  all three flight crewmen sighted a glaring, white, dazzling light with a pale-green 
  tinged (core) with "an outer ring which reflected the glow from the center."
  (NICAP report) It approached them at high speed. Several passengers who weren&#146;t 
  asleep also saw the approaching light. The light source was variously described 
  as a "round," "large, glaring spot light," "magnesium-flash
  white," "burning greenish-white appearance," "brilliant,
  greenish-white object," "clearly circular-shaped object," "not
  a meteor." "When it got closer," (Van Winkle) said, "he
  had noticed it was not shaped like any known jet." (UP wire story, March
  9, 1957)</p>
<p>"It appeared to fly in level flight from the SW to the NE Capt. Van Winkle
  later said, "Instinctively, I thought it might be another plane heading
  straight toward us (so) I pulled the plane up and to the side... Since it was 
  on automatic pilot, apparently I forced it too much and all the forty-four passengers 
  except one or two who had belts fastened, came out of their seats and rolled 
  on the floor." (Ibid.) Another account stated that three passengers and
  a stewardess were injured when the pilot "took violent evasive action"
  climbing sharply about 1,500 feet to avoid a possible collision with the object. 
  The air crew radioed a <a href="/org/us/dod/af/adc/CIRVIS.html">CIRVIS</a> report (following Joint Chiefs of Staff regulation
  J-146). According to Air Force report UFOB-702-101, their investigators found 
  that the luminous object was roundish (sic) or oval in outline and the angular 
  size of a basketball held at arm&#146;s length, or about 20 degrees diameter! 
  It appeared "bright green" with four exhausts protruding downward,
  the angular length of each being about one-fourth the diameter of the object.</p>
<p>The pilots of at least seven other aircraft spanning 300 miles all en route 
  to Puerto Rico also saw the luminous object with sightings that ranged from 
  seconds to three minutes. Air Force officials said that it was not a missile 
  but rather a "seldom-seen form of a meteor, a &#145;bolide,&#146; often
  referred to as a fireball." (USAF Blue Book Report). Interestingly, an
  article in the New York Journal - American stated that an unofficial report 
  said a jet intercept task force accompanied by a radar plane was sent aloft 
  to investigate from a strategic air command fighter base in the south. Reports 
  from the air crew of the other six aircraft flying along the same route to Puerto 
  Rico also were analyzed by Air Force investigators.</p>
<p>46. March 27, 1957 2035L UM Roswell, New Mexico</p>
<p>The pilot of an Air Force C-45 (Lt. Sontheimer) was flying near Roswell at 
  an unknown altitude when he looked out his left-hand window and noticed three 
  bright lights in a tight formation. Each was round and brilliant white and about 
  the angular size of an aircraft landing light (at an unspecified distance). 
  His official USAF report submitted to the Project Blue Book office stated: "The
  pilot of the C-45 claims that when he realized the objects were on a collision 
  course with him he immediately flashed his taxi lights on. One of the objects 
  shot straight up in the air above him the other two continued on passed in front 
  of aircraft. When the pilot flashed his taxi lights the objects immediately 
  blacked themselves out thereby disappearing from sight." (USAF Blue Book

<p>47. June 3, 1957 2135L UC Shreveport, Louisiana</p>
<p>Trans-Texas Airlines flight 103 had departed Shreveport Airport headed for 
  Lake Charles, 166 miles to the south. They were climbing to 9,000 feet altitude 
  in the dark night sky when the control tower operator called the Captain&#146;s 
  attention to a small white light nearby the airplane. Its captain was Lynn Kern, 
  34, and FO, Abbey Zimmerman, 32. The time was about 2135L. The pilots saw an 
  "unidentified object" approaching them from their 2 o&#146;clock position
  "at a tremendous speed and 10 o&#146;clock high. It then "...settled
  down and paralleled his course all the way to Lake Charles. Soon a second object 
  appeared on the opposite side of his aircraft. Each appeared as a blue-green 
  pulsating light and kept pace with their aircraft which was flying at 165 mph.; 
  these objects paced the airplane for virtually its entire trip at a slightly 
  higher altitude. "Captain Kern blinked his lights at the objects, objects
  lights flared extremely bright then went back to normal." Upon reaching
  Converse, LA the pilot radioed ground radar at England AFB (Alexandria, LA) 
  and reported the objects. Air Force personnel said that they had two targets 
  in his approximate area at 9,700 feet. A radar controller stated that since 
  he saw "...nothing unusual about (the) sighting." he did not file
  a report. The Air Force summary pointed out that there was heavy B-47 aerial 
  refueling operations in the area at the time. Interestingly, a tower operator 
  at Shreveport Municipal Airport viewed both objects through binoculars until 
  the aircraft and accompanying objects were out of sight. The lights disappeared 
  from sight in a cloud deck to the SW. This report is one of the USAF&#146;s 
  Unidentified Cases. (USAF Blue Book file)</p>
<p>48. July 17, 1957 1132L UP Eagle Lake, Texas</p>
<p>This close encounter with a domed disk occurred with a Cessna 172 was at 1,500 
  feet altitude climbing to 4,500 feet at 80 mph while travelling VFR from Eagle 
  Lake to Palacios near the Gulf of Mexico. According to the signed witness form 
  from the pilot, C.M., 26, he and his passenger Mr. C. C. were in bright daylight 
  with broken cumulus clouds covering about one-tenth of the sky. The passenger, 
  a Church of Christ pastor, was learning to fly. Unexpectedly, they saw a very 
  strangely shaped object appear almost directly ahead of them moving up and to 
  their right. The sharply edged object was pointed at its left- and right-hand 
  ends (7.5:1 width to thickness ratio) with a low, rounded dome on top. The object&#146;s 
  length subtended an angle that was almost as wide as one-half of the forward 
  windshield! Its surface appeared metallic and its dome glass or plastic. "It
  was a vehicle foreign to this planet," he wrote. It remained in view for
  about sixty seconds before departing. The pastor was so upset, "...that
  he stopped flying the aircraft. I had to take over...". He stopped all
  further lessons after this event took place. (Pilot report form)</p>

<p>A commercial airliner (flight 655) was flying from Dallas, TX to Los Angeles, 
  CA when a near miss occurred. The other unknown object was described by Captain 
  E. Bachner "at least the size of a B-47" jet aircraft but other than
  that he could not identify it. Because of the evasive maneuver which the captain 
  felt necessary to carry out two passengers were injured and had to be taken 
  to a hospital upon landing. There were no known aircraft in the area at the 
  time. (Lorenzen, C. and J. Lorenzen, UFOs: The Whole Story. pg. 79, Signet Books,

<p>50. July 24, 1957 2215L UC Amarillo, Texas</p>
<p>TWA flight 21 from New York to Phoenix at FL180 had reached northern Texas 
  when Captain G. Schemel saw red and green lights suddenly appear ahead of him 
  at his altitude on a collision course. The sky was dark with thin scattered 
  clouds. Although visibility was greater than 15 miles the flight was operating 
  under IFR conditions. According to the CAA report, eight of the passengers and 
  two hostesses on board were thrown into the aisles and suffered minor injuries 
  when he dove 500 feet to avoid hitting the oncoming object. "One elderly
  lady was thrown against the ceiling, receiving a bad head cut. Seven additional 
  passengers and two hostesses received bad head bumps and bruised hips and legs."
  (Anon, 1957) The unidentified object quickly passed above his aircraft and out 
  of sight. The Civil Aeronautics Board investigation of this close encounter 
  could locate no military, commercial, or private aircraft an the area at the 
  time. (Anon., Scientists say near collisions may involve space vehicles, UFO

<p>51. October 23, 1957 2015L UC Pampa, Texas</p>
<p>Two commercially rated pilots were flying a charter flight in a Beechcraft 
  Bonanza from Kansas City, Missouri to Albuquerque during this event. Emerson 
  Goff was flying with Harold Briggs, his passenger, about 10 miles NW of Pampa, 
  Texas under clear, dark (no moon) skies when they sighted an "exceptionally
  bright star" slightly above their altitude and about 30 degrees on their
  left side. They were descending through 12,000 feet MSL on a heading of 210 
  degrees. At first, they estimated its range from them at about 40 to 50 miles, 
  perhaps over Estelline or Silverton, Texas. However, very soon the light seemed 
  to approach them at a high rate of speed, its apparent size increasing rapidly. 
  And, as it became larger and larger, they could just see a "faintly solid
  elliptical shape with an apparently rounded upper portion," explained Goff.
  It was now about five to eight miles in front and perhaps 3,000 to 4,000 feet 
  above them. "It was "lit up" so brilliantly in a bluish, greenish,
  white brilliance that it was really hard to discern just the exact shape it 
  did have." It drew near to their aircraft and "maneuvered sharply...
  at high speeds." Then the light suddenly rose vertically an estimated 8,000
  to 10,000 feet very quickly and leveled off and continued flying horizontally 
  to the NW. The object did not change its attitude at any time during these maneuvers. 
  The two astonished pilots watched it disappear into storm clouds about 30 to 
  40 miles to the NW. This encounter lasted about six minutes. At no time did 
  the UAP change color or shape or emit a smoke or vapor trail. (The UFO Investigator, 
  Vol. 3, No. 10, October-November 1966, Center for UFO Studies, Chicago, Illinois).</p>
<p>52. June 9, 1958 1017L UM central Puget Sound, Washington</p>
<p>1st. Lt. Charles Scharf, 25, of the 318th Fighter Interceptor Squadron at McCord 
  AFB, near Tacoma was flying an F-102 (No. 1425) on a heading of 180 degrees 
  and between 40,000 and 50,000 feet altitude and about 600 mph during this incident. 
  The weather was clear and visibility was unlimited. He then observed a cylindrical 
  shaped object (12:1 length to width ratio) that was pinkish-white and had a 
  dark circle in its center. The object was first seen at 30 degrees elevation 
  above his own altitude. It seemed to oscillate as it approached his position 
  at a high rate of speed. It isn&#146;t known whether either of these motions 
  were objective object motion, aircraft motion, or a combination of both. The 
  pilot banked left "to keep it in sight" and noticed that the object
  continued north and then appeared to climb, decelerate, and perform a "large
  360 degree orbit." The UAP then circled the F-102 three separate times
  as it descended toward him. "It finally pitched up 45 degrees altitude
  (sic) and accelerated in a climb, rapidly disappeared on a northwest heading."
  Then the pilot descended and returned to base. The object was not detected on 
  ground radar; the pilot did not check his on-board radar for contact during 
  the event. The official Air Force explanation for this object was a "balloon."
  A U.S.Navy "Sea Balloon" had been launched twenty minutes earlier
  and was claimed to have reached an altitude of 40,000 feet by the time this 
  sighting took place. What was overlooked or ignored were the following reported 
  facts: (1) the cylindrical shape of the UAP, (2) the visual oscillations of 
  the UAP, (3) the decelerations and accelerations of the UAP, (4) the relatively 
  low wind velocities at that time and place, and (5) the 45 degree pitch up maneuver 
  prior to departing. (USAF Project Blue Book file, Incident: NC-4320)</p>
<p>53. November 4, 1958 2103L UM Pope AFB, North Carolina</p>
<p>The pilot of a KB-50 USAF tanker was in the downwind leg of the traffic pattern 
  during a ground controlled approach to Pope AFB about to make a night landing 
  when he noticed an object on a collision course. He and his flight crew also 
  noticed that "strange lights were observed in his cockpit while he was
  on the final approach...". [Note: The Air Force file does not discuss this
  further] He executed a go-around maneuver and climbed in altitude to await the 
  disappearance of the object. Air Force tower personnel also saw the UAP hovering 
  above the airport, watching it through their binoculars for twenty minutes. 
  They are convinced it was not an atmospheric phenomenon of some kind. They said 
  that "the UFO presented a hazard to aircraft operating in the area. (USAF
  Blue Book file - WDO-INT 11-WC23)</p>
<p>54. July 4, 1961 2215L UP NW of Akron, Ohio</p>
<p>Private pilot Ernest Stadvec, a B-29 bomber pilot in WW-2 and owner of a flying 
  service had strange encounters on two consecutive nights. He was flying NW of 
  Akron with two passengers on Tuesday night, July 4th at about 2215 local time 
  when they saw a brilliant green and white light appearing above them and to 
  their right side. They were at 5,000 feet altitude. He said, "The object
  we saw dived at us on a collision course to the extent that I actually called 
  out to my passengers that the object was going to ram us... After the object 
  came at us it reversed course and climbed rapidly into a clear night sky."
  He went on, "This happened again the next night [about the same time and
  altitude] when the object flashed up in front of us and again climbed into a 
  clear sky. In both instances, the object climbed at tremendous speeds, leveled 
  off and disappeared to the northwest." Radar at Cleveland Hopkins Airport
  detected a "meteor-like" object for several minutes. (Hall, R., The
  UFO Evidence. pg. 43, NICAP, Wash. D.C., 1964)</p>
<p>55. February 7, 1963 2345L UP Charlottesville, Virginia</p>
<p>Carl Chambers, pilot, and his passenger John Campbell were about 95 miles SW 
  of Washington, DC en route to Pennsylvania in a light aircraft when they noted 
  a star like light in the night sky which seemed to be flying toward them. After 
  his encounter the pilot estimated the yellow-white light was about three feet 
  in diameter. Concerning its flight dynamics he wrote, "After noting that
  its altitude and position changed rapidly, I radioed the Washington FAA and 
  reported the incident.... For nearly an hour after, we stayed in contact with 
  Washington. During that time, the object hovered off the right wing [easterly] 
  and moved toward, under, and above the aircraft. Then it dropped off and a few 
  minutes later appeared about 35 miles south of Washington...". Chambers
  was told by the FAA that another pilot in the area had reported a similar event 
  at that time. (Hall, The UFO Evidence, NICAP, Pg. 43, 1964)</p>
<p>56. August 18, 1964 0529L UM 200 miles E. Dover (Atlantic Ocean)</p>
<p>This USAF Project Blue Book air-visual case is interesting because of the apparently 
  intelligent responsive behavior of the UAP to the behavior of the pilots of 
  a C-124 cargo (aircraft 31007 assigned to the 31st. ATS, 1607 ATW). Briefly, 
  at least four crew members on a flight out of Dover AFB at 9,000 feet altitude, 
  200 mph true airspeed, sighted a round, diffuse-edged self-luminous object ahead 
  of and about 500 feet below them on a collision course. The object was visible 
  for about two minutes as they were flying between layers of scattered clouds. 
  Lt. J. F. Jonke and a Major who were in control executed an evasive maneuver, 
  turning from 260 degree heading to 340 degree heading while maintaining their 
  altitude. As the airplane turned the UAP turned right and disappeared. They 
  called Boston Center and were told no other aircraft were in the area and no 
  radar contact was made with the other object. [AF IN : 10417 (20 Aug 64)E/der]

<p>57. January 3, 1965 Dusk UC East Coast, USA</p>
<p>Capt. Bill Williams, FO, Ed Dynes, and FE, Charley Booth (all pseudonyms) were 
  flying a four-engine Electra of a major airline on a commercial flight toward 
  a large eastern city when this incident took place. The captain was a former 
  military pilot with a total of 25 years flying experience. The flight crew sighted 
  what they thought was another aircraft as they neared their destination but 
  it unexpectedly changed its course and approached them head-on. The object was 
  huge and delta-shaped and was only seen by a black silhouette against the dwindling 
  skylight. "I called out &#145;What the hell is it?&#146; ... Somebody said
  &#145;Good God!&#146; ... It started to turn away, then as suddenly as it had 
  appeared it departed... It disappeared at a tremendous speed - a speed of several 
  thousand miles per hour. I did not report to the tower because I did not feel 
  it was a near miss with a conventional aircraft.... And also because of the 
  ridicule that was heaped on Captain Pete Killian of American Airlines,"
  said the captain. (UFO Investigator, Vol. 3, No. 2, April-May 1965, Center for

<p>58. April 25, 1966 2052L UP Near Ocala, Florida</p>
<p>Captain Fred Sharrer, Herbert Bates (FO), Frank Stockton, (executive assistant 
  to the Governor of Florida), Governor Haydon Burns, Capt. Nathan Sharron, State 
  Patrol Officer, four newspaper reporters, and three others were the witnesses 
  to this prolonged close encounter at 6,000 feet altitude. They were in a Convair, 
  propeller driven aircraft flying at 230 mph during a campaign-related flight. 
  It was a clear, moonlit night. Two yellow-orange luminous spheres of light side-by-side 
  (dumbbell shape) kept exact pace on the right side of their aircraft for about 
  forty miles distance during their flight from Orlando to the Capital at Tallahassee. 
  Passengers in the rear of the airplane saw the luminous globes for from three 
  to five minutes while the flight crew watched them for about ten minutes duration. 
  At one point Governor Burns asked his pilot to "turn into it." As
  the pilot did so the thing rose at a steep angle and quickly disappeared from 
  sight. Its distance from the airplane wasn&#146;t determined but some of those 
  on board estimated the UAP to be at a near distance while others at a great 
  distance. (Clearwater (Fl.) Sun, April 26, 1966; Kalamazoo Gazette, April 27,

<p>59. May 21, 1966 1515L UP Willow Grove, Pennsylvania</p>
<p>This two-witness, daylight, near-miss with a domed disk incident at 4,500 feet 
  altitude was carefully investigated by many people including the noted atmospheric 
  physicist Dr, J. McDonald. William Powell was flying in his Luscombe single 
  engine propeller-driven aircraft with his passenger, Muriel McClave. They were 
  touring the Philadelphia area and were only about five miles NW of Warminster 
  when they sighted a domed disk at their 11:00 o&#146;clock position. It looked 
  like it had been following several Navy jets that had just taken off from Willow 
  Glen Naval Air Station field. But suddenly it changed its course (without banking) 
  and approached their small airplane, passing on their right side by only about 
  100 yards. The object did not appear to rotate or have any exhaust. The disc 
  was "dayglo red" with a low, white glistening dome centered on its
  top surface. This account is adapted from McDonald&#146;s testimony before the 
  Committee on Science and Astronautics of the U.S. House of Representatives on 
  July 29, 1968. (Anon., 1968)</p>
<p>60. January 1967 Night UP SW New Mexico</p>
<p>Jimmie Moran, a passenger on a Lear Jet 23 en route to Las Vegas, NV from Houston, 
  Hobby Airport, Texas was the first to sight the bright red light associated 
  with a sharply defined object ahead of them at their 10 o&#146;clock position 
  in the dark sky. He was seated on the left-hand side of the passenger cabin. 
  Flying at FL410 to the NW just beyond jetway J-86 which ended at El Paso, the 
  pilot, Carl M., filed for a direct flight to Winslow (AZ) on a heading of 300 
  degrees. He was delivering the new aircraft to its owner. An unnamed FO was 
  also on board and saw the UAP which kept pace with the jet off its left-hand 
  side for 29 minutes. Their airspeed was 300 kts. (Mach 0.82).</p>
<p>In the pilot&#146;s own words, "I told Jimmie and the other passengers
  in the back, that maybe it was a light on a weather balloon. A few minutes later 
  my passengers called me again, saying the bright red light was moving, so I 
  told them that the light was in a military flight training block, so it might 
  be a military plane."</p>
<p>"The light had a red ray below the light towards the ground and about
  2000 ft. below the first light, a second oval light appeared, then a third light, 
  and then a fourth," said Capt. M. "Each had a red ray of about 2000
  ft. from one to the other. Then the lights retracted one at a time until there 
  was one light shining bright red. Then it ran the lights down again, but at 
  a 40 degree angle. And then retracted the lights the same way." Capt. M.
  then radioed Albuquerque Center to inquire if they showed any aircraft at their 
  9 to 10 o&#146;clock position. They replied they did not have any transponder 
  signal there." At this moment the UAP&#146;s light extinguished for 30
  seconds and came back on again. "Then Albuquerque Radar (AR) called me
  and said they had the object on their radar"... 39 miles west of our aircraft
  and moving at the same heading. Next Albuquerque Radar contacted a National 
  Airlines DC-8 then over Casa Grande, AZ heading for Houston and learned from 
  its captain that "...he had been watching the light and said it did everything
  the Captain on the Lear Jet said it was doing. AR asked the DC-8 captain if 
  he would like to make a "UFO" report, and the captain said no. AR
  asked the captain for his name, and he told them it was none of their damn business."
  It was at this point that the frightfully close near miss occured.</p>
<p>In the pilot&#146;s own words, "AR called me to tell me the object was
  closing in on me, and before they finished telling me, the vehicle was so close 
  that the blips on the radar screen became one. [The captain&#146;s sketch of 
  his cockpit window outline shows the UAP filling at least 75 percent of the 
  window&#146;s forward area!] The red light was so bright that when I looked 
  up from the instrument Panel and would look back at the panel my eyes were having 
  trouble ajusting (sic) each time to the panel white lights. At this close formation 
  the encounter lasted 29 minutes.... My passengers in the back were hollering 
  at me to get them away from the object... After a few minutes the bright red 
  light of the vehicle went out, but I could not get a good look at the vehicle, 
  because my eyes couldn&#146;t adjust to the darkness before the vehicle turned 
  the bright light back on. Then the vehicle slowed down [meaning unclear] to 
  the point that I pulled away from him. The passengers were overjoyed when the 
  light went behind the left engine... But that was short lived. The vehicle passed 
  us up at a speed so that the red light was trailing the object like a comet 
  for as much as 150 yards. It slowed down again, which allowed me to overtake 
  the vehicle at Winslow. We both made a left turn over Winslow at 41,000 feet. 
  The UAP remained with the jet to beyond Flagstaff (where the aircraft was now 
  under Los Angeles Center control which, the captain learned, also had the UAP 
  on their radar). The captain said, "My passengers were still hollering
  and in a panic for me to get them away from the vehicle. The UAP finally accelerated 
  to the west at a 30 degree climb angle when we were only fifteen minutes from 
  landing at Las Vegas. No official inquiry was made of this high altitude encounter.

<p>61. October 27, 1967 0300L UP NE Jacksonville (Atlantic Ocean)</p>
<p>This fascinating aerial encounter involved Charlie Little, pilot of a Piper-Twin 
  Commanche PA-30 (N7942Y). He was multi-engine rated and a flight instructor. 
  Two other commercially rated pilots, and a passenger were also on board. Having 
  taken off from Opa-Locka, FL to Morristown, NJ, they were headed ENE at 8,000 
  feet altitude in uncontrolled airspace under an IFR flight plan but were in 
  radio contact with Jacksonville ARTCC for safety reasons. Stars were visible 
  in the dark sky. Ground control helped them maintain a correct heading when 
  their two VORs apparently displayed significantly large angular deviations toward 
  the east. About half-way between Jacksonville and Charleston, SC over the ocean 
  at least three of the occupants saw a light moving across the sky and interpreted 
  it to be a commercial flight at high altitude bound for Miami. But the light 
  began to descend and approach their airplane. The pilot radioed radar control 
  to inquire if any other traffic was seen in their vicinity (now at their one 
  o&#146;clock position high and seemingly southbound). The answer was "negative."</p>
<p>Little turned his landing and taxi lights on. He said (later), "As the
  light came closer and closer, it was very apparent that we were going to pass 
  very close and that the aircraft was not making any move to avoid us."
  He then asked for permission to descend immediately... "We may need all
  the way to the deck immediately." He received permission to do so even
  though permission was not legally required. Under the circumstances, he was 
  probably trying to set an example of extra-safe procedures for the benefit of 
  the other two pilots on board. Little then disengaged the autopilot, pulled 
  the throttle back and pushed the wheel forward "...trying to avoid a head-on
  collision. We descended to 6,500 feet but the lights came closer and closer."
  Then they saw not one but six, huge, round, bright, white lights in a (horizontal) 
  row. "A collision seemed imminent. Panicking, I yelled, &#145;We can&#146;t
  get away from him!&#146; The situation seemed hopeless; there was no way to 
  avoid him. We were all going to die because the pilot in the other craft wasn&#146;t 
  paying attention." Little had to shield his eyes with his hands the lights
  were so intense. "Suddenly, a soft green light was all over our cockpit."</p>
<p>At the very instant of collision, "...the craft made an unbanked 180 degree
  turn, remained ahead for a few seconds and then "took off and disappeared
  like a flash bulb."" At least two of the witnesses agreed that the
  huge object was a gray equilateral triangle, each side at least 200 feet long 
  and twenty feet thick. Its outer edges were very smooth and sharply defined 
  (with no rivets, doors, antennae, windows, etc.) while at its center there was 
  a triangular-shaped opening or hole large enough to fly through. It flew with 
  one side directly forward. "As a pilot, I did not believe in UFOs but we
  had just had a near mid-air collision with one!" When Little told radar
  control what had just happened he was met with ridicule. Later he recalled, 
  "I became very angry and threw the microphone on the floor instead of hanging
  it on the clip... We all knew we had just seen a UFO but we didn&#146;t know 
  what to say. We were afraid that if we told anybody we would lose our pilot&#146;s 
  licenses. This was very important to us because we were all hoping to become 
  commercial airline pilots. It could be the end of our careers." Investigator
  Smith also discovered that Little was told by radar control that a United B727 
  captain allegedly had just reported the same shaped object over Washington (about 
  535 miles away)! I could not locate any record of this other claimed sighting 
  which isn&#146;t surprising given the continuing attitude of derision shown 
  toward air crew by authorities on the ground and the understandable reticence 
  to report bizarre aerial sightings.</p>
<p>One final word is appropriate. Is it possible that Jacksonville radar was actually 
  tracking the UAP and not the aircraft when the several clock-wise deviating 
  VOR "events" were taking place? It isn&#146;t clear whether the aircraft
  had a transponder (they were relatively expensive at the time) so that ground 
  radar might have had only a weak return from the aircraft&#146;s skin paint. 
  Indeed, broadband radar in the 1960s wasn&#146;t particularly effective when 
  it comes to a non-transponder equipped aircraft. The far larger radar "skin
  paint" return from the triangular object might have been significantly
  larger than that of the aircraft. If true, this would explain the progressive 
  clockwise deviation of the ground radar&#146;s track that also corresponded 
  with the south-bound movement of the UAP before it apparently changed its heading 
  to approach the aircraft. (Smith, W., A huge "open" triangular UFO,
  International UFO Reporter, Pp. 4-6, Sept./October 1984, Center for UFO Studies,
