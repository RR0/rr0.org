<h2>Caractéristiques</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Le système d'affichage d'information 3270, avant l'arrivée du PC, est la manière dont presque tout le monde de
    l'entreprise s'interfacent avec un ordinateur. </li>
  <li>The 3277 terminal was a non-graphical (text only) monochrome (black screen with green letters) display that
    buffered data so that key strokes could be saved until the ENTER key was pressed. (Previous terminals sent every key
    stroke immediately to the computer to which the terminal was attached.) The 3277 was also field-oriented rather than
    line-oriented which meant that a program could write an output data stream to the terminal based on
    application-oriented fields rather than having to create the display output line by line. A number of 3277s could be
    attached to a control unit or cluster controller which in turn was attached to an IBM mainframe computer. Terminals
    could be attached to the computer on a relatively high-bandwidth local link called a channel or remotely over a
    telecommunication link that was either dedicated (usually a leased line) or dial-up. </li>
  <li> After the personal computer arrived with its own self-sufficient operating system and applications, it gradually
    replaced the 3270 system in much of the corporate world (although there almost certainly are some working 3270s in
    use as this is being written). A 3270 terminal became the most prominent example of what became known as a "dumb
    terminal," since it relied entirely on its attachment to a mainframe (and sometimes a minicomputer) for its
    "brains." The PC attached to a mainframe then became known generically as an "intelligent workstation." It could run
    its own programs independently of the mainframe and it could also interface with mainframe applications. There was
    one product attempt to blend the two, called the 3270 PC.</li>
  <li>The terminals themselves were the 3277 (which attached to a control unit), a 3275 standalone terminal (for
    locations where only a single terminal was needed), the 3278 (a sleeker version of the 3277), and the 3279 color
    terminal. The control units were the 3271 (channel attachment), 3272 (telecommunication attachment), and the 3274 (a
    control unit with a smaller form factor that could handle up to 32 terminals). For about 15 years, the 3270 family,
    one of IBM's most successful products ever, was a ubiquitous feature of offices the world over. The PC changed all
    that.</li>
  <li>However, many thousands of corporate legacy application programs written to interact with users at 3270s are being
    used from PCs equipped with software known generally as 3270 emulators. TN3270 is a program that provides PC users
    remote (Telnet) connection to an IBM computer that is running 3270 applications.
