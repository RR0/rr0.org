<p>ON another occasion also, when the blessed man was living for some days in the province of the Picts, he was obliged
  to cross the river Nesa (the Ness); and when he reached the bank of the river, he saw some of the inhabitants burying
  an unfortunate man, who, according to the account of those who were burying him, was a short time before seized, as he
  was swimming, and bitten most severely by a monster that lived in the water; his wretched body was, though too late,
  taken out with a hook, by those who came to his assistance in a boat. The blessed man, on hearing this, was so far
  from being dismayed, that he directed one of his companions to swim over and row across the coble that was moored at
  the farther bank. And Lugne Mocumin hearing the command of the excellent man, obeyed without the least delay, taking
  off all his clothes, except his tunic, and leaping into the water. But the monster, which, so far from being satiated,
  was only roused for more prey, was lying at the bottom of the stream, and when it felt the water disturbed above by
  the man swimming, suddenly rushed out, and, giving an awful roar, darted after him, with its mouth wide open, as the
  man swam in the middle of the stream. Then the blessed man observing this, raised his holy hand, while all the rest,
  brethren as well as strangers, were stupefied with terror, and, invoking the name of God, formed the saving sign of
  the cross in the air, and commanded the ferocious monster, saying, ‘Thou shalt go no further, nor touch the man; go
  back with all speed.’ Then at the voice of the saint, the monster was terrified, and fled more quickly than if it had
  been pulled back with ropes, though it had just got so near to Lugne, as he swam, that there was not more than the
  length of a spear-staff between the man and the beast. Then the brethren seeing that the monster had gone back, and
  that their comrade Lugne returned to them in the boat safe and sound, were struck with admiration, and gave glory to
  God in the blessed man. And even the barbarous heathens, who were present, were forced by the greatness of this
  miracle, which they themselves had seen, to magnify the God of the Christians.</p>
