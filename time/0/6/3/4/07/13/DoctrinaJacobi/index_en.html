<span class="note">This "Doctrina Jacobi" Greek Christian polemical tract has a controversial dating from the early
  7th century to the late 8th century <a class="source"

    in <span class="people">135</span> AD, after the Second Jewish Revolt or Bar Kokhba Revolt</span> sometime

<p>When the candidatus [i.e., Sergios, commander of the Byzantine army in Palestine] was killed by the Saracens, I was
  at <span class="place">Caesarea</span> and I set off by boat to <span class="place">Sykamina</span>. People were
  saying <q>the candidatus has been killed,</q> and we Jews were overjoyed. And they were saying that <span
    class="people" title="Mohammed">the prophet</span> had appeared, coming with the Saracens, and that he was
  proclaiming the advent of the anointed one, the Christ who was to come. I <span class="note">Abraamès</span>, having
  arrived at Sykamina, stopped by a certain old man well-versed in scriptures, and I said to him: <q>What can you tell
    me about <span class="people" title="Mohammed">the prophet</span> who has appeared with the Saracens?</q> He
  replied, groaning deeply: <q>He is false, for the prophets do not come armed with a sword. Truly they are works of
    anarchy being committed today and I fear that the first Christ to come, whom the Christians worship, was the one
    sent by God and we instead are preparing to receive the Antichrist. Indeed, Isaiah said that the Jews would retain a
    perverted and hardened heart until all the earth should be devastated. But you go, master Abraham, and find out
    about <span class="people" title="Mohammed">the prophet</span> who has appeared.</q> So I, <span class="people">Abraham</span>,
  inquired and heard from those who had met him that there was no truth to be found in the so-called <span
    class="people" title="Mohammed">prophet</span>, only the shedding of men's blood. He says also that he has the keys
  of paradise, which is incredible <span class="source">Doctrina Jacobi V.16, 209. [p. 57]</span>.
