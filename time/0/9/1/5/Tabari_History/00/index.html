<p>THE HISTORY OF PROPHETS AND KINGS (Ta'rikb al-rusul wa'l- muluk) by Abu Ja'far Muhammad b. Jarzr al-Tabari (839-9231,
  here rendered as the History of al-Tabari, is by common consent the most important universal history produced in the
  world of Islam. It has been translated here in its entirety for the first time for the benefit of non-Arabists, with
  historical and philological notes for those interested in the particulars of the text.</p>
<p>Al-Tabari's monumental work explores the history of the an- cient nations, with special emphasis on biblical peoples
  and prophets, the legendary and factual history of ancient Iran, and, in great detail, the rise of Islam, the life of
  the Prophet Muhammad, and the history of the Islamic world down to the year 9r5. The first volume of this translation
  will contain a biography of al- Tabari and a discussion of the method, scope, and value of his work. It will also
  provide information on some of the technical considerations that have guided the work of the translators.</p>
<p>The <em>History</em> has been divided into 38 volumes, each of which covers about two hundred pages of the original
  Arabic text in the Leiden edition. An attempt has been made to draw the dividing lines between the individual volumes
  in such a way that each is to some degree independent and can be read as such. The page numbers of the original in the
  Leiden edition appear on the mar- gins of the translated volumes.</p>
<p>Al-Tabari very often quotes his sources verbatim and traces the chain of transmission (isl; dd) to an original
  source. The chains of transmitters are, for the sake of brevity , rendered by only a dash (-) between the individual
  links in the chain . Thus, according to Ibn Humayd- Salamah-Ibn Is4aq means that al-Tabari received the report from
  Ibn Humayd who said that he was told by Ibn Isbaq, and so on. The numerous subtle and important differences in the
  original Arabic wording have been disregarded.</p>
<p>The table of contents at the beginning of each volume gives a brief survey of the topics dealt with in that
  particular volume. It also includes the headings and subheadings as they appear in al- Tabari's text, as well as those
  occasionally introduced by the translator.</p>
<p>Well-known place names, such as, for instance, Mecca, Baghdad, Jerusalem, Damascus, and the Yemen, are given in their
  English spellings . Less common place names, which are the vast majority, are transliterated. Biblical figures appear
  in the accepted English spelling. Iranian names are usually transcribed according to their Arabic forms, and the
  presumed Iranian forms are often discussed in the footnotes.</p>
<p>Technical terms have been translated wherever possible, but some, such as dirham and imam, have been retained in
  Arabic forms. Others which cannot be translated with sufficient preci- sion have been retained and italicized as well
  as footnoted.</p>
<p>The annotation aims chiefly at clarifying difficult passages, identifying individuals and place names, and discussing
  textual difficulties. Much leeway has been left to the translators to in- clude in the footnotes whatever they
  consider necessary and helpful.</p>
<p>The bibliographies list all the sources mentioned in the annotation.</p>
<p>The index in each volume contains all the names of persons and places referred to in the text, as well as those
  mentioned in the notes as far as they refer to the medieval period. It does not include the names of modem scholars. A
  general index, it is hoped, will appear after all the volumes have been published.</p>

This volume covers approximately the last two and a half years of the Prophet's life. Al-Tabari's account is full of graphic details and vivid descriptions which makes it delightful to read. In many instances, the narrative seems as though it must have been expe- rienced directly. The animated dialogues, turns of phrases in re- ported speech, moments of humor-all these seem redolent of his literary talent. An effort has been made in the translation to pre- serve the original flavor without sacrificing the English idiom.
Al-Tabari's account of this period is derived mainly from Ibn
IsI aq's (d. ca. 1150/767) Shah, one of the main sources for the
subject. The original version of the Shah, which was transmitted
through several riwayahs, did not survive.* What we have is an
abbreviated, annotated version edited by Ibn Hisham (d. ca.
218/833) based on the riwdyah of Ziyid al-Bakka i (
d. 183/799),
who lived in al-Kufah . The Shah version used by al-Tabari, on the other hand, is based on the riwayah of Salamah b. Facil al-Abrash al-Angari (d. 191/806), who lived in al-Rayy. This explains the variants, as al-Tabari's text is carefully collated with Ibn Hi- sham's Sirah. Despite a number of variants and some minor addi- tions and omissions, it is worth noting that, on the whole, there is remarkable agreement between the two riwayahs. The stories of
*Segments of this original work found in the Qarawiyy-in library of Fez (trans- mitted through the riwayah of Yimus b. Bukayr), and the Zahiriyyah library of Damascus (transmitted through the riwayah of Muhammad b. Salamah al- Harrani), edited by Mul?ammad Hamidullah, have been consulted and collated.

xii Translator's Foreword
Abu Dharr al-Ghifarn and 'Adi b. Hatim al-Tayyi', the account of the Tamim deputation, and the Prophet's letter to the kings of
Himyar, are just a few cases in point.
Al-Wagidi (d. 207/823) is another authority very frequently
quoted by al-Tabari. All these references are collated with his Kitab al-Maghazu. The latter provides more details, especially about the expeditions. The story of 'Urwah b. Masud al-Thagafi, who came to the Prophet and accepted Islam after the siege of al- Ta'if, is also more graphically depicted . It is from al-Wagidi that we learn that the people were not happy when the Prophet decid-
ed to end the siege of al-'Wa'if and depart without the victory. He further states that they had to be persuaded by Abu Bakr and 'Umar that the Prophet in so doing was merely acting under di- vine instructions. All the verses revealed about the expedition of Tabiik are likewise listed separately.
In addition to Ibn Ishaq's Shah and al-Wagidi's Kitab al- Maghazi, the translation is collated with Ibn Sa'd's (d. 230/845) al-Tabagat, especially the biography of the Prophet in the first two volumes, and with the first volume of al-Baladhuri's (d. ca. 279/892) Ansab al-ashraf, dealing with the Prophet's life. A number of other sources, such as Ibn Shabbah's (d. 262/875) Ta'- rikh al-Madinah al-munawwarah, al-Ya'qubi's (d. 284/897) Ta'- r.kh, al-Mas'iidi's (d. 345 / 956) Muruj al-dhahab and al-Tanbih
wa'1-ishraf, Ibn al-Atbir's (d. 630/11233) al-Kamil, and Ibn Kathir's
al-Sirah have been consulted . All the major variants as well as additions in the above sources have been noted in the footnotes. Minor variants of verbal forms, prepositions, and dif- ferences of words of nearly the same meaning, which do not radi- cally affect the translation, have been ignored. Full references to Ibn Ishaq, al-Wagidi, Ibn Said, and al-Baladhuri are given at the first citation in each context. Although I have benefitted greatly by A. Guillaume's translation of the Shah, it is not referred to in the footnotes simply to save space, except where the comments are made expressly by him.
Most of the authorities listed in the isnads are identified from the standard biographical dictionaries, such as Ibn Sa'd's al-Taba- qat; Dhahabi's (d. 748/11347) al-'Ibar, Mizan, and Tadbkirah; and Ibn Hajar's (d. 852/1449) al-IIabah, Tahdhib, and Lisan. All the geographical areas and place names have likewise been identified
(d. 774/ 11373)

from the works of al-Hamdani (d. 334/945), aI-Bakri (d. 487/1094), and Yaqut (d. 626/1229). Genealogies of the tribes and clans have been verified from the works of Hisham al-Kalb-1 (d. ca. 204/819) and Ibn Hazm (d. 456/1064). For historical geography and topography, recent works of A. Musil, H. Sr. J. B. Philby, H. al-Jasir, and A. al-Wohaibi have been consulted. For the life of the Prophet, the biographies of F. Buhl, T. Andrae, W. M. Watt, M. Gaudefroy-Demombynes, and M. Rodinson have been referred to. On disputed questions, every effort has been made to cite the latest opinion or interpretation.
Finally, I would like to thank Vincent Cornell for reading a major part of the translation, and for giving his thoughtful sug- gestions, amendations, and criticisms. I also wish to thank Hasanuddin Hashmi for elucidating some difficult and obscure passages. For any inadequacies, I alone am responsible.
I would like to thank Ahmed Nassef and Mohammad Atho
Mudzhar for their help in proofreading.
