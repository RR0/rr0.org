Concerning the affairs of the Messenger of God, the Muslims, and the [clans ofj Hawazin, we have received an account on the au- thority of both 'Ali b. Na$r b. 'Ali al- Jah4ami3 and 'Abd al-Wanith b. 'Abd al-$amad b. 'Abd al-W3rith4-'Abd al-$ amad [b. 'Abd al-
r. A large North Arabian tribe or a group of tribes . They were bitterly hostile to Quraysh because of the trade rivalry between Mecca and al -'fa'if, since they were either the inhabitants of the latter city or in close alliance with its people . E12, s.v. Hawi zin; Kalbi, /amharah, 115. See below n. it.
2. A deep and irregular valley where the great battle took place . It is situated at a day's journey from Mecca on the road to al-Ti'if. E12, s.v. Hunayn; Hamidullah, Battlefields, 42-43. Watt's remarks in his Muhammad at Medina, 70-72, give proper perspective to this expedition, as both Hawi zin and Thaqif were old en- emies of Quraysh due to the trade rivalry. Lings, Muhammad, 304-6, gives a vivid description of the battle.
3. 'Ali b. Na$r b.'Ali b. $ahbin b. Abi al-Jah4anni al-Ba$n died in 187/802-3. Ibn Hajar, Tahdhib, VII. 390.
4. Died in 252 / 866-67 . Ibid., VI, 443-44.

2 The Last Years of the Prophet
Warith]5-Aban al-'Attar6-Hisham b. 'Urwah7-'Urwah:8 The Prophet had been staying in Mecca9 during the year of its con- quest for only a fortnight1° when [he received the news that the clans of] Hawazin and Thaqif" [were marching against Mecca and] had already encamped at Hunayn intending to fight him. Hunayn is a valley next to Dhn al-Majaz.12 Both the aforemen- tioned tribes had assembled before [their march] after hearing about the Messenger of God 's departure from Medina,13 thinking that he was intending [to invade] them. When they learned that he had occupied Mecca, Hawazin marched against him [to Mecca] with their women, children, and possessions. Their leader was Malik b. 'Awf14 from the Bann Na$r.'s [The clans of] Thagif joined forces with them and encamped at Hunayn intending to fight the Prophet. When the Prophet, still in Mecca, was informed
about them he decided to march against them .16 He met them at Hunayn, and God, the Great and Mighty, inflicted defeat on

them. God has mentioned this battle in the Qur 'an. 17 Since they
had marched with their women, children, and flocks, God granted [I 65 5 ] them as booty to His Messenger, who divided the spoils among
those Quraysh who had [recently] embraced Islam.
Ibn I;Iumayd'8--Salamah19-Ibn Ishaq:20 When Hawazin heard about the Messenger of God and that God had given him victory over Mecca, Malik b. 'Awf al-Na$ri gathered [his people] together. With Hawazin, all of Thagif joined him, followed by all Nagr and Jusham,21 Sa'd b. Bakr,22 and a few people from the Bann Hilal 23 These (clans] were the only ones from Qays 'Aylan24 who participated [in Hunayn]. Neither Ka'b25 nor Kilab26 from Hawazin participated, and no one of any importance from [these tribes] took part in the battle. Among Jusham was Durayd b. al- $immah,27 a very old chieftain whose only use [for the others] was to derive blessing from his counsel and his knowledge of war because he was an experienced old chieftain. Thaqif had two lead- ers: Qarib b. al-Aswad b. Mas'ud [b. Mu'attib]28 over the Ahlaf
17. Because of their great number, the Muslims were elated, and one of the companions remarked, "Today we will not be overpowered on account of small numbers." Wigidi, Maghdzi, a 889; lbn Sad, Tabagat, II/ 1, tog (it was Abti Bakr who made the above remark ); Balidhuri, Ansab, I, 365 (it was either Abu Bakr or someone else); Ibn al-Atha, al-Kamil, 11, 263 (it was the Prophet himself who made the above remark).
After the initial setback, the Muslims rallied around the Prophet and won the battle. Qur'an 9.25-26, stating that the Muslims were elated with joy at their great numbers, was revealed after the victory. Noldeke-Schwally, Geschichte, I, 224.

When Malik [b. 'Awf] decided to march against the Messenger of God, he took with his men their possessions, wives , and chil- dren. After making camp at Awlas,32 the men gathered around him. Among them was Durayd b. al-$immah , who was carried in a howdah (shijdr)33 As soon as he had encamped he inquired what valley they were in . When he was told that it was Awlas, he said: "What a wonderful place for cavalry! Neither a rugged hill, nor a soft lowland full of dust . But why do I hear the groaning of camels, the braying of asses, the bleating of sheep, and the crying of children?" They told him that Malik b. 'Awf had brought his men's children, wives, and possessions. He inquired where Malik was and summoned him.34 Then he said, "0 Malik, you have become the leader of your people. Indeed, this is a battle which will have great consequences. Yet why do I hear the groaning of camels, the braying of asses, the bleating of sheep, and the crying of children?" When Malik replied that he had brought them with
the men, Durayd inquired the reason. Malik explained [that his purpose in bringing them] was to put every man's family and possessions behind him, so that he would fight [to the death] in their defense. Durayd made a sound35 [indicating his dismay] and said, " By God, [you are] a sheep-tender. [Do you think] that any- thing will turn back a fleeing man? If everything goes in your favor, nothing will help you except a man with his sword and lance; if it goes against you, then you will be disgraced with your family and possessions." [Then Durayd inquired]36 what had hap-

pened to Ka'b and Kilab. When he was told that not a single
person from those two clans were present, he said, "Bravery and
ardor are missing. Were i t a day-of noble and lofty deeds, Ka'b and
Kilab would not have stayed away. I wish that you had done what
they have done!" Then he asked what clans were with them.
When told [that they were] 'Amr b. 'Amu and 'Awf b. 'Amir, he
replied, " Those two clans are recently formed branches of the
Banu 'Amir37 and can neither be useful nor harmful. 0 Malik, you
have done no good by sending forward the best troops of Hawazin [1657] [to meet] the main body of the cavalry. Dispatch them to the high
and inaccessible parts of their land and meet the apostates (al- $ubbd')38 on horseback. If the battle goes in your favor, those in the rear can join you, and if it goes against you, you will have saved your families and possessions."39 Malik replied, "By God, I won't do [itJ ao You are an old, senile man, and your senility has affected your judgment. 0 people of Hawazin, you will either obey me, or I will lean on this sword until it comes out of my back." He detested giving Durayd any say or credit in the matter. [The people responded by saying that they would obey him.141

38. Al-Sabi'un, pl. of al-$abi', is used in the Qur'an 2:62; 5:69,22:17, but not the pl. al-$ubba'. Various explanations have been given as to who they were. The Sabaeans mentioned in the Qur'an, and placed along with the Jews and Christians, are apparently the Mandaeans, a Judaeo-Christian sect practicing the rite of bap- tism in Mesopotamia. They were also called Christians of John the Baptist. The pagan Sabaeans of I.3arrin may have adopted this name to secure toleration ac- corded by the Qur'an. Ell, s.v. al-$ibi'a; Andrae, Mohammed, 108-9; Rodinson, Mahomet, 1461 Blachbre, Coran (the above verses). For al-$abi'ah today see al- Majallah: The International News Magazine of the Arabs, no. 354, Nov. 19-25, 1986,
explain that the term means one who departs from his religion to another. They further state that this appelation was first given to Muhammad because he de- parted from the religion of Quraysh , and that it was applied later to those who embraced Islam. Tabafl, Tafsiir, II, 145-47 ; Tabarsi, Majma', I, 126; Firuzibad-i, Qamds, s.v. s-b-'; Lane, Lexicon, s.v. s-b-'; Shahrastini, Milal, II, 61-63 (gives slightly different explanation).
39. Wagidi (Maghazi, III, 886- 89) states that Durayd was very old and had almost lost his eyesight. Despite his warning, the Hawizin stayed with Malik because they feared that if they disobeyed him, Malik, being a young man, might kill himself, and then they would be left with an old man, Durayd, who might not fight.

Durayd, therefore, retorted by saying that the [coming] battle was one he would not witness [as a warrior] and would not miss, [and recited]:
Would that I were young!
I would ride gently and advance
Leading long and bushy-haired steeds As if they were young ewes.
Durayd was the chief of the Bann Jusham, their leader and the noblest of them, but old age had overtaken him to the point that he had become feeble. His full lineage was Durayd b. al-$immah b. Bakr b. 'Algamah b. Juda'ah b. Ghaziyyah b. Jusham b.
[1658] Mu'awiyah b. Bakr b. Hawazin. Then Malik told his men that when they saw the foe they should break their scabbards and charge them as one man.
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Ibn Ishaq-Umayyah b. 'Abdallah b. 'Amr b. 'Uthman b. 'Affan : [I was told] that Malik b. 'Awf sent out spies to keep watch and to obtain intelligence of the enemy, but that they came back with their joints dislocated. When Malik, expressing his distress, asked what had happened to them, they said, "We saw white men on black and white horses, and, by God, before we could resist we were struck as you see."42 [This news], however, did not deter Malik from pursuing the course he intended.
Ibn Isl~iaq states: When the Messenger of God heard about Hawazin and Thagif, he sent 'Abdallah b. Abi Hadrad al-Aslami43 to them and ordered him to mingle with the crowds and to stay there until he could gather information about them and bring back news of them. Ibn Abi Hadrad, therefore, went and mingled with them and stayed with them until he learned that they had decided to fight the Messenger of God . He also learned about the dispositions of Malik and Hawazin and what they had decided. He then returned and informed the Messenger of God. The Mes-

senger of God called for 'Umar b. al-Khattib44 and informed him about what In Abi Hadrad had told him . Thereupon 'Umar said that he was lying. Ibn Abi Hadrad replied, " O 'Umar, you may accuse me of lying, but you denied the truth for a long time."45 Umar said, "0 Messenger of God, do you not hear46 what Ibn Abi Hadrad says?" The Messenger of God answered, "You were in error and God guided you, 0 'Umar."
Ibn Humayd- Salamah-Muhammad b. Ishiq- Abu Ja'far Muhammad b. 'Ali b. Husayn:47 When the Messenger of God [1659] decided to march against Hawizin, he was told that $afwin b. Umayyah48 had armor and weapons. Therefore, he sent to him, although he was at that time a polytheist , saying, " Lend us these weapons of yours so that we may fight our enemy tomorrow."
$afwin said to the messenger, "[Are you demanding them] by
force, 0 Muhammad?" The Messenger of God replied, "[No,] just
[lend them] to us as a loan and a trust until such time as we return
them to you." $afwin said that in that case he did not have any objection and gave one hundred coats of mail with an adequate
supply of arms. They allege that the Messenger of God asked him
to provide for its transport and that he complied with the request.
Abu Ja'far Muhammad b. 'Ali states : Thus it became a sunnah49 that a loan with a guarantee [of its return] must be returned [or paid back].50
44. He was the second caliph and is considered the second founder of Islam. He was assassinated in 23 / 644. See Ell, s.v. 'Omar b. al-Khattib.
45. lbn Ishiq: 0 Umar, if you accuse me of lying„ then many a time you have denied the truth. You have accused the one who is better than me [i.e., the Prophet[ of lying. Wagidi: You accuse me of lying, then many a time you have denied the truth.
46. Wigidi: Do you hear?
47. The fifth Shill imim, and a recognized authonty on tradition, was the grand- son of al-Husayn b. All b. Abi Tilib. On account of his learning he was given the honorific title al-Bdgir (one who goes deep into things). See EI', s.v. Muhammad b. 'Ali.
48. He fought the Muslim army entering Mecca, then surrendered. He died during 'Uthmin's caliphate (23-35 /644-56). lbn Sad, Tabagat, 11/ 1, 25- 110 pas- sim, 1II/ 1, 167; 1/2, 79, 95; N/1, 15, 146, 147; V, 16, 338.
49. Usually, it means exemplary behavior, custom, or practice. Generally, it is used as sunnah of the Prophet, meaning his deeds, utterances, and unspoken approval of something. These actions and sayings of the Prophet were later estab- lished as legally binding precedents. See Ell, s.v. Sunna.

Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Ibn Ishaq-'Abdallah b. Abi Bakr:51 The Messenger of God marched with two thousand Meccans and ten thousand of his companions [who had marched with him and]52 with whose support God had facilitated the conquest of Mecca. Thus they were twelve thousand in all. The Messenger of God placed 'Attab b. Asid b. AM al-'Iq b. Umayyah b. 'Abd

They had collected [themselves] and were fully prepared. By God, were we fright-

with his lance. When the people escaped from his lance he lifted it to those behind him so that they would follow him. When [the Muslims] were put to flight and the uncouth fellows from Mecca who were with the Messenger of God saw [the Muslims] in total disarray, some of them spoke [in such a way as to disclose] the hatred they had harbored [against one another]. Abu Sufyan b. Harb69 said, " Their stampede will not stop until they reach the ocean!" He had the divining arrows with him in his quiver. Ka- ladah b. al-Hanbal,70 who was present with his half-brother $af- wan b. Umayyah b. Khalaf, shouted, "Indeed, sorcery is useless today." $afwan, who was at that time [still] a polytheist during a

see them as abbreviations of God 's names, while others see them as abbreviations of the basmalah. Yet some others offer a variety of explanations ranging from mystical signs to numerical values.
Western scholars, beginning with Noldeke, have also attempted various expla- nations, none satisfactory or convincing. Noldeke (Geschichte, 215f.) suggested that they were the initials of the owners of the manuscripts used by Zayd when he first compiled the Qur'in. Later he abandoned this hypothesis and adopted a view that they were meaningless symbols (Noldeke-Schwally, Geschichte, II, 68-78). Loth ("Korancommentar") advocated an abbreviation theory, that is, that the letters are cabalistic symbols standing for certain key words and phrases in the surahs and that they are part of the revelation. Bellamy ("Mysterious letters") proposed that those letters are abbreviations for the basmalab. Watt, Bell's intro- duction, 6r-65j Blachi*re, Introduction, 540-49.

They confronted each other and ex- changed two blows. Abu Musa killed him with his sword and returned to Abu `Amir telling him that God had killed his enemy.

He then appointed Abu Musa in charge of the army and died shortly thereafter.
Ibn Humayd- Salamah- Ibn Ishaq: It is alleged that Salamah b. Durayd was the one who shot Abu `Amin with an arrow that hit him in his knee and killed him. Salamah b. Durayd said in this regard:

of God, she said, "0 Messenger of God, I am your foster- sister."134 He said, "What is the proof of that?" She replied, "The
bite you gave me on my back when I carried you at my hip." The Messenger of God acknowledged the proof, spread out his robe for
her and asked her to sit on it. He then gave her the choice either
to live with him in affection and honor or to go back to her people
with compensation. She replied that she would prefer to return to
her folk and he complied with her wish. The Banu Sa'd b. Bakr [16691 allege that the Messenger of God gave her a slave called Makhul

20 The Last Years of the Prophet
The captives of Hunayn, along with their possessions, were brought to the Messenger of God, Masud b. 'Amr al-Qari141 over- seeing the spoils. The Messenger of God then ordered that the captives and their possessions be taken to al-Ji'ranah142 and held there in custody.

Thaqif came to al-Ta'if, they shut the gates of the city and made
preparations for war. Neither'Urwah b. Mas'nd143 nor Ghaylan b.

and al-dubur)
and the catapult (al-majaniq).
