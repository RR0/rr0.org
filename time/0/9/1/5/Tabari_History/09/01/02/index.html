Prophet left and halted at al-Ji'ranah where the captives of Iju- nayn were held with their women and children. It is alleged that those captives taken from the Hawazin numbered six thousand with women and children. When he reached al-Ji'ranah, the dele- gations of Hawazin came to the Prophet and embraced Islam. Therefore, he set all their women and children free and decided to make the lesser pilgrimage (directly[ from al-ji'ranah. The month was Dhu al-Qa'dah. After that, the Messenger of God returned to Medina, put ['Attab b. Asid] 148 in charge of Mecca, and asked him to perform the greater pilgrimmage with the people and to ensure their safety. [He also left behind with him Mu'adh b. Jabal]'49 to instruct [the people] in Islam. When he reached Medina, the dele- gations of Thagif arrived, brought the dispute (mentioned earlier) before him, and gave him the oath of allegiance, which consisted of a document that they wrote and signed with him.
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Ibn Isbaq-'Amr b. Shu'ayb:150 The Messenger of God journeyed from Hunayn to al-Ta'if by the way
of Nakhlat al-Yamaniyyah,151 Qam,152 al-Mulayb,153 and Babrat al-Rugha'154 of Liyyah.155 There he built [i.e., at Bahrat al-Rugha']
a mosque and prayed in it. After he arrived that day, he permitted [1671] retaliation for homicide. That was the first time [this practice]

was allowed in Islam. A man of the Banu Layth'56 had killed a man of Hudhayl,157 so the Messenger of God killed him. While he was in Liyyah, the Messenger of God ordered that the fortress of Malik b. 'Awf be demolished.158 He then followed a road called al- Iaaygah [i.e., the narrow, strait].159 As he was passing through it he inquired about its name. When he was told that it was al- I?aygah, he said, "No, rather it is al-Yusra [i.e., the easy]." Then he went by Nakhb160 and halted under a lote tree called al- $adirah near the property of a man of Thaqif. The Messenger of God sent word to him either to come out or else his walled garden would be destroyed.161 He refused to come out, so the Messenger of God ordered the walled garden to be destroyed.162
Then the Messenger of God went on until he halted near al- Ta'if and pitched his camp there. Some of his companions were killed by arrows, because the camp had been placed very close to the walls of al-Ta'if and the arrows were reaching them.'' The Muslims were unable to get through its wall, for [the inhabitants] had shut the gate against them . When his comrades were killed by arrows, the Prophet moved to higher ground and pitched his camp near where his mosque stands today . He besieged them for some twenty days.' ' He had two of his wives with him, one of

tribe of northern Arab descent that occupied much of the territory west and east of Mecca and up into the mountains toward al-Ti'if. It was closely related to Kinanah and consequently to Quraysh. E12, s.v. Hudhayl. Wagidi, Maghazi, III, 924, states that the man of Layth, who had killed a man from the Hudhayl, was apprehended and brought before the Prophet . The people gathered and quarrelled in the Prophet's presence, so he turned the man over to the men of Hudhayl who killed him.

that the other was Zaynab bt. Jabsh.166 He pitched two tents for
them and prayed between the tents as long as167 he stayed there.
After Thagif surrendered, `Amr b. Umayyah168 b. Wahb b. Mu'at-
tib b. Malik built a mosque over the place where the Messenger of
God had prayed. There was a column in that mosque about which [16721 it is alleged that the sun never rises over it any day without a creaking noise being heard from it.169 The Messenger of God besieged Thaqif and fought them bitterly. Both sides shot arrows
at each other17O until the day when the wall of al-'Wa'if was stormed (shadkhah).171 [That day] a number of the Messenger of God's companions went under a testudo and advanced up to the wall [to make a breach in it].172 Thagif showered them with scraps of hot iron, so they came out from under [the testudoj, and Thaqif shot them with arrows, killing some of them. The Mes- senger of God then ordered that the vineyards of Thaqif be cut down, and the men fell upon them, cutting them down.173
Abu Sufyan b. Harb and al-Mughirah b. Shu 'bah went up to al- Ta'if and cried out to Thagif to assure their safety so that they could speak to them. When they guaranteed them safety, they called upon the women of Quraysh and Banu Kinanah174 to come out to them, for they were afraid that they would be taken cap-

Al-Wagidi177-Kathzr b. Zayd178-al-Walid b. Rab4179-Abu
Hurayrah:180 When fifteen days of siege had passed at aal-''if, the Messenger of God consulted Nawfal b . Mu'awiyah al-Di11181 and asked his opinion about continuing [the siege]. He replied, "0 Messenger of God, [they are like] a fox [hiding] in its den. If you persist [in your siege], you will capture it, and if you leave it, it will not harm you."
Ibn Humayd- Salamah- Ibn Ishaq: It has been reported that the Messenger of God said to Abu Bakr b. Abi Quhafah while he was besieging Thagif in al-'Wa'if, "0 Abu Bakr, I saw [in a dream] that I was presented with a large bowl filled with butter and that a cock pecked at it and spilt it." Abu Bakr replied, "0 Messenger of God, I don't think that you will attain what you desire from them today." The Messenger of God responded that he did not think so either.182

Qal'. Cf. Wigidi, Maghazi, III, 929. When those women refused to come out, Ibn al-Aswad b. Mas'nd spoke to Abu Sufyin and al-Mughirah about saving his own property from destruction.

Awgag al-Sulamiyyah, wife of 'Uthman b . Maz'un, requested the Messenger of God that if God granted him victory over al -Ta'if, he would give her the jewelry of Badiyah bt. Ghaylan b. Salamah,'84 or that of al-Firi'ah bt. 'Ugayl,185 for they were the most be- jeweled'86 women of Thaqif.
Ibn Isl)aq: It has been reported that the Messenger of God told her, "And if [the victory] over Thagzf is not granted to me, 0 Khuwaylah?" Khuwaylah left and told 'Umar b. al-Khattab [what had happened], so he came to the Messenger of God and asked him whether what Khuwaylah had said was true. The Messenger of God replied, "Yes, I said it." [Thereupon 'Umar] said, "Is [victory] over them not to be granted, 0 Messenger of God?" On hearing the Messenger of God's answer [in the affirmative], 'Umar asked if he should give the order to depart, and after receiving permission he announced the departure.'87
When the people began to move out, Sa'id'88 b. 'Ubayd b. Asid ' 89 b. Abi 'Amr b . I laj al'Thagaf`i cried out that [al-Ta'if] was holding out [against the siege]. 'Uyaynah b. Hi^n190 responded,
"Yes, admirably and nobly! " One of the Muslims191 said to him, "May God smite you, 0 'Uyaynah! Do you praise the polytheists for holding out against the Messenger of God while you [yourself] have come to assist him?" He replied, 'By God, I did not come to fight Thagzf with you, but I wished Muhammad to be victorious
over al-Ta'if, so that I might obtain a slave girl from Thagzf whom
