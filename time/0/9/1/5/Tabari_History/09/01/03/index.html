Ibn Humayd- Salamah- Ibn Ishaq: Then the Messenger of God left al-Ta'if and went [by way] of Dahna195 until he halted at al- Ji'ranah with the Muslims who were with him. When he marched to al-Ti'if, he had sent the captives of Hawazin to be detained in al-ji'ranah. Thus the delegations of Hawazin came to him there. The Messenger of God held six thousand captives from the chil- dren and women, and innumerable camels and sheep.196

This is a pun, a play on the word manakir, because its singular munkar generally means an action disapproved by sound intellect, or deemed to be bad, or anything pronounced to be abominable by the law . Here it is not used in this general sense but as rajulm nakirlm, meaning a man who possesses intelligence with cunning. Funz1b3di, Qamus, s.v. n-k-r; Lane, Lexicon, s.v. n-k-r.
Wigidi (Maghazi, III, 937): For Tbagif are gifted with a blessing (mubarakun). He further states that, when 'Umar b. al-Khattib informed the Prophet what 'Uyaynah had said, he smiled and said, "[The man exhibits) an acceptable foolishness." (He is an agreeable fool.)
Ibn Islaiq (Sirah, IV, 127- 28) states that during the siege of al-Ti'if some of the slaves came out, embraced Islam, and were set free by the Prophet. Cf. Wigidi,

According to Wigidi (Maghazi, III, 943- 44), there were six thousand captives, twenty-four thousand camels, and about forty thousand sheep. In addition to that, the Muslims captured four thousand ugiyahs [about 1/12 ra41 or forty dirhams to

al-'A$.198 The
deputation of Hawazin came to the Messenger of God while he was in al-Ji'ranah and embraced Islam. Then they said, "0 Messenger of God, we are of noble origin and we are kinsfolk. The disaster which has befallen us is not hidden from you. Please show us favor, since God has granted you favor." Then a man of Hawazin from [the clan of] the Banu Sa'd b. Bakr (it was this clan who nursed the Messenger of God) called Zuhayr b. $urad' 9 and nicknamed Abu $urad, stood up and said, "0 Mes- senger of God, among the detainees are your paternal and mater-
nal aunts and the ones who suckled you and looked after you. Had we provided al-Harith b. Abi Shimr200 or al-Nu'man b. al- Mundhir201 with foster-parents2O2 and then got into the situation in which you now hold us, we could hope for his favor and kind- ness. [We know that] you are the best of protectors."203 Then he recited [the following ] verses:
Have mercy on us, Messenger of God, out of generosity,
for you are the man [from whom] we hope and treasure [as our own].
Grant favor to [your] kinfolk2O4 whom fate has frustrated, and whose fortunes are shattered by the
vicissitudes of fate.

28 The Last Years of the Prophet
The Messenger of God said, "Are your sons and wives dearer to you or your possessions?" They replied, "0 Messenger of God, you have given us the choice between our honor and our posses-
[1676] sions, so give us back our wives and sons, for they are dearer to us." He said, "As for what I and the Banu 'Abd al-Mullalib have [of your goods], they are yours. When I have prayed [the noon prayer]205 with the people, then [stand up and]206 say, 'We ask the Messenger of God's intercession with the Muslims, and the Mus- lims' intercession with the Messenger of God for our sons and wives.' I will then give them to you and will request [the Mus- lims) on your behalf." When the Messenger of God had prayed the noon prayer with the people, they stood up and spoke as he had asked them, and he did what he had promised to do. The Muha- jirnn said that what was theirs was the Messenger of God's, and
the Ansar said the same. Al-Aqra' b. Habis [al-Tamimi],207 how- ever, said that as far as he and the Banu Tamim208 were con- cerned, [they would not agree to give up their share]. 'Uyaynah b. Hi$n also refused on behalf of himself and the Banu Fazarah,209 and so did 'Abbas b. Mirdis [al-Sulami]210 for himself and the Band Sulaym .211 The Banu Sulaym, however, said, "[YesJ,212 what is ours is the Messenger of God's." Therefore, 'Abbis said to them that they had rendered him a coward. Then the Messenger of God said, "He who holds to his share of these captives shall have six camels for every captive from the first booty we take." So the Muslims returned the women and children to their kinsfolk.213

The Events of the Year 8 (cont'd) 29
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Muhammad b. Islaq-Abu Wajzah
Yazid b. 'Ubayd al-Sa'di: From the captives of Hunayn, the Mes-
senger of God gave 'Ali, b. Abi 'J glib a slave girl called Ratah bt.
Hilil b. Hayyin b. 'Umayrah b. Hilil b. Nisirah b. Qusayyah b. [11677] Nagr b. Sa'd b. Bakr; and he gave 'Uthmin b. 'Affin214 a slave girl

'Abdallih b. 'Umar: The Messenger of God gave 'Umar b. al- KhalXib a slave girl from the captives of Hawizin and 'Umar gave her to me. I sent her to my maternal aunts from the Banu Jumab218 to prepare land get her ready]219 for me until I had circumambulated the Ka'bah and returned to them, wanting to take her when I returned. When I had finished and came out of the mosque, the men were rushing away. When I asked the reason why, they told me that the Messenger of God had given them back their wives and children. I told them that that girl of theirs was with the Banu Jumab and that they should go and get her, so they went and took her. As for 'Uyaynah b. Hign, he had taken an old widow of Hawizin and said when he took her, "I see that she is an elderly lady of standing in the tribe. Perhaps her ransom might be high." When the Messenger of God returned the cap- tives for six camels each, 'Uyaynah refused to return her. Zuhayr Abu $urad told him to let her go, for her mouth was neither cold nor were her breasts swelling; she could not conceive, her milk was not rich, and her husband would not care. After Zuhayr had told him this, he returned her for six camels.220 They allege that

220. Wigidii, Maghazi, III, 952-54, gives a different version and states that in the beginning her son offered to pay a ransom of a hundred camels, but 'Uyaynah,

[when] 'Uyaynah met al-Agra` b. Habis he complained to him [1678] about i, so he said, "By God, you did not take her as virgin221 in
her prime nor even full-figured in her middle age!"
The Messenger of God asked the Hawazin delegation about Malik b. 'Awf and what he did. They told him that he was in al- Ta'if with Thagif. The Messenger of God told them to inform him
that if he came to him embracing Islam, he would restore his family and possessions to him and give him a hundred camels.222 When Malik was informed about it, he left al-Ta'if. He was afraid that Thagif might imprison him if they knew what the Messenger of God had said about him, so he ordered that his mount be prepared for him and that a horse be brought to him in al-'l a'if. He slipped away at night, came [to the place] where his mount was tethered,223mounted his horse, and rode off until he overtook the
Messenger of God in al-Ji'ranah or Mecca. The Messenger of God returned him his family and property and gave him a hundred camels. He embraced Islam and became a good Muslim. The Mes- senger of God put him in charge of his kinfolk and the tribes around al-'Wa'if who had embraced Islam. [Those tribes were] Thumalah, Salimah, and Fahm224 Then he began to fight Thagzf with them; their flocks could not come out [of al-Ta'if] without being raided by him and he tightened the noose around them.225 Abu Milian b. Habib226 b. 'Amr b. 'Umayr al-Thagaf"i said:
Enemies have dreaded our vicinity,
but now the Band Salimah are engaged in warring and plundering us.
Malik brought them on us,
breaking his covenant and solemn word.
wanting a higher price, declined the offer. Finally, he had to release her without any ransom.
221. Hisch. and Ibn Isbaq: Of fair complexion.
222. Malik's family were brought to Mecca and were lodged with their relatives. His possessions were also kept aside and were not divided with the other booty. Wagidi, Maghazi, III, 954- 55; Lings, Muhammad, 310.
223. It was in Dabna. Wiqidi, Maghazi, III, 955.
224. All the three were clans of Azd. Kalbi, Jamharah, 210, 211 ; Ibn Hazm, Jamharah, 376-79.
225. From those raids, Malik used to send the khums to the Prophet. Once he sent a hundred camels and then a thousand sheep. Wigid-i, Maghuzi, III, 955. 226. Wigidi (Maghazi, III, 930, 932, 935): Hubayb. He was one of the leaders of
Thagif.

They raided us in our settlements,
though we were men who retaliated.227
(This is the end of Abu Wajzah's report. To return to the report of 'Amr b. Shu'ayb: )228 After the Messenger of God had completed the return of the captives of Hunayn to their families, he rode away and the people229 followed him, saying, "0 Messenger of God, divide our booty of camels and small cattle among us," until they forced him back against a tree and his mantle was pulled away from him.230 He said, "0 men , give me back231 my mantle! By God, if I had as many sheep as the trees of the Tihimah I would have divided them among you. You have not found me miserly or cowardly or a liar." Then he stood near his232 camel and took a hair from its hump and holding it aloft in his fingers said, "0 men, by God, I do not have anything of your booty, even to this hair, except the fifth, and that fifth will be returned to you. So bring back the needle and the thread, for dishonesty will be a shame, a flame,233 and a disgrace on the Day of Judgment."2-34 A man from the An$dr came with a ball of hair thread, and said, "0 Messenger of God, I took this ball to make a pad for my sore camel." He replied, "As for my share in that, you can keep it." The man said, "If it has come to that, I don't want it," and he threw it away.235 (This is the end of 'Amr b. Shu'ayb' s report.)

It is used in the Qur'in 9:60, where it states: "Charity is [meant] only for the poor, the needy, those working at [collecting and distributing ) it, those [possible converts) whose hearts are being reconciled Ito yours), for freeing cap- tives and those who are in debt, and in the cause of God, and for the wayfarer, as a

their hearts.237 He gave a hundred camels each to the follow- j 168o[ ing:38 Abu Sufyan b. Harb; his son Mu'awiyah;239 Hakim b. Hizam;240 al-Nudayr241 b. al-Harith b. Kaladah b.

duty imposed by God." The term is applied here to certain tribal chiefs and influential men whose loyalty the Prophet endeavored to secure by lavish gifts given out of the khums . Wagidi-, Maghazi, III, 944, 948; Lane, Lexicon, s.v. a-1-f; Lings, Muhammad, 308-9.
Watt (Muhammad at Medina, 74, 348- 52) argues that the above Qur'inic term cannot be applied to the men who received gifts at al-Ji'ranah. Its application to the leading Meccans, who received fifty or a hundred camels, was probably the work of the "pious opposition" in Medina during the Umayyad period in the early part of the second / eighth century.
237. Hisch. and Ibn Isbiq: And to reconcile through them their people.
238. See the list compiled by Watt, Muhammad at Medina, 73-74.
239. He was the first Umayyad caliph. LIP, s.v. Mu'awiya. Abu Sufyin's son
Yazid also received a hundred camels . In addition to those camels , both the broth- ers and their father also received forty dgi'yahs each of silver. Wigidl, Maghazu, III,
'd, Tabagat, Il/r, I I0. Watt, Muhammad at Medma, 75, states that the mention of Abu Sufyin 's sons is doubtless a device to conceal the favor shown to him by Mubammad.
240. He was a nephew of the Prophet 's wife Khadijah. He asked for more camels and so was given some. Wiq,di, Maghazi, III, 945 (he got three hundred); Ibn Sa'd, Tabagat, 1/2, 179; Il/I, 97, 110; III/ I, 27; IV/ 1, 6, 45 (he got two hundred).
241. Ibn Isbiq: Al-Hirith; Ibn Hishim: Nusayr, it is possible that his name was al-Harith. Ibn Sa'd, Tabagat, V, 331- 32, 352, gives his name as al-Nudayr b. al- Harith B. 'Algamah b. Kaladah b. 'Abd Manif b . 'Abd al-Dar b. Qugayy.

Lu'ayy.250 The exact number [of camels] given to them is not preserved,251 but it is known, as alleged, that it was less than a hundred. He gave fifty camels to Said b. Yarbu' b. 'Ankathah b. 'Amir b. Makhzum252 and to al-Sahmi.253 He gave 'Abbas b. Mir- das al-Sulami some camels,254 but he was not pleased with them and reproved the Messenger of God saying:
It was pillage that I acquired,
by charging on my colt in the rugged plain.
And I kept the people awake lest they should sleep.255 When they slept I kept watch.
My pillage and that of al -'Ubayd256

34 The Last Years of the Prophet
The Messenger of God said [to them], "Go and cut off his tongue from me," so they gave him more [camels] until he was satisfied. This was what the Messenger of God meant by his order "to cut off his tongue."26°
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Ibn Ishaq-Muhammad b. Ibrahim b. al-Harith:261 One of the companions of the Messenger of God262 said to him, "0 Messenger of God, you have given 'Uyaynah b. Hi$n and al-Agra` b. Habis a hundred camels each and left out Ju'ayl b. Suragah al-Ipamri." He replied, "By Him in whose hand is my soul,264 Ju'ayl b. Suragah is better than an entire world

fair." The Messenger of God became angry and said, "Woe to you! If justice is not to be found with me, then with whom is it to be found?" 'Umar b. al-Khatxab asked the Messenger of God to allow him to kill the man, but he said, "No, leave him, for he will have a following that will penetrate so deeply into religion that they will come out of it as an arrow comes out of the target ; one looks at the head and there is nothing on it ; then one looks at its butt end and there is nothing on it ; [then one looks at its notch and there is nothing on it].268 It passed through [the target] before flesh and blood could stick to it."

When my camel crowded his, the toe of my sandal hit the Messenger of God's leg and hurt him. He hit my foot with the whip and said, 'You have hurt me, get behind me!' and so I went behind.

Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Ibn Ishaq-'Agim b. 'Umar b. Qatadah-Mahmud b. Labid274-Abu Said al-Khudri: When the Messenger of God had distributed those gifts among Quraysh and the Bedouin tribes, and the An4dr got nothing from it, this group of An$dr took [the matter] to their hearts and talked volubly about it until one of them said, "By God, the Messenger of God has joined his kinsfolk! "275 Sa'd b. 'Ubadah276 went to the Mes- senger of God and said, "0 Messenger of God, this group of Ansar have a grudge against you for what you did with the booty and how you divided it among your own people, and by giving great
(1684] gifts to the Bedouin tribes while this group of Ansdr got nothing." He said, "Where do you stand in this matter, 0 Sa'd?" He said, "I stand with my kinsfolk." The Prophet said, "Then gather your people in (thisJ277 enclosure ." Sa'd went out and did so, and when a number of the Muhajirdn came, he allowed some to come in and sent back the others. When all of them had assembled, he went and informed the Prophet, who came to them. After due praise and exaltation of God, he addressed them saying: "0 com- munity of Anyar, what is this talk I hear about you? [What is] the grudge you have harbored in your hearts [against me]? Did I not come to you when you were erring and God guided you; [were you not] needy and then made rich by God; [were you not] enemies and [did not] God reconcile your hearts?" They answered, "Yes

We would like to know whether this is from God or his personal view. If it is from God, we will be patient, but if it is his personal view , then we will censure him . When this news reached the Messenger of God , he became very angry.
276. Sa'd b. 'Ubidah al-Khazraji, who was present at the second pledge of al-'Aqabah, was a champion of Islam and several times had acted as standard- bearer in the expeditions. After the death of 'Abdallih b. Ubayy, he became un- disputed head of the Khazraj and was proposed by the An$ar as their head after the Prophet's death. When Abu Bakr was elected caliph, he refused to give him his oath of allegiance and left Medina for Hawrin , where he died ca. 15 / 636-37. Balidhuri, Ansdb, I, 250; E11, s.v. Sa'd b. 'Ubada.

"Why do you not answer me (directlyj, 0 An$nr?" They said,
"What shall we answer. you, 0 Messenger of God? Kindness and graciousness belong to God and His Messenger." He said: "Now
then, by God, had you wished you could have said-and you
would have spoken the truth and have been accepted as truth- ful-'You came to us (when your message] was rejected [by the Quraysh] and we believed in you; [you were] forsaken and we

[against me] because of the worldly things by which I conciliate a
people so that they may embrace Islam, while I entrust you to

and the An$ar another, I would take the way of the An$ar.28O 0 [1685] God, have mercy on the An$ar, their sons and their sons' sons!"
The people wept until the tears ran down their beards and said that they were pleased with the Messenger of God as their lot and good fortune. Then the Messenger of God departed and they dispersed.281

Contrary to Ibn Hisham's view, some authorities state that the poem in question was composed on the occasion of the conquest of Mecca , expressing the Angdr's displeasure because the Prophet gave precedence to the Bann Sulaym and to Khilid b. al-Walid over the An$dr when the Muslims entered Mecca .

Asid in charge of Mecca.285 He also left behind with him Mu'adh b. Jabal286 to instruct the people in religion and to teach them the Qur'an. He was followed by the remainder of the booty. The Messenger of God's lesser pilgrimage was in Dhu al-Qa'dah, and he arrived in Medina in the same month or in Dhu al-Hijjah.287 The people made the pilgrimage that year as the Arabs used to do. 'Attab b. Asid made the pilgrimage with the Muslims that [same] year, which was 8/630.

Al-Wagidi states that when the Messenger of God distributed the spoils among the Muslims in al-Ji'ranah, every man got four camels and forty sheep, while each horseman received an addi- tional share for his horse .288 The Messenger of God arrived in Medina from this expedition toward the end of Dhu al-Hijjah/ April 630.

of al-Julanda from the Azd.292 They allowed 'Amr b. al-'A^ to collect the alms [without interference), and so he collected it [only] from the rich and returned [what he took] to the poor. He collected the poll tax (jizyah)293 from the Zoroastrians (al- Majus)294 who were indigenous to that region, while the Arabs lived in the surrounding countryside.
In the same year, the Messenger of God married al-Kilabiyyah who was called Fatimah bt. al-I?abhak b. Sufyan 295 When she was given the choice [to select between this world and the here- after] she preferred this world. It is said that she asked the Mes- senger of God's protection, so he left her.

In this year, the delegation of the Dariyyun from Lakhm3O4 came. There were ten of them.
According to al-Wagidi, in this year, 'Urwah b. Mas'nd al- Thaqafi came to the Messenger of God and accepted Islam.305 I
have received the following account about 'Urwah on the authori-
ty of Ibn Humayd- Salamah- Muhammad b. Isbiq: When the Messenger of God departed from the people of al-'J a'if, 'Urwah b.
Mas'nd b. Mu'attib followed in his wake until he caught up with
the Prophet before he reached Medina . ' Urwah then embraced
Islam and asked the Prophet that he might return to his people as
a Muslim. The Messenger of God said, so his306 folk report,
"They will fight you , "307 for the Messenger of God knew the
proud spirit of resistance that was in them. 'Urwah responded: "0 Messenger of God, I am dearer to them than their firstborn."308
He was indeed loved and obeyed by his people, so he went out summoning his people to Islam and hoping that they would not
oppose him because of his position among them. When he ap-
peared above them from his upper balcony, after having already summoned them to Islam and announcing to them his [new] (1688] religion, they shot arrows at him from every direction. One arrow
struck ['Urwah) and killed him. The Band Malik allege that one of their men, whose name was Aws b. 'AWf,309 brother of the Band
Salim b. Malik, killed him. But the Ahlaf allege that one of their men called Wahb b. Jabir from the Bann 'Attab b. Malik killed him. Urwah was asked, "What do you think about your blood [being shed)?"310 He replied: "[It is] an honor which God has

305. He returned from Jurash after the Prophet had left al-Ti'if [see Tabari,
above, I, 16691. It is said that he was inspired by God to embrace Islam
to Medina and accepted Islam. Wagidi, Maghazi, III, 96off., narrates his story with graphic detials. See also Lings, Muhammad, 313.
306. As in Hisch. and Ibn Isbiq. Text: Their folk.

308. Hisch., Ibn Hishim: Eyesight; Wiqidi, Ibn Sad (Tabagat, I/1, 52): Their
firstborn children. Ibn Shabbah (in another version): If they find me asleep, they will not awaken me (i.e., disturb me).
309. Later on he came to the Prophet with the Thaqif delegation and accepted Islam. Ibn Sa'd, Tabagat, V, 373-74.
310. It means: Should it be avenged? 'Urwah belonged to the Altlif group [see Tabari, above, I,165 5, It. 29), and his clan took up arms to avenge his blood, but he instructed them not to fight and gave up his blood for the sake of God. See Wiqidi for details.

They did so and allege that the Messenger of God said about him that he was among his [own] folk like Ya Sin311 was among his 312
In this year, the deputation of the people of al -Ta'if came to the Messenger of God. It is said that they came in the month of Ramadan [December 12, 63o-January 111, 6311.
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Muhammad b. Ishaq: After killing 'Urwah, Thagsf held out a few months. Then they deliberated among themselves [and determined]313 that they did not have the strength to fight the Arabs surrounding them who had given their oath of allegiance [to the Messenger of God], and who had accept- ed Islam.
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Muhammad b. Ishaq-Ya'qub b. 'Utbah b. al-Mughzrah b. al-Akhnas b. Shariq al-Thaqafi: 'Amr b. Umayyah, brother314 of the Banu llaj, had shunned 'Abd YM b. 'Amr,315 and there was ill feeling between the two. 'Amr b. Umayyah was one of the most cunning of the Arabs. He ambled over to 'Abd Yalil b. 'Amr and entered his dwelling place.He then sent word to him that 'Amr b. Umayyah said, "Come out to me." 'Abd Yalil said to the messenger: "Woe to you! Has 'Amr sent
j16891 you?" The messenger replied: "Indeed, he is standing here in your dwelling place." 'Abd Yalil then retorted, "I would not have thought that of 'Amr. He knows how to protect himself better than that." [So he came out],316 and when he saw 'Amr he wel- comed him. 'Amr said: "We have been dealt a situation from which there is no escape (hijrah)317 Indeed, you have seen what

has transpired as regards this man [i.e., the Messenger of God). All the Arabs have embraced Islam and you do not have the strength to make war against them, so consider your situation ." There- upon, Thagif deliberated among themselves, some saying to one another, "Don't you see that your herd is not safe, and none of you can dare go out without being cut off [from the town]." They deliberated [further] and decided to send a man to the Prophet as they had [previously] sent 'Urwah. They spoke to 'Abd Yalil b. `Amr b. 'Umayr, who was of the same age as'Urwah b. Masud, but he declined to undertake the task. Fearing that he would be dealt with as was 'Urwah on his return, he said, "I am not doing any- thing until you send someone with me ." Thus they agreed to send two men from the Ahlaf and three from the Banu Malik. There were six [all told]: 'Uthman b. Abi al-'Ag b. Bishr b. 'Abd Duhman, brother of the Banu Yasar; Aws b. 'Awf, brother of the Banii Salim [b. 'Awf],318 Numayr b. Kharashah b. Rabi 'ah, brother of Bal- bi rith;319 and from the Ahiaf, al-Hakam b. 'Amr b. Wahb b. Mu'attib and Shurahbil b. Ghaylan b. Salimah b. Mu'attib 320 •Abd Yalil then departed with them as leader of his folk and in charge of their affairs. He took them [i.e., the other five] with him be- cause he feared he would be dealt with as was 'Urwah b . Mas'nd, and he hoped that each man among them would keep his [own] clan occupied on their return to al-Ta'if.
When they drew close to Medina and dismounted at Qanat,321
they met al-Mughirah b. Shu'bah taking his turn at pasturing the
mounts of the Messenger of God's companions (the task of pas- [ r69o] turing the mounts was taken up in turn by each of the compan-
ions). When he saw them , al-Mughirah left the mounts [with the Thagafis1322 : nd dashed off to give the Messenger of God the good
tidings that they were coming to him . Abu Bakr al-$iddiq met

44 The Last Years of the Prophet
Abu Bakr that a group of riders from Thagif had arrived with the
intention of giving the oath of allegiance and embracing Islam, so that conditions might be set down for them and put in writing [in the presence of] the Messenger of God, guaranteeing [safety] to their folk, their land, and their possessions. Abu Bakr begged al- Mughzrah: "I swear by God on your behalf, don't beat me to the Messenger of God, so that I might be the first to break this news to him." Al-Mughirah complied with this request, so Abu Bakr went to the Messenger of God and informed him that a group of riders from Thagif had arrived. Following that, al-Mughirah324 went back to his [Thaqafil companions and brought the mounts back with them. He taught them how to greet the Messenger of God, as they were only used to the pagan salutation . [Narrators] allege that when they came to the Messenger of God, he erected a
dome-shaped tent for them in the vicinity of his mosque (ft 3
nalliyat masjidihi) 25 Khalid b. Said b. al-`A$326 acted as inter- mediary between them and the Messenger of God until their treaty was written, and it was Khalid who drafted the treaty with his own hand. They would not eat the food sent to them from the Messenger of God until Khalid ate of it . (This behavior continued] until they embraced Islam, rendered their oath of allegiance and completed the drafting of their treaty.
Among the things which they had requested of the Messenger
of God was that he should leave al-Taghiyyah [i.e., the idol al- LatJ327 alone, and not demolish it for three years. The Messenger of God refused that request of theirs, but they continued to ask
324. Al-Mughlrah went to the Prophet after Abu Bakr. Wagidi, Maghazi, III, 964-
325. That is, because the Prophet spent most of his time in the courtyard of his mosque; it was here that he received delegates , conducted business, and addressed his followers. The mosque was, in fact, the center for the secular as well as the religious life of the community.
Wagidi, Maghazi, III, 965, states that the delegates stayed with al-Mughirah and three tents were erected in the mosque so that they would sit there and observe the Muslims while praying and reciting the Qur 'an. Cf. Ibn Shabbah, Ta'rikh, 11, 502.

him to do it for a year or two, and he kept on refusing.328 Finally,
they asked if he could desist for a single month after their return [home], but the Messenger of God declined to allow the idol to
remain for any specified time. [By persisting in their request] and showing their desire to leave [the idol alone], they were seeking to 116911 be safe from the fools among them [as well as from] their women
and children. They did not wish to alarm their fellow tribesmen by destroying the idol until Islam had entered their [hearts]. The Messenger of God not only refused that request but sent Abu Sufyan b. Harb and al-Mugbirah b. Shu'bah, who subsequently demolished it. In addition to leaving al-Taghiyyah, they had asked that they be exempted from prayer and from smashing their idols with their own hands. The Messenger of God responded, "As for smashing your idols with your own hands, we shall let you off, but as for prayer there is no good in a religion which has no prayer." They said. "0 Muhammad, we will give in to you on this issue even though it is demeaning."329
When they had embraced Islam and the Messenger of God had drawn up their treaty for them, he appointed 'Uthman b. Abi al-'A$330 to be their leader, although he was the youngest among them. This was because he was the most zealous in his desire to study Islam and to learn the Qur'an . Abu Bakr told the Messenger of God, "0 Messenger of God, indeed I have seen this youth to be the most zealous among them in his desire to study Islam and to learn the Qur'an."331

330. According to Wagidi (Maghazi, III, 9661, Ibn Sid (Tabagat, VII/1, 26-27), and Ibn Shabbah, he had secretly embraced Islam soon after his arrival in Medina, and used to visit the Prophet, Abu Bakr and Ubayy b. Rib to learn the Qur'in.

land, the Messenger of God dispatched Abu Sufyan b. Harb and al- Mughirah b. Shu'bah to demolish al-7'aghiyyah. The two traveled with the deputation until they approached al-Ta'if, at which point al-Mughirah asked Abu Sufyan to precede him. Abu Sufyan re-
[1692] fused, saying, "Go to your kinsfolk yourself,"332 and stayed at his estate in Dhu al-Harm333When al-Mughirah b. Shu'bah entered [al-'Wa'if], he mounted the idol and struck it with a pickaxe while his folk, the Banu Mu'attib, stood by him, fearing that he might be shot at or struck as 'Urwah had been. The women of Thagif came out with their heads uncovered and said, lamenting the [loss of the] idol [i.e., the goddess]:
Oh, shed tears for the protector!33'
Ignoble ones have forsaken her,
those not competent in wielding swords.
He said: While al-Mughirah was striking the idol with the axe, Abu Sufyan was saying, "Alas for you, alas! "335 When al- Mughirah had demolished it, he took its treasure and ornamenta- tion and sent [it] to Abu Sufyan. Its ornamentation was made up of various items, while its treasure consisted of gold and onyx. The Messenger of God had previously instructed Abu Sufyan to pay the debts of 'Urwah and al-Aswad, the sons of Mas'ud,336 from the property of al-Lat, so he discharged their debts.337
In this year, the Messenger of God carried out the military expedition to Tabuk.338

337. On their return home, the delegation was received with hostility, and it took two or three days before the people of al -Ti'if abandoned the idea of waging war against the Prophet. Wagidi, Maghozi, III, 969- 71. For the text of the treaty, see Ibn Hishim, Sfrah, IV, 187; Wagidt-, Maghazi, III, 973. Rodinson, Mahomet, 306, states that the actual text of this treaty is lost.
