In Humayd-Salamah-Muhammad b. Ishaq: After his return from al-'Wa'if, the Messenger of God stayed in Medina from Dhu al-Hijjah to Rajab [May 19-October 14, 6311; then he ordered the people to prepare for a military expedition against the Byzan- tines339
Ibn Humayd- Salamah- Muhammad b. Ishaq on the authority
of al-Zuhri, Yazid b. Ruman,340'Abdallah b. Abi Bakr and'Asim b.
`Umar b. Qatadah and others: Everyone transmitted what he had learned about the expedition to Tabuk and some people reported
what others did not. All the reports agree, however, that the Mes- 116931 senger of God ordered his companions to prepare for the military expedition against the Byzantines341 This was a season when
people were hard pressed; the heat was oppressive and the coun-
try was passing through a dry spell. At the time, fruit was ripe and
shade was dearly sought. People love to stay where they have
shade and fruit [trees], and find leaving them distasteful. The Messenger of God would seldom go out on a military expedition without alluding to a destination and announcing [publicly] that
he meant [a placel342 other than that intended . The Tabuk expedi-
tion was the exception, in that he explained [the particulars of the expedition openly] to the people. This was because of the long distance, the difficult season, and the enemy's numerical superi-
ority. He wanted the people to be fully prepared, so he ordered

341. Wigidi, Maghazi, III, 989- 92, 1019, states that the Prophet had received the news that the Byzantines were gathering troops and threatening to attack Medina. After reaching Tabuk, the Prophet discovered that the information he had received was exaggerated and decided to return to Medina. Cf. Balidhuri, Ansab, I, 368.

them to make ready and informed them that his objective was the Byzantines. They prepared themselves despite their dislike for that approach and what it entailed, as well as their respect for the Byzantines and their fighting ability.
One day, while the Messenger of God was making preparations for this expedition, he said to Jadd b. Qays,343 brother344 of the Banu Salimah:345 "Would you like, 0 Jadd, to fight the Banu Afar (sons of the Yellow/Red One)346 this year?" He said: "0, Messenger of God, please excuse me [from this] and do not tempt me. By God, my folk know no better admirer of women than I.1 fear that if I see the women of the Banu Afar I shall not be able to control myself." The Messenger of God turned away from him saying, " I excuse you." It was about al-Jadd that the following verse was revealed: "Among them is a man who says, 'Grant me exemption [to stay at home] and tempt me not [into trial].' Have they not already fallen into trial ? Indeed hell encompasses the unbelievers."347 ["Tempt me not "] meant that he feared tempta- tion from the women of the Banu Afar. But was it not [also]
temptation that he had fallen into, by staying behind [while] the Messenger of God [went to battle]? By falling prey to human desires, he had fallen into a greater temptation . Indeed, hell is at his back.

The Byzantines were called Banu Afar by the Arabs in contrast to aswad (black), a description of non-Arabs as light-skinned. The genealogists were not satisfied with the color explanation and considered Agfar, (Sefo of Genesis 36:I) the grandson of Esau (in the Septuagint, Genesis 36 , to) and the father of Rumll (Genesis 36, I fl, as the ancestor of the Rum. E12, s.v. Afar; Goldziher, Muslim studies, 1, 243; Lewis, Muslim discovery, 141. In Hazm (Jamharah, 5zz), on the
other hand, states that the Bana Afar were the descendants of Igab b. Is$aq b. lbrihim, who lived in the mountains of al-Sharit between Syria and al-1 ijaz.

skeptical of the truth, and spreading false rumors about the Mes- senger of God, said to another that they should not go out in the heat. With regard to them, God revealed: "They said, 'Do not march out in the heat'; say, 'The heat of hell is far more intense, if only they understand!' So, let them laugh a little, for they will weep more in retribution for [the sins ] they have accu- mulated."349
The Messenger of God went ahead earnestly with his prepara- tions for the expedition and ordered the men to get ready quickly. He urged and persuaded the people of means [to help in meeting] the expenses and [to provide] mounts for the cause of God. The men of means provided mounts [in anticipation of] God's reward. 'Uthman b. 'Affan spent a huge sum, more35O than anyone had ever done, on this expedition.
Seven Muslims, known as "The Weepers," from among the Ansar and others, came to the Messenger of God and asked him to provide them with mounts, for they were without means. He said: "I do not have any mount to provide you with." They turned back and their eyes flowed with tears out of grief that they had not the wherewithal to meet the expense (of the expedition]351
[Ibn Isliaq] states : I have received a report that Yamzn b . 'Umayr
b. Ka'b al-Nadri met Abu Layla 'Abd al-Rabman b. Ra'b and 'Abdallah b. Mughaffal as they were weeping, and asked, "What
makes you cry?" They responded, 'We went to the Messenger of
God (asking him) for mounts, but he had none to give us and we
do not have anything to sustain us in order to go forth with him." Thereupon he gave them a camel upon which water was carried
[from a well], so they mounted it. He provided them with some [1695] dates, and they went off with the Messenger of God.352

to apologize, but God would not accept their excuse. I have been told that they were from the Banu Ghifar,353 and Khufaf b. Ima' b. Rah4ah was one of them.
When the Messenger of God was prepared and determined to set off, a number of Muslims, whose intentions had prevented them from [following ] the Messenger of God , lagged behind with- out any doubts or misgivings . Among them were Ka'b b . Malik b. Abi Ka'b,354 brother of the Banu Salimah; Murarah b. al-Rabi', brother of the Banu 'Amr b. 'Awf; Hilal b. Umayyah, brother of the Banu Wagif355 and Abu Khaythamah, brother of the Banu Salim b. 'Awf.356 They were sincere people whose Islam was be- yond reproach.
After the Messenger of God had set out, he pitched his camp by Thaniyyat al-Wadi ,357 whereas 'Abdallah b. Ubayy b. Sauul358 pitched his camp separately below him facing Dhubab,359 a mountain in al-Jubbanah below Thaniyyat al-Wadi'. [The nar- rators] allege that the latter's camp was not the smaller of the two camps. When the Messenger of God set out, 'Abdallah b. Ubayy stayed behind with the hypocrites and waverers360 'Abdallah b. Ubayy was a brother of the Banu 'Awf b. al-Khazraj; 'Abdallah b. Nabtal was a brother of the Banu 'Amr b. 'Awf; and Rifa'ah b.

Ibn Ishaq: The Messenger of God left 'Ali b. Abi Talib behind to look after his family and ordered him to stay with them, and he left Siba' b. 'Urfutah, a brother of the Banu Ghifkr, in charge of Medina.36s The hypocrites spread false rumors about 'All b. Abi Talib, saying that he had been left behind because he was a bur- den to the Messenger of God and he wanted to relieve himself of him. [After) hearing [these accusations) 'Ali took his weapons and set off until he caught up with the Messenger of God while he was [camped]366 in al-Jurf,367 saying, "0 Prophet of God, the hypo- crites allege that you have left me behind because you found me burdensome and wanted to get rid of me." He replied, "They lied. I left you behind because of [what I have 1eftJ368 behind, so go back and represent me in my family and yours. Are you not pleased, O'Ali, that you are in the same position in relation tome as Aaron (Haxun) was in relation to Moses (Musk), except that there will be no prophet after me?

52 The Last Years of the Prophet
Some days after the Messenger of God had set out, Abu Khaythamah,370 a brother of the Banu Salim, returned to his fam- ily on a hot day. He found his two wives in huts [made of palm sticks] in his garden [of palm trees surrounded by a fence]. Each had sprinkled her hut and cooled water for him in it and prepared food for him there. When he entered the garden, he stood at the door of the hut and looked at his wives and what they had pre- pared for him and said, "The Messenger of God is exposed to the heat of the sun and the blowing of the winds, while Abu
J16971 Khaythamah is in cool shade, [has] cool water, prepared food, and rests with a pretty woman371 in his estate. This is not fair." Then he added, "By God, I will not enter either of your huts, but will join the Messenger of God; so get some provisions ready for me." They did so and he brought forth his camel upon which water was carried [from a well and mounted it. He set out in search of the Messenger of God until he overtook him where he had camped in Tabuk. 'Umayr b. Wahb al-Jumalu,372 who was also looking for the Messenger of God, had overtaken Abu Khaythamah on the way, so they traveled together. When they approached Tabuk, Abu Khaythamah said to 'Umayr b. Wahb, "I have done wrong. If you don't mind, stay behind me until I go to the Messenger of God.- 'Umayr complied with his request. When Abu Khaytha- mah drew near the Messenger of God as he halted in Tabuk, the people called [the Prophet's] attention, saying that a rider was approaching on the way. The Messenger of God said, "[It must] be Abu Khaythamah!" They said, "0 Messenger of God, he is, by God, Abu Khaythamah." Having dismounted he came and greet- ed the Messenger of God, who responded by saying, "Woe to you, 0 Abu Khaythamah!" He then informed the Messenger of God what had happened and [the Prophet] spoke to him well and in- voked a blessing upon him 373

the people drew water from its well . Having departed from there,
the Messenger of God said, " Do not drink any of its water nor perform ablutions with it. If you have used it for making dough,
then eat none of it, and feed it to the camels . Let none of you go
out at night alone except with a companion ."375 The people did
as the Messenger of God had ordered them, except for two men
from the Banu Sa'idah•376 one went out to relieve himself, while
the other went to look for his camel. The one who had gone out to [16981 relieve himself was choked on his way, and the other who had
gone to look for his camel was carried away by the wind and was thrown to earth at the two mountains of Tayyi '. When the Mes- senger of God was informed about them he said , "Did I not forbid you from going out alone without a companion ?" He then prayed for the one who was choked on his way and he recovered , and the other who was thrown to earth at the two mountains of Tayyi' was presented to the Messenger of God by a man of Tayyi' when he arrived in Medina.
Abu Ja'far [al-Tabarnl states that the story of the two men was reported by Ibn Humayd - Salamah- Ibn Isbaq- ' Abdallah b. AN Bakr- al-'Abbas b. Sahl b. Sa'd al-Sa'idi377

Ibn Hishim, Sirah, IV, x65, states that when the Messenger of God passed by al- Mir he covered his face with his cloak and urged his camel on, saying, "Do not enter the dwellings of those who sinned unless you are lamenting, for fear that you may meet with the same fate that befell them."

man knew that hypocrisy [exited] in his brother, father, uncle, or his kinsfolk, they would cover it up for each other." Then Mah- mud said, "Some of my clansmen have informed me that a hypo- crite, whose hypocrisy was notorious,379 used to go with the Mes- senger of God wherever he went. When the incident of rain happened at al-fir and the Messenger of God prayed as he did, and God sent a cloud which rained until the people were satisfied, we went to him and said, 'Woe to you! Is there anything more to
say after this?' He replied, '[It was] a passing cloud!"'
Then the Messenger of God moved on. On the way his camel [1699] strayed and his companions went in search of it. There was a man called 'Umarah b. Hazm380 with the Messenger of God who was present at al-'Agabah381 and Badr382 and who was the uncle of the
Banu 'Amr b. Hazm. In his camp was Zayd b. Lu$ayb383 al-Qaynu- gai384 who was a hypocrite. Zayd, while he was in 'Umarah's camp and 'Umarah was with the Messenger of God, said, "Does not Muhammad allege that he is a prophet and informs you of news from heaven when he doesn't know where his camel is? "385 The Messenger of God said while 'Umarah was with him, "A man has said that this Muhammad tells you that he is a prophet and alleges that he informs you of heavenly matters when he doesn't

know where his camel is. By God, I know nothing except that which God has taught me, and He has indicated to me where it is. It is in the-3116 valley on such-and-such a mountain trail. It is caught up in a tree by its halter; so go and bring it to me." They went and brought it. 'Umarah b. Hazen returned to his camp387 and said, "By God, what a wonderful thing the Messenger of God has just told us about something said by someone of which God has informed him." He then repeated the words as uttered by Zayd b. al-Lu$ayb. A man who was in the camp of 'Umarah but was not present with the Messenger of God, exclaimed, "By God, Zayd uttered those words [just) before you came." Consequently, 'Umarah advanced on Zayd beating him on the neck and saying, "0 servants of God, by God, a great distressing thing happened in my camp and I did not know of it . [Addressing Zayd] Get out of my camp, 0 enemy of God, and do not accompany me." Some people allege that Zayd repented after that, while others say that he was suspected of evil until he died.
Then the Messenger of God continued his march and men be-
gan to fall behind . When they told the Messenger of God that so and-so had fallen behind, he responded, "Leave him, for if there is any good in him God will unite him with you; if not, God has relieved you of him ." Finally, it was reported to him that Abu Dharr388 had fallen behind and his camel had delayed him. He said, "Let him be, for if there is any good in him God will join him to you; if not, God has relieved you of him." Abu Dharr remained on his camel until it slowed down with him . Then he took his baggage, lifted it onto his back and started following the trail of the Messenger of God . When the Messenger of God had halted at one of his halting places, an onlooker called his attention to a lonely man walking on the way. The Messenger of God said that he wished it was Abu Dharr. When the people looked attentively, they said that it was indeed Abu Dharr. The Messenger of God said, "May God have mercy on Abu Dharr! He walks alone, will die alone, and will be raised alone."

56 The Last Years of the Prophet
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Ibn Ishaq-Buraydah b. Sufyan al- Aslami3s9-Muhamad b. Ka'b al-Aura 1:390 When 'Uthman ex- iled Abu Dharr, he came down to al-Rabadhah391 where he died and there was no one with him except his wife and slave. (Abu Dharr] instructed them to wash him and to wrap him in a shroud and lay him on the open road and to tell the first caravan that passed by that he was Abu Dharr, a companion of the Messenger of God, and that they should help [his wife and slave] bury him. When he died, they did [as they were told] and put his body on the open road. 'Abdallah b. Mas'ud392 had been approaching that place with a group of men from Iraq on a lesser pilgrimage when sud-
denly they noticed the bier on the road,-393 the camels nearly treading on it. [Abu Dharr's] slave went to them and said, "This is Abu Dharr, the Messenger of God's companion. Help us to bury
(r 7o i ] him." 'Abdallah b. Mas'nd broke into tears saying, "The Mes- senger of God spoke the truth. You will walk alone, die alone, and be raised alone."

Some of them said to others, "Do you think that fighting the Banu Agfar is like fighting otherst399 By God, it looks to me as if you will be tied with ropes tomorrow in order to intimidate and frighten the faithful." Makhshi b. Humayyir°00 said, "By God, I wish I could swear before a judge that every one of us should be flogged a hundred lashes if we could escape from God 's revealing a verse about us because of what you have said."401
The Messenger of God, as it was reported to me, said to 'Ammar
b. Yasir,402 "Overtake that band, for they have forged lies, and ask
them what they said. If they deny it, tell them, 'Yes indeed, you
said such-and-such."' 'Ammar went and told them (what the
Prophet had said), and they came to the Messenger of God making excuses. The Messenger of God had stopped on his camel, and Wadi'ah b. Thabit started speaking while he held its girth: "0 Messenger of God, we were simply playing and speaking non-
sense." Then God revealed about them: "And if you question
them, then assuredly they will say, 'We were only speaking non-
sense and playing. "'4O3 Makhshi b. Humayyir said, "0 Mes-
senger of God, my name and my father's name have withheld me
[from attaining honor)."404 The man who was pardoned in the

5 8 The Last Years of the Prophet
'Abd al-Rahman 406 He asked God to make him die as a martyr in a place not known [by anyone]. He was killed on the day of al- Yamamah407 and no trace of him was found.
When the Messenger of God reached Tabuk, Yuhannah b. Ru'bah, governor of Aylah,408 came to him, made a treaty with him, and offered him the poll tax [jizyah]. The people of jarbi'409 and Adhnah41O also offered him the poll tax, and the Messenger of God wrote a document for each of them which is still in their possession.
Then the Messenger of God summoned Khalid b. al-Wal7id411 and sent him to Ukaydir at Dumah.412 This was Ukaydir b. 'Abd al-Malik, a man from Kindah413 who was a king of Dumah and a Christian. The Messenger of God told Khalid that he would find him hunting wild cows . Khalid b. al-Walid rode out until he came

410. It was a Roman camp between Ma an and Petra in the judham country and was visited by the caravans of Quraysh . It became famous in Islamic history on account of the arbitration conference which took place there after the battle of $iffin. E12, s.v. Adhrub. Wagidi, Maghazf, III, 1032, has reproduced the treaty. Cf. I:iamidullah, Majmn'ah, 90-91.

within sight of his fort . It was a moonlit summer night and Ukaydir was on the roof terrace with his wife. The wild cows had been scratching the palace gate with their horns all night. His wife asked him if he had ever seen anything like that, and he said,
"No indeed." Then she said, "Who would allow this?" He re- sponded, "No one." He then came down and called for his horse, which was saddled. A group of men from his family , among them his brother Hassan, took their hunting spears, mounted [their horses], and rode off. On their way they encountered the Mes- senger of God's cavalry, and [Ukayd rj was seized and his brother Hassan was killed. Hassan was wearing a silk brocade gown woven with gold in the form of date-palm leaves. Khalid stripped him of it and sent it to the Messenger of God before his arrival.414
Ibn Humayd--Salamah- Muhammad b. Ishaq-'Agim b.
'Umar b. Qatadah-Anas b. Malik: I saw Ukaydir's gown when it
was brought to the Messenger of God. The Muslims were feeling 117031 it with their hands and admiring it. The Messenger of God said,
"Are you amazed at it? By Him in whose hand is Muhammad's
soul, the kerchiefs of Sa'd b. Mu1 dh415 in paradise are better than
this."
Ibn Humayd-Salamah- Ibn Ishaq: Khalid brought Ukaydir to the Messenger of God, who spared his blood and made peace with him on the condition that he paid the poll tax.416 Then he re- leased him, and he returned to his village.
(Now the report goes back to Yazid b. Roman at the beginning of the military expedition to Tabuk.) [See Tabari, I, 1692, above] The Messenger of God stayed in Tabuk no more than ten nights

Mu'idh died in 5/627 as a result of injuries suffered during the siege of Medina when he was thirty-siven years old. In Hishim, Sirah, III, 262- 64; Ibn Sa'd, Tabagat, ID/2, 2-13 ; Ibn Hajar, l dbah, 1II, 84-85; Ell, s.v. Sa'd b. Mu'idh. The tradition states : A silk robe was presented to the Messenger of God, and his companions began to feel it with their hands and marvel at its softness, so he said, "Do you marvel at the softness of this? Sad b . Mu'adh's headband in paradise is better and softer than it." Tabrizi, Mishkat, 111, 272; Mishkat (trans. Robson], II,

and departed, returning to Medina. On the way there was water issuing from a rock in a valley called al-mushaqqaq (i.e., the cracked, furrowed 417 enough to quench the thirst of two or three riders. The Messenger of God ordered that whoever should get there before him must not draw any water from it until he came. A number of hypocrites418 got there first and drew the water that was there. When the Messenger of God came and halted, he found no water. He inquired as to who had got there first, and was told that so-and-so had. He exclaimed, "Did we not forbid them to draw any water from it until we came?" He then cursed them and invoked God against them. Then he alighted and put his hand under the rock, and water started to sprinkle into his hand as God willed. He then sprinkled the rock with that water, rubbed it with his hand and prayed as God willed him to pray. The water gushed forth, as one who heard it said, with the sound of thunder. The
[1704] people drank and drew water from it for their needs, and the Messenger of God said, "Those419 of you who live will indeed hear about this valley that it is more fertile than others in its vicinity."
The the Messenger of God proceeded until he halted in Dhu Awin,420 a town an hour's daytime journey from Medina. The people who had built the Mosque of Dissent (masjid al-,dinar) had come to him while he was preparing for Tabuk, saying, "0 Mes- senger of God, we have built a mosque for the sick and needy and for rainy and cold nights, and we would like you to visit us and pray for us in it."421 [The Prophet] said that he was on the verge of traveling, and was preoccupied, or words-to that effect, and that when he returned, God willing, he would come to them and pray for them in it.
When he stopped in Dhu Awin, news of the mosque422 came to him, and he summoned Milik b. al-Dukhshum, a brother of the

Banu Salim b. 'Awf, and Ma'n b. Adi, or his brother 'Aim b. 'Adi, brothers of the Band al-'Ajlan,4" and said, "Go to this mosque whose owners are unjust people and destroy and burn it." They went out briskly424 until they came to the Banu Salim b. 'Awf who were Malik b. al-Dukhshum's clan. Malik said to Man, "Wait for me until I bring fire from my people." He went to his kinsfolk and took a palm branch and lighted it. Then both of them ran until they entered the mosque , its people inside, set fire to it and destroyed it and the people dispersed.425 Concerning them it was revealed in the Qur'in: "And those who have taken a mosque for [working] mischief and disbelief, as well as disunion among the faithful and as an outpost for those who already fought God and His Messenger, will swear, 'We desired nothing but good.' God witnesses what sort of liars they are. "426
Those who built [the mosque ] were twelve men:427 Khidim428
b. Khalid from the Banu 'Ubayd b. Zayd, one of the Band 'Amr b.
'Awf, (the Mosque of Dissent was built as an extension onto his
house); Tha'labah b. Halib from the Band 'Ubayd, attributed to 117051 the Band Umayyah b. Zayd;429 Mu'attib b. Qushayr from the

425. Wigidi states that the fire was set after the evening prayer.
426. Qur'in 9:107. The Prophet had received some information which made
him suspect the ulterior motives of the builders of this mosque. Probably they were linked to those who had planned an attempt on the Prophet 's life when he was returning from Tabnk. It was also suspected that they were acting in concert with Abn 'Amir, an opponent of the Prophet.

62 The Last Years of the Prophet
The Messenger of God arrived in Medina [and found that) a group of hypocrites had stayed behind. From among the Muslims, Ka'b b. Malik, Murirah b. al-Rabi', and Hilil b. Umayyah had also stayed behind, but without doubt or hypocrisy. The Messenger of God ordered that no one should' speak to the three.430 Then the hypocrites who had stayed behind came to him making excuses and swearing oaths so he forgave them, but neither God nor His Messenger ever absolved them from guilt. The Muslims refrained from speaking to those three until God revealed: "God has for-
given the Prophet and the Emigrants (Muhiijirun) and the Helpers (An$dr) who followed him in the hour of difficulty, after the hearts of a section of them were about to swerve aside; He then turned to them [in His mercy); surely He is kind and compassion- ate with them. As for the three who were left behind [he did not forgive them], until, when the earth became straitened for them, despite all its breadth, and their souls became straitened, so that they thought there was no shelter from God except in Him, He then turned to them, that they might also repent; surely God accepts repentance, and is all-compassionate. 0 believers, fear
God, and be with those who are truthful."431
The Messenger of God returned to Medina from Tabuk in the month of Ramadin. In that month , the deputation of Thagzf, those whose report has been mentioned before, came to him.
