[1706] In this year (i.e., A.H. 9), the Messenger of God dispatched Ali b. Abi T glib with an army (sariyyah )A32 to the land of Tayyi' in the month of Rabi ' 1I.433 He raided them and took captives and seized

The term sariyyah, p1. sardyd, is applied to an army sent by the Prophet in contradistinction to ghazwah (pl. ghazawdt, also maghdzi, meaning raiding expe- dition, wherein the Prophet himself participated. Originally it was applied to a portion of an army marching by night ; it could consist of from five persons to four hundred. Lane, Lexicon, s.v. s-r-y.

[My aunt] said "0 Messenger of God, the man who should speak for me (wafid[444 is far away, my son has been separated [from me], and I am an old woman of no service [to anyone]. Be kind to me and God will be kind to you, 0 Messenger of God." He said,
"Who is the man who should speak for you?" "'Adi b. Hatim," she said. He said, "[The one] who fled from God and His Mes- senger." He then granted her request, and a man next to her, who was apparently 'Al!, told her to ask him for a mount. She asked for one and the Messenger of God ordered it for her.

'Adi b. Hatim: She came to me and said, "You have done some- thing which your father would not have done. Go to him [i.e., the Messenger of God] with earnestness and fear. So-and-so went to him and he was treated properly ." So I went to him and lo, a woman and two boys, or a boy, were with him. (Then the narrator [i.e., `Abbad b. Hubayshj recounted their closeness [of rela-
[11707] tionship] to the Prophet.)445 And so I knew that he was neither like Khusraw (Kisra)4" nor like Caesar (Qayyar) 447 He said to me, "0 'Ad! b. Hatim, what made you flee from saying, 'There is no God except Allah'? Is there any God except Allah? What made you flee from saying, 'God is great'? Is there any thing greater than Allah?" So I embraced Islam and saw in his face that he was rejoicing.
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Muhammad b. Ishaq-Shayban b. Sa'd al-'jai: It has been reported to me that'Ad! b . Hatim of Tayyi' used to say, "No Arab disliked the Messenger of God when he first heard about him more than I. As far as I was concerned, I was a noble man, a Christian, traveling about among my people and collecting the fourth part of their spoils (mirbd) 448 I professed my own religion, and the way I was treated was as if I were a king among my people. When I heard the Messenger of God I disliked him and said to an Arab slave of mine who was herding my camels, 'May you have no father!449 Prepare for me some docile, fat, and old camels, and keep them near me. When you hear of Muhammad's army treading this country, inform me."' He did
that, and one morning he came to me and said , "O 'Adi, whatever you were going to do when Muhammad 's cavalry should descend upon you, do it now, for I have seen banners and when I inquired about them I was told that they were Muhammad 's army." I asked him to bring my camels, which he did, and I took my family and children and told him that I would join my fellow

Christians in Syria. I traveled to al-Jushiyyah450 and left one of Hatim's daughters in that settlement. When I reached Syria I stayed there.
The Messenger of God's cavalry followed me when I turned
away from [that settlement] and took Hatim's daughter among
the captives.She was brought to the Messenger of God among the [i7o8] captives of Tayyi' and he received the news of my flight to Syria.
Hatim's daughter was put in the enclosure by the door of the
mosque where the captives were detained 45i When the Mes-
senger of God passed by her she went to him and, being an intel-
ligent woman, said, "0 Messenger of God, [my] father is dead, and
the man who should speak for me has gone away . Grant me a
favor and God will grant one for you." "Who is the man who
should speak for you?" he asked . When she replied that it was
`Adi b. Hatim he exclaimed, "The one who has fled from God and
His Messenger." Then he walked away and left her. On the fol-
lowing day he passed by heI2 while she was in despair. A man
behind [the Prophet] motioned her to go to him and speak (to
him). She went to him and said, "0 Messenger of God, [my] father
is dead, and the man who should speak for me is absent . Be kind
to me and God will be kind to you ." He replied, "I have done so,
but do not rush to leave until you find someone of your own
people whom you can trust and take you to your country, then
call on me." She states: I asked about the man who had motioned
to me to speak and was told that it was All b. Abi Talib. I stayed
until some riders from Bali or Qutla'ah453 came . What I wanted
was to go to my brother in Syria . I went to the Messenger of God
and said, " 0 Messenger of God, a group of my people who are trustworthy and reputable have arrived." He provided me with clothing, put me on a mount and gave me money, and I departed
with them until I arrived in Syria.

66 The Last Years of the Prophet
[1709] 'Adi said: By God, I was sitting among my family when I saw a woman riding in a howdah pointing to me and leading her way to us. I exclaimed, "(Is it] Hatim's daughter?" and it was she. When she got to me she reviled me, saying, "You, the unjust one who broke with your relatives, you carried away your family and chil- dren and abandoned your father's (little) daughter454 and honor." I replied, "0 [my] little sister, do not say anything except good, for by God, I have no excuse. I did do what you stated." Then she dismounted and stayed with me. Because she was a prudent wom-
an, I asked her what she thought of [the Prophet]. She replied, "By God, I think that you should join him forthwith, for if the man is a prophet, then the one who joins him first will have an exquisite virtue; and if he is a king, you will not be humbled in the glory of the Yemen, you being what you are." I said, "By God, this is a good suggestion," and so I left until I came to the Messenger of God in Medina. I went to him while he was in his mosque and greeted him, and he asked who I was. When I said that I was 'Adi b. Hatim, he got up and took me to his house. By God, as he was leading me an old feeble woman ran to him and asked him to stop. He stopped for a long while as she spoke to him of her needs. I said to myself, "By God, this is no king." Then he continued until we entered his house, reached out for a leather cushion stuffed with palm fibers and threw it to me, saying, "Sit on this."
I said, "No, rather you sit on it." He said, "No, you," and so I sat on it and he sat on the ground. I said to myself, "By God, this is not the way a king conducts himself." Then he said "Now, 'Adi b.
[1710] Hatim, are you not half Christian and half Sabaean (rakusij?"ass I replied, "Yes." "Didn't you go among your people collecting the fourth part of their spoils?"456 he asked. When I admitted it, he said, "But that is not lawful for you in your religion." I said,
"Certainly, it is true," and realized that he was a prophet sent by

456. According to the Arab lexicographers, pre-Islamic practice was to allot one- quarter of the booty to the leader as commander-in-chief. It was also the South Arabian practice. In Islam, one-fifth of the booty was set aside for God before the general division. Lane, Lexicon, s.v. r-b-'; Beeston, Warfare, r5.

God who knows what is not known. Then he said, "O 'Adi b. Hatim, perhaps it is the poverty that you see which prevents you from embracing this religion, but, by God, [so much] wealth will soon flow among them that there will not be enough people to take it. Perhaps it is because you see how few they are and how many are their enemies which prevents you from joining this religion. But by God, you will hear of a woman traveling on her camel from al-Qadisiyyah457 to visit this House [i .e., the Ka'- bah]458 without fearing [any one] except God. Perhaps it is be- cause you see that others have kingship and power, but, by God, soon you will hear that the white castles of Babylon (Babii[459 have been conquered ." Then I embraced Islam.
'Adi b. Hatirn used to say that two things [mentioned above by the Prophet ] occurred and that the third remained , but, by God, that too would certainly come to pass. I have seen the white castles of Babylon being conquered, and I have seen a woman traveling on her camel from al -Qadisiyyah to this House to make the pilgrimage without any fear. By God, the third will happen and wealth will flow until there will not be anyone to take it.
Al-Wagidi: In this year, the deputation of the Banu Tamim460 came to the Messenger of God.

E12, s.v. Bibil. Ibn Isl?iq, Kitab al-Mubtada', 267-68, gives different ver- sions of what the Prophet said to 'Ad-i. One version states : O 'Adi b. Hatim, the last hour will come only when the treasures of Kisra and Qayyar would have been conquered ... the last hour will come only when a woman would travel on her camel, from al-H-irah [to Meccal to circumambulate the Ka'bah, without protec- tion ... the last hour will come only when a man carrying a sack of money would roam [about the country] and would not find anyone who would take it.

Al-Aqra' b. Habis and 'Uyaynah b. Hign had been with the Mes- senger of God when Mecca was conquered465 and 466 al-Ta'if was besieged. When the deputation of the Banu Tamim came, they were with them. As the deputation entered the mosque, they called out to the Messenger of God from behind the [inner] apart- ments, "Come out to us, 0 Muhammad."467 That loud call of theirs annoyed the Messenger of God, and he came out. They said, "0 Muhammad, we came to compete with you in boasting, so allow our poet and orator [to start]." He replied, "Yes I permit your orator, let him speak." 'Ularid b. Hajib stood up and said: "Praise be to God who granted us His favors and who is worthy of praise. [It is He] who has made us kings and has granted us great wealth with which we are generous, and has made us the might- iest people of the East, the greatest in number, and best armed; so who among the people is our equal ? Are we not the leaders of men and their superiors? Let him who competes with us enumerate what we have enumerated.

464. There were more than eighty people in the delegation. The reason of their coming is explained by Ibn Sa'd, Tabagnt, I/2, 404; U/ x, rr6, as follows:
The Tamimis had attempted to prevent the Khuza'ah tribe from paying the alms to the Prophet's agent. Although the Khuzi'ites were able to drive the Tarnimis away, the Prophet's agent fled back to Medina. Subsequently, the Prophet sent a force of fifty horsemen under the leadership of 'Uyaynah b. Hign to punish the Tsmimis. In a surprise raid, 'Uyaynah captured about fifty men, women, and children and brought them back to Medina . It was then that the delegation came. When their women and children saw them , they began to cry. This explains the sense of urgency and impatience displayed by the delegation in their attempt to reach the Prophet.
465. Ibn Isl,iiq adds : And at the battle of Hunayn.
466. Ibn Shabbah adds : (The battle of) Hunayn (was fought(, and.
467. The delegation on its arrival in Medina passed by the Tamimi prisoners.
When the women and children saw them, they burst into tears, hence the delega- tion went hurriedly to the mosque calling the Prophet from behind the inner apartments.

granted us, and we are known [for that].469 Now, I will say that you may bring forward the like of our speech and anything better than ours." Then he sat down.
The Messenger of God said to Thabit b. Qays b. Shammas,470 a [1712] brother of Ballaarith471 b. al-Khazraj , " Get up and answer the
man's speech." Thibit got up and said:472 "Praise belongs to God
who created heaven and earth and carried out His command
therein, and His knowledge encompasses His Throne . Nothing exists but by His bounty. By His power He made us kings and chose the best of His creation as a prophet who is the noblest in lineage, the most truthful in speech, and the best in noble de- scent . He sent down to him His book and entrusted him with His creatures. He was the chosen one of God from the worlds. Then he summoned people to faith, and the Emigrants from his people and his kinsfolk believed in the Messenger of God. They are the most noble people in lineage, the most prominent, and the best in deeds. Then the first of creation to answer and respond to God when the Messenger of God summoned them were ourselves. We are the Helpers of God and the viziers of His Messenger, and we fight people until they believe in God. He who believes in God and His Messenger has protected his life and possessions from us]; as for one who disbelieves, we will fight him forever in the cause of God and killing him is a small matter to us . I say this and ask God's forgiveness for myself and the believing men and the believing women . Peace be upon you."
Then they said, "0 Muhammad, permit our poet [to speak]," and he did. AI-Zibrigan b. Badr got up and said:
We are the nobles, no tribe can match us,
from us are the kings and in473 our midst houses of worship are built.
How many tribes have we plundered and subjugated, for excellence in glory is to be sought after!

[11713]
In times of drought when no tattered clouds are seen,
we feed meat to the hungry in our banquet halls.
You can see leaders coming to us humbly from every land,
and we feed them.474
We are delighted to slaughter a herd of camels for our guests, when they come to us they eat their fill.
You will see not a tribe whom we challenge,
except in submission or with its head nearly cut off. We scorn others but none scorns us,
similarly, we are exalted in pride.
He who would challenge us [in these matters] knows us,
so he withdraws his challenge, and the news is listened to seriously.
Hassan b. Thabit475 was absent [at the time], so the Messenger of God sent for him. Hassan said: When the runner came and informed me that the Messenger of God had called me to .answer the Banu Tamim 's poet, I went to him while reciting:476
We protected the Messenger of God when he settled down among us,477 whether Ma'add liked it or not 478
We defended him when he dwelt among our houses,479
with our swords against every transgressor and oppressor, in a unique house whose glory and wealth48o is in Jabiyat al-Jawlan4' among the foreigners.
Is glory [nothing] but the reiteration of domination
and generosity, and the dignity of kings and the enduring of great misfortunes?

When I came to the Messenger of God and the tribal poet (of (17141 Tamiml had recited what he recited, I replied in the same pattern
and rhyme.
When al-Zibrigan b. Badr had finished his recitation, the Mes- senger of God said to Hassan, "Arise, 0 Hassan, and answer the man for what he has said." Hassan recited:482
The nobles are from Fihr and their sister tribes; they have shown a way of life to be followed.
Everyone who fears God
and does all manner of good commends them.484 They are a people such that when they fight they harm
their enemies, and when they help their adherents
they benefit.
That is their nature and not a newly acquired habit;
be informed485 that the worst of personal traits is
innovation.
If there are people who surpassed them and came after them, then every preceding people would
have precedence.
People do not repair what their hands have destroyed in defense, nor do they destroy what they have repaired.
If they compete with others, they win by virtue of their 1171151 precedence; if weighed against the people of glory
and generosity, their scales are heavy.
Chaste are those whose chastity is mentioned in revelation; they are not rapacious486 nor can greed harm them.
They are not stingy with an act of generosity toward a neighbor,487 nor are they touched by the stain of covetousness.
When we declare war on a tribe, we do not creep silently, like a calf crawling to the wild cow.

We stand tall when the claws of war reach us, when the hordes are humbled by its nails.
They do not boast488 when they overpower their enemy, and if they are beaten, they neither languish nor despair.
In battle, when death is at hand,
they are like lions of Bishah489 with crooked claws.

I dedicate my eulogy to them from my heart,
aided in its beloved task by an eloquent and ready tongue,
For they are the best of all people in matters both grave and gay.
When Hassan b. Thabit had finished his speech,493 al-Aqra' b. Habis said,494 "By my father, this man has a helper. Indeed, his orator and his poet are better than ours and their voices are loud- er495 than ours." When they were through, they embraced Islam and the Messenger of God gave them valuable gifts.

When you defamed me to the Prophet you exposed [1717] yourself; you neither spoke the truth nor hit the mark.
If you hate us, well, Byzantine497 is your origin, but the Byzantines do not harbor hatred against the Arabs.
We have ruled and our authority is ancient, but yours498 is left behind at the root of the rump and the tail.

Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Muhammad b. Ishaq-'Abdallah b. Abi Bakr: On his return from Tabuk, a letter from the kings of Himyar [announcing] their Islam came to the Messenger of God

Then the Messenger of God wrote to them :5O6 "In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. From Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and His Prophet to al-Harith b. 'Abd Kulal, Nu'aym b.

If anyone adds more thereto, it is to his credit . He who professes this and bears witness to his Islam and helps the faithful against the polytheists is one of the faithful with his rights and obligations as theirs, and has the protection of God and His Messenger . If a Jew or a Chris- tian embraces Islam, then-515 he has the same rights and obliga- tions as the faithful. He who holds fast to his religion, Judaism or Christianity, is not to be tempted from516 it. It is incumbent on him to pay the poll tax : for every adult, male or female, free or slave, one full dinar (denarius),517 or its value in al-ma`afir,518 or its substitute in clothes.

Alms are neither lawful to Muhammad nor to his family; it is a purifying tax to be spent on poor Muslims and the wayfarer. Malik has conveyed only the necessary infor- mation but has kept [others'] secrets to himself, so I order you to treat him well. I have sent to you some of the most virtuous of my people, the most religious and the most learned, so I order you to treat them well, for he [i.e., Mu adh b. Jabal] will be accountable for them.

"541 "Yes, indeed, 0 Messenger of God," he answered, and left as the head of the pilgrims, while'Ali announced the declaration of immunity. 'Ali stood up on the day of sacrifice542 and announced, saying: "No polytheist shall come near the Holy Mosque after this year,543 and no one shall circum-
ambulate the House [i.e., the Ka'bahl naked. Those who have a covenant between themselves and the Messenger of God will have his covenant until [the end of] its term.544 These are the days of eating and drinking [i.e., celebration]. God will allow only the one who is Muslim to enter Paradise." [The polytheists] said, "We declare ourselves free from your covenant and that of your cousin except to strike." Then the polytheists went back blaming each other and saying, "What will you do? The Quraysh have accepted Islam, and so you had better embrace Islam."

heal nor harm. God has sent a messenger and has sent down to
him a book. By means of it I seek to deliver you from your present
state [of ignorance]. [As for me], I bear witness that there is no god

sunnah of His Prophet. If they did not accept Islam, I was to fight
them. I came to them and invited them to Islam for three days as
the Messenger of God commanded me, and I sent riders among
them [announcing], '0 Banii al-Harith, embrace Islam, and you
will be safe.' They have surrendered and did not fight, and I am
staying in their midst ordering them [to do] what God has or-
dered, forbidding them from [doing] what God has forbidden, and teaching them the requirements of Islam and the sunnah of the
Prophet until the Messenger of God writes to me. Peace be upon
you, 0 Messenger of God, and God's mercy and blessings."
The Messenger of God wrote to him:570 "In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful, from Muhammad, the Prophet, the Messenger of God, to Khalid b. al-Walid. Peace be upon you. I praise God, the only God, unto you. Now then: Your letter has reached me via your messenger571 with the news572 that the Banu al-Harith [b. Ka'bJ573 surrendered before they fought574 and re-

God has guided them with His guidance, so give them good tid- ings and warn them and return, and let their deputation come with you. Peace be upon you, and God's mercy and His blessings."
Then Khalid b. al-Walid came back to the Messenger of God and with him came the deputation of the Banu al-Harith b. Ka'b. Qays b. al-Hu$ayn b. Yazid b. Qanan Dhu al-Ghuggah, Yazid b.
[17261 'Abd al-Madan, 576 Yazid b. al-Mu1 ajjal, 'Abdallah b. QurayZ577 al- Ziyadi, Shaddad b. 'Abdallah b. al-Qanani, and 'Amr b. 'Abdallah al-Qababi were among the delegation. When they came to the Messenger of God, he saw them and asked who those people were, because they looked like Indians. He was told that they were the Banu al-Harith b. Ka'b. When they stood before the Mes- senger of God, they greeted him and said, "We testify that you are the Messenger of God and that there is no god but Allah." He replied, "And I testify that there is no god but Allah, and that I am the Messenger of God." Then he said, "You are the ones who when driven away would push forward." They became silent and none of them answered him. He repeated it three times and none of them replied. When he repeated it the fourth time Yazid b. 'Abd al-Madan replied, "Yes, 0 Messenger of God, we are the ones who, when driven away, pushed forward," and he repeated it four times. The Messenger of God said, "Had Khalid b. al-Walid not written to me that you had surrendered and had not fought, I would have thrown your heads underneath your feet." Yazid b.
'Abd al-Madan answered, "By God, 0 Messenger of God, we did not eulogize you, nor did we eulogize Khalid." "Then whom did you eulogize?" he asked. They said, "We exalted God who guided us through you." "You have spoken the truth," he said, and then asked them, "With what did you overpower those who fought you in pre-Islamic times (al-jnhi1iyyah)?"578 "We did not prevail over anyone," they replied. "Yes, indeed, you did prevail over

God, we used to overpower those who fought us because we were
the sons of slaves and579 were united, not divided, and never [1727] committed an injustice against anyone ." " You have spoken the
truth," he said, and appointed Qays b. -al-Hugayn as their leader.58o
The deputation of the Band al -Harith b. Ka`b returned to their people at the end of Shawwil or the beginning of Dhd al-Qa'dah. After their return there did not pass but four months before the Messenger of God died.
Ibn Humayd- Salamah- Ibn Isbiq: I have received an account on the authority of `Abdallih b. Abi Bakr : After the deputation of the Band al-Harith b. Ka'b returned, the Messenger of God sent `Amr b. Hazm al-Amid and later someone from the Band al- Najjar58i to instruct them in religion, to teach them the sunnah and the requirements of Islam, and to collect alms from them. The Messenger of God wrote a letter for 'Am entrusting him with his commands. [It read]:582
"In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. This is a declaration from God and His Messenger. '0 you the believers, fulfill your contracts.'583 [This is al deed from Muhammad, the Prophet, to `Amr b. Hazm when he sent him to the Yemen. He orders him to fear God (tagwa)in all his doings for 'Surely God is with those who are god-fearing, and those who are doers of good.'584 He commands him to observe the truth as God has commanded, that he should give the people tidings of good (al- khayr), command them to follow it, teach them the Qur'an, in- struct them in religion, and forbid them [from wrongdoing], be- cause 'None but the purified shall touch the Qur'an.'585 [He]

should inform the people of their privileges and obligations and be gentle to them when right is with them, but be severe with them when they are unjust, for God abhors injustice and forbids it, and states, 'Surely the curse of God shall rest upon the evildoers.'586
"He should give the people good news of paradise and the way to attain it,587 and should warn them of hell-fire and the way to earn it. [He] should court the friendship of the people until they comprehend religion and should teach them the rites of pil-
(1728] grimage, its practices, its obligations, and what God has com- manded about it with regard to the greater pilgrimage (al-Ilajj al- akbar)588 and the lesser pilgrimage (al-bajj al-aghar), the latter being the 'umrah.589 [He must] prohibit people from praying in one small garment unless it be a garment whose ends590 could be doubled over the shoulders.591 [He must] forbid them from wrap- ping themselves in one garment which would expose [what de- cency requires to be concealed]592 and forbid men to braid their hair when it is long on the back of the head. (He must] forbid them from appealing to tribes and kinsfolk when there is a dis- pute among them, but let their appeal be to God alone who has no associate. He who does not appeal to God but [instead] to tribes and kinsfolk should be smitten with the sword, so that the appeal is made to God alone who has no associate . [He must] command the people to perform the ablution thoroughly with plentiful water-washing the face, washing the hands and the forearms up to the elbows, washing the feet up to the ankles, and rubbing [the wet hands] on the head as God has commanded.593

"He orders him to take God's fifth from booty and those alms enjoined on the faithful from landed property-one tenth from
the land watered by streams596 and rain, and one twentieth from
land watered by a leathern bucket; two sheep for every ten camels 1117291 and four sheep for every twenty camels; a cow for every forty
cows and a bull or a cow calf for every thirty cows; one sheep for every forty sheep at pasture. This is the ordinance of God which He has enjoined on the faithful concerning alms. He who adds thereto earns merit. A Christian or a Jew who embraces Islam sincerely, out of his own accord, and follows the religion of Islam, is among the faithful with the same privileges and the same obli- gations. He who holds fast to his Christianity or Judaism is not to be seduced597 from it. On every adult, male or female, free or .slave, [the poll tax] is one full dinar , or its substitute ('ar(1uhu)598 in clothes. He who pays [the poll tax] has the protection of God and His Messenger, and he who withholds it is the enemy of God, His Messenger, and all the faithful."

88 The Last Years of the Prophet
In this year, the deputation of Ghassan600 came in Ramadan. In this year, the deputation of Ghamid came in Ramadan 601 In this year, the deputation of al-Azd headed by $urad b. 'Abd-
allah came, and they were ten odd.602
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Muhammad b. Is^aq-'Abdallah b.
Abi Bakr: $urad b. 'Abdallah al-Azdi came to the Messenger of
God with the deputation from al-Azd, embraced Islam, and be- [1730] came a good Muslim. The Messenger of God invested him with authority over those of his people who had embraced Islam and ordered him to fight the polytheists from the tribes of the Yemen with them. $urad b. 'Abdallah then left with an army by the
Messenger of God's command and alighted at Jurash,603 which at that time was a closed city inhabited by Yemeni tribes. Khath'am6O4 had sought refuge with them, and when they heard that the Muslims were marching they shut themselves in it. The Muslims besieged them for about a month but the tribes refrained from coming out of the city. $urad withdrew from them, appear- ing to return. While he was near a mountain called Kashar,605 the inhabitants of Jurash, thinking that he had fled from them, came out in pursuit of him . When they overtook him he turned on them and inflicted a heavy loss on them.
The people of Jurash had sent two of their men to the Mes- senger of God while he was in Medina to explore and see [what was taking place]. One evening, after the afternoon prayer, while they were with the Messenger of God, he inquired in what coun- try Shakar was. The two men from Jurash got up and replied, "0 Messenger of God, there is a mountain in our country called Kashar, and the people of Jurash call it likewise ." " It is not Kashar but Shakar," he replied. They said, "What is [the news] of it, 0 Messenger of God ?" He replied, " Camels brought for sacrifice to God [at Mecca] are being slaughtered there now." Then the two

men sat with Abu Bakr, or with 'Uthman, who said to them, "Woe to you ! The Messenger of God has just now announced to you the death of your people, so go to him and ask to pray to God to remove [that affliction] from your people." They went and did so, and he did pray for them. Then they left the Messenger of God and returned to their people, and discovered that they were killed on the day Surad attacked them, which was the very day and at the very hour in which the Messenger of God had uttered those
words.
The deputation of Jurash returned to the Messenger of God and
embraced Islam, and he declared the environs of their city to be a sanctuary (I im°a) with well-known marks6O6 for horses, mounts, and ploughing oxen . Anyone who pastured his cattle elsewhere (other than in the sanctuary), then his cattle could be seized and destroyed with impunity.607 A man from al-Azd said with regard to that raid that Khath'am used to attack Azd in pre-Islamic times and used to invade them in the sacred month:
O what a raid ! We never raided before with such success, with mules, horses, and asses,
Until we came to Humayr in its strongholds-
where Khath'am had assembled and were given warnings.
If I could satisfy the thirst for revenge which I carried, I should not care whether they followed Islam
or were infidels.
In this year, the Messenger of God dispatched 'Ali b. Abi 'f glib with an army to the Yemen in Ramadin.608

ther613-Abu Ishaq-al-Bars' b. 'Azib:614 The Messenger of God sent Khalid b. al-Walid to the people of the Yemen inviting them to Islam, and I was among those who went with him. He persisted in the matter for six months, but they did not respond, so the Messenger of God sent 'Ali b. Abi Talib and ordered him that Khalid and those who were with him should return, but if any of them would like to follow him he should allow them. Al-Barn' said, "I was one who followed 'Ali, and as we reached the borders of the Yemen the people got the news. They gathered around him and 'Ali led us in the morning prayer. When he had finished [the prayer], he lined us up in one row. Then he moved before us, praised and extolled God, and then read to them the letter of the Messenger of God.615 All of Hamdan embraced Islam in one day, and he wrote to the Messenger of God about it. When the Prophet read 'All's letter he fell down, prostrating himself to God.616 Then he sat up and said, 'Peace be upon Hamden, peace be upon Ham- den!' [After the conversion of Hamdan] the people of the Yemen followed in succession with their acceptance of Islam."
Abu Ja'far lal-Tabaril: In this year, the deputation of Zubayd617 came to the Prophet with their acceptance of Islam.618
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Ibn Ishaq-'Abdallah b. Abi Bakr: 'Amr b. Ma'dikarib619 came to the Messenger of God with men from the Banu Zubayd and embraced Islam. He had told Qays b.

he says, then it will not be hidden from you, and when we meet him we will follow him. If he is other than that we shall know about him." But Qays b. Makshuh declined and called ('Amr b. Ma`dikarib's] idea foolish. Thereupon `Amr b. Ma'dikarib rode off and came to the Messenger of God, attested his truthfulness, and embraced Islam. When Qays learned about it he criticized 'Amr and threatened621 him, saying that he had gone against him and rejected his counsel. With regard to that, `Amr said:
On the day of Dhu San 'X I counseled you, counsel which was plainly upright.
I counseled you to fear God,
practice goodness, and come to its understanding.
Out of worldly desires you went off,
like a donkey622 beguiled by its lust.
He wished to meet me on a horse, which I ride like a lion,
Wearing a wide coat of mail glittering like a pool, whose water is purified against hard level ground.
Mail that repels lances with their heads bent, with broken shafts flying around.
If you had encountered me,
you would have encountered a lion with a flowing mane.
You would confront a lion
with rough claws and lofty back,
Vying with his rival for glory;
if the rival heads for him he grasps him in his arms,
Seizes him and lifts him up,
throws him down and kills him,
Dashes out his brains and shatters him, tears him apart and devours him,
Admitting none a share in what
his teeth and claws could take.623
Whenever he feeds on the prey, he is received coolly.

where the people around him will be numerous.
'Amr b. Ma'dikarib stayed with his people the Banii Zubayd while Farwah b. Musayk al-Muradi624 was their chieftain. When the Messenger of God died, 'Amr apostatized and said:
We found Farwah's reign the worst of reigns, a donkey sniffing at dirt.625
If you had looked at Abu 'Umayr,
you would have seen him like a caul filled with filth
and treachery.
Farwah b. Musayk al-Muradi had come to the Messenger of God in this year [i.e.,1o / 63i) before the coming of'Amr b . Ma'dikarib, disassociating himself from the kings of Kindah 626
Ibn Humayd- Salamah- Ibn Isl}aq-'Abdallih b. Abi Bakr: Farwah b. Musayk al-Muradi came to the Messenger of God, withdrawing himself from the kings of Kindah627 out of hostility toward them. Shortly before [the advent of] Islam , there was a battle between Murad628 and Hamdan wherein the latter gave a sound thrashing to the former in an encounter called al-razm.629 The person who led Hamdan over Murad was al-Ajda' b. Malik, who put them to disgrace on that day. Concerning that [engagement], Farwah b. Musayk said:

Ifwearevictorious,we were victors of old,630 1173S] and if defeated, we were not defeated before.631
If we are killed,632 it is not (because of) cowardice, but (because of) our fate and the bait633 of others.
Likewise is the fate whose wheel turns now for and now against.
When it is with us we are delighted and rejoice in it, though its opulence has shielded us for years.
When the wheel of fate turns,
those who were envied are found ground to pieces,
And those who were envied with the turn of fate will find the turn of time deceptive.
If kings remained forever we would be immortal, and if the noble endured we would endure. But those leaders of my people are annihilated,

When Farwah b. Musayk headed for the Messenger of God, sepa- rating himself from the kings of Kindah , he said:
When I saw the kings of Kindah turning away,
like a man 's foot letting him down by his leg 's sinew,
I turned to my camel, leading the way to Muhammad, hoping for the virtues and good earth of Medina.
When he reached him, the Messenger of God asked him, "It has [17361 been reported to me, 0 Farwah, that you were upset at what happened to your people on the day of a]-razor." He replied, "0 Messenger of God, what befell my people on that day would upset
any person if it happened to his people." The Messenger of God answered that if it were so, Islam would bring only good to his people, and appointed him [as a leaderl over Murad, Zubayd, and

In this year, the deputation of 'Abd al-Qays637 arrived.
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Ibn Ishaq: Al-farad b. 'Amr b. Hanash b. al-Mu'alla, a brother of 'Abd al-Qays, who was a Christian, came to the Messenger of God with a deputation of 'Abd al- Qays 638
Ibn Humayd- Salamah- Ibn Ishaq- al-Hasan b. Dznar639-al- Hasan [al-Basri]: When al-farad reached the Messenger of God, he spoke to him, and the Messenger of God proposed Islam to him, invited him to embrace it, and made him desirous of Islam. He answered, "0 Muhammad, I followed a religion, and now if I leave it for yours will you guarantee my religion ?"640 The Mes- senger of God replied, "Yes, I guarantee that what God has guided you to is better than that [i.e., which you practice]." So he and his companions embraced Islam. Then they asked the Messenger of God for mounts, and when he replied that he had none they said,
"0 Messenger of God, between us [i.e., Medina] and our country there are some stray beasts that strayed from their owners. Can we ride them to our country?" He replied, "No, beware of them. Indeed, it [leads to] hell-fire."

of apostasy (al-riddah ).641 When some of his people who had em- braced Islam went back to their earlier religion with al-Ghar ir642 al-Mundhir b. al-Nu 'man b . al-Mundhir, al-jarud stood up, con- fessed his Islam and invited them back to it saying , " 0 people, I testify that there is no god but God, and Muhammad is His ser- vant and His Messenger. I am done with him who does not pronounce the shahadah."
The Messenger of God had sent al-'Ala' b . al-Ha4irami to al- Mundhir b. Sawa al-'Abdi before the conquest of Mecca,6" and he embraced Islam and became a good Muslim. Al-Mundhir died after the Messenger of God but before the apostasy of the people of al-Bahrayn,645 while al-'Ala', who was the Messenger of God's amir (deputy) over al-Bahrayn, was with him.
In this year, the deputation of the Banu Hanzfah6" came.
Ibn Humayd- Salamah- Ibn Ishaq: The deputation of the Banu Hanzfah came to the Messenger of God and among them was Musaylimah b. Habib,647 the arch liar. They stayed with the daughter of al-Harith,64$ a woman of the An$ar from the Banu Najjar.649
641. It is generally translated as "the wars of apostasy," because in the tradi- tional sources it is reported as a religious movement directed against Islam. This view was first challenged by Wellhausen (Skizzen, VI, 7-37), and Caetani (Annali, II, 549- 831), who argued that it was essentially political in nature . The leaders of the riddah, often called "the false prophets," represented themselves as possess- ing prophetic aspirations; hence it was not wholly devoid of religious character. Cf. Watt, Muhammad at Medina, 147-48. Its character and extent are analyzed by Shoufani, al-Riddah, 71-106.
642. Hisch., Ibn Ishaq: Gharir b. al-Mundhir.
643. Hisch., Ibn Ishiq: I regard him an infidel.
644. According to Ibn Sa'd, Tabagat, I/2, 19, 27-28, 41, the Prophet sent aI-'Ali'
to al-Mundhir b. Sawa, who was Khusraw's governor over al-Babrayn after he had returned from al-Ji'rinah. See also Hamidullih, Majml 'ah, 112-15.
645. In pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, this name was applied to the main- land of Eastern Arabia, embracing the oases of al-Qalif and Hajar (al-Hasa). Later, it was restricted to the archipelago offshore . E12, s.v. al-Ba1 rays.
646. A large section of this ancient Arab tribe revolted against Medina under Musaylimah. E12, s.v. Hanifa. For the delegation, see Ibn Sa'd, Tabagat, I/2, 55- 56; Ibn al-Athir, Kdmil, II, 298.
647. Musaylimah, diminutive of Maslamah (which was his real name), was the theocratic lord of a sacred baram. According to one report, he had set up this sacred enclave in Yamimah before the Prophet's hi/rah. He thus controlled an extensive area of the eastern Arabia. Ell, s.v. Musailinia; Serjeant, "Early Arabic Prose," 127.

Ibn Humayd- Salamah- Ibn Isl}aq: I have received an account on the authority of some of our Medinese scholars: The Banu Hanzfah brought Musaylimah to the Messenger of God , veiling him with a garment, while the Messenger of God was seated among his companions, holding a palm branch with some leaves on its upper end. When he approached the Messenger of God while being veiled with garments, he spoke to him [and asked ]650[for a gift]. The Messenger of God replied, "If you had asked me for this palm branch which I hold, I would not have given it to you."
Ibn Humayd- Salamah- Ibn Isl}aq-a shaykh of the Banu Hanifah from the people of al-Yamamah :651 The story of Musay- limah differs from the one mentioned before . [This shaykh] al- leged that the deputation of the Banu Hanzfah came to the Mes- senger of God and left Musaylimah behind with their baggage. When they embraced Islam, they mentioned to the Prophet where he was, saying, "0 Messenger of God, we have left behind a companion of ours to guard our camels and baggage." The Mes- senger of God ordered for him the same as he had ordered for them, saying, "His position, guarding the property of his compan- ions, is not worse than yours." This is what the Messenger of God meant.
Then they left the Messenger of God and brought Musaylimah what the Prophet had given him.652 When they reached al- Yamamah, Musaylimah (the enemy of God) apostatized, posed as a prophet, and played the liar, saying, "I have been made a partner with him [i.e., Muhammad] in the affair." He then said to his deputation, "Did not the Messenger of God say to you when you mentioned me to him that my position is no worse than yours? What could it mean except that he knew I have been made his associate?"6 Then he began to speak in rhyming speech (saj')6" and in imitation of the Qur'an: "God has bestowed favors upon the pregnant woman; He has brought forth from her a living being

that moves from between the bowels and peritoneum .11655 He rid them of the burden of prayer,. and permitted them to drink wine and fornicate and so forth, [yetJ656 he acknowledged the Mes- senger of God as a prophet. The Bani Hanzfah agreed with him on that. God knows best what the truth was.
Abu Ja'far [al-Tabari]: In this year, the deputation of Kindah headed by al-Ash'ath b. Qays al-Kindi arrived.657
Ibn Humayd- Salamah- Ibn Is);iaq--Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri: Al- Ash'ath b. Qays came to the Messenger of God with sixty6 8 riders from Kindah, and went to him in his mosque. They had combed their locks and darkened their eyelids with kohl, and were wearing striped robes (of the Yemeni fabric) bordered with silk. When they entered, the Messenger of God asked, "Have you not embraced Islam ?" "Yes, indeed," they answered. "Why, then, is this silk hanging round your necks?" he asked. So they tore it off and threw it away. Then al-Ash'ath said, "0 Messenger of God, we are the sons of those who eat bitter herbs and so are you."659 He smiled and said, "Ascribe this ancestry to al-'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib and Rabi'ah b. al-Harith." Both were mer- chants. When they traveled in Arab lands and were asked who they were, they would reply that they were sons of those who ate bitter herbs, and were proud of that because Kindah were kings. Then the Messenger of God said, "We are the sons of al-Naclr b. Kinanah. We neither follow our mother's [line of descent] nor disown our father's." Al-Ash'ath b. Qays said, "Do you know, 0 men of Kindah, by God, if I hear a man saying [such a thing] after today, I will thrash him with the prescribed punishment of eighty strokes. "660

Khaybar,671 Rifa'ah b. Zayd al-Judhami672 al-I)ubaybi came to the Messenger of God, presented him a slave, and embraced Islam. He became a good Muslim, and the Messenger of God gave him a letter addressed to his people. In it was written: "In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. This is a letter from Muhammad, the Messenger of God, to Rifa'ah b. Zayd. I have sent him to his people in general and those who have joined them [in Islam] to invite others to God and His Messenger. Whoever re- sponds belongs to the party of God and His Messenger, and whoever turns away will have two months' truce."673 When Rifa'ah came to his people they responded and embraced Islam. Then they went to al-Harrah (the volcanic tract, lava field),674 the Harrah of al-Rajla',675 and camped there.

reached a valley called Shanar, 680 al-Hunayd b. 'U^681 and his son 'U* b. al-Hunayd al-I?ulay'i, a clan of Judham, attacked him and seized everything that he had. This news reached some people of the Bann I?ubayb, the kinsfolk of Rifa'ah who had embraced Is- lam. They responded and went after al-Hunayd and his son; al- Nu'min b. Abi Ji'al of the Bann I?ubayb was among them. When they encountered them, a skirmish followed. On that day, Qurrah b. Ashqar al-I?ifari, who traced his ancestry from the clan of al- Qulay', said, "I am the son of Lubna." He shot al-Nu'man b. Abi ji al with an arrow, hitting him in his knee, saying, "Take it, I am the son of Lubna." He had a mother who was called Lubni. Hassan b. Mallah al-Qubaybi had been a friend of Dihyah b. Khalifah al-Kalbi before that [incident] and had taught him the Umm al-Kitab [i.e., the first chapter of the Qur'an]. They rescued what was in the hands of al-Hunayd and his son 'Ug and restored it to Dihyah. Then Dihyah left and came to the Messenger of God, informed him what had happened, and sought that he be allowed to kill al-Hunayd and his son.
The Messenger of God sent Zayd b. Hirithah with a force against them, which was what provoked the raid of Zayd on Ju- dhim. All of Ghatafin of judhim, Wi'il,682 those of Salamin, and Sa'd b. Hudhaym683 had set out when Rifi'ah b. Zayd came with the Messenger of God's letter and camped in al-Harrah (the vol- canic tract) of al-Rajli', while Rifa'ah b. Zayd was in Kuri' Rab- bah684 with some people of the Bann al-I?ubayb, not knowing [what had happened]. At the same time, the rest of the Bann al- I?ubayb were in a valley [of Madan]685 in the region of the vol- canic tract where it stretches to the east.

canic tract. They rounded up the cattle and men they found, and
killed al-Hunayd and his son and two men from the Banu al- Ahnaf6118 and one from the Banu Kha$ib.689 When the Banu al- Iaubayb and the army, who were in the flat plain of Madan,690
heard about [the raid], Hassan b. Mallah, Unayf b. Mallah, and
Abu Zayd b. 'Amr rode to them. Hassan rode on Suwayd b. Zayd's
horse called al-'Ajijah, and Unayf on Mallah's horse called Righal,
and Abu Zayd on his own horse called Shamir. They went on
until they approached the army, at which time Abu Zayd691 said
to Unayf b. Mallah, "Hold back from us and leave, for we are
afraid of your tongue." So he left and held himself back. The two
had hardly left him when his horse began to scrape the ground
and jump. He said [to the horse], "I am more withholding from
the two men than you are from the two horses," and he slackened
the reins until he overtook them. They said to him, "If you are
going to do what you have done, then spare us your tongue and
don't bring us bad luck today." They agreed among themselves
that only Hassan b. Mallah should speak. Now they had a word [1743] which they learned from one another in the pre-Islamic days. If someone wanted to strike with his sword he said "than."692
When they approached the army, the men came running to them and Hassan told them that they were Muslims . The first man to meet them was riding a deep black horse with his lance stretched out as if he had fixed it on the withers of his horse, and was saying, "Forward, overtake," while he advanced, leading the oth- ers. Unayf said "thuri," and Hassan told him to take it easy. When they stood before Zayd b. Harithah, Hassan said, "We are Muslims." Zayd replied, "Then recite the Umm al-Kitdb." When Hassan recited it, Zayd b. Hirithah said, "Proclaim to the army that God has forbidden us their land except from those who were unfaithful to their covenant."
Hassan b. Mallah's sister, the wife of Abu Wabr b. 'Adi b. Umayyah b. al-IDubayb, was among the prisoners. Zayd told him

to take her and she clung to his waist. Umm al-Fazr of al-I)ulay' said, "Are you going away with your daughters and leaving be- hind your mothers?" One of the Banu Kha$ib said, "She is from the Banu al-Qubayb and their tongues cast spells all day long." Someone from the army heard that and told Zayd b. Harithah about it, so he ordered that the hands of Hassan's sister be loosed from his waist and told her to sit with the daughters of her uncle until God decided about them. So, they [i.e., Hassan's party] went back and [Zayd] forbade the army to go down into the valley whence they had come. They [i.e., Hassan's party] passed the night with their people and milked the camels of Suwayd b. Zayd at nightfall. After they had drunk their night draught of milk, they rode off to Rifa'ah b. Zayd (among those who went were Abu

Mallah), until they came to Rifa'ah b. Zayd in the morning in Kura' Rabbah in the plain of the volcanic tract by a well there in Harrat Layla .695 Hassan b. Mallah said to him, "You sit milking goats while the women of Judham are dragged off as prisoners. The letter which you have brought with you has deceived them." Rifa'ah asked for his camel and began to saddle it while reciting:
"Are you alive or do you call the living?"
In the early morning, they and he, with Umayyah b. l)afarah, the brother of the slain Khasibi , left the plain of the volcanic tract and journeyed for three nights to the plains of Medina . When they entered the city and arrived at the mosque, a man looked at them and said, " Don't make your camels kneel-otherwise their legs will be cut off." So they dismounted while the camels were stand- ing. When they came to the Messenger of God , he saw them and waved them with his hand to advance [toward him] from behind the people. As Rifa'ah began to speak, a man [from the gathering] got up and said, "0 Prophet of God, these men are sorcerers," and repeated it twice. Rifa'ah replied, "May God forgive him who does not treat us well today." Then he handed over the letter to the

Messenger of God which he had written for him, saying, "It falls short of your [dignity], 0 Messenger of God; it was written long ago but its violation is very recent." The Messenger of God asked a young man to read it openly. When he had read it, he asked what had happened. After they had told him the news, he said, "What am I to do about the slain?" and repeated it three times. Rifa'ah replied, "You, 0 Messenger of God, know best. We do not make unlawful what you consider to be lawful and we do not make lawful what you consider to be unlawful." Abu Zayd b. 'Amr said, "Release, 0 Messenger of God, those who are alive and overlook those who are dead." He answered, "Abu Zayd spoke the truth. 0 'Ali, ride with them." 'Ali replied, "0 Messenger of God, Zayd will not obey me." He replied, "Take [this] sword of mine," and gave him his sword. Then 'Ali told him that he did not have a beast to ride. The Messenger of God mounted him on a camel called al-Mikl}al belonging to Tha'labah b. 'Amr, and they de- parted. Suddenly a messenger from Zayd b. Harithah appeared on a camel of Abu Wabr called al-Shamir. They dismounted from him and he asked 'Ali, "What have I done?" 'Ali replied, "It is their property, they recognized it and took it back." They con- tinued until they met the army at Fayfa' al-Falilatayn6% and took back the property which was in their possession, even to a wom-
an's saddle cloth from beneath a saddle.697

Am I to follow the footsteps of this youth from Quraysh?" Then he said to Arbad, "When we702 come to the man, I will divert his attention from you, and as I do that, cleave him with the sword." When they came to the Messenger of God, 'Amir b. al-Tufayl said, "0 Muhammad, can I [talk to you] privately?"703 He replied, "No, by God, [I will not talk to you] until you believe in God alone." ('Amin b. al-Tufayll repeated his request for privacy and went on talking to him, expecting that Arbad would act as he had told him, but Arbad did not return a word in reply. When 'Amir saw that Arbad did not respond, he again repeated his request and the Messenger of God gave him the same reply. When the Mes- senger of God refused, he said, "Then, by God, I will fill the land with red horses704 and men against you." When he turned away, the Messenger of God said, "O God, protect me from 'Amin b. al- Tufayl."705 On their return, 'Amir said to Arbad, "Woe to you, Arbad! What happened to that with which I had charged you? By God, there was no man on the face of the earth whom I feared more than you, but by God, I shall never fear you after today." "May you have no father, don't be hasty with me," Arbad replied,

703. Ibn Sa'd, Tabagvt, 1/2, 51-52, gives a different version. He states: 'Amin asked, "What would I get, 0 Muhammad, if I accept Islam?" "You have the same rights and obligations as the Muslims," the Prophet replied. He asked, "Would you invest me with authority after you?" "That is neither for you nor for your people," the Prophet answered. He asked, "Would you grant me [authority] over tent dwellers and [you] exercise (authority] over city dwellers ?" "No," the Prophet replied, "but I would appoint you as commander of the cavalry, because you are a warrior." He said, "Then, by God, I will fill ..." Cf. Ibn Shabbah, Ta'rikh, II,

The Events of the Year io 105
The Messenger sent what you see, as if
we were intending to raid the troops of horsemen.
Our horses became lean while bringing us to Medina,
and they killed the Angdr in their midst.
While they were on their way back to their country, God af- flicted 'Amin b. al-Tufayl's neck with a fatal disease [a tumor] and killed him while he was in the house of a woman from the Banu Salul.707 He began to say, "0 Banu 'Amir, a lump like the lump of a young camel, and death7O8 in the house of a woman from the Banu Salul!" When they buried him, his companions left for the country of the Banu 'Amin. When they arrived there, their people came to them and asked Arbad what had happened. He replied, "Nothing, by God. He [i.e., Mubammad] called on us to worship something. I wish he were near me now, and I would shoot him with this arrow of mine and kill him." A day or two after he had uttered those words, he went out with his camel to sell709 it, and God sent a thunderbolt which scorched him and his camel.710 Arbad b. Qays was brother of Labid b. Rabi'ah by the same mother.
The deputation of Tayyi' came to the Messenger of God and talked to him, and he proposed Islam to them. Their leader, Zayd
al-Khayl,711 was among them.712 They embraced Islam and be came good Muslims.

Ibn Humayd- Salamah- Ibn IsIaq- some men of Tayyi': The Messenger of God said, "Every Arab man that has been spoken of to me in the highest terms has fallen short of what was said about him after I met him except Zayd al-Khayl. Indeed, all that was

said about him does not render full justice [to all his attain-
ments]." Then [the Prophet] named him Zayd al-Khayr,713 granted him Fayd714 and some lands with it, and wrote a docu- ment for him to that effect. As he left, returning to his people, the Messenger of God said that he hoped Zayd would escape the fever of Medina. The Messenger of God called it something other than fever and other than umm mildam,715 but [the reporter] could not ascertain which. After Zayd had reached one of the watering places in Najd716 called Fardah,717 he was struck with the fever and died there. When he felt that his end was near he said:
Are my kinsfolk setting out eastward tomorrow,
while I am to be left in a house in Fardah of Najd? Oftentimes if I fell sick, women would visit me,
not worn out, but tired by the journey.
When he died, his wife took the documents granted to him by the Messenger of God and burnt them718 in the fire.
In this year, Musaylimah wrote to the Messenger of God alleg- ing that he was his associate in prophethood.
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Ibn Isltaq-'Abdallah b. Abi Bakr: Musaylimah b. Habib, the arch-liar wrote to the Messenger of God:719 "From Musaylimah the Messenger of God to Muham- mad the Messenger of God. Peace be upon you. Indeed, I have been made a partner with you in authority . To us belongs half of the land and to Quraysh the other half, but Quraysh are a trans- gressing people."720 This letter was brought to the Messenger of God by two couriers.

Malik al-Ashja'i722-Salamah b. Nu'aym b. Mas'Ud al-Ashja'i723 -his father Nu'aym:724 I heard the Messenger of God saying to the two couriers after they had read Musaylimah's letter, "What do you say about it?" They replied that their answer was what [Musaylimahj had said. 'By God," he replied, "were it not that messengers are not to be killed I would have beheaded you. "725 Then he wrote to Musaylimah:726 "In the name of God, the Com- passionate, the Merciful. From Muhammad, the Messenger of God, to Musaylimah the arch-liar. 'Peace be upon him who fol- lows [God's] guidance.'727 Now then: 'Surely the earth belongs to God, who bequeaths it to whom He will among His servants. The ultimate issue is to the God-fearing."1728 This was at the end of the year 10/632.

108 The Last Years of the Prophet
Muwayhibah,735 the Messenger of God's freedman: When the Prophet returned to Medina after performing the Pilgrimage of Completion for Perfection of Religion] (1lajjat al-tamam[,736 he began to have a complaint of illness . As travel was allowed [after the pilgrimage], the news of the Prophet's illness spread; so both al-Aswad737 and Musaylimah leapt at [the opportunity and claim- ed prophethood for themselves]-the former in the Yemen and the latter in al-Yamamah, and their news reached the Prophet. After the Prophet had recovered, Tulayhah738 leapt at [the oppor- tunity and claimed prophethood] in the land of the Banu Asad. Then in Muharram the Prophet complained of the pain from which he died.
Abu Ja'far (al-Tabaril: The Messenger of God dispersed his rep- resentatives to every land where Islam had entered to collect the alms (al-sadagat).
Ibn Humayd- Salamah- lbn Ishaq-'Abdallah b. Abi Bakr: The Messenger of God sent out his officials and representatives to every district wherein Islam had set foot to collect the alms. He sent al-Muhajir b. Abi Umayyah b. al-Mughirah to $an'a',739 and al-'Ansi rebelled against him while he was there. He sent Ziyad b. Labid, a brother of the Banu Bayatiah al-An^ari, to Hadramawt. He sent 'Adi b. Hatim to collect the alms from Tayyi' and Asad. He sent Malik b. Nuwayrah to the Bann Hanzalah. He divided [the task of collecting] the alms from the Bann Sa'd between two of their own men: [Zibrigan b. Badr and Qays b. 'A$im, each in charge of a district].740 He sent al-'Ala' b. al-Hacjrami to al- Bahrayn, and 'Ali b. Abi Talib to Najran to collect their alms and bring their poll tax to him.

736. It was during this pilgrimage that the verse "Today I have perfected your

The Events of the Year io ro9
When the month of Dhu al-Qa'dah started this year, that is, the year 110/632, the Prophet made preparations for the pilgrimage and ordered the people to get ready.
Ibn Humayd- Salamah- lbn Ishaq- ' Abd al-Rahman b. Qasim741-his father742-'A'ishah the Prophet 's wife:743 The Prophet departed for the pilgrimage on the twenty-fifth of Dhu al- Qa'dah.744 Neither he nor the people talked of anything but the pilgrimage, until when he was in Sarif745 and had driven with him the sacrificial animals as some nobles had also done, he ordered the people to remove their pilgrim garments, except for those who had brought the sacrificial animals [with themj.746 That day my menses started. He called on me while I was weep- ing and said, "What is the matter with you, O 'A'ishah?Are you in your menses ?" "Yes," I replied, " I wished I had not come with you on this journey this year." "Don't do that," he said, "Don't say that, for you can carry out [all the rites ) performed by a pil- grim except that you will not circumambulate the Ka 'bah." The Messenger of God entered Mecca and his wives and everyone who did not have a sacrificial animal with him took off the pilgrim

745. About six miles from Mecca. Harbi, Manasik, 465-66; Bakri, Mu'jam, III, 735-36.
746. Those without the sacrificial animals should be content with the 'umrah, because those who perform the pilgrimage must sacrifice an animal.
Before the pilgrim arrives in Mecca, he puts on the ibram. He is then mubrim, in a state of holiness . The rites on arrival at Mecca are the same for all , for the mail is in a way an 'umrah, which is a rite of visiting the Ka'bah and the Holy Places around it. The 'umrah consists of circumambulating the Ka'bah seven times (Ia- waf), praying two rak'ahs facing the Magam Ibrahim and the Ka'bah, and walking )fast) (sa'y) seven times between $afi and Marwah. What follows after it depends on the intention of the pilgrim made at the time of assuming the ibrdm. If he intended to perform either the bail alone (ifrdd), or the 'umrah and the bail together (giran), then in neither case does he relinquish the state of holiness after having performed the rites of arrival. If he wants to perform the 'umrab first and then to enjoy the freedom of a normal life (tamattu'), not resuming the state of holiness again until the last minute (i.e., on the eighth of Dhu al-Hijjah), .he deconsecrates himself by having a few locks of hair cut off. In this case, he will have to offer a sacrifice within the sacred territory within a specified period. See E12, s.v. Uadjdj; Fahd, Pantheon, 2o3ff ...

garment. On the day of sacrifice, beef747 was brought to me and put in my house. When I asked what it was, they said that the Messenger of God had sacrificed some cows on behalf of his wives. On the night of ljagbah,748 he sent me with my brother 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abi Bakr to perform the 'umrah from al- Tanim749 in place of the 'umrah which I had missed.750
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Ibn Ishaq-Ibn Abi Naji1x:751 The Messenger of God had sent 'Ali b. AM Talib to Najran and met him in Mecca while he was still in a state of ibram. [When he arrived,] 'Ali went into Fatimah,752 the Messenger of God's daughter, and found that she was not in her pilgrim garments and was prepared [to receive him]. He asked her, "What is the matter with you, 0 daughter of the Messenger of God?" She replied, "The Messenger of God ordered us to remove the pilgrim gar- ments, so we did." Then he went to the Messenger of God. After he had finished reporting about his journey , the Messenger of God told him to go and circumambulate the Ka'bah and remove the pilgrim garments as his companions had done. He replied, "0 Messenger of God, I have decided to sacrifice an animal as you did." He said, "Remove the pilgrim garments as your companions have done." 'Ali replied, "0 Messenger of God, when I put on the pilgrim garments I said, '0 God, I will invoke your name over a

(The Prophet] asked ['Ali] whether he had a sacrificial animal, and when he replied that he did not have one, the Messenger of God made him a partner in his sacrificial animal. 'Ali retained his pilgrim gar- ments with the Messenger of God until both of them had com- pleted the pilgrimage and the Messenger of God slaughtered the animals on behalf of them both.753
Ibn Humayd- Salamah-Ibn Ishaq-Yahya b. 'Abdallah b.'Abd al-Rabman b. Abi 'Amrah754-Yazid b. Talhah b. Yazid b. Rukanah: When 'Ali b. Abi Talib came from the Yemen to meet the Messenger of God in Mecca, he hurried to him and left one of his companions in charge of his army. That man dressed some of the men755 in the army with linen clothes that were entrusted to 'Ali b. Abi Talib. When the army approached (Mecca], he went out to receive them and found that they were dressed in the linen clothing. "Wtie to you," he said, "what is this?" "I dressed them so that they might look handsome when they came to the peo- ple," the man replied. 'Ali asked him to remove [the clothing] before he came to the Messenger of God. He did so and returned them to the booty, but the army expressed resentment at their treatment.

Then he addressed them in a speech and elucidated [certain
things]. After he had praised and glorified God, he said, "0 people,

'Abdallah b. al-Zubayr776-his father 'Abbad:777 The man who used to repeat the Messenger of God's words loudly to the people when he was on 'Arafah was Rabi'ah b. Umayyah b. Khalaf. The Messenger of God would say to him. "Say: 0 people, the Messenger of God says, do you know what month this is?" and they would say, "The sacred month." Then he would say, "Say to them: God has made your blood and your property sacro- sanct until you meet your Lord, like the sanctity of this month of yours." Then he said [to him], "Say: the Messenger of God says, 0 people, do you know what land this is?" Rabi 'ah would call out loudly and they would say, "The Holy Land." He would say, "Say: God has hallowed your blood and your property until you meet your Lord like the sanctity of this land of yours." Then he said, " Say: 0 people, do you know what day this is? " Rabi'ah repeated [this] to them and they said, "The day of the Greater Pilgrimage." He said, " Say: God has made your blood and your property sacrosanct until you meet your Lord like the sanctity of this day Of yours- 1778
Ibn Humayd- Salamah- Muhammad b. Ishaq- ' Abdallah b.

Abu Ja'far [al-Tabari]: The military expeditions (ghazawat)783 in which the Messenger of God personally participated were twenty-six. Some say that they were twenty-seven. Those who maintain the number as twenty-six count the Prophet's expedi- tion to Khaybar and the expedition from there to Wadi al -Qura784 as one, because after accomplishing the victory he did not return from Khaybar to his abode but marched from there to Wadi al- Qura.

782. Mas'nd-r, Tanbih, 240, states that it is so called because the Prophet an- nounced that time had completed its cycle and was as it had been on the day that God created the heavens and the earth . j Probably, he implies the cancellation of
intercalating a month.I
Ibn Sa'd states that the Muslims call this pilgrimage the bajjat al-islam. It was
probably so-called because the Sabah and other sacred precincts were now pu- rified of all pagan presence and heathen rites . It was made clear that all ntes were now dedicated to Allah and to His worship . The Prophet had taken every oppor- tunity to free the rites from their pagan associations . His performance of the rites during this pilgrimage became a sunnab to be followed by the faithful. Cf. Wiqidi, Maghdzi, III, 1o8g; Baladhuri, Ansdb, 1, 368, See Tabari, below,

He actually fought in nine of them : Badr, Ubud, al- Khandaq, Qurayzah, al-Muulaliq, Khaybar, the conquest of Mec- ca, Hunayn, and al-Ta'if.
Al-Harith807- Ibn Sa'd808-Muhammad b. `Umar-Mubam- mad b. Yabya b. Sahi b. Abi Hathmah-his father- his grand- father:809 The Messenger of God carried out twenty -six expedi- tions. Then he cited a report similar to that of In Humayd on the authority of Salamah [as cited above].
Muhammad b. 'Umar: The Messenger of God's expeditions are well-known and [their number is] agreed upon . No one disputes about their number, which is twenty-seven, but the authorities differ among themselves with regard to their sequence.
Al-Harith- Ibn Sa'd-Muhammad b. `Umar- Mu'adh b.
Bor. Khandaq means a ditch, a trench. It is applied to the "Expedition of the Khandaq," because the Muslims foiled a Meccan attempt to storm Medina by digging a trench at those parts of the city which were open to attack by cavalry. E12, s.v. Khandak.

M uham m ad al-A iI-i810-Muhammad b. Thabit al-Angari:811 Ibn 'Umar was asked how many expeditions the Messenger of God carried out and he said, "Twenty-seven campaigns." Then it was said to him, "In how many did you participate with him?" He replied, "Twenty-one; the first was al-Khandaq and I missed six. I was eager to take part and offered myself to the Prophet for all of them, but he turned me down and did not permit me [to take part] until al-Khandaq."
Al-Wagidi states that the Messenger of God fought in eleven [1758] expeditions. He mentioned nine of them, which I have reported on the authority of Ibn Ishaq, enumerating with them the expedi-
tion of Wadi al-Qura. He stated that he fought there with his slave Mid'am, who was shot by an arrow and killed. Al-Wagidi [also] states that he fought on the day of al-Ghabah and that some of the polytheists as well as Muhriz b. Nadlah were killed on that day.

When he was in al-Qargarah,835 about six miles from Khaybar, Yusayr b. Rizim regretted going to the Messenger of God. 'Abdallih b. Unays perceived his intention as he was getting ready to draw his sword, so he leapt at him and struck him with his sword, severing his leg. Yusayr hit him with a stick (with a crooked head) of shawliat"6 wood which was in his hand, aiming at his head. God killed Yusayr, and each one of the Messenger of God's companions fell upon their Jewish travel- ing companions and killed them , except for one person who es- caped on his mount.837 When 'Abdallih b.

Abu Rafi`. Between the battles of Badr and U1iud, the Messenger of God sent Mubammad b. Maslamah with his companions to Ka`b b. al-Ashraf, and they killed him. The Messenger of God sent `Abdallah b. Unays to Khalid b. Sufyan b. Nubayh al-Hudhali while he was in Nakhlah or `Uranahsas preparing to attack the Messenger of God and killed him.
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Muhammad b. IsIaq-Mu$ammad
b. Ja`far b. al-Zubayr839-`Abdallah b. Unays:840 The Messenger of
God called me and said, "It has reached me that Khalid b. Sufyan
b. Nubayb al-Hudhali is gathering a force to attack me. He is
either in Nakhlah or `Uranah, so go to him and kill him." I re-
plied, "0 Messenger of God, describe him to me so that I might
know him." He said, "When you see him he will remind you of
Satan. [A sure] sign between you and him is that when you see [1761] him you will feel a shudder." I went out, girding on my sword,
until I came to him while he was in howdah with the women,
seeking a halting place for them at the time for afternoon prayer.
When I saw him I found him to be as the Messenger of God had described. I advanced toward him, but fearing that there might be acrimony between me and him which would distract me from the
prayer, I prayed, making gestures with my head as I walked to-
ward him. When I got to him he asked who I was, and I replied,
"An Arab who has come to you because he has heard about you
and your gathering [a force] against this fellow [i.e., Muham-
mad]." He said, "Yes, I am doing that." I walked a short distance
with him and when it was feasible for me I struck him with my
sword and killed him. Then I departed, leaving his women to
throw themselves at him. When I came to the Messenger of God
and greeted him, he looked at me and asked, "Is the objective accomplished?" I replied, "I have killed him." "You have said the
truth," he replied. Then he stood up and went"' into his house
and gave me a stick, saying, "Keep this stick with you 0 `Abdal- lah b. Unays." When I went out with it the people asked me what that stick was. I told them that the Messenger of God had given it to me and asked me to keep it with me. They told me to go back

to him and ask him the reason for that. So I went back to him and said, "0 Messenger of God, why did you give me this stick?" He replied, "[As a] sign between me and you on the day of resurrec- tion. There will be a few men at that time who will carry sticks tied to their waists (al-mutakha$$in3n)." `Abdallah, therefore, fas- tened the stick to his sword, where it remained with him until his death, when he ordered that it should be fastened to his body with the shroud and buried with him.
(Now the report goes back to `Abdallah b. Abi Bakr who states:) The expedition of Zayd b. Harithah, Ja`far b. Abi 'J glib, and 'Abd- [1762] allah b. Rawahah to Mu'tah842 in the land of Syria;84a the expedi- tion of Ka`b b. `Umayr al-Ghifari to Dhat At1ah844 in the land of

Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Ibn lshaq - ` Agim b. 'Umar b. Qata- dah: `A'ishah said to the Messenger of God, "0 Messenger of God, I must free a slave of the sons of Isma i l." He replied, "These captives of the Band al-`Anbar are coming now. We will give you one, and you can set him free ." Ibn Ishaq states : When their captives were brought to the Messenger of God , a deputation of the Band Tamim rode with them until they arrived before the Messenger of God. Among them were Rabi`ah b. Rufay`, Sabrah b. `Amr, al-Qa`ga` b. Ma`bad, Wardan b. Muhriz, Qays b. `Agim, Ma- lik b. `Amr, al-Agra` b. Habis, Hanzalah b. Darim, and Firas b.

Al-Harith b. Muhammad-Ibn Sad-Muhammad b. 'Umar:
The armies and the raiding parties sent by the Messenger of God were forty-eight.
Al-Wagidi states: In this year, in [the month of] Ramadan, Jaru b. 'Abdallah al-Bajali came to the Messenger of God accepting Islam, so he sent him to Dhu a1-Khala4ah [an idol],850 which he demolished.
In this year, Wabar b. Yubannas came to the descendants of the Persian soldiers (al-abna') living in the Yemen, inviting them to Islam. He stayed with the daughters of al-Nu'man b. Buzurj [Buzurg], who embraced Islam. He sent word to Fayriiz al- Daylami, who embraced Islam, and [he also sent word] to Marka- bud and his son'Ata ', as well as to Wahb b. Munabbih.851 Wahb b. Munabbih and 'Ala' b. Markabud were the first to collect (jama'a) the Qur'an in $an'a'.
846. Ibn Isl}iq: Usimah said: When I and a man from the An$nr overtook him and attacked him with our weapons, he pronounced the shahadah, but we did not stay our hands and killed him. When we came to the Messenger of God we told him what had happened and he said, "Who will absolve you [from ignoring the shahadah?"

124TheLastYearsoftheProphet
In this year, Bazan embraced Islam and sent [a messenger] to the Prophet with his acceptance of Islam.
Abu Ja'far [al-Tabari] states: The above report [about the saraya] is at variance with what is reported by'Abdallah b. Abi Bakr [that the saraya were thirty-five] and those who stated that the Mes- senger of God's expeditions were twenty-six.
Abu Kurayb Muhammad b. al-'Ala'-Yahya b. Adam852- (1764] Zuhayre -Abu Ishaq-Zayd b. Arqam:854 I heard that the Mes- senger of God carried out nineteen expeditions, and that he made one pilgrimage after he emigrated [to Medina]. He did not make any pilgrimage other than the Farewell Pilgrimage. Ibn Ishaq mentioned a pilgrimage at the time of the conquest of Mecca.
Abu Ishaq states: I asked Zayd b. Arqam, "How many expeditions did you take part in with the Messenger of God?" He replied, "Seventeen."
Ibn al-Muthanna-Muhammad b. Ja'far-Shu'bah-Abu Ishaq: 'Abdallah b. Yazid al-An$ari went out with the people to pray for rain. He offered two rak'ahs and then prayed for rain. That day I met Zayd b. Arqam. There was only one person between me and him. I asked him, "How many expeditions did the Messenger of God undertake?" "Nineteen," he replied. I asked, "How many did you participate in with him?" "Seventeen," he replied. I asked, "What was the first expedition he carried out?" He said, "Dhat al-'Usayr, or al-'Ushayr." Al-Wagidi alleges that [the re- port] is erroneous.
Al-Harith-Ibn Sa'd-Muhammad b. 'Umar-Isra'-il-Abu Ishaq al-Hamdini: I asked Zayd b. Arqam, "How many expedi- tions did you participate in with the Messenger of God?" "Seven- teen expeditions," he replied. I asked, "How many expeditions did the Messenger of God carry out?" "Nineteen expeditions," he replied.
Al-Harith-Ibn Sa'd-al-Wagidi: When I narrated this report to 'Abdallah b. Ja'far, he said, "This is the chain of narrators for the people of Iraq, who state [the affair] thus. The first expedition in which Zayd b. (al)-Arqam took part was al-Muraysi', while he was still a young boy. He was present in the expedition of Mu'tah as a

That which al-Harith reported to me is also reported from Makhiil. [This report is received on the authority of] Ibn Sa'd-Ibn 'Umar-Suwayd b. 'Abd al-'Azzz-al-Nu'man b. al-Mundhir855- Makaul: The Messenger of God carried out eighteen expeditions, out of which he personally fought in eight. The first of them was Badr, then Mud, then al-Ahzab, and then Qurayzah.
Al-Wagidi states: Both of these reports, that of Zayd b. al- Arqam and of Makhul, are wrong.

126 The Last Years of the Prophet
Muhammad b. 'Ali b. al-Hasan b. Shariq: I heard my father saying: I have received an account on the authority of Abu Hamzah-Mufarrif865-Abu Ishaq-Mujahid: I heard Ibn'Umar saying that the Messenger of God performed three 'umrahs. When [this report] reached 'A'ishah, she said that Ibn 'Umar knew that he performed four, and that one of them was combined with the pilgrimage.
Ibn Humayd-Jarirs66-Mangur867-Muj ahid: Once 'Urwah b. [1766] al-Zubayr and I entered the mosque while Ibn 'Umar was sitting near 'A'ishah's room. We asked him, "How many'umrahs did the Prophet perform?" "Four," he replied, "One of them was in Ra- jab."868 We disliked contradicting and refuting him, but we heard the noise of 'A'ishah in the room cleaning her teeth with the siwak.869 'Urwah b. al-Zubayr said, "0 my mother, 0 Mother of
the Faithful, do you not hear what Abu 'Abd al-Rahman says?" "What does he say?" she asked. He replied, "He says that the Prophet performed four 'umrahs, and that one of them was in Rajab." She replied, "May God treat Abu 'Abd al-Rahman with mercy! The Prophet did not perform any 'umrah when he was not present, and he did not perform [any] 'umrah in Rajab."

He married Khadijah bt. Khuwaylid b. Asad b. 'Abd al-'Uzza in pre-Islamic days when he was twenty and some years old.872 She
was the first [woman] whom he married. Before that she was
married to 'Atiq873 b. 'Abid b. 'Abdallah b. 'Umar b. Makhzum.
Her mother was Fafimah bt. Zi'idah b. al-Mamm b. Rawihah b.

Jurwah b. Usayyid b. 'Amr b. Tamim, who was of the Banu 'Abd [1767) al-Dar b. Qu$ayy. From Abu Hilah she gave birth to Hind bt. Abi Hilah,875 after which he died. When the Messenger of God mar-
ried [Khadijah], she had Hind bt. Abi Hilah with her. She bore eight children with the Messenger of God: al-Qisim, al-Tayyib, al-Tihir, 'Abdallih, Zaynab, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum, and Filimah.876
871. Ibn Hishim (Shah, IV, 2931 He married thirteen women and left behind :
nine. Ibn al-Athir (Kamil, Q 307), reporting on the authority of Ibn al-Kalbi, gives the same account as that of Taban . See also Ibn Kathir, Sirah, IV, 580. Watt, Muhammad at Medina , 393-99, and Gaudefioy-Demombynes , Mahomet, 223- 33, give a comprehensive list. The latter tries to justify Mubammad's nine wives (at the same time) by the Qur'inic verse 4:3, by adding the numbers two, three, and four. The sequence of his marriages, as given by Ibn Isbag, Kitab al-Mubtada', 227-50, is as follows : First Khadijah, then Sawdah, then 'A'ishah, then Hafgah, then Zaynab bt. Khuzaymah, then Umm Habibah, then Umm Salamah, then Zaynab b. Jabsh, then Juwayriyyah, then $afiyyah, and then Maymnnah.
872. Mubammad 's age at the time of his marriage with Khadijah is generally given as twenty-five, but some sources state that he was twenty-one, or thirty. Her age, on the other hand, is generally given as forty; however, according to some reports she was either twenty-eight or two years older than Mubammad. She died in Ramadin, tenth year of the mission (or three years before the Emigration). Ibn Sa'd, Tabagat, VIII, 7-27; Ibn Kathir, Sirah, IV, 58i.

876. Ibn Hishim, Sirah, I, 202, names three male children as al-Qisim, al-Tahir, and al-Tayyib. Ibn Isbiq, Kitab al-Mubtada', 229, cites two reports: (i) it states that she gave birth to seven children, four female and three male, al-Qisim, al- T'ihir, and al-Tayyib; (ii) it states that she gave birth to six children, four female and two male, al-Qisim, and 'Abdallih.

Abu Ja'far [al-Tabari]: The Messenger of God did not marry another woman during the life of Khadijah until she passed away. When she died, the Messenger of God got married, but (opinions] differ as to whom he married first after Khadijah. Some say that it was 'A'ishah bt. Abi Bakr al-$iddiq, while others say that it was Sawdah bt. Zam'ah b. Qays b. 'Abd Shams b. 'Abd Wudd b. Nagr. As for 'A'ishah, when he married her she was very young and not yet ready for consummation,877 whereas Sawdah was already married before. Before the Prophet, her husband was al-Sakran b. 'Amr b. 'Abd Shams. Al-Sakran was one of the emigrants to Abyssinia (al-I,iabashah), who became a Christian and died there. The Messenger of God married her while he was in Mecca.878
Abu Ja'far [al-Tabari] states: All those knowledgeable about the Messenger of God's life agree that the Messenger of God consum- mated his marriage with Sawdah before [consummating his mar- riage with] 'A'ishah.
also called Tihir. Ibn Kathir, Shah, IV, 581- S;, also names three male children: al-Qisim, al-Tayyib, and al-Tihir. They died in their infancy: al-Qisim and Tdhir before the mission, while Tayyib after the mission. Some scholars state that Tihir and Tayyib are names of 'Abdallih. Zaynab, the eldest daughter, was married to her cousin Abu al-'A5 b. al-Rabi'ah before the mission. Her husband fought against the Muslims at Badr and was taken captive. She died in 8/629. 'Ali b. Abi Tilib married her daughter Amimah after the death of Fitimah.
Both Ruqayyah and Umm Kulthum were betrothed to Abu Lahab's sons before the mission, but were divorced after the revelation of snrah i i 1. Rugayyah was later married to 'Uthmin. After her death in Ramadan 2/624, Umm Kulthum was married toUthmin in Rabi' I, 3/624, and she died in Sha%in 9 / 631. Fiximah, born five years before the mission, was the youngest daughter and survived her father for a few months. For details, see In Sa'd, Tabaqdt, VIII, 7- 27; Baladhuri, Ansab, I, 396- 407; Tabari, DhuyUI, 493-94, 498-99; Gaudefroy-Demombynes, Ma- homet, 233-36; E12, s.v. Khadidja.

The Reason Why the Messenger of God Asked for the Hands of Both `A'ishah and Sawdah in Marriage and the Received Reports as to with Whom He First Contracted the Marriage
Said b. Yabya b. Said al-Umawi879-his father880-Mulammad
b. `Amr-Yabya b. 'Abd al-Ra] min b. Hitib881-`A'ishah: When [11768] Khadijah died, Khawlah bt. Hakim b. Umayyah b. al-Awga^, wife
of `Uthmin b. Ma:;'un, who was in Mecca, said [to the Messenger
of God], "0 Messenger of God, will you not marry?" He replied,
"Whom?" "A maiden," she said, "if you like, or a non-maiden." He replied, "Who is the maiden?" "The daughter of the dearest creature of God to you," she answered, "`A'ishah bt. Abi Bakr." He asked, "And who is the non-maiden?" "Sawdah bt. Zamah b. Qays," she replied, "she has [long] believed in you and has fol- lowed you." [So the Prophet] asked her to go and propose to them on his behalf.
She went to Abu Bakr's house, where she found Umm Rumen, mother of `A'ishah, and said, "0 Umm Rumen, what a good thing and a blessing has God brought to you !" She said, "What is that?" Khawlah replied, "The Messenger of God has sent me to ask for `A'ishah's hand in marriage on his behalf." She answered. "I ask that you wait for Abu Bakr, for he should be on his way." When Abu Bakr came, Khawlah repeated what she had said. He replied, "She is [like] his brother's daughter. Would she be appropriate for him?" When Khawlah returned to the Messenger of God and told him about it he said, "Go back to him and say that he is my brother in Islam and that I am his brother [in IslamJ, so his daughter is good for me." She came to Abu Bakr and told him what the Messenger of God had said. Then he asked her to wait until he returned.
Umm Rumen said that al-Mut'im b. 'Adi had asked `A'ishah's hand for his son, but Abu Bakr had not promised anything. Abu Bakr left and went to Mut'im while his wife , mother of the son for

whom he had asked 'A'ishah's hand, was with him. She said, "0 son of Abu Quhafah, perhaps we could marry our son to your daughter if you could make him leave his religion and bring him
[1769] in to the religion which you practice." He turned to her husband al-Mut'im and said, "What is she saying?" He replied, "She says [what you have just heard]." Abu Bakr left, [realizing that] God had [just] removed the problem he had in his mind. He said to Khawlah, "Call the Messenger of God." She called him and he came. Abu Bakr married ['A'ishah] to him when she was [only] six years old.
Then Khawlah left and went to Sawdah, saying, "0 Sawdah, what a good thing and a blessing has God brought to you!" She said, "What is that?" Khawlah replied, "The Messenger of God has sent me with a marriage proposal." Sawdah said, "I want you to go to my father and tell him about it." Khawlah states: He was a very old man and had stayed away from the pilgrimage. I went to him and greeted him with the pre-Islamic salutation and told him that Muhammad b. 'Abdallah b. 'Abd al-Muttalib had sent me to ask for Sawdah's hand in marriage. "A noble match," he replied, "What does your friend882 say?" "She likes it," Khawlah replied. He said, "Call her to me." She was called and he said, "0 Sawdah, [this woman] alleges that Muhammad b. 'Abdallah b. 'Abd al-Muttalib has sent her to propose marriage to you, which is a noble match. Do you wish that I marry you to him?" "Yes," she replied. Then he called for him. [The Prophet] came and he mar- ried her to him. Her brother 'Abd b. Zam'ah came from the pil- grimage and [when he found out about the marriage] began to pour dust over his head. After he had embraced Islam he said, "I was a fool who poured dust over his head the day the Messenger of God married Sawdah bt. Zam'ah."
'A'ishah states: We came to Medina and Abu Bakr took up quarters in al-Sunk among the Banu al-Harith b. al-Khazraj. The Messenger of God came to our house and men and women of the Ansar gathered around him. My mother came to me while I was being swung on a swing between two branches and got me down.
[1770] Jumaymah, my nurse, took over and wiped my face with some water and started leading me. When I was at the door, she stopped

so I could catch my breath. I was then brought [in] while the Messenger of God was sitting on a bed in our house . [My mother] made me sit on his lap and said, "These are your relatives. May God bless you with them and bless them with you!" Then the men and women got up and left. The Messenger of God consum- mated his marriage with me in my house when I was nine years old. Neither a camel nor a sheep was slaughtered on behalf of me. Only Sa'd b. 'Ubidah sent a bowl of food which he used to send to the Messenger of God.

She died three years or close to that before the Messenger of God's departure from Mecca, and he mar- ried 'A'ishah after Khadijah's death. The Messenger of God saw 'A'ishah twice-[first when] it was said to him that she was his wife (she was six years old at that time), and later [when] he consummated his marriage with her after coming to Medina when she was nine years old.
(The report goes back to Hisham b . Muhammad. See above, I, 1766.) Then the Messenger of God married 'A'ishah bt. Abi Bakr, whose name is 'Atiq b .

One day, when she returned from her father's house, she found the Messenger of God with Miriyah in her house and burst into hysterical behavior. The situation was further aggravated by 'A'ishah 's chattering tongue. According to Ibn Isbiq (Kitab al-Mubtada', 240( the Prophet had divorced her once but then took her back .

She bore with him 'Umar, Sal- amah, Zaynab, and Durrah.888 When Abu Salamah died, the Mes- senger of God said nine takbirahs [during the prayer over him]. When he was asked whether he was distracted or had forgotten [the proper number], he replied, "I was neither distracted nor had I forgotten. Even if I had said a thousand takbirahs [during the prayer] over Abu Salamah, he was worthy of it," and he prayed for the surviving members of his family. The Messenger of God mar- ried [Umm Salamah] in the- year 3/624,889 before the battle of al- Ahzib. Salamah, son of Abu Salamah, married the daughter of Hamzah b. 'Abd al-Muttalib.890

Ibn Sad, Tabagat, VIII, 60- 67, gives an interesting conversation be- tween her and the Prophet when the latter proposed marriage to her. According to some authorities, she died in Dhii al-Qa'dah 59/679 , while according to others she died after the massacre of Karbali'. Balidhuri, Ansdb, I, 429-3 2; Ibn al-Athir, Ramil, II, 308; Ibn Hajar, l$abah, VIII, 221-25.
887. He died because of injuries suffered at Uliud . Ibn Sa'd, Tabagat, III/1,170- 72.
888. Hisch., Ibn Hishim : Ruqayyah.
889. The date given by Ibn Sad and Balidhuri that the Prophet married her in Shawwil 4/626 seems to be more likely , because the battle of Mud took place in Shawwil 3 / 625 and Abu Salarnah died thereafter.
89o. On his conversion the uncle of the Prophet became one of the bravest champions of Islam. He was slain fighting heroically at Ubud. E12, s.v. Hamza b.

Then the Messenger of God married Juwayriyyah891 bt. al- Harith b. Abi I)irir b. Habib b. Malik b. Jadhimah, who is al-Muglaliq b. Sa'd b. 'Amr, in the year of al-Muraysi' [i.e., the expedition against the Banu Muglaligj (the year 5/626-27). Pre- viously, she was married to Malik b . $afwan Dhi al-Shafr b. Abi Sark b. Malik b. al-Mustaliq, but did not bear any children with him. She was chosen (gafiyyah)by the Messenger of God for him- self on the day of al-Muraysi' [from the captives and at which time], he freed her and married her.892 She asked the Messenger of God to release what was in his possession from her people, and he did so.
Then the Messenger of God married Umm Habibah893 bt. Abi Sufyan b. Harb. She was [previously] married to 'Ubaydallih b. Jabsh b. Ri'ab b. Ya'mur b. $abirah b. Murrah b. Kabir b. Ghanm b. Dndin b. Asad. Both she and her husband were among the emi- grants to Abyssinia . Her husband embraced Christianity and tried to make her follow him, but she refused and maintained her religion. He died as a Christian, so the Messenger of God sent [his marriage proposal] to the Negus. The Negus said to [her hus- band's] companions, "Who is more entitled [to take care] of her?" They said, "Khalid b. Said b. al 'Ag." The Negus said [to Khalid], "Marry her to your Prophet ." He did so and the Negus gave her four hundred dinars as dowry (mater). It is, however, said that the Messenger of God asked 'Uthmin b. 'Affin for her hand in mar- riage, and after he allowed [the Prophet] to marry her, the Mes- senger of God sent to the Negus for her . The latter gave her dowry
891. Ibn Sa'd: Her name was Barrah and the Prophet gave her a new name, Juwayriyyah.
892. Both Ibn Hishim and Wiqidi state that she had fallen to the lot of Thibit b. Qays b. al-Shammis al-Angiri. She was very beautiful, and she haggled with him to write a written contract with her that she should pay a certain sum as the price of herself, and on the payment thereof be free . Probably, he was unwilling to part with her, hence she went to the Messenger of God asking for his help in the matter. He said, " Would you like something better than that? " " What is that?" she asked. "I will pay the sum on your behalf and marry you," he replied. "Yes," she answered, and he married her.
Another version of the story states that her father came to the Messenger of God with the ransom and accepted Islam. The Messenger of God gave her back to her father, she accepted Islam, and he asked her father for her hand in marriage. She died in 5o/67o or 56/676. Ibn Hishim, Sirah, IV, 295- 96; Wigidl, Maghczi, I, 410-12; Ibn Sa'd, Tabsgat, Vm, 83-85 ; Balidhuri, Ansdb, 1, 441-42.

did not bear any children with him. [It was] about her that God
revealed: "When you said to him whom God had blessed and you
had favored, 'Keep your wife to yourself and fear God,' you con-
cealed within yourself that which God was about to reveal. You
feared other men, but it is more fitting that you should fear God.
When Zayd had accomplished the necessary [formality of divorce)
from her, We gave her in marriage to you, so that there should not
be any fault for the believers in respect to the wives of their
adopted sons, after they have performed the necessary formal-
ity [of divorce] from them. And God's command must be ful-
filled."896 God married her to him and sent Gabriel concerning
that matter. She used to boast to the other wives of the Prophet,
saying, "I am the most honored among you because of the One
who gave me in marriage and the one who was my intermediary
[i.e., Gabriel) (akramukunna waliyyan wa akramukunna Saari). ""897
Then the Messenger of God married $afiyyah bt. Huyayy b. Akhtab b. Sa'yah b. Tha'labah b. Ubayd b. Ka'b b . al-Khazraj b. Abi Habib b. al-Nadir. Previously, she was married to Sallam b. Mishkam b. al-Hakam b. Harithah b. al-Khazraj b. Ka'b b. al-

895. She was the Prophet's cousin and he married her in Dhn al-Qa'dah 5/627. She died in 20/641 , and it is said that she was the first one to die from among his wives. For details see Ibn Sa'd, Tabagat, II/ 1,114; VIII, 71- 82; Balidhuri, Ansdb, I,
Ibn Hajar, I$dbah, VII, 667-70; Lings, Muhammad, 433-37; 337.
134 The LastYearsoftheProphet
This marriage of the Prophet has been discussed widely. According to some, it served as a legal test case against the prevailing notion of
adoption. Andrae, Mohammed, 153-54; Rodinson, Mahomet, 238-41.
897. It refers to her marriage. She states that God was her waif, who gave her away in marriage, and that Gabriel was the intermediary (safir(. Baladhuri, Ansab,
I, 435.
Ibn Sad reports: One day Zaynab ]bragging about herself]said to the Prophet, "I
am not, 0 Messenger of God, like other wives of yours. All of them were married to you either by their fathers, brothers, or guardians except me. It was God who gave me in marriage to you." See also Ibn al-Atha, Kamil, II, 309; Gaudefroy- Demombynes, Mahomet, 226-27.

Khazraj. After his death she was married to Kininah b. al-Rabi' b. Abi al-Huqayq, who was killed by Muhammad b. Maslamah at the Prophet's order. He was struck on the neck until he died. When the Prophet scrutinized the captives on the day of Khaybar, he threw his cloak over $afiyyah. Thus she was his chosen one ($afiyyah (898 on the day of Khaybar.899 Then he proposed Islam to her and she accepted, so he freed her. That was in the year 6/627-

Then the Messenger of God married Maymunah bt. al-Harith b. Hazn b. Bujayr b. al-Huzam b. Ruwaybah b. 'Abdallih b. Hilal. Previously, she was married to 'Umayr90° b. 'Amr of the Banu 'Uqdah b. Ghiyarah b. 'Awf b. Qasi, who was [from] Thagzf. She did not bear any children with him, and she was the sister of Umm al-Facjl, wife of 'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib.

goo. Ibn Hishim : She was mamed to Abu Ruhm b . 'Abd al-'Uzza. Baladhuri (Ansdb, 1, 444): She was married to Abu Sabrah b. Abi Ruhm. Ibn Hishim further adds: It is said that it was she who gave herself to the Prophet because she received his marriage proposal while she was on her camel. She said, "The camel and what is on it belongs to God and His messenger ." So God revealed: "A believing woman who bestows herself upon the Prophet, provided the Prophet wants to marry her.- [W in 33:50). See also El', s.v. Maimuna.
It is said that the one who bestowed herself upon the Prophet was Zaynab bt. Jabsh, or Umm Sharik Ghaziyyah bt. Jabir. Others state that it was a woman from the Bann Simah b. Lu'ayy and that the Prophet postponed the matter.

Asmi' b. al-$alt al-Sulamiyyah, while others say that she is Sabi bt. Asma' b. al-$alt of the Banc, Haram of the Banc, Sulaym. They say that she died before the Messenger of God consum- mated his marriage with her. Some, ascribing her lineage, state that she is Sani bt. al-$alt b. Habib b. Hirithah b. Hilal b. Harim b. Sammal b. 'Awf al-Sulami.
The Messenger of God married al-Shanba' bt. 'Amr al- Ghifariyyah, whose tribe were also the allies of the Banc, Qurayza. Some [authorities] allege that she was a QuraZiyyah, and that her lineage is not known because the Banc, Qurayzah perished. It is also said that she was a Kininiyyah . She menstru- ated when she entered [the house of] the Messenger of God, and [the Prophet's son ] Ibrahim died before she took her ritual pu- rification bath. She said, "If he were a prophet, the person who is dearest to him would not have died," so the Messenger of God dismissed her by !giving her] divorce905
The Messenger of God married Ghaziyyah906 bt. Jabir of the Bann Abi Bakr b. Kilab. [The news of] her beauty and skill had reached the Messenger of God, so he sent Abc, Usayd al-Angari al- Sa'idi asking her hand in marriage. Being in a state of infidelity when she came to the Prophet, she said , " I was not consulted [about this marriage], and I seek refuge from you in the name of God." He replied, " One who seeks God's protection is inviola-

Ibn Hishim states : "[Among the women whom the Prophet married but did not consummate the marriage was) 'Amrah bt. Yazid al-Kilibiyyah . Being recently in a state of infidelity, when she came to the Messenger of God she sought refuge from him. The Prophet replied, '[One who seeks God's protection) is inviolable,' and returned her to her folk." He further adds : "Others state that the one who sought God's refuge was a woman of Kindah, a cousin of Asma' bt. al-Nu'min. It is said that when the Messenger of God summoned her, she said, 'We are a people to whom others come, we go to none.' The Messenger of God returned her to her people."

The Messenger of God married Asmi' bt. al-Nu'min b. al- Aswad b. SharaWl b. al-Dawn b. Hujr b. Mu'awiyah al-Kindi. When he went to her he found that she was suffering from leprosy, so he gave her a compensation [for divorce], provided her [with some provision], and returned her to her people. It is also said that it was al-Nu'min who sent her to the Messenger of God and that she defamed him908 When she went to him she also sought ref- uge from him, so he sent her to her father saying, "Is she not your daughter?" He replied that she was. The Prophet said to her, "Are you not his daughter?" She replied that she was. Al-Nu'min said,
"Take h e r , 0 Messenger of God, she is ... ," and he praised her excessively. He replied that she would never be useful. The Mes- senger of God did with her what he did with al-'Amiriyyah. It is not known whether it was because of her pronouncement or that of her father that the Messenger of God said that she would never be useful.

907. Ibn Sad, T'abagat, VIII, 110-12, gives quite a different account . It was she who gave herself to the Prophet and the Qur'inic verse 33:50 refers to her. Because the Prophet did not marry her, she did not marry anyone else . Cf. Balidhuri, Ansab, I, 422.
908. Ibn Sa'd, T'abagat, VIII, 102- 5, states that Nu'min came to the Prophet, accepted Islam and offered his daughter in marriage . It was in RabF 1, 9/630, but when the Prophet entered into her presence she sought God's refuge , so he di- vorced her. For a slightly different version, see Balidhuri , Ansab, 1, 456-57.
9o9. Ibn Sa'd (T'abagat, VIII, 92-94) and Balidhuri (Ansab, I, 453- 54) state that the Prophet freed her after she accepted Islam and married her in Mubarram 6/627 . She died soon after the Prophet 's return from the Farewell Pilgrimage. See also Ibn Hishim, Sirab, 111, 256.

Abu Ja'far [al-Tabari] states: Among the marriages not men- tioned by Hisham [b. Muhammad] in this report is the one related from the Messenger of God according to which he married Zaynab bt. Khuzaymah. She is the one called Umm al-Masakin (Mother of the Poor),912 [and was] from the Banu'Amir b. $a'$a'ah. She is Zaynab bt. Khuzaymah b. al-Harith b. 'Abdallah b. 'Amr b. 'Abd Manaf b. Hilal b. 'Amin b. $a'p'ah. Previously, she was mar- ried to al-Tufayl913 b. al-Harith b. al-Mullalib, brother of 'Ubaydah b. al-Harith. She died in Medina while she was married to the Messenger of God. It is said that no one from the Messenger
[11776] of God's wives died while he was alive except her, Khadijah, Sharaf bt. Khalifah ( sister of Dihyah b. Khalifah al-Kalbi),914 and al-'Aliyyah bt. 7abyan.915
Ibn 'Abdallah b. 'Abd al-Hakam916-Shu'ayb b. al-Layth917- 'Ugay1918-Ibn Shihab [al-Zuhri]: The Messenger of God married al-'Aliyyah,919 a woman of the Banu Abi Bakr b. Kilab.

Ibn Sa d (Tabaqat, VIII, 82): She was married to Tufayl, and after he divorced her she married 'Ubaydah b. al-Harith. The Prophet married her in Ramadin 3/625, and she died eight months later. Cf. Ibn Isbaq, Kitab al- Mubtada', 241; Balidhuri, Ansab, I, 429.
914. Ibn Sa'd, Tabaqat, VIII, 115, lists her among those to whom the Prophet proposed but did not marry. Baladhuri, Ansab, 1, 460, states that she died before the marriage was consummated . Ibn Kathir, Sirah, IV, 587, states that she was the maternal aunt of Khawlah bt. Hudhayl and that she died on her way to Medina.

apostatized from Islam with her brother. He [also] married Fapimah bt. Shurayh.921 It is reported from Ibn al-Kalbi that the Messenger of God married Ghaziyyah bt. Jabir , who is [called] Umm Sharik. She was previously married and had a son called Sharik from [the first husband], so she was called by that surname [of relationship]. When the Prophet went to her he found her to be an old woman, so he divorced her.922 She embraced Islam and used to call on the Qurashi women and invite them to Islam. It is said that he married Khawlah bt. al-Hudhayl b. Hubayrah b. Qabi- ph b. al-Harith.923

He replied, "I accept." She went back to her people925 and said that the Messenger of God had married her. They said, " What a bad thing you have done! You are a self-respecting woman, but the Prophet is a wom- anizer.926 Seek an annulment from him." She went back to the Prophet and asked him to revoke the marriage and he complied with [her request].927 [It is reported] without the above chain of authorities that the Prophet married 'Amrah bt.

He re- plied, "I told him [to wait] until I sought your permission." She said, "Has permission to be sought for the Prophet? Go back and marry him [to me]." He went back but the Prophet did not say anything because he was informed that she was too old.931 Re- portedly, it is said that he proposed to $afiyyah bt. Bashshamah, sister of the one-eyed al-'Anbari. She was taken as a captive, so he allowed her to choose between him and her husband. She chose her husband and he sent her back .932 He proposed to Umm Habib933 bt. al-'Abbas b. 'Abd al-Muttalib, but discovered that al-'Abbas was his foster-brother; Thuwaybah had nursed them both. He asked for the hand of Jamrah bt . al-Harith b. Alai Harithah934 in marriage, [but] her father- so it is reported-said

Every time he was asked whose freedman he was he continued to give the same answer until he had been flogged five hundred times . Then he was asked, "Whose freedman are you?" and replied, "Your master's." When 'Abd al-Malik948 killed 'Amr b. Said, al-Bahi b. Abi Rafi' said:

Mihran.969 He narrated traditions from the Messenger of God.
The Messenger of God also had a eunuch called Mabur,970 who
was presented to him by al-Muqawqis with two slave girls; one of
them was called Mariyah, whom he took as a concubine, and the
other [was called] Sirin,971 whom he gave to Hassan b. Thabit
after $afwan b. al-Mu'attal had committed an offense against
him 972 Shin gave birth to a son called 'Abd al-Raliman b. Hassan. Al-Muqawqis had sent this eunuch with the two slave girls in
order to escort them and guard them on the way [to Medina]. He presented them to the Messenger of God when they arrived. It is
said that he was the one [with whom] Mariyah was accused of [117821 [wrongdoing], and that the Messenger of God sent 'Ali to kill him.
When he saw 'Ali and what he intended to do with him, he un-
covered himself until it became evident to 'All that he was com-
pletely castrated, not having anything left at all of what men [normally] have, so ['Ali] refrained from killing him.
While the Messenger of God was laying siege to al-'Wa'if, four slaves came out to him, whom he set free. Abu Bakrah973 was among them.974

972. $afwan, who was the accused party in the scandal against 'A'ishah, as-
saulted Hassan because of the latter's part in spreading the rumors. Whether $afwin did it out of a sense of personal injury or on the Prophet's orders to stop the gossipers is not dear, but it seems certain that $afwin went unpunished for this assault. The Prophet's gift to Hassin seems to be an act of reconciliation. See Arafat, " Controversial incident."

152 The Last Years of the Prophet
hammadl°21-his father'°22-Nabhin,1023 freedman of Umm Salamah: I heard Umm Salamah saying that the diet, or the great- er part of the diet, of the Messenger of God's family consisted of milk. The Messenger of God had milch camels in the thicket which he allotted to his wives. Among them was a milch camel called al-'Aris. From it [Umm Salamah] used to get whatever amount of milk she desired. 'A'ishah had a milch camel called al- Samra' which used to yield abundant milk, unlike that of Umm Salamah. The herdsman later brought the milch camels to a near- er pasture in the district of al-Jawwiniyyah,102a after which they were brought to the women's houses in the evening and were given to them to be milked. [The Messenger of God's]1°25 milch camel was more abundant in milk than the two milch camels [of
A'ishah and Umm Salamah], being almost equal to them or more. Al-Hirith-Ibn Sad-Muhammad b.'Umar-'Abd al-Salim b. Jubayr-his father: The Messenger of God had [seven]1°26 milch
camels which were kept at Dhu al-jadr1027 and al- jammi'1°28 and their milk was brought to him. [One of the] milch camels was called Muhrah. 1029 It was given [to him] by Sa'd b. 'Ubidah from the herd of the Banu 'Ugayl'°3O and was abundant in milk. Al-Rayyd1031 and al-Shagra' were bought from the Banu 'Amir in the Nabatean (al-Nabl)1°32 market. Al-Burdah, al- Samra', al-'Axis, al-Yasirah, and al-Hanna' were " milked every night and their milk was brought to him. The Prophet's slave named Yasir [who looked after those camels] was killed [during the Bedouins' raid]. 1033

Ibn al-Muthanni- Mu'idh b. Mu adh1105-Hartz b. 'Uth- minl 1°6-Abu Musa- Mu adh: I have never seen a person from the inhabitants of Syria to whom I could give preference over [the Prophet]. We went to 'Abdallih b. Busr, and I said to him while I was with my companions, "Did you see the Messenger of God? Was he an old man?" He put his hand on the part between his chin and the edge of his lower lip and said, "There was a white hair [among a few hairs ] between his lower lip and his chin."

Report about the Beginning of the Messenger of God's Illness in Which He Died, and What He Did just Prior to It When He was Bewailed [for His Approaching Death]
Abu Ja'far [al-Tabari]: God states: "When comes the help of God,
and victory, and you see men entering God's religion in multi-
tudes, then glorify your Lord and seek His forgiveness. Verily He
is forgiving ." 1127We have mentioned before what the Messenger
of God's instructions were to his companions during his pil-
grimage called "The Farewell Pilgrimage (l7ajjat al-wads`)," "The
Pilgrimage of Completion for Perfection of Religion] (hajjat al-
tamam)," and "The Pilgrimage for Conveying the Message (haj- 1128

Then the Messenger of God re- turned from his journey, after he had performed the pilgrimage, to his residence in Medina toward the end of Dhn al-Ilijjah and stayed there during the remainder of that month as well as during Muharram and $afar.

Abu Ja'far [al-Tabari]: I have received an account on the authority of Ibn Ilumayd- Salamah-Muhammad b. Ishaq- ' Abd al- Rahman b. al-Harith b. 'Ayyash b. Abi Rabi'ah:129 In the year 11/632, during the month of Muharram,"3° the Messenger of God ordered the people to undertake an expedition to Syria. He put Usamah, the son of his freed slave Zayd b . al-Harithah, in command over them, ordering him to lead the cavalry into the territory of al-Balga'1131 and al-Darum132 in the land of Pal- estine. The people got ready and the first emigrants 1133 went forth all together with him . As the people were preparing for the expedition, the Prophet began to suffer from the sickness by which God took him to what honor and compassion He intended

He ordered them to undertake an expedi- tion, put Usamah b. Zayd in charge of it, ordering him to go from Abil al-Zayt,1139 the land of the Arabs that is near masharif al-Sham, 1140 to the territory in Jordan (al-Urdunn).1141 The hypo- crites criticized [the leadership of Usamah], so the Prophet re- futed them, [stating] that indeed he was worthy of [the com- mand]. If they criticized [Usamah's leadership], then indeed they had criticized his father before, although Zayd was qualified to command.' 142 The news that the Prophet was suffering from sickness spread in the land as travel became permissible. Both al- Aswad and Musaylimah seized upon [the opportunity to claim the prophethood for themselves] in the Yemen and al-Yamamah, respectively, and their news had reached the Prophet. After he had recovered [from his illness], Tulayi ah seized upon [the oppor- tunity to claim the prophethood for himself] in the country of Asad. In Mubarram the Prophet complained of the pain by which God took him.

Ka'b (that is, al-Aswad) among the commonalty of Madhlpij after the Farewell (Pilgrimage]. Al- Aswad was a soothsayer and a juggler. He used to show them wondrous things captivating the hearts of those who listened to his speech. The first time he [claimed the prophethood] was [after] his coming out of the Khubban cave. It was his residence [because] he was born and brought up there. Madhl} ij corre- sponded with him, promising him Najran. They attacked [Najran] and expelled `Amr b. Hazm and Khalid b. Said b. al-'Ag [the Proph- et's agents), giving al-Aswad the position occupied by the latter two. Qays b. 'Abd Yaghuth attacked Farwah b. Musayk, [the Prophet's agent] over Murad, and expelled him placing al-Aswad
in his stead. 'Abhalah [al-Aswad] did not stop at [the subjugation of] Najran but marched to $an`a' and occupied it. The news of his rising and occupation of $an`a' was conveyed to the Prophet. It was the first news about him that the Prophet received from Farwah b. Musayk. Those people of Madhhij who remained faithful to Islam joined Farwah, and they [gathered] at al-Ahsiyah. Al-Aswad neither corresponded with Farwah nor sent [any mes- senger] to him, because there was no one with the latter who would have caused trouble for him . His hold over the Yemen was [thus] complete.

dered the expedition of Usamah, but it did not go well because of his illness and because both Musaylimah and al-Aswad had re- nounced [his authority]. The hypocrites did much [to criticize] Usamah's leadership. When [the criticism] reached the Prophet, he went out to the people while his head was wrapped around because of the pain, which had increased due to the dream he had seen [while he was] in 'A'ishah's house, saying, "Last night I saw what a sleeping person sees, that in my two upper arms there were two golden armbands. I disliked them so I blew on them, and they flew away [in the air]. I interpreted the armbands to mean these two arch liars,' 148 the possessor of al-Yamamah and' 149 the possessor of the Yemen . It has reached me that some people speak [ill of] Usamah's leadership. By my life, if they crit- icize his leadership, then they have criticized the leadership of his father before. If his father was worthy of command, then he is [equally] worthy of it. Dispatch the expedition of Usamah! 115° May God curse those who make the tombs of their prophets as places of worship (masajid]!" Usamah went out [with his army], camped at al-turf, and the people began to gather in the army. Tulayhah rose [in rebellion], so the people acted slowly and delib-
erately. The Messenger of God's [disease] became violent, so the expedition was not accomplished. The people were looking at each other until God took His Prophet's soul.
Al-Sari b. Yahya wrote to me [i.e., al-Tabarij stating that he has received an account on the authority of Shu 'ayb b. Ibrahim al- Tamimi-Sayf b. 'Umar-Said b. 'Ubayd, Abu Ya'qub-Abu Ma- jid al-Asadi-al-Ha4rami b. 'Amir al-Asadi: [When] Abu Majid asked Ha4lrami concerning Tulayhah b. Khuwaylid's affair, the latter replied: [After] we received the news of the Prophet's ill- ness, it reached us that Musaylimah and al-Aswad had gained ascendency over al-Yamamah and the Yemen, respectively. Soon thereafter, Tulayhah claimed the prophethood while [Usamah's] army was [still] at Samoa'. The commonalty [of Asad] followed Tulayhah and his hold became consolidated. He sent his brother's son Hibal to the Prophet, inviting him to make peace with him

and informing him about his news . Hibal said that the one who visits Tulayhah is Dhu al-Nun, and he named [that spirit] an angel.' 1-51 Then Hibal, [introducing himself], said that he was the son of Khuwaylid. The Prophet replied, "May God kill you and deprive you of the shahddah!"
'Ubaydallah b. Said (al-Zuhril- his uncle Ya'qub-Sayf [b. 'UmarJ-Sa'id b. 'Ubayd- Hurayth b. al-Mu'alla: The first person who wrote to the Prophet about the news of Tulayhah was Sinan b. Abi Sinn. He was [the Prophet's agent] over the Banu Malik while Qucla i b. 'Amr was [the Prophet's agent] over the Band al- Harith.
'Ubaydallah b. Said [al-Zuhril-his uncle [Ya'qubj-Sayf [b. 'Umarl- Hisham b. Urwah- his father: The Messenger of God waged war against the false prophets by sending messengers. He sent a messenger to some of the descendants of the Persian sol- diers in the Yemen (al-abnd') instructing them [to get rid of] al-
Aswad by artful contrivance . He [further] instructed them to seek help of some people whom he named from the Banu Tamim and Qays, sending [word] to the latter to help the former . They did [as instructed]. The means of [escape]for those who apostatized were cut off, and they were attacked [while they were] in a state of waning. Since they were isolated, they were occupied with them- selves. Al-Aswad was killed while the Messenger of God was [still] alive, a day or a night before the latter's death. Tulayhah, Musaylimah and the likeness of them were driven away by the messengers.
Despite his illness, the Messenger of God was not distracted from the command of God and the defense of His religion. ""52 He sent Wabar b. Yuhannas to Fayruz, Jushaysh al-Daylami, and Dadhawayhi al-Islakhri; Jarir b. 'Abdallah to Dhu al-Rata' [Sumayfi'11153and 1Hawshabl1154 Dhu Zulaym; al-Agra' b. 'Abdal-

Then he said, "It would not distress you if you were to die before me so that I would take care of your bodyj , wrap you in the shroud, pray over you, and bury you." I replied, "By God, it seems to me that if you were to do that you would return to my house and would make a marriage feast with one of your wives."1166 The Messenger of God smiled, [then] his pain came to him, all of it, as he was going the round of his wives until he was over- whelmed by it while he was in Maymunah 's house. 1167 He called his wives, asking their permission to be nursed in my house. They permitted him, so the Messenger of God went out [walk- ing] 1168 between two men of his family, al-Fatll b. al-'Abbas, and another man with his feet dragging on the ground, while his head was wrapped around until he entered my house.

Then he got down [from the pulpit),, prayed the ;uhr (midday)
prayers, returned and sat on the pulpit repeating what he had said
earlier. A man stood up saying, "0 Messenger of God , you owe
me three dirhams." He said, "0 Fatll, give him [three dirhams],"
and I did. Then he sat and said, "0 people , he who has a pledge let
him return it and not profess the disgrace of this world, because
the disgrace of the present world is easier [to bear] than the dis-
grace of the world to come." A man stood up saying, "0 Mes-

"I was in need of it," the man replied. He said, " 0 Fall, take
[three dirhams] from him." Then he said, "0 people, he who is
afraid of himself for something, let him stand up so that I will
pray for him." A man stood up saying, "0 Messenger of God, I am
a liar, a late riser, and [one who acts] impudently ." The Messenger
of God said, "0 God, bless him with truthfulness and faith and
remove lethargy from him, if he is determined!" Another man [1803] stood up saying, "By God, 0 Messenger of God, I am a liar, a hypocrite, and there is no act which I did not commit." `Umar b. al-Khattab stood up and said that the man had disgraced himself.
The Prophet said, " 0 son of al-Khattab, the disgrace of this world is easier [to bear] than the disgrace of the world to come. 0 God, bless that man with truthfulness and faith, and make his affairs good!" 'Umar thereupon asked the Prophet to speak to that man. 1181 The Messenger of God smiled and said, "`Umar is with me and I am with him."

He went out, prayed with the people, addressed them and sought God's forgiveness for the martyrs of Uhud. Then he urged them to take care of the An4dr, saying, "Now then: 0 community of the Emigrants, you will go on increasing, but the An$dr will not grow [greater in size] than what they are today. They are my intimates with whom I sought shelter, so honor their nobles and overlook those (of them) who do ill.111227 He [added], saying, "One of God's servants has been given the choice between this world and that which is with God, and he has chosen the latter." No one except Abu Bakr perceived that the Prophet meant himself, so he cried. The Prophet said to him, "Gently, 0 Abu Bakr!"

Al-'Abbas said, "Let me force him," and [the Messenger of God] was forced. 1231 After the Messenger of God recovered he asked who had done that with him. They said that it was his uncle al-'Abbas. Pointing in the direction of Abyssinia, the Prophet said, "This is a medicine brought by women from that country." When he asked why they had done it, al-'Abbas replied, "0 Messenger of God, we were afraid that you might have pleurisy (dhat al-janb)."1232 He re- plied, "That is a disease with which God would not afflict me. Let no one remain in the house until he is forced to take this medi- cine except my uncle."

We did so, and, after he had recovered, he inquired who had done that to him. When they replied that [it was] Asma' bt.

severe, I and the people came down [from where we were en- camped] to Medina and went12a7 to the Messenger of God. As he was tongue-tied, he began, to lift his hand toward heaven and put it down upon me, so I understood that he was praying for me.
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Ibn Ishaq-al-Zuhri-'Ubaydallah b., 'Abdallah-'A'ishah: Very often I used to hear the Messenger of God say, "God never takes a prophet's life without giving him the choice."1238
Abu Kurayb-Yunus b. Bukayr1239-Yunus b. 'Amr1240-his father [Abu Ishaq 'Amr al-Sabii)-al-Arqam b. Shurahbil:1241 I asked Ibn 'Abbas, "Did the Messenger of God make a will?"
"No," he replied. I asked, "How was that?" He replied: The Mes-
senger of God asked for 'Ali, but 'A'ishah said, "[I wish] you had [ r 8 i 1 ] asked for Abu Bakr!" Hafaah said, "[I wish] you had asked for
'Umar!" So all of them gathered before the Messenger of God. He
asked them to disperse, for he would call them if there should be
any need, and they went away. [At another time] the Messenger of
God asked whether the time for prayer had drawn close. They
said, Yes. When he ordered that Abu Bakr should lead the people
in prayer 'A'ishah said, "He is a delicate man, so order'Umar." He
did that,1242 but 'Umar replied, "I will not lead while Abu Bakr is
present." So Abu Bakr led [them in prayer]. The Messenger of God
got some relief [from the pain], so he went out [to the mosque].
When Abu Bakr heard his movement, he stepped backward, so
the Messenger of God pulled at his clothes asking him to stand in
his place. He sat down [near Abu Bakr] and recited from where
Abu Bakr had left off.

18o The Last Years of the Prophet
Ibn Wake'-his father'243-al-A'mash'244-Abu Hisham al- Rifa t-Abu Mu awiyah and Wake'-al-A'mash; and 'Isa b. 'Uthmin b. 'Isa1245-al-A'mash-Ibrahim-al-Aswad-'A'ishah: During the Messenger of God' s illness during which he died, a call for prayer was given. He ordered that Abu Bakr should lead the people in prayer. I said, "Abu Bakr is a tender-hearted man. When he will stand in your place, he might not be able to bear [the idea of taking your place],"12 He repeated his order nevertheless. When I repeated my objection,1247 he became angry and said, "You are like Joseph's women companions (gawdtlib)." Ibn Wake' states:
"[You are like] Joseph's women companions (4awabibnt); order Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer." Then, he came out while he was being supported between two men,12 and his feet were dragging on the ground. Abu Bakr stepped backward when the Prophet approached him. The Messenger of God motioned him to
(18121 stand in his place, while he sat down and prayed sitting at the side of Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr followed the Prophet in his prayer, and the people followed Abu Bakr in their prayers. [Al-Tabaril: The [exact] words in [the above account] are that of `Isa b. 'Uthmin.

1246. In another version, 'A'ishah said: Abu Bakr is a tender-hearted man who
weeps a lot when he recites the Qur'in, so order 'Umar to lead the people in prayer! Ibn Sa d, Tabagat, II/a, 18. In a different version reported by Balidhuri, Ansab, I, 554, it was Abii Bakr himself who suggested that let 'Umar lead the prayer. See also Lings, Muhammad, 339.
•1247. Another version states: The reason for my objection was that the people might not like a person taking the Prophet's place. I felt that nobody would take his place without being regarded by the people as a portent of evil. Ibn Sa'd, T'abagat, II/2, 18, 20.
1248. According to ibid., II/a,19- 20, they were either 'Abbis and 'All or al-Fa4l b. 'Abbis and Thawbin. All the reports that Abu Bakr was asked by the Prophet during his last illness to lead the prayer are tendentious and inconsistent. They are used by the Sunnis to argue the succession in favor of Abu Bakr (see n. 1290 below). For the Shi i refutation we al-Qi41 al-Nu'min, al-Urjnzab, 73-76, 267-68. Although the phrase "Joseph's women companions" is in the plural, it is meant to be in the singular, that is, for 'A'ishah. She is compared to the Egyptian official's wife who tried to seduce Joseph. See Mirzi, al-Balogh, I, 235-54, where older sources are given.

were almost distracted from their prayers with joy when they saw the Messenger of God. He motioned [to them] 126a with his hand1265 to continue their prayers, and smiled with joy when he saw their appearance in their prayers . I had never seen the Mes- senger of God in better shape before. Then he returned, and the people departed thinking that the Messenger of God had re- covered from his illness. Abu Bakr [also] went back to his family in al-Sunk.
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Ibn Isbaq-Abu Bakr b. 'Abdallih1266 b. Abi Mulaykah: On Monday, the Messenger of God came out to morning prayer with his head wrapped around while Abu Bakr was leading the people in prayer. When the Messenger of God came out, the people were delighted in looking at him . Abu Bakr knew that the people would not [be distracted from prayer] except for the Messenger of God, so he withdrew from his place. The Messenger of God pushed him in the back telling him to lead the prayer. He sat on the right side of Abu Bakr and prayed while seated. After he had completed the prayer, he turned to the people and spoke to them, raising his voice until it could be heard from outside, saying, "0 people, the fire has been kindled, and dissen- sion (fitan) has set in like segments of a dark night . By God, you cannot lay anything to my charge . I did not make anything lawful for you except what was made lawful by the Qur 'an. I did not make anything unlawful for you except what was forbidden by the Qur'an." After he had finished his speech, Abu Bakr said to
118141 him, "O Prophet of God, I see that this morning, with the grace of God and His bounty, [you have recovered] as we desire. Today is the day of Bint Kharijah.1267 May I go to her?"1268 Then the Messenger of God went to this house] and Abu Bakr left for his family in Sunh.

had gone to the mosque, he returned1269 and lay down in my lap. A man from the family of Abu Bakr1270 came to me, and he had a fresh siwak in his hand. The Messenger of God looked at it in such a way that I knew [that] he wanted it.12711 took it, chewed it until I had softened it and gave it to him. He rubbed his teeth with it more energetically than I had [ever]1272 seen him doing it be- fore. Then he put it down, and I found him getting heavy in my lap. When I looked into his face his eyes were fixed while he was saying, "Nay, the most Exalted Companion is that of paradise." I said, "By Him who sent you with the truth, you were given the choice, and you have chosen," and he died.1273

'Abbad b. al-Zubayr1274-his father 'Abbad:1275 I heard 'A'ishah saying, "The Messenger of God died on my bosom during my turn, and I did not wrong anyone in regard to him.1276 It was because of my ignorance and youthfulness that the Messenger of God died while he was in my lap. Then I laid his head on a pillow and got up beating my chest and slapping my face along with the women.

184 The Last Years of the Prophet
Hisham b. Muhammad b. al-Sa'ib-Abu Mikhnaf-al-$aq'ab b. Zuhayr-the jurists of al-Hijaz: The Messenger of God died at noon on Monday, the second of Rabi' I. The oath of allegiance was given to Abu Bakr on Monday, the very day on which the Prophet died.
Al-Wagidi: [The Messenger of God] died on Monday, the twelfth of Rabi 1.1277 He was buried the following day around midday, after the sun had declined, and this day was Tuesday.1278
Abu Ja'far [al-Tabari] The Messenger of God died while 'Umar was present and Abu Bakr was in al-Sunh.1279
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Ibn Ishaq-al-Zuhri-Sa'id b. al- Musayyib128O-Abu Hurayrah: When the Messenger of God died, 'Umar b. al-Khattab stood up saying, "Some of the hypocrites allege that the Messenger of God is dead. By God, he is not dead,
[1816] but has gone to his Lord as Moses b. 'Imran went and remained hidden from his people for forty days. Moses returned after it was said that he had died. By God, the Messenger of God will [also] return1281 and will cut off the hands and feet of those who allege that he is dead."
When the news [of the Prophet's death] reached Abu Bakr, he came and dismounted near the door of the mosque [where] 'Umar was speaking to the people. He paid no attention to anything and went [straight] to the Messenger of God in 'A'ishah 's house where he was lying in a comer covered by a striped garment of the Yemeni fabric. Abu Bakr went close [to the Prophet], uncovered his face, kissed him, then said, "With my father may you be ransomed, and with my mother! Indeed, you have tasted the death which God had decreed for you. No [other] death will ever overtake you." Then he replaced the cloth on [the Prophet's] face and went out as 'Umar was speaking to the people. He said, "Gen- tly, O'Umar, [and] be silent!"'Umar refused [to be silent] and kept on speaking. When Abu Bakr saw that he would not listen, he went forward to the people [speaking]. When they heard his

words, they came to him and left `Umar. After praising God and extolling Him, he said, " 0 people, those who worshipped
Muhammad, [must know that] Muhammad is dead; those who worshipped God, [must know that ] God is alive [and] immortal."
He then recited the verse: "Muhammad is only a messenger; and
many a messenger has gone before him. So if he dies or is killed,
will you turn back on your heels ? He who turns back on his heels
will do no harm to God; and God will reward the grateful."1282 By
God, it was as if the people did not know that this verse was revealed to the Messenger of God until Abu Bakr recited it that
day. The people took it from him, and it was [constantly) in their mouths. 'Umar said, "By God, as soon as I heard Abu Bakr recite [1817] it, my legs betrayed me so that I fell to the ground , and my legs
would not bear me. I knew that the Messenger of God had indeed died."1283

threatening to kill [those who maintained that the Prophet was dead].
The An$dr gathered in a roofed building (sagifah)12s9 of the Banu Sa'idah to render their oath of allegiance to Sa'd b. Ubadah. This news reached Abu Bakr, so he came to them with'Umar and Abu'Ubaydah b. al-Jarrah, asking [them] why [they had gathered]. They replied, "Let us have a ruler (amir) from us and another from you." Abu Bakr said, "The rulers (umard') will be from us, and the viziers (wuzard') from you." Abu Bakr then added, "I am pleased [to offer] you one of these two men: 'Umar or Abu 'Ubaydah. Some people came to the Prophet asking him to send a trustworthy man with them. The Messenger of God said that he
[18181 would send a truly trustworthy man with them, and he sent Abu 'Ubaydah b. al-Jarrah. I am pleased [to offer] you Abu 'Ubaydah." 'Umar stood up saying, "Who among you would be agreeable to leave Abu Bakr whom the Prophet gave precedence? 11290 and he gave him the oath of allegiance. The people followed ['Umar]. The Angdr said, or some of them said, "We will not give the oath of allegiance [to anyone] except 'Ali."

Abu Bakr's election took place in this building, hence the event surrounding his election is named "The Sagifah" after it. Following the Prophet's death, the An- $dr, who had grown resentful of the growing influence of the Quraysh, met there to deliberate on the critical leadership crisis that had arisen. The common view among the early Muslim historians is that the crisis was averted by the resolute action of three prominent Muhdjirun : Abu Bakr, 'Umar, and Abu 'Ubaydah, and that their success was facilitated by the jealousies among the An$ur. The sources, as pointed out by Lammens, "Triumvirate," also suggest an alliance between those three Muhdiirdn. Moreover, all of them, being close advisers to the Prophet, carried considerable influence and prestige in the emerging Islamic polity. For an analysis of the early sources and an intelligent reconstruction of the events, see Jafn, Origins, 27-57 . Shoufani, a]-Riddah, 48-70, who has reexamined the earlier sources, states that Abu Bakr was elected mainly because he was supported by the newly converted Meccan aristocracy . See also Rodinson, Mahomet, 327-28; Momen, Shi'i Islam, 18-20.

and kissed him, saying, "May my father and mother be your ransom! How good you are both living and dead! [I swear] by the
Lord of the Ka'bah that Muhammad is dead." Then he went to the
pulpit and found'Umar b. al-Khallib standing [there], threatening
the people and saying, "The Messenger of God is alive and not
dead. He will [return], go out after those who spread lies about him,
cut off their hands and strike their necks and crucify them." Abu
Bakr asked him to be silent, but he refused to listen, so Abu Bakr
spoke, saying that God had revealed to His Prophet: "Verily, you
will die, and so will they. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will [ 1819] dispute before your Lord. 111295 [Then] he said: "Muhammad is only

At this point, his supporters gathered in Fitimah's house. Abu Bakr and 'Umar, fully aware of 'Ali's claims and fearing a serious threat from his supporters , summoned him to the mosque to swear the oath of allegiance. 'All refused , and so the house was surrounded by an armed band led by Abu Bakr and 'Omar , who threatened to set it on fire if 'Ali and his supporters refused to come out and swear allegiance to Abu Bakr. The scene grew violent and Fitimah was furious . For details, see Bal- idhuri, Ansab, I, 582- 86; Ya'qubi, Ta rikh, II, 116; (Pseudo-) Ibn Qutaybah, al-

time we had reached, affirmed that they did not know that those two verses were revealed until Abu Bakr recited them that day. Then, a man suddenly came running and said, " Listen to me, the An$ar have gathered in a roofed building (;ullah)1297 of the
Bann Sa'idah to give their oath of allegiance to one of their men. They say: Let us have a ruler from us and let Quraysh have an- other from them." Abu Bakr and 'Umar rushed away (as though each of them led the other) until they came to them . 'Umar want- ed to speak but Abu Bakr stopped him so he said, "I will not disobey the Prophet's successor (khalifah) twice in a day." Abu Bakr spoke and did not leave out anything that was either re- vealed about the Ansar or was said by the Messenger of God with regard to their fine qualities . He said, " You know that the Mes- senger of God said, 'If the people took one way and the An$ar another, I would take An$ar's path.' 0 Sa'd, you know that the Messenger of God had said, while you were sitting, that Quraysh were the masters of this authority . The righteous follow their kind, and the wicked follow theirs ." Sa'd replied, " You have spo- ken the truth. We are the viziers and you are the rulers."1298 'Umar said, "Stretch out your hand, 0 Abu Bakr, so that I may give you the oath of allegiance ." Abu Bakr replied, " Nay, rather you, 0 U mar. You are stronger than I [to bear the responsibility]." 'Umar was indeed the stronger of the two. Each of them wanted the other to stretch his hand so that he could strike the bargain with him.1299 'Umar stretched Abu Bakr's hand saying, "My power is for you with your power," and the people gave their oath
[r82o] of allegiance . They demanded confirmation of the oath , but 'Ali and al-Zubayr stayed away. Al-Zubayr drew his sword (from the scabbard), saying, "I will not put it back until the oath of alle- giance is rendered to 'Ali." [When] this news reached Abu Bakr and 'Umar, the latter said, "Hit him with a stone and seize the

[There] you can confer privately with the Messenger of God's companions,1313 both the Emigrants and the Ansdr. You
[x82.-1 can say what you will with firmness, they will retain your words and interpret them properly." He replied, "By God, I will do it at the first opportunity which I get in Medina."
After we arrived in Medina, 1314 I journeyed on Friday at midday [to listen to) the report which 'Abd al-Rahman had narrated to me. I found that Sa'id b. Zayd had already preceded me [to the mosque],1315 so I sat at his side near the pulpit , my knee to his knee. Immediately after the sun had declined, 'Umar came. As he was coming I said to Said, "The Commander of the Faithful will say something today from this pulpit which he has not said1316 before." Said became angry, retorting,1317 "What is he going to say that he has not said before ?" When 'Umar sat in the pulpit, the muezzin'318 called to prayer. After the muezzin had finished his call to prayer, 'Umar stood up. He praised God, extolled Him and said, "Now then: I want to say something which has been decreed that I should say.1319 He who takes heed of it, under- stands it and will remember it. Let him relate it wherever he goes, [but] he who takes no heed of it, I do not permit him to he [to someone that I did not say it]. God sent Muhammad with truth and revealed the Book to him. The verse concerning the stoning [of adulterers] was among [the verses] which were revealed to him.1320 The Messenger of God stoned [adulterers], and we

stoned them after him. I am afraid that as time becomes pro- longed some people might say that they do not find stoning in God's Book, and (thereby] they might go astray by forsaking an obligatory act (farfdah) revealed by God. 1-321 We used to say:1322
'Do not detest your ancestors for it is infidelity to do so.11323
"It has reached me that someone1324 of you said, 'If the Com- mander of the Faithful1325 is dead, I will give the oath of alle-
1321. lbn Isbiq adds: Stoning in the Book of God is a penalty laid on married men and women who commit adultery, if evidence stands, or confession is made, or [it] results in pregnancy.
The alleged verse about stoning read : "Do not detest your ancestors, for it is infidelity to do so. If an adult man (al-shaykh) or woman (al-shaykhah) commit adultery, stone them without exception as a chastisement from God. God is Mighty and Wise." It is suggested that this verse was a part of the Qur'an, and that it originally belonged to snrah 33, but was later abrogated. See Noldeke, Geschichte, I, 248- 52, where older sources are cited. Schacht doubts that the verse is genuine and states that the traditions relating to it and the mention of 'Umar are clearly tendentious. He suggests that stoning was introduced from Jewish law. Eh, s.v. Zini'.
Burton (Collection of the Qur'an, 72- 86, 134ff.) contends that the Iladith about the stoning penalty for adultery and the stoning verse, classified in the third category of naskh (i.e., naskh al-tilawah dune alliukm , the suppression of a Qur'inic verse without prejudice , however, to the continuing validity of its ruling for legal purposes), were most probably fashioned by the dictates of Islamic legal science, u4dl al filth. He further contends that the latter has also shaped Islamic accounts of the history of the collection of the Qur'inic texts, in which the Prophet is said to have been deliberately excluded from the task of collecting revelations because naskh (withdrawal) was a possibility as long as he lived.
In the Qur'an 24:2, scourging is prescribed as a punishment for adultery. It states: "Flog both the adulterous woman and the adulterous man with a hundred lashes, and do not let any pity for either of them deter you from (complying with) God's law, if you believe in God and the Last Day." Both the flogging and stoning remained as a punishment combined with a year 's banishment. In some traditions and the system of law , stoning and flogging are separated as punishment (tiadd) for adultery in two categories of criminals, whether they are mub$an (an adult in possession of his faculties, who is free and has had sexual intercourse in a legal marriage) or not. Generally, the non-mub$an is flogged, while the muIj an is flogged and then stoned, or stoned.

We are in the center among the Muslims with respect to our position, and we are the noblest with respect to our lineage, and we are the nearest to the Messenger of God in relationship. You are our brethren in Islam and our partners in re- ligion .... The Arabs will not submit themselves except to this clan of Quraysh....

Abu'Ubaydah put his hand upon Abu Bakr's hand and 'Umar did the same [in ratifying their bargain]. The Meccans who were with them did the same . Then Aba 'Ubaydah cried, "0 people of the Ansdr, you were the first to help [the prophet[so do not be the first to change and convert [back to paganism[." Next, 'Abd &I-Rabmin b.

By God, the Arabs will never accept your rule, since their Prophet is not from you, but they will not reject the rule of one from whom is their Prophet. If anyone refuses our authority, we will [produce] a clear rebuttal and an evident proof.

God, I liked everything he said except the last words. I would have preferred myself to be sent forward and my head struck off- if it were not considered a sin-rather than to be appointed a ruler over a people of whom Abu Bakr was one.
"After Abu Bakr had finished his speech, a man from the An-

['Umar] said,1347 "Voices rose and clamorous speech waxed hotter. I feared [total] disagreement so I said to Abu Bakr, 'Stretch out your hand [so that]I may give you the oath of allegiance .' He did so and I gave [him ] the oath of allegiance ; the Muhdjirdn followed and then the An$ar. [In so doing] we jumped on Sad b. 'Ubadah so someone said that we had killed him. I said, '[May] God kill him! '1348 By God, nothing was mightier than the rendering of the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr. We feared that if [we] left [without rendering the oath of allegiance], no agreement would be ham- mered out later. It was either to follow the An$ar in what we did not like, or else to oppose them, which would have led to disorder (fasad[."

Messenger of God was asked who were the people about whom God said: "Therein [i.e., in a mosque] are men who love to be purified; and God loves those who purify themselves,"1349 he replied that the best of them was U waym b .

As for Man, it has reached us that when people wept over the Messenger of God's death and said that they wished that they had died before him because they feared that they would be subjected to tempta- tions after him, he said, "By God, I do not wish to die before him, so that I can bear witness to his truth when he is dead, as I did when he was alive." Ma'n was killed in the battle of al-Yamamah, the battle against Musaylimah, the arch-liar, as a martyr during Abu Bakr's caliphate.

It was the first and most important step taken by both Abu Bakr and 'Umar in their attempts to displace the Banu Hishim , and especially 'Ali, from their pre- rogatives in the leadership of the Muslim polity . Acceptance of this claim of inheritance based on family ties would have opened the door widely to 'Ais right to the succession. Moreover, the income from both these sources was consider- able, and it would have given some leverage WAR. In Shabbah , Ta'z kh, I,176- s18; jafri, Origins, 14-r6, 63.

attention turned away from him .1358 Falimah continued to live for six months after the Messenger of God 's [death] and then died. Ma'mar: A man asked al-Zuhri, "Did 'Ali not give his oath of allegiance for six months?" "No, nor anyone of the Bann Hashim until `Ali rendered his," he replied.1359 When 'Ali saw that the
people's attention had turned away from him, he begged for rec- [1826] onciliation with Abu Bakr. He sent to the latter, [asking him] to
visit him, and [requesting] that nobody should accompany him.
'All disliked that 'Umar should come with Abu Bakr, for he knew 'Umar's rudeness. U mar said [to Abu Bakrj, "Don't go alone."
Abu Bakr replied, "By God, I will go alone. It is not possible that [the Bann Hashim) might do anything to me," and he went. He entered into 'All's presence while the Bann Hashim had gathered with him. 'All stood up, praised God and extolled Him with what is due to Him. Then he said, "It is neither the denial of your good qualities nor the rivalry of good, which God has given you, that prevented us from giving you the oath of allegiance , but the fact that we considered that we have a right in this authority which you have monopolized." 'Ali then mentioned his relationship with the Messenger of God and the rights of the Bann Hashim. He continued speaking until Abu Bakr wept . After 'Ali stopped, Abu Bakr pronounced the shahadah, praised God, extolled Him with what is due to Him, then said, "By God, the relationship of the Messenger of God is dearer to me [too]. I reach [him) through my relationship [to him]. By God, I did not fall short of doing what was requisite with regard to this property [i.e., the Prophet's in- heritance], which became [a dispute] between you and me except for good. I had heard the Messenger of God saying: 'Our [i .e., the
prophets' property] cannot be inherited and whatever we leave behind is alms [i.e., to be given in charity].

He was the effective ruler of Mecca during his lifetime and also became the master of the Ka'bah holding all the important offices, such as sidanah (guard- ianship), nfadah (feeding), and sigayah (providing water). His descendants 'Abd al- Dir inherited much of his power, but in the course of time the family was split and challenged by 'Abd Manif.

Zoo The Last Years of the Prophet
Hisham b. Muhammad-Abu Muhammad al-Qurashi: When the oath of allegiance was rendered to Abu Bakr, Abu Sufyan said to 'Ali and al=Abbas, "You are two despicable ones," and began reciting the [following] proverbial verses:
A domestic ass knows the disgrace,
but a free man and a well-built camel, soft in the joints, detest it.
No one bears an unjust state that is intended for him, except the two despicable things : a domestic ass and a wooden peg.
The former is turned back to his state of ignominy by a
piece of worn-out rope, while the latter's head is broken
and no one mourns.
Ibn Humayd- Salamah- Muhammad b. Ishaq-al-Zuhri- Anas b. Malik: The following day after Abu Bakr was given the oath of allegiance in the Sagifah , he sat in the pulpit . 'Umar stood up and spoke before him. After praising God and extolling Him
with what is due to Him, he said, "0 people, yesterday I said something to you that1375 was based on my own opinion. I nei- ther found it in God's book1376 nor was it something by which the Messenger of God had enjoined me;1377 but I thought1378 that the Messenger of God would conduct our affairs until he was the last of us [alive]. God has left His book, by which He guided His Messenger, with you. If you hold fast to it God will guide [you] as He guided him. God has vested your affairs in the hands of the best one among you, the companion of the Messenger of God, 'the second of the two when both of them were in the cave,'1379 so arise and give [him]1380the oath of allegiance ."

Abu Bakr their oath of allegiance in public after the one rendered [18291 in the Sagifah.
Then Abu Bakr spoke. After praising God and extolling Him with what is due to Him, he said, "Now then: 0 people, I have been put in charge of you although I am not the best of you. Help me if I do well; rectify me if I do wrong. Truthfulness is loyalty and falsehood is disloyalty. The weak among you shall be strong in my eyes until I ensure his right, God willing; and the strong among you shall be weak in my eyes until I wrest the right from him, God willing. No one from you should refrain from fighting in the cause of God, because if it is forsaken by a people, God will smite them with disgrace.1381 Foul things never become wide- spread in a people but God brings calamity upon them.

Abu Ja'far [al-Tabari]: After the oath of allegiance was rendered to Abu Bakr, people came to prepare the Messenger of God's burial. Some [of the authorities] state that the burial took place on Tuesday, that is, the following day of the Messenger of God's death, while the others state that' he was buried three days after his death. The report of some of those authorities has already preceded.
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Muhammad b. Ishaq-'Abdallah b. Abi Bakr, Kathir b. 'Abdallah,1387 and others who relate from `Abdallah b. 'Abbas: 'All b. Abi Talib, al-'Abbas b. 'Abd al- MuXlalib, al-Facll b. al-'Abbas, Qutham b. al-'Abbas, Usamah b. Zayd, and Shugran, freedman of the Messenger of God, were the ones who took charge of the washing of the Prophet. Aws b. Khawli, one1388 of the Banu 'Awf b. al-Khazraj, said to 'Ali, "I adjure you by God, 0 'Ali, [where is] our share in regard to the Messenger of God?" Aws was one [of the companions of the Mes-
senger of God] 1389 who had participated in Badr. 'Ali allowed him to enter, so he came in'-390 and was present at the Messenger of God's washing. `Ali made the Prophet's body to rest upon his breast and 'Abbas, al-Fads, and Qutham turned him over along with 'Ali. Usamah and Shugran were the ones who poured water [over him], 1391 while 'Ali washed him, having rested him against his breast. The shirt was still on the Prophet's body; 'Ali rubbed him from the outside without touching the Messenger of God's
do not know." 'Umar said, "O son of 'Abbas, your father is an uncle of the Mes- senger of God and you are [the Prophet 's[ cousin, so what prevented the Quraysh [from supporting]you?" Ibn 'Abbas answered, "I do not know." Then 'Umar said, "But, I know, they dislike your authority." Ibn 'Abbas replied, "[But) why? We are [always] good to them." 'Umar added, "0 God, pardon me! They did not like having both the prophethood and the caliphate combined in your family, which would have made you proud and arrogant." This conversation not only reveals 'Umar's attitude toward 'Ali but also clearly indicates that he was aware of the importance of the idea of inherited sanctity. On another occasion, the same sub- ject is discussed between the two, but the second dialogue is more intense and lively. When Ibn 'Abbis answers back, 'Umar loses his temper. SeeTabari, I, 2769- 71.

Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Ibn Ishaq-Yahya b. 'Abbad-his fa- ther 'Abbad [b. 'Abdallah b. al-Zubayrl-'A'ishah: When they wanted to wash the Prophet, they disagreed about it, saying that they did not know whether they should remove his clothes as they do with their dead, or wash him with his clothes on. When they disagreed, slumber overtook them1393 so that everyone's chin was sunk on his chest. Then a speaker-it is not known1394 who he was-spoke from a comer of the house: "Wash the Prophet with his clothes on." They got up and washed the Messenger of God with his shirt on, pouring water on the shirt, and rubbing him with the shirt. 'A'ishah used to say, "Had I known regarding my duty at the beginning what I knew at the end, none but his wives would have washed him."1395

Ibn Ishiq states that he has [also[ received this account on the authority of al-Zuhri-'Ali b.

When they decided to dig [a grave] for the Messenger of God, al-'Abbas called two men, told one of them to go to Abu 'Ubaydah and the other to go to Abu Wallah, [saying], "0 God, choose for your'4°0 messenger." The one who had been sent for Abu Talhah found him and brought him, so he dug the grave with the niche for the Messenger of God.
After the preparations for the Messenger of God's burial had been completed on Tuesday, he was laid upon his bed in his house. The Muslims had disagreed about the place of his burial.

The Events of the Year i i 205
Ibn Ishaq states: Those who descended into the Messenger of God's grave were 'Ali b. Abi Talib, al-Fad b. al-'Abbas, Qutham b. al-'Abbas, and Shugran, freedman of the Messenger of God. Aws b. Khawli implored 'Ali in the name of God, asking for his share regarding the Messenger of God. 'Ali permitted him to descend [into the grave] with the others.1407 After the Messenger of God was laid in his grave and the earth was laid over him, Shugran, the Messenger of God's freedman, took a garment which the Mes- senger of God used to wear and spread out (for sitting), and tossed it' 408 in the grave saying, "By God, no one shall ever wear it after you," so it was buried with the Messenger of God.
Ibn Ishaq states: Al-Mughirah b. Shu'bah used to claim that he was the last man to be with the Messenger of God. He used to say, "I took my ring, threw it in the grave and said, my ring has fallen.
I threw it intentionally so that I might touch the Messenger of God and be the last person to be with him."1409
Ibn Humayd-Salamah-Muhammad b. Islaq-his father Ishaq b. Yasar-Miqsam, Abu al-Qasim, freedman of 'Abdallah b. al-Harith b. Nawfal-his master 'Abdallah b. al-Harith:1410 I made a lesser pilgrimage with 'Ali b. Abi Talib during the [caliphate] of 'Umar or'Uthman. 'Ali stayed with his sister Umm Hari' bt. Abi Talib. After he had finished his lesser pilgrimage, 'Ali returned and I poured [water]1411 for him [to perform] the major ritual purification, which he did. After he had finished the purification, some Iraqis came to him and said, "0 Abu al-Hasan, we have come to ask you about a matter on which we would like you to give us information." He said, "I suppose that al-Mughirah tells you that he was the last person to be with the Messenger of God." They said that, indeed, that was the reason they had come to ask him. 'Ali said that al-Mughirah lied. The last man to be with the Messenger of God was Qutham b. al-'Abbas.1412

206 The Last Years of the Prophet
Zuhri-'Ubaydallah b. 'Abdallah-'A'ishah: The Messenger of God was wearing a black cloak (khamIIah)1414 when his pain became severe. Sometimes he would put it over his face, at times he would put it off, saying, "May God fight the people who took the graves of their prophets as places of worship (masajid)!", warning his community against such a practice.
Ibn Humayd- Salamah-Ibn Isl3aq-$ i" b. Kaysan-al- Zuhri-'Ubaydallah b. 'Abdallah b.

The Messenger of God died on the twelfth of Rabi' I/June 7, 632, the very day on which he came to Medina as an emigrant,1415 so he completed a full ten years of his migration.

of God died on the twelfth of Rabi' I/June 7, 632,1452 on Monday, and was buried on the night of Wednesday.
Abmad b. 'Uthman [b. Hakim]-'Abd al-Rahman [b. Sharik]- his father-Muhammad b. Isliaq-'Abdallah b. Abi Bakr: Muhammad b. Ishaq went to'Abdallah b. Abi Bakr, who asked his wife Fatimah to narrate to him what she had heard from 'Amrah bt. 'Abd al-Rabman. She said, "I heard 'Amrah saying that she had heard 'A'ishah saying that the Prophet of God was buried on the night of Wednesday, and that they did not know about it until they heard the sound of the pickaxes."1453
1452. Baladhuri, Ansdb, I, 568. Gaudefroy-Demombynes, Mahomet, 205, on the other hand, states that it must be Monday, the twenty-third of Rabi' 1, which corresponds to June 8, 632. According to Haig 's Comparative tables, the corre- sponding date given above in the text is correct.
