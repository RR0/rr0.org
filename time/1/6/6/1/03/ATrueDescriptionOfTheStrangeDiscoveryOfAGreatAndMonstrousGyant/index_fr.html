<p>This story may seem to the Reader very incredulous, in regard of the wonderful bigness and proportion of this huge,
  great and impregnable Monster of men; but to make it more apparent that there hath been persons of the like bigness, I
  shall not mention any old Romance wherein such Gyants have been proportioned, or drawn out according to the fancy of
  the Poet, but instance one well known to be true to the generallity of people, and so come to the Discription of this
  hideous and invincible Monster.</p>
<p>We read in Samuel of that valiant Champion of the Philistins named Goliah who defied the Hoast of Israel, who was six
  Cubits and a span in highth, and ware a Helmet of Brasse on his Head, and was Armed with a Coat of Male, which weighed
  five thousand Shekels of Brasse, and the staffe in his hand was like a Weavers Beam, the Head of his Spear weighing
  six hundred Shekels of Iron, and a great Target of Brasse between his Shoulders; this may be enough to satisfie any
  rational person, therefore though several others have been in later ages, which might be here inferred, both of great
  Gyants and valiant Champions, I shall not for brevities sake enter into any further discourse but come to the story
  itself, which is as followeth, viz.</p>
<p>Certain Labourers digging in a Mine (which lay on the side of a Hill for Lead Ore, following a vane that ran up to
  the top of the Hill) found to their apprehension a perfect Rock, but having disrobed it of the Earth or Mole that lay
  thereon, they discovered a plain stone of a vast bigness, upon which they soon espied a fair but strange Inscription
  engraven in an unknown Language, which as yet no Schollar can be found to Interpret, but only by the date of the year
  that is likewise engraven in Figures, it doth appear by the best exposition they can make thereon, that it must
  without question be layd there before the Nativity of our blessed Lord & Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>These workmen upon order given them digged down on both sides thereof, and discovered on either side a large stone as
  big as the former, and with much toyle and ingenuity removing the uppermost, they beheld a very spacious & stately
  Tomb or Sepulchre, in which there lay the full proportion of an huge, monstrous and impregnable Gyant, which as they
  to their best Judgment could not perceive in the least diminished in any part of the Body.</p>
<p>But in fine they attempted to remove the Body of this mighty Monster, which immediatly fell in pieces, whereupon they
  took up the bones which were of a vast bigness and also his Scul, and conveyed them to a Lords house near adjacent,
  where they are to be seen daily, and have been by several persons of quality.</p>
<p>The Scul of this great Gyant hath been measured and doth hold at least a bushel of Corn, all his bones being
  proportionable thereunto, the highth of this Monster being adjudged by the best accountant (according to the bigness
  of the Scull and bones to be at least five yards if not more).</p>
<p>For further testimony of the truth hereof, there was lately one of the teeth of this Gyant sent by a Gentleman out of
  Darbyshire to a friend of his in London, which in weight is at least two pound and a half; this tooth hath been shown
  divers times (by a Barber Surgion at the Sign of the Blew Anchor in Little Brittain) to several credible persons, who
  being eye-witnesses can testifie the truth hereof.</p>
<p>FINIS.</p>
