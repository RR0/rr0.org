<p class="abstract"> Seen in the Air, in February last, and also this present March. 1661.</p>
<p>Amongst the many wonderful Apparitions, and Prodigious Signs that have been visible within some few years last past,
  none that hath appeared in Europe can Parallel these last strange and miraculous and wonderful Sights seen in February
  last, which is confirmed by Letters from Hamborough [note: Hamburg, Germany] dated the 4th of March 1661. Certefying
  that at Dresseden [note: Dresden, Germany] hath been seen many wonderful Omens, and miraculous Signs.</p>
<p>First, a Watchman at three of the Clock in the Morning (as the manner is), said: The Day drives away the darke Night,
  Beloved Christians be sober and watch & praise God; at the ending of these words a little Childe in a white shite
  appeared to him, Commanding him, when he cryed again, to say, Beloved Christians the last day is not far off. The same
  words the next morning was told to an old Watch-man, by an old White-man, biding him say the same words.</p>
<p>2. The several sorts of Victual, that was upon their Tables turn’d into Blood.</p>
<p>3. That Fire did fall from Heaven.</p>
<p>4. That (our Ladys Church so call’d) the Graves open’d, and that they did hear the rattling of the dead mens bones
  perfectly.</p>
<p>5. That at clear noon day, three ships did appear upon the River of Elve [note: Elbe], sayling with a full wind
  through Bridge, and thence upon a suddain they appeared on dry Land; After which, immediatly there came out of the
  first ship little Children, out of the second came forth men with naked Swords and Spades, hacking and hewing as they
  went, and out of the third came all Souldiers, and after they had been upon the Land, they with the three Ships
  suddainly vanished away.</p>
<p>6. and lastly, That the Boor or Countey-man in the same party, met a man who was Armed, having in his hand a naked
  Sword who upon his approaching towards him immediatly vanished.</p>
<p>The truth of all this is by two Posts confirmed, and by a worthy Senator of Dresden.</p>
<p>It is further certified that they have all manner of strange births, and not a day passeth wherein there is not some
  miraculous or dreadful thing seen or heard of in this or some adjacent Towns.</p>
<p>It is confirmed likewise by Letters from Hambirdge [note: Hamburg, Germany] of the same date, That there fell in
  Egersteed [note: Eggerstedt, Germany] a wonderful great storm of Hayle, which was of an extraordinary weight, and
  blood-red, this hail was so hard and durable that they could not make it melt in the fire, nor burn to Ashes; but at
  last being put into the water, did turn it into a blood-red colour; this likewise is reported for truth by several
  credible men.</p>
<p>A Letter from Dirnix in Moravia dated the fifteenth of February 1661, certefies that there was the appearance of a
  clear shinning Sun in the East, with several Rayes or beams, about twelve of the Clock at night, and upon each of
  these Rayes hanged a Skeliton of a dead man, linked fast together with fiery Serpents.</p>
<p>And also from Dantzik [note: Gdansk, Poland] it is advertize by a Letter dated the 28 day of February 1661. That for
  several daies together there was seen in the Heavens many wonderful, strange and miraculous Sights, as of Pikes, Greek
  and Hebrew Letters, and also in the night season great Armies of men in the habit of Turkes.</p>
<p>There is likewise an account given us by Letters of the same date from Thoren [note: Thoren, Germany], That there was
  seen a strange woman well habited, who walked thorough the Town thre[e] several days one after another, and that as
  she went along, expressed several times these following words, Repent, repent, the last day is at the door.</p>
<p>What the effect of these strange Sights, wonderful Signs and Prodigious births may be, I shall not attempt to give
  you an account of, many now living having already heard & seen the events of some strange apparitions that have bin
  visible in these latter Ages, yet not altogether so miraculous as these herein mentioned, which indeed are too hard
  for any mortal to dive into the Interpretation of; and the true meaning being known to none but God alone, who
  ordereth and decreeth all things in Heaven and Earth, according to his good will and pleasure, and by whom we live,
  and move and have our beeing.</p>
