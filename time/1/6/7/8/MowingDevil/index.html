<p class="abstract">Being a True Relation of a Farmer, who Bargaining with a Poor Mower, about the Cutting down Three
  Half Acres of Oats; upon the Mower's asking too much, the farmer swore <em>That the Devil should Mow it rather than
    He.</em> And so if fell out, that very Night, the Crop of Oat shew'd as if it had been all of a Flame; but next
  Morning appear'd so neatly mow'd by the Devil or some Infernal Spirit, that no Mortal Man was able to do the like.</p>
<p class="abstract">Also, How he said Oats ly now in the Field, and the Owner has not Power to fetch them away. </p>
<p class="abstract2">Men may dally with heaven, and Criticise on Hell, as Wittily as they please, but that there are
  really such places, the wife Dispensations of Almighty Providence, does not cease continually to evince. For if by
  those accumulated circumstances which generally induces us to the belief of any thing beyond our senses, we may
  reasonably gather that there are certainly such things as Devils, we must necessarily conclude, that these Devils have
  a Hell; and as there is a Hell, there must be a Heaven, and consequently a GOD; and so all the Duties of Christian
  Religion as indispensible subsequents necessarily follow.</p>
<p>The first of which Propositions, this ensuing Narrative does not a little help to Confirm.</p>
<p>For no longer ago, than within the compass of this present Month of August, there hapned so unusual an Accident in
  <em>Hartfordshire</em>, as is not only the general Discourse, and Admiration of the whole Country; but may for its
  Rarity Challenge any other event, which has for these many years bin Product's in any other County whatsoever. The
  Story thus.</p>
<p>In the said County, Lives a Rich industrious Farmer, who perceiving a small Crop of his (of about three Half-Acres of
  Land which he had Sowed with <em>Oats</em>) to be Ripe and fit for Gathering, sent to a a poor neighbour whom he knew
  worked commonly in the summer-time at Harvest Labor, to agree with him about mowing, or cutting the said oats down;
  the poor man as it behoov'd him, endeavour'd to fell the sweat of his brows and marrow of his bones at as dear a rate
  as reasonably he might, and therefore askt a good round price for his labour, which the farmer taking some exceptions
  at, bid him much more under the usual rate than the poor man askt above it; so that some sharp words had past, when
  the farmer told him he would discourse with him no more about it. Whereupon the honest mower recollecting with
  himself, that if he undertook not that little spot of work, the might thereby lose much more business which the farmer
  had to imploy him in beside, ran after him, and told him, that, rather than displease him, he would do it at what rate
  in reason he pleas'd; and as an instance of this willingness to serve him, propos'd to him a lower price, than he had
  mowed for any time this year before. The irretated farmer with a stern look, and hasty gesture, told the poor man, <q>that
    the Devil himself should mow his oats before he should have any thing to do with them</q>, and upon this went his
  way, and left the sorrowful yeoman, not a little troubled that he had disoblig'd one in whose power it lay to do him
  many kindnesses.</p>
<p>But how ever, in the happy feries of a interupted prosperity, we may strut, and plume our selves over the miserable
  indigencies of our ncessitated neighbours; yet there is a just God above, who weighs us not by our bags, nor measures
  us by our coffers; but looks upon all men indifferently, as the common sons of Adam; so that he who carefully
  officiates that rank or station wherein the <em>Almighty </em>has plac't him, tho but a mean one, is truly more worthy
  the estimation of all men, than he who is prefer'd to superior dignities, and abuses them ; and what greather abuse,
  than the contempt of men below him ; the relief or whose common necessities is none of the least conditions wherby he
  holds all his <em>Good things</em>; which when that tenure is forfeited by his default, he may juilly expect some
  judgment to ensue; or else that those riches wherby he prizes himself so extravagantly, may shortly be taken from him.
</p>
<p>We will not attempt to fathom the canse, or reason of preternatural events ; but certain we are, as the most credible
  and general relation can inform us, that the same night this poor mower, and farmer parted, his field of oats was
  publickly beheld by several passengers, to ba all on a flame, and so continued for some space, to the great
  consternation of those that beheld it.</p>
<p>Which strange news being by several carried to the farmer next morning, could not give him a great curiosity to go
  and see what was become of his crop of oats, which he could not imagin, but was totally devour'd by those ravenous
  flames which were observ'd to be so long refident on his acre and half of ground.</p>
<p>Certainly a reflection of his suddain and indiscreet expression, [that the Devil should mowe his oats before the poor
  man should have any thing to do with them] could not but on this occasion come into his memory. For if we will but
  allow our selves to much leisure, to consider how many hits of providence go to the production of one crop of corn,
  such as the aptitude of soyl, the seasonableness of showers, nourishing solstices and salubreous winds, etc. we should
  rather welcome maturity with devout acknowledgements than prevent our gathering of it by our profuse wishes.</p>
<p>But not to keep the curious reader any longer in suspense, the inquisitive farmer no sooner arriv'd at the place
  where his oats grew, but to his admiration he found the crop was cut down ready to his hands ; and as if the Devil had
  a mind to shew his dexterity in the art of husbandry, and scorn'd to mow them after the usual manner, he cut them in
  round circles, and plac't every straw with that exactness that it would have taken up above an age, for any man to
  perform what he did that one night; and the man the ows them is as yet afraid to remove them. </p>
<p>FINIS.</p>
