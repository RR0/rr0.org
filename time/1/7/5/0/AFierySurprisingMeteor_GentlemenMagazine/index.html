  <h2> From the Newcastle Journal.</h2>
  <p> On July 22, between 8 and 9 at night, a strange phaenomenon was seen in the air, it appeared first at a
    considerable distance in the North, passed this place with great velocity to the South, and seemed to be a body of
    fire about 20 inches round, and in its motion had a luminous tail about two yards long.</p></section>

  <h2> Letter from Wigtoun.</h2>
  <p> The extraordinary meteor mentioned in the Newcastle paper, &amp;c. appeared over the Solway firth, directing its
    course South Eastward, the wind W.S.W. passed to the East of Wigton, seemed to be over Carlisle, and passed
    Newcastle also : but in order to account for its appearing at so many places, near the same time, it must have been
    kindled in the higher regions of the atmosphere, and been vastly higher than people imagined, whose computation was
    about 30 yards only, whereas it seems to have been as many miles at least, else it could not have appeared, almost
    over every place that we yet hear of; its tail and other appearances would vary with the circumstances of its
    inflammability and motion. Yours, G.S.</p>

  <p> (A like meteor was seen at Coventry on the [...] about 8 in the evening, which moved swiftly from westward to
    eastward.)</p></section>

    about 5 or 6 inches diameter, more sparkling than the morning star. It drew after it a tail of a duller and more
    blood colour'd flame, seemingly four or five feet in length; broad next to the head, to which it closely join'd, and

    Kelham, speeding this way; at Gransmire, 5 miles East of us, still pursuing its course; and in all the intermediate
    villages (that is, for ten miles in a direct line) by numbers of people, who all confes'd that they never beheld
    such a sight in the heavens before; and in all these places it appeared in every respect as it did here. </p>
