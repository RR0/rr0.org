<p>Edgeworthflown, Mullingar, Ireland.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, </p>
<p>At Half past nine in the evening of the 18th of August, I saw the meteor which has been observed in so many different
  places.</p>
<p>Its size appeared to be about one third of the moon's diameter ; and it moved from the north with an equable
  velocity, at an elevation of ten or twelve degrees, and in a line parallel to the horizon.</p>
<p>It was visible during ten or fifteen seconds, and seemed to be of a parabolic figure, with a luminous tail, twenty or
  five and twenty of its diameters in length.</p>
<p>It exhibited the most vivid colours ; the foremost part being of the brightest blue, followed by different shades of
  red. Twice during its flight it was eclipsed or extinguished, not gradually, but at once, immerging and emerging with
  undiminished lustre.</p>
<p>I shall not venture to trouble you with any conjectures upon the nature of this phenomenon, as it is probable, that
  the subject has been fully discussed long before this time by your friends in London. I am, etc.</p>
<p>Richard Lovell Edgeworth.</p>
<p> Sept, 5. <a href="../../../index.html">1783</a>. </p>
