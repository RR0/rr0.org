<p>Sur la route de Penrith à Kefwick se trouve Southerfell, remarquable pour un phénomène extraordinaire qui, peut-être,
  ne peut guère avoir de parallèle dans l'histoire, ou reconcilié avec la probabilité. Such, however, is the evidence we
  have of it, that I cannot help relating it, and then my readers may judge for themselves. I shall give it nearly in
  the words of Mr. Lancaster of Blackhills, from whom I had the account, and whose veracity, even if it were not
  supported by many concurrent testimonies, I could fully rely on.</p>
<p>Le 23ème jour de juin, en 1744, le servant de son père, Daniel Stricket (qui vit maintenant under Skiddow, and is an
  auctioneer), vers <time>19:30</time>, marchait un peu au-dessus de la maison ; regardant autour de lui, il vit une
  troupe d'hommes à cheval, chevauchant du côté de Southerfell, [un endroit où dormir that a horse can scarcely travel
  at all] in pretty close ranks, and at a brisk walk. Stricket observed these aerial troops some time before he ventured
  to mention what he saw : At length, fully satisfied that what he saw was real, he went into the house, and told Mr.
  Lancester he had something curious to shew him. Mr. Lancaster asked what it was ? adding, I suppose some bonfire, (for
  it was then, and still is a custom, for the shepherds on the evening before St. John's day, to light bonfires, and vie
  with each other in having the largest.) Stricket told him, if he would walk with him to the end of the house, he would
  shew him what it was. They then went together, and before Stricket spoke, or pointed to the place, Mr. Lancaster
  himself discovered the Phenomenon, and said to Stricket, "Is that what thou hast to shew me ?" "Yes, Master," replied
  Stricket, "do you think you see as I do ?" They found they did see alike; so they went and alarmed the family, who all
  came, and all saw this strange appearance.</p>
<p>Thse visionary horsemen seemed to come from the lower part of Southerfell, and became visible first at a place called
  Knott ; they then moved in regular troops along the side of the Fell, till they came opposite Blake Hills, when they
  went over the Mountain ; thus they described a kind of curvilineal path upon the side of the Fell, till borth their
  first and last appearance were bounded by the top of the Mountain.</p>
<p>Frequently the last, or last but one in a troop (always either the one or the other) would leave his place, gallop to
  the front, and then take the same pace with the rest, a regular swift walk : These would happen to every troop, (for
  many troops appeared) and oftener than once or twice, yet not at all times alike. The spectators saw all alike, the
  same changes, and at the same time as they discovered them, by asking each other questions as any change took place.
  Nor was this wonderful Phenomenon seen at Blake Hills only ; it was seen by every person at every village within the
  distance of a mile : Neither was it confined to a momentary view, for from the time that Stricket first observed it,
  the appearance must have lasted at least two hours and a half, viz. from half past seven, till the night coming on
  prevented the further view ; nor yet was the distance such as could impose rude resemblances upon the eyes of
  credulity. Blake Hills lay not half a mile from the place, where this astronishing appearance seemed to be, and many
  other places where it was likewise seen, still nearer.</p>
<p>Desirous of giving my Readers every possible satisfaction, I procured the following attestation, signed by Mr.
  Lancaster, and Daniel Stricket :</p>
<p>"We whose names are hereunto subscribed, declare the above account to be true, and that we saw the Phenomena as above
  related ; as witness our hands, this 21st day of July, 1785.</p>
<p>William Lancaster</p>
<p>Daniel Stricket.</p>
<p>Thus I have given the best account I could procure of this wonderful appearance ; let others determine what it was.
  Speed tells us of something similar to this as preceding a dreadful intestine war. Can something of this nature have
  given rise to Offian's grand and awful Mythology ? Or, finally, is there any impiety in supposing, as this happened
  immediately before the Rebellion which was intended to subvert the liberty, the law, and the religion of England, that
  tho' immediate Prophecies have ceased, these visionary Beings might be directed to warn manking of approahing tumults
  ?"</p>
