<p>On the 19th of September, between the hours of 5 and 6 in the evening, a luminous meteor appeared to the south, and
  about the distance of a quarter of a league from the small commune of Brezeau on the Meuse; persons who attentively
  examined it assert that it was nearly a quarter of an hour in collecting, floating over the place where it was first
  seen, and that when all its parts had united, it appeared all at once as a very considerable globe of fire; taking a
  northerly direction, it spread terror amongst the inhabitants of the village, who believed their houses would be
  burnt, and they themselves perish. This globe was accompanied by a frightful noise, which was heard at a distance of
  more than a league and a half, and sometimes resembled the roaring of a rapid chariot; at others, the noise of rain
  violently agitated by the wind. It was followed by a very thick fog, and carried up from the ground every thing it met
  in its passage, in crossing a river it absorbed water, which afterwards soon fell in rain. It wandered for some time
  near the village. One thing certain, is that the roof of a house was thrown down, which is the only trace it has left.
  It was accompanied and followed by an abundant rain, much lightning, and loud claps of thunder. Continuing in the same
  direction, it suddenly turned into a column of fire, which with the fog rose towards the heavens. This made many
  persons believe the fog was smoke. It remained about a quarter of an hour in this state, a quarter of a league to the
  north of the village, and a short distance from the forest of Beauleau. This column now sunk a little, and at last it
  suddenly disappeared, leaving a thick fog which had no smell. This phenomenon lasted three quarters of an hour, and
  travelled over the space of half a league.</p>
