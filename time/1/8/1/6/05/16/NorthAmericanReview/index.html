<p>On the 16th of last May (1816), being a very warm day, and during a gale of wind from south-west, a cloudless sky, at
  about 4 O'clock, p.m., the sun became dim, and lost his brightness to that degree, that he could be looked at without
  inconvenience to the naked eye, (the sun) being of a dark red, or almost bright color, without brilliancy. </p>
<p>At the same time there appeared at the western horizon, from where the wind blew, to arise gradually, and in quick
  succession, a great number of balls, or spherical bodies, to the naked eye of the size of the crown of a hat, and of a
  dark brown color. </p>
<p>The nearer these bodies, which occupied a considerable though irregular breadth of the visible heaven, approached
  towards the sun, the darker they appeared, and in the vicinity of the sun, became entirely black. </p>
<p>At this elevation their course (speed) seemed to lessen, and a great many of them remained, as it were, stationary;
  but they soon resumed their former, and accelerated motion, and passed in the same direction with great velocity and
  almost horizontally. </p>
<p> During this course some disappeared, others fell down, but the most part of them continued their progress almost in
  a straight line, till they were lost sight of at the eastern horizon. </p>
<p>The phenomenon lasted uninterruptedly, upwards of two hours, during which time millions of similar bodies continually
  rose in the west, one after another irregularly, and continued their career exactly in the same manner (mentioned
  above). </p>
<p>No report, noise, nor any whistling or buzzing in the air was perceived. As these bodies slackened their course on
  passing by the sun, several were linked together, three, six, or eight of them in a line, joined like chain-shot by a
  thin and straight bar; but on continuing again amore rapid course (speed), they separated, and each having a tail
  after it, apparently of three or four fathoms length, wider at its base where it adhered to the ball, and gradually
  decreasing, till it terminated in a fine point (tapered tails). </p>
<p>During the course, these tails which had the same black color as the balls, disappeared by degrees.</p>
