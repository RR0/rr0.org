<p>Last Friday, the 17th, about 7 o'clock in the everning, some travelers observed a remarkable natural phenomenopn
  half-way between Soendburg and Odensee, in Fulmen. There fell from the air like rain, an incredible number of larger
  and smaller balls, which, as they passed through the sunbeams, assumed all the colours of the rainbow. These balls,
  when they were caught, dissolved in vapour, and left yellow sports on the hands, and a strong smell of sulphur. They
  danced in the air like soap bubbles. This phenomenon continued nearly till sunset.</p>
<p>On the 21st of this month, the buildings on the estate of Pederstrup, in Lacland, belonging to the Minister of State
  Count Reventlow, were destroyed by fire. </p>
