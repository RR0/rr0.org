<p><i>From the Wheeling Gazette September 1. Mr Curtis.</i>?</p>
<p>The following phenomena are to me, so new and so remarkable, that I think proper to send them for publication, hoping
  that it may induce others who may also have seen the same, to give a philosophical explanation of them.</p>
<p>About 10 o'clock, on the evening of the 28th inst. I discovered from my window facing the west, a regular, luminous
  arch in the northern hemisphere of the heavens, extending from east to west, the centre of which was elevated near 45Â°
  above the horizon. It consisted of a pale, white light, similar to the brightest parts of that zone which astronomers
  call the galaxy. Its western limb was the most luminous, and it gradually became paler as it approached the eastern
  horizon. But the most singular part, and that which struck me most forcibly, was a great number of luminous columns
  perpendicular to the horizon immediately under the luminous arch, following its course and extending but a few degrees
  below it. The columns were unequal in length, but equidistant and distinct from each other. Between these studs the
  stars were seen distinctly, but through them, they appeared dim. These columns moved slowly, but, as regularly on to
  the west as a body of soldiers would have done, and preserved their distance from each other.?Continuing this movement
  for probably three or four minutes, they disappeared, leaving the arch still visible. In a few minutes more, the
  columns re-appeared, though less bright, and made the same movement and again disappeared. Shortly after this, the
  arch became broken and the eastern limb invisible. The other part of the arch then extended into the heavens, and
  moved towards the south, dividing itself into two branches, which again became consolidated and appeared a single
  luminous column, similar to the train of an immense comet. It continued to move on in a southerly direction until it
  gained the west &amp; then gradually died away.</p>
<p>When these remarkable appearances were first discovered, the north, near the horizon, was considerably illuminated,
  and this gradually increased, until it exhibited the appearance of the moon shining through a dense fog. At 10
  o'clock, where these appearances commenced or were first noticed, the moon had been down more than half an hour; the
  sky was free from clouds, except a thin one which passed over the western limb of the luminous arch. From the time
  these phenomena were first seen until they disappeared, it was something more than half an hour. </p>

<p><em>The Northern Lights</em>.?Under this head will be found, in a preceding column, several accounts of the
  extraordinary phenomenon that appeared on the evening of the 28th ult. in the Northern section of the Heavens. We did
  not see it, but believe, from what we have been able to collect, that some of the descriptions given, come very near
  the appearance presented to the view of the inhabitants of our neighborhood?some of whom, however, saw, or imagined
  that they saw, hostile armies marching and countermarching with all the paraphernalia and precision and confusion of a
  contested field.</p>

<h2>The Northern Lights.</h2>
<p><em>Washington, September 1.</em></p>
<p>The <em>Aurora Borealis</em>, or Northern Lights, a phenomenon very seldom witnessed in this latitude, was displayed
  on Tuesday night with uncommon brilliancy. It was observed by many persons here, from 10 to 11 o'clock.?The whole
  Northern portion of the Heavens was filled with this singular light, which shot its silver streams sometimes vividly,
  high up towards the zenith, and then became nearly blended in a mass of mad light. <em>Int</em>.</p>

<p><em>Baltimore, September 1. </em></p>
<p>The Aurora Borealis noticed here on Tuesday night, has attracted the same attention in the north, where it exhibited
  pretty similar appearances. The descriptions given in the Philadelphia papers, coincide the most nearly with what we
  observed ourselves, except that here there were no flashes of light from the zenith downwards, and the rose colour was
  more conspicuous. The range of seeming comets is compared there to a line of infantry : From their rapid evolutions,
  they might be more aptly resembled to a squadron of horse. This is not the first time, according to veracious
  tradition, when armies have been seen in the air. Perhaps some of our readers may wish that they were always confined
  to it ; we are sure the people of Flanders would, even those who had the honor to have their standing corn trampled
  down in the "glorious victory," (as Peterkin says in the poem) of Waterloo. <em>Amer.</em></p>

<p><strong>NORTHERN LIGHTS</strong>.?We had not the pleasure of viewing the <em>Northern Lights</em>, which occured on
  Tuesday evening last ; those who saw them, say they were unusually brilliant and beautiful?their coruscations so
  numerous and fanciful, that the eye of imagination might picture embattled hosts, and many direful prognostics! <em>Repos</em>.

<p><em>Pittsburg, August </em>31.</p>
<p><strong>NORTHERN LIGHTS</strong>.?On Tuesday night last, there was a singularly beautiful and brilliant display of
  lights in the north, rising from the horizon to the zenith, like successive and scarcely intermitting flashes, and
  illuminating the whole country around us from 11 till after 12 o'clock. A gentleman who noticed it, assures us the
  light was so constant and bright that almost any kind of out-door work might have been performed. Was this the Aurora
  Borealis? Has the phenomenon been observed elsewhere??<em>Gaz</em>.</p>

<p><em>Philadelphia, August </em>31.</p>
<p><strong>AURORA BOREALIS</strong>.?On Tuesday evening last, from half past 9 until half past 11 o'clock, the
  atmosphere exhibited this, to us, most unusual appearance of the Heavens. It began with a mild clear light in the
  northern horizon, precisely resembling the break of day?above which, at unequal distances, there shot forth numerous
  short lines or rays of light parallel to each other, or but slightly radiated, and forming a broken arch from N. W. to
  N. E. the highest point being about 30 degrees above the horizon, changing at intervals in size, and at times assuming
  a beautiful degree of brightness on the comparatively dark sky ; above these rays a vapoury arch of light appeared,
  into whgich gradually merged, giving it an additional brightness; imperceptibly the light sunk to a point a little
  North of West, from which it extended upwards nearly to the zenith in great beauty and clearness, increasing in
  breadth as it rose, and resembling a vast stream of fire gushing forth from the mouth of some immense beam changed
  into two or three long narrow rays or rods of light, inclining South, which, in a short time, died away, leaving an
  atmosphere so clear, that the dark vault of Heaven seemed to have doubled its innumerable host of Stars.</p>
