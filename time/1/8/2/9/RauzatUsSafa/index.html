<p>Halimah said that he had two milk-brothers who went every day into the desert to pasture the sheep, and that when his
  lordship was three years old he said to her: 'How is it that I have not seen my brothers these two days?' She replied:
  'During the day they are engaged in pasturing the sheep.' He queried further: 'Why sendest thou not me with them?' She
  answered: 'No doubt thou wishest to be in their company.' Accordingly, she combed his hair next morning, inserted
  collyrium into his blessed eyes, dressed him in a robe, and tied a string of Yaman shells round his blessed neck to
  avert the evil eye; but he immediately tore it off, threw it away, and said: 'He who is my guardian will be with me!'
  Sending him away with his [milk-]brothers, she enjoined them to take care of him, but about noon her son Zobeir came
  running in great distress and bathed in perspiration, exclaiming: 'O mother, rescue Muhammad&#8212;u. w. b.&#8212;but
  I believe thou wilt not be able to reach him.' She asked what had happened, and he continued: 'Two men, dressed in
  green, came from the sky, took him away from us to the top of the mountain, ripped open his abdomen, and they are
  still with him.' Halimah says: 'I, my husband, and several women of my tribe, ran helter-skelter to the meadow, and
  saw him standing on the top of the mountain, looking towards heaven. My husband asked him what had happened, and he
  replied as follows: "Two men alighted from the atmosphere, brought a vase full of snow-water, laid me down, opened my
  abdomen, and ripped up my breast. They took from it a small black grain, washed it with snow-water, and filled it with
  light. Then they passed their hands over my body, whereon it became again as it was before."' With reference to this
  matter there is also a tradition that Halimah said: 'When my son Zobeir informed me that two men had borne Muhammad to
  the mountain, and had opened his breast, I immediately ran with my husband to the spot, where we beheld him sitting
  and looking around, and when his eyes alighted on me he smiled. I kissed his head and eyes, saying: "May my life be
  sacrified for thee; tell me what has happened." He rejoined: "I was standing with my brothers, when all of a sudden
  three"'&#8212;but according to another tradition two&#8212;'"men made their appearance, dressed in white garments. One
  of them had a silver pitcher, and the other a plate of green emerald in his hand. They took me away from my brethren
  and carried me to the top of the mountain. One of them ripped open my breast down to the abdomen, without my feeling
  any pain. Then he introduced his hands into the cavity and extracted my bowels, washed them with snow-water, and again
  replaced them. After this the second individual arose, and said to his companion: 'Go away, for thou hast done thy
  duty.' Then the second person took out my heart, halved it, and removed therefrom a black point enveloped in gore,
  which he threw away, and said: 'This is the writing of Satan.' Thereupon he filled my heart with something he had
  brought, and I had never seen anything more tender or fragrant than that substance."'</p>
<p>Halimah reports that the prince of the world said: 'They weighed me first against ten men, but I preponderated; then
  with five hundred, and I preponderated; then with five thousand, and I again preponderated. Then one of them said to
  the other: "Let him alone. If he be balanced with the whole nation he will preponderate." Hereon they left me, flew
  away, and went to heaven.' Halimah says: 'When I brought Muhammad back to the house, the people said: "He ought to be
  taken to a sooth-sayer, because he is touched by the genii." <span class="note">He is mad</span> But Muhammad replied:
  "I am free, and safe from what you imagine, nor has anything befallen me." The people, nevertheless, insisted so much
  that we were obliged to comply. After we had stated the circumstances to the sorcerer, he desired the boy himself to
  explain them, as he was more familiar with them [than we could be]. When Muhammad&#8212;u. w. b.&#8212;had narrated
  the event, the sooth-sayer jumped up, pressed him to his breast, and exclaimed: "O Arab people, put him to death and
  me also. For if he remains alive he will consider your wise men to be fools, and will abolish your religion. He will
  invite you to worship a God whom you do not know, and to profess a religion contrary to your own."'' Halimah says:
  'When I heard these words I snatched Muhammad from his arms and said: "Thou art a fool! Had I known that thou wouldst
  utter such sentiments I would not have brought the child. Find a man to kill thee, for we shall not slay Muhammad."
  Accordingly, I took him home; nor did we pass any house of the Bani Sa'ad which did not exhale the odour of musk.
  After this strange event the father of my children [<i>i.e.</i>, my husband] and all my relatives advised me to return
  with Muhammad to A'bd-ul-Muttalleb, lest a misforturne should befall him.' </p>
