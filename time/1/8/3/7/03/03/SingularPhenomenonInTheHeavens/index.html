<p>Two large bright balls near together, and resembling full moons, were seen one night in the last week in January, in
  the southern horizon by some gentlemen who were fox hunting near Concord, Calloway co. Kentucky. They were stationary,
  and so continued for a long time. Could they have been a part of the gorgeous pageantry of the heavens, seen all over
  North America, and at Bermuda, the night of the 25th??<em>N. Y. Star</em>. </p>
