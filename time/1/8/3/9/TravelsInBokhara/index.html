<p class="note">17 mars 1832</p>
<p>Before crossing the Indus, we observed a singular phenomenon at the fork of the Indus and Cabool river, where an
  ignis fattus shows itself every evening. Two, three, and even four bright lights are visible at a time, and continue
  to shine throughout the night, ranging within a few yards of each other. The natives could not account for them, and
  their continuance during the rainy season is the most inexplicable part of the phenomenon, in their estimation. They
  tell you, that the valiant Man Sing, a Rajpoot, who carried his war of revenge against the Mahommedans across the
  Indus, fought a battle in this spot; and that the lights now seen are the spirits of the departed. I should not have
  credited the constancy of this "will-o'-the-wisp," had I not seen it. It may arise from the reflection of the water on
  the rock, smoothed by the current; but then it only shows itself on a particular spot, and the whole bank is smoothed.
  It may also be an exhalation of some gas from a fissure in the rock; but its position prevented our examining it. </p>
