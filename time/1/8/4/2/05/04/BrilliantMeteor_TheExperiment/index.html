<p>The Buffalo <em>Commercial Advertiser</em> of the 11th inst. says:?About half-past two o'clock this morning, a most
  brilliant meteor shot athwart the sky, a little to the south and west of this city. When first seen, it was at an
  elevation of about forty-five degrees, nearly in the southwest, and thence moved rapidly to the northward, till it
  reached a point to the northwest of the city, when it burst with a loud explosion, resembling the blasting of rocks,
  succeded by a heavy rumbling sound for some moments. The meteor was very large, and its light was like that of day.
  The sky was perfectly cloudless at the time. In the fore part of the evening, there was quite a brilliant display of
  the aurora borealis. </p>
<p>The Buffalo Unionist adds the following :</p>
<p>The meteor which we mentionned in our paper as having been witnessed in this city a few days since, appears to have
  been very generally observed. The last Westfield Messenger contains a very long and able article on this subject. The
  editor says :</p>
<p>"On Monday morning last, about 3 o'clock, we were awakened by a sudden and extremely brilliant light which shone
  through the window of our sleeping apartment. On opening our eyes, we had a momentary glimpse of a vividly luminous
  body or trail, which almost instantly passed out of sight, and was gone. We were convinced it was a large meteor, and
  expected an explosion. We waited from three to five minutes, when a report burst through the welkin like a piece of
  heavy ordnance standing within a short distance. There was nothing in it like thunder, but a perfect resemblance to
  the sound we have named. It shook the house very sensibly, as it did others. ?in one instance jarring a tooth-brush
  from the window to the floor. Its direction was northerly and the explosion took place probably, over the lake.</p>
<p>The light emitted was nearly as bright as day-light at meridian. The shingles on distant houses were distinctly
  visible. Mr. Sexton our post-master, was at the time of its passage, assorting the mail, having two candles to furnish
  him light ; but the light of the meteor was so great as to make them appear like burning candles in full daylight.</p>
<p>The following rather startles our credulity, but we give it verbatim from the Messenger:</p>
<p>"Since writing the above, we have conversed with Mr. Horace Palmer, who was on his way from Dunkirk to this place,
  when the meteor appeared. He was tow or three miles from Dunkirk, when he appeared to be instantly surrounded with a
  most painful vivid light, proceeding from a mass of florid or <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/residu/gelee/index.html">jelly-like substance</a>, which fell around and
  upon him, producing a sulphurous smell, a great difficulty of breathing, adn a feeling of faintness, with a strong
  sensation of heat. As soon as he could recover from his astonishment, he perceived the body of the meteor passing
  above him, seeming to be about a mile high. It then appeared to be in diameter about the size of a large steamboat
  pipe, near a mile in length. Its dimensions varied soon ; becoming first much broader, and the waning away in diameter
  and length until the former was reduced to about eight inches, and the latter to a fourth of a mile, when it separated
  into pieces which fell to the earth, and almost immediately he heard the explosion, which he says, was tremendous. On
  arriving here in the morning, his face had every appearance of having been severely scorched ; his eyes were much
  affected, and he did not recover from the shock it gave his system for two or three days. This is really a marvelous
  story, but Mr. Palmer is a temperate aand industrious man, and a man of integrity, and we believe that any one
  conversing with him on the subject, would be satisfed that he intends no deception, but describes the scene, as nearly
  as possible, as it actually appeared. Probably, however, his agitation at his sudden introduction to such a scene,
  caused the meteor to be somewhat magnified by him. Witnesses here speak of the sparks which were given off : probably
  one of these fell and envelopped Mr. Palmer. In addition to its light, Mr. Palmer states that its passage was
  accompagned by a sound like that of a car moving on a railroad, only louder.</p>
<p>At Salem, an observer stated the meteor to be "as large as a house"?rather indefinite, but proving it to have been
  one of extraordinary magnitude. It was noticed at North East, Waterford, and Sugar Grove, Pa.; Harmony, Chautauque and
  other towns in the county. The report was heard also at Buffalo. In Chautauque an observer describes it as six or
  eight inches in diameter and half a mile long.</p>
<p>We learn also, that it burst about three miles beyond Fredonia, or about eighteen from this place. The report is,
  that a fragment has been found, a foot or more in diameter, but we know not the original authority of the
  statement.</p>
<p>If it did burst where it is represented to have done, and it was seen here until it exploded, its elevation must have
  been about thirty-five miles. Its course is represented by all to have been northeasterly.</p>
<p>In 1812, a large metero burst in England, and discharged more than 3000 stones to the ground, some of them wighing
  twenty pounds. The remarkable stone which fell in Connecticut twenty-five years ago, in the day time, weighed near a
  ton. It was bright and luminous, but did not explode : and rushed to the earth with such force that it sunk three or
  four feet beneath the surface, making a tremendous jar. </p>
