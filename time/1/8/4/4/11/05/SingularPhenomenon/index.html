  </table><p>On Wednesday, Sept. 11, at about 9 o'clock, was observed, from the deck of the sloop Mount Vernon, by Capt.
  J. P. Smith, and also by all his crew, what to all appearance was a star, but of such size and brilliancy, considering
  the sky was unclouded, and the sun pouring down its rays with unusual lustre, as to almost land to the belief that it
  was some supernatural vision. This singular phenomenon is represented as being, in appearance, nearly equal to the
  size of the moon. It remained visible nearly the whole day, and disappeared only as the shades of night were fast
  approaching, when all expected to have a better and more distinct view of this brilliant and apparently erratic
  heavenly body. Capt. S. states it to have presented an appearance, in color, similar to that of the planets at night,
  only a shade whiter.?<em>Key West Light of the Reif.</em></p>
