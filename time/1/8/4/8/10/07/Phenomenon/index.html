<p> A gentleman writes to the Newark Advertiser that, while at the Ocean House, Newport [Rhode Island], all being calm,
  waiting for the rising moon, just as her whole disc was visible above the ocean, a ship, "far out at sea,"
  with all sails spread moved slowly across her face, and apparently impressed upon it the free and beautiful outline of
  every sail and spar. Slowly indeed it passed along, too soon disappearing, but while it lasted, it was a most
  beautiful phenomenon. This frequently occurs, and is a very beautiful spectacle on a calm night. </p>
