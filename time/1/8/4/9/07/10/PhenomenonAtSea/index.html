<p><i>Balls of Fire.</i>?The ship Portsmouth, just arrived at Warren from a whaling cruise, reports, that on the 18th of
  March, lat. 57 S., lon. 74 W., she experienced a severe gale. While scudding before it, a dense cloud gathered in the
  west, out of which issued a <em>hurricane and many balls of fire</em>. One of these struck the cutting pendants at the
  main-mast head, and fell in fragments on the deck, setting fire to the mast-head and rigging, and doing other damage.
  We do not remember to have heard of such an occurence at sea.<em>.</em>?The Portsmouth has $20,000 in California gold
