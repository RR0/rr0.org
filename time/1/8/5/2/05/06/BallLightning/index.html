<p>During the remarkable storm of Friday evening (April 30th) we witnessed the rare phenomenon of <em>ball
  lightning</em>. For a time the lightning was vivid and almost incessant in the form of sheet and zigzag or chain
  lightning. Our attention was directed to the northwestern quarter of the heavens, when a ball of fire appeared to move
  from an elevation of about 38° to about 72° above the horizon when it exploded.?Its course was not vertical. We
  estimated the time of its visibility at 3 seconds. Numerous instances of this phenomenon are cited by M. Arago.?<em>Hudson
    Visitor</em>. </p>
