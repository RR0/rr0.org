    </tr></table><p>A most remarkable electric phenomenon was seen at the plantation of Charles J. Baldwin, Esq., about
    five miles from Madison, Geo., on Tuesday, June 8. Mr. Baldwin was standing in his back porch, when immediately,
    after a pretty severe flash of lightning, he observed a ball of fire at 60 or 70 yards from him. The ball, when
    first seen, appeared about a foot in diameter. It instantly began to expand, throwing off beautiful scintillations,
    and continued to enlarge and scintillate until it had become 10 or 12 feet in diameter, when it disappeared. Mr. B
    says it was the most beautiful sight he ever beheld. His family, both white and black, who saw it, were very much
    alarmed, but he was apparently so much interested as to feel no alarm. He has examined his cotton where it appeared,
    and observed no signs of injury. It must have been visible for some time, say 50 or 60 seconds, as the negroes ran
    into the house and gave the alarm, and returned before it disappeared.</p>
