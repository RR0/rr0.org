<p>A severe snowstorm, accompanied by lightning, occurred in a part of Maine on the 13th ult. [February]. A
  correspondent of the Gardiner (Me.) Fountain, writing from Bass Harbor, Mt. Desert, describes the storm as it appeared
  there, as awful and sublime. A thunder cloud passed over the place, which for terrific appearance, exceeded anything
  ever witnessed there. The correspondent adds:</p>
<p>The lightning was of a purple color, and sometimes appeared like balls of fire, coming in through windows and doors,
  and down the chimneys, while the houses trembled and shook to their very foundations.</p>
<p>Mrs. E. Holden was near a window, winding up a clock; a ball of fire came in through the window and struck her hand,
  which benumbed her hand and arm. She then, with all in the house, retreated into the entry. Another flash succeeded,
  and in the room from which they had retired, resembled a volume of fire, whirling round and producing a crackling
  noise. A similar appearance of fire was seen, and crackling noises were heard in a large number of houses.</p>
