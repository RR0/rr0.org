<p>The Cincinnati <em>Times</em> of Saturday [October 20], furnishes the following as a probable clue to the fate of
  this gentleman: --
</p>
<p>A CLUE TO A MYSTERY. &ndash; We have obtained what may perhaps be considered a clue to the awful mystery in which the
  fate of Mr.WINCHESTER, the daring Norwalk Aeronaut, is enveloped. A reliable gentleman of this city, in business on
  Main-street, informs us that on the day succeeding the ascension of Mr. WINCHESTER from Norwalk, Ohio, a customer[,]
  entering his store, remarked, "Have you seen the balloon?" Replying in the negative, the gentleman stepped to the
  door, and looking in a south westerly direction, perceived what at first appeared to be a balloon.
</p>
<p>At the first glance it appeared to be very diminutive, but gradually it dilated and appeared in the shape of a huge
  bird with expanded wings, apparently 30 feet across. Changing again from that form it reassumed the shape of a
  balloon. A strongly magnifying telescope being procured, it was fixed upon the floating object, and many persons who
  had now assembled to gaze at the mysterious aerial stranger, agreed in the opinion that it was a balloon, and
  concurred in the belief that it was a <em>wreck.</em></p>
<p>The gentlemen from whom we obtain the above information, states [sic] that about 150 persons were witnesses of the
  phenomenon. The information is certainly very vague, and to be sure it casts the painful mystery into a darker shadow,
  yet it may eventually lead to information that will remove the suspense that now oppresses the friends of the
  venturesome aerial navigator.
