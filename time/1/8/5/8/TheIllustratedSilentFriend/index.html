<p>I propose in this connection to make a few remarks on the following: Mr. Henry Wallace and other persons of Jay,
  Ohio, have recently detailed to me the annexed. There are thousands of such cases on record. These gentlemen state,
  that sometimes since on a clear and bright day, a shadow was thrown over the place where they were; this necessarily
  attracted their attention to the Heavens, where they one and all beheld a large and curiously constructed vessel, not
  over one hundred yards from the earth. They could plainly discern a large number of people on board of her, whose
  average height appeared to be about <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">12</span> <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">feet</span>
    </span>. The vessel was evidently worked by wheels and other mechanical appendages, all of which worked with a
  precision and a degree of beauty never yet attained by any mechanical skill upon this planet. </p>
<p> Now, I know that thousands will, at this recital, cry humbug, nonsense, lunacy, & c., but I know that there are
  other thousands who will read and reflect. It is for these latter thousands that I write. Once upon a time there
  appeared a celebrated reformer, who arose among the people and taught a new doctrine, that from its reasonableness and
  its simplicity, electrified the hearts of the thinking people. But the party who didnt think, and who hated reason,
  and new ideas, cried out, away with him to the crucifixion. And they did crucify his body, but they have not yet
  succeeded in crucifying the reason, and new facts and ideas that be taught. </p>
<p> In view, then, of the above, I venture to advance the following remarks: I believe that the time will come when all
  of the inhabitants of all worlds or planets in the solar system, will regularly visit each other when in the fullness
  or fruition of things, an interchange of ideas and commodities, visiting and greetings between the respective
  inhabitants of all worlds or planets, will be common and universal. I believe that the grand aspirations of an
  advanced humanity on this earth, is not without a good cause and a good reason. </p>
<p> I believe that when the respective atmospheres seen surrounding the different planets in the solar system, indeed,
  of every part of the universe, shall have passed into the highest condition of excellence and purity of which it is
  capable, that it will then give life to a more exalted and finished condition of genera and species, or inhabitants.
  That all of the planets are now inhabited by a kind of beings suited to their respective planetary and electrical
  conditions, is, I think, certain. And that the inhabitants of thousands of these worlds, that roll with eternal beauty
  throughout the boundless regions of the immensity of space, have attained that advanced condition in their planetary
  being, I have no doubt, whatever. </p>
<p> And that this ship which Mr. Wallace and others saw, was a vessel from Venus, Mercury, or the planet Mars, on a
  visit of pleasure or exploration, or some other cause; I myself, with the evidence at hand, that I can bring to bear
  on it, have no more doubt of, than I have of the fact of my own existence. This, mind, was no phantom that disappeared
  in a twinkling, as all phantoms do disappear, but this aerial ship was guided, propelled and steered through the
  atmosphere with the most scientific system and regularity, at about six miles an hour, though, doubtless, from the
  appearance of her machinery, she was capable of going thousands of miles an hour, and who knows but ten thousand miles
  an hour. What can be more wonderful as an illustration, than the Electric Telegraph to connect the old world with the
  new. And why then, may not the scientific geniuses of other planets have done as much as ours have? </p>
<p> Besides this, if I had room, I could draw an argument from the electrical condition of the media existing between
  the planets, to show that a body once in motion at a given distance from a planetary body in space, will move with
  nearly the speed of electricity till it meets again the resisting media, or atmosphere of another planet or body in
  space. That all of this knowledge, and a million times more, may be known to some of the exalted beings of other
  planets in space, I have no doubt. But as I was saying, this aerial ship moved directly off from the earth, and
  remained in sight, till by distance she was lost to the view. The foregoing is my firm and decided conclusion and
  belief in this matter." </p>
