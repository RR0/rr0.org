    Visited Scene </p>
    <p>Descriptive Details of Chester Hull Were So Cleverly Presented That Metropolitan Papers Accepted Story</p>
    <p>In 1859 Chester Hall, Jr., then the city editor of the "Palladium" cleverly, although questionably, perpetrated a
      hoax upon the newspaper's readers, doubtedly intended, as the editor later registed, purely as a joke, when he
      described in the most fascinating and graphic story the supfused visit of a meteor or "aerolite" to the remote
      Redfield-Boylston area. So well done was the job, and the descriptions given in the article so realisticly
      presented in language scientificly plausible that the New York Buffalo, Utica and other large city newspapers
      republished in their own columns the "dispatches" which Hull had represented as having come from the "Palladium's"
      own "reliable" correspondent in Boylston, crediting them to the "Palladium", however.</p>
    <p>On the face of the dispatches carried by the "Palladium" during the first one of three duty in which the story
      was being printed in the newspaper, with daily addition of new details which appeared scientificly plausible, the
      Regents of the University of the State of New York were reported by the "Rome Sentinel" as having dispatched a
      scientist to study the phenomena in the locale where it existed and to report back to the Regents his
      findings.</p>
    <p>A large party of scientists also gathered at Utica, and made the sing jaunt to Boylston to visit the home of the
      supposed bursting of the aerolite only to find in the fragments which had been planted here, by Hull of some of
      his agents, some bits of melted iron-scrap which had been sent to the home after having been picked up from the
      rejected scrap at the Vulcan Iron Works in Oswego. Even the most casual study of the fragments and the other
      supposed evidences of the visit of the meteor, soon convinced the scientists that the entire story was a fake, and
      that the supposed meteoric remains had been "planted" there with so little skill as to leave no doubt at first
      glance that they were but parts of a gigantic hoax. The truth of this matter Hull at once admitted, stating that
      he had planned the entire incident only as a "joke" and not with the intent of deceiving any one permanently.</p>
    <p>Evidently many people in Oswego enjoyed the joke at the time as we find the barroom owners advertising that
      specimens of the "aerolite" taken from local foundries were on exhibition at their respective establishments and
      otherwise making light and hun of the matter of Hull's hoax.</p>
    <h2>Hull's Later Career</h2>
    <p>Chester Hull, the prepetrator of the hoax, had seen years of experience as a newspaperman in Oswego and elsewhere
      before he attempted the hoax. He was a swon of education, and he delved reply into the lore of meteors before
      launching his story. He had been chosen as the first librarian of the Gerrit Smith Public Library a number of
      years earlier and he had been the author of a published history of early Oswego which possessed merits. Even the
      outcome of the local hoax and the unfavorable comment that its perpetration brought from many sources, along with
      the plaudits which came from admiting personal cronies, had no apparent effect in perpending him to change his
      ways in regard to such matters: for some years later he left Oswego and went to the Pacific Coast where he became
      a correspondent for the "New York World".</p>
    <p>"From San Francisco Hull sent many wonderful stories over the telegraph wires to newpapers back east," wrote many
      years later Fred A. Dixon who had been one of his newspapers associates in Oswego. "There was one story of an
      artic expedition", continued Mr. Dixon, "represented as being projected by Monsieur Louis Tavy, who, as it turned
      out, never saw any ice except in the bottom of a glass in San Francisco bars. The stories of the expedition made
      interesting reading for a time for the more gullible."</p>
    <p>Hull never returned to Oswego to reside. He had left the "Palladium" some time after the Boylston meteor hoax and
      later joined the staff of the "Advertiser and Times". He had been succeeded as city editor of the latter paper by
      Chester S. Lord who was to rise highter in his chosen profession, perhaps, than any other newpaper worker whom the
      county has produced.</p>
    <p>There follow in Chronological order as they appeared in the "Palladium", first the stories of the visit of the
      "aerolite" as they appeared, and later the comments of the "Commercial Advertiser" and other newspapers upon the
      perpetration of the haox, once that it had been finally revealed as such:</p>
    <p>GREAT NATURAL PHENOMENON</p>
    <p>Descent Of An Immense Meteoric Body in Oswego County ! !</p>
    <p>INTENSE EXCITEMENT IN THE COUNTRY</p>
    <p>(Palladium?June 15, 1859)</p>
    <p>On Wednesday (yesterday) morning the inhabitants of the towns of Boylston and Redfield in this county, were
      startled by the occurance of a most remarkable phenomenon?the descent from the heavens of an immense meteoric
      mass. The body struck the earth between the hours of 3 and 4 a. m. with a crash that was truly terrific, and the
      shock was sensibly felt and people aroused from their sleep at a distance five miles from the scene.</p>
    <p>The body fell upon the farm of Horace Sanger, situated on the line of Boylston and Redfield, striking in a meadow
      and partially on the highway. It is estimated by our informant that it covered about half an acre of the land. The
      earth was torn up in a terrible manner and large fragments were thrown two-thirds of a mile.</p>
    <p>THe mass is very irregular in shape and rises at some points to 60 and 80 feet in height. There is supposed to be
      imbedded in the earth as many feet. The surface generally has the appearance of iron ore.</p>
    <p>THe excitement occasioned by the event among the inhabitants was intense and the crash was said to be terrific.
      Many supposed the the final winding up of terrestrial affairs had arrived.</p>
    <p>(We are indebted to our friend, E. S. Putnam, Esq., of Boylston, for his effort to furnish us with the
      particulars of the event.)</p>
    <p>THE METEORIC PHENOMENON</p>
    <p>Further Particulars</p>
    <p>(Correspondence of the Palladium)</p>
    <p>Boylston?Thursday, June 16</p>
    <p>On the receipt of your dispatch, at Pulaski, I started at once for Boylston, to inspect in person the scene of
      the startling phenomenon of Wednesday.</p>
    <p>You probably have received greatly exaggerated reports before this of the occurence as the whole neighborhood, as
      in such cases, is full of the most distorted versions, I at once proceeded to the farm of Mr. SAnger where the
      aerolite fell and collected the following facts which are as nearly the truth as the excitement which prevailed in
      the immense crowd there would permit and will probably be found correct enough short or anything of a strict
      scientific investigation:</p>
    <p>Mr. Hadley's Statement</p>
    <p>(Palladium?June 17, 1859)</p>
    <p>The atmosphere had been very oppressive during Tuesday and especially in the evening?something similar I have
      once experienced before a toronado which I witnessed in the West Indies in 1836. I was awakened about 3 o'clock on
      Wednesday morning by the room in which I slept being filled with light, and immediately heard a rushing sound like
      the coming on of a great wind. This lasted but a few seconds after I was awakened when an explosion followed of
      which I can give no description?it was terrific. The whole house shook as if 100 cannon had been fired under the
      windows. Quite a number of pains of glass were broken out of the windows and the plastering of the room I was in
      came rumbling about me. The light, which was so bright that I could planely see every object in the room, was at
      once extinguished.The window of my room is on the opposite side of the house from the place where the meteor fell
      so that I could only judge its direction. The light seemed to come from some body moving very rapidly and from
      South to North and seemed to increase rapidly during the brief space that preceded the explosion. I at once
      started in the direction of the explosion but was unable to find the spot and returned. The spot where the body
      fell is about one mile from my house.</p>
    <p>This is the substance of observation of all who were near the spot.</p>
    <p>The facts at the time of the circumstances preceeding the fall of the aerolite I have from Mr. James Hadley, an
      intelligent and respectable citizen of the town of Redfield, who resides about one mile from the scene, and the
      rest is from personal observation.</p>
    <p>Many were awakened by the shock at a distance of five miles and until the truth was ascertained, thought an
      earthquake had occured.</p>
    <p>The aerolite struck the earth in some timberland belonging to Mr. Sanger. We believe Mr. Hadley's dwelling to be
      the nearest. It seemed to have been a spherical body as near as we can judge by the fragments that remained. Its
      course was from Southwest to Northeast and descended at an angle of about thirty degrees from the horizon which is
      proved by its track through the heavy hemlock trees before it touched the earth. The trees were cut through as a
      cannon ball would cut through a hedge leaving a huge track. The earth was torn up for several rods and the huge
      trees are splintered and piled up like brush. One large hemlock four feet in diameter near whose roots the meteor
      struck was thrown bodily for eighty yards cracking the surrounding trees like pipe sterns. Fragments of a huge
      sandstone boulder which lay in its course were thrown in all directions. One weighing one-half ton was found
      three-quarters of a mile away.</p>
    <p>The aerolite seemed to have been formed of a nucleus of a crystalized substance of a semi vitreous character but
      harder than quartz ... </p>
