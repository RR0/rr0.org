<p>A correspondent of the <i lang="en">National Intelligencer</i> describes a phenomenon witnessed in Washington : On
  Thursday last, the 21st July, at half past nine o'clock, P. M., a remarkable phenomenon was noticed by several persons
  in this city. Attention was first drawn to a light not like that of a flash of lightning, but increasing by degrees,
  though rapidly in intensity, suggesting the idea of a piece of firework. The whole lasted but for two or three
  seconds, and yet was sufficient to render all objects distinctly visible as if the full moon were rising ; but the
  light was of a bluish tint and softened by the masse of clouds which covered the heavens at that moment. Those who
  were placed facing the north saw only the illumoination of surrounding objects ; but on turning southward the light
  shining through the coulds was distinctly seen. In all probability this was a meteor passing from west to east or from
  east to west. The object of inserting this notice is to draw attention to the fact in order that observations at
  distant points may be obtained. If any such have been made they should be transmitted to the Secretary of the
  Simthsonian Institution, for, from data so furnished, the direction and velocity of the meteor may be approximately
  obtained, although the body itself was not seen. </p>
