<p>The New Haven <i>Palladium</i>, of the 7th, says: "Another very brilliant meteor was seen on Monday, August 6, by
  persons in Branford. Just at sunset, the sky being clear, a fire-ball like a star was observed near the south-eastern
  horizon, sailing around slowly and gradually through the north-eastern quarter of the heavens, and a few degrees above
  the horizon and disappearing some degrees west of north. The motion was very slow, and the time of the flight may have
  been from 20 to 30 seconds. Had this phenomenon occured after dark, we should doubtless have seen a meteor rivaling in
  splendor and general glory the famous one of July 20. We hope to hear from our Northern neighbors more about this
  celestial stranger. Perhaps this is one of the outsiders of the shooting stars expected on the mornings of the 9th and
  10th instants."</p>
<p>The Rochester <i>Union</i> of the same date says: "Last evening another brilliant and beautiful meteor was seen. The
  hour is stated at from 7:15 to 7:25. It is thus described: Course from southeast to northwest?length about two
  feet?color of ball, clear white?color of tail, blueish white?the latter appeared to be a continuous flame with a
  waving movement. It was about midway between the zenith and horizon, and was twelve seconds in passing over."</p>
<p>The same phenomenon was observed at Philadelphia. There its elevation was about twenty-five degrees above the western
  horizon, and its course, as it appeared to the observers, was north, a little west. Its rate of speed was about the
  same as that of the great meteor of the 20th ult. </p>
