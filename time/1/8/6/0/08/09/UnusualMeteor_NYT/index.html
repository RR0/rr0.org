    </tr></table><p>The New Haven <em>Palladium</em>, of the 7th, says: "Another very brilliant meteor was seen on
    Monday, August 6, by persons in Branford. Just at sunset, the sky being clear, a fire-ball like a star was observed
    near the south-eastern horizon, sailing around slowly and gradually through the north-eastern quarter of the
    heavens, and a few degrees above the horizon and disappearing some degrees west of north. The motion was very slow,
    and the time of the flight may have been from 20 to 30 seconds. Had this phenomenon occured after dark, we should
    doubtless have seen a meteor rivaling in splendor and general glory the famous one of July 20. We hope to hear from
    our Northern neighbors more about this celestial stranger. Perhaps this is one of the outsiders of the shooting
    stars expected on the mornings of the 9th and 10th instants."</p>
    <p>The Rochester <em>Union</em> of the same date says: "Last evening another brilliant and beautiful meteor was
      seen. The hour is stated at from 7:15 to 7:25. It is thus described: Course from southeast to northwest?length
      about two feet?color of ball, clear white?color of tail, blueish white?the latter appeared to be a continuous
      flame with a waving movement. It was about midway between the zenith and horizon, and was twelve seconds in
      passing over."</p>
    <p>The same phenomenon was observed at Philadelphia. There its elevation was about twenty-five degrees above the
      western horizon, and its course, as it appeared to the observers, was north, a little west. Its rate of speed was
      about the same as that of the great meteor of the 20th ult. </p>
