<p>The <span class="place">Cleveland, Ohio</span>, Herald says that a tremendous thunder shower passed over that city on
  the night of the 3d inst., and adds :-- "Between three and four o'clock next morning the appearance of a vessel on
  fire was seen far out on the lake. Some persons thought they could distinguish the sails. During a heavy gust of wind
  the light disappeared. Such appearances are not unfrequent on the lake, and the more experienced men along the dock
  think there has been no vessel burnt."</p>
