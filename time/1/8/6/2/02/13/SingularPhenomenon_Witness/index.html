<p>Mr. G. W. Kinney, of Barnston, communicates to the Stanstead <i>Journal</i> the following statement of an
  extraordinary appearance on the west side of a small lake in that Township. It was evidently what is termed a <em>mirage</em>,
  but the question is, where was the army thus reflected? Were they British troops on their way from Halifax to Canada?
  -- "Two weeks ago to-day in the morning, I discovered that the mountains on the west side of the lake looked very
  different from what they usually do. It came to my mind what I had heard had been seen a few days before this in the
  same place. I stopped and saw, apparently, a train of cars, four in number; presently they changed their position and
  came together, forming into one body, one side of which was perpendicular to a great height; and then another familiar
  form made its appearance at a short distance, I then saw as it looked to me, an army of men advance towards each other
  and then disappeared; it then passed away into some different position. I then saw a ship come into sight, turn
  broadside to the apparent army of men, and thus they appeared and disappeared for six hours, passing before my eyes
  like a splendid panorama. There were no clouds to be seen in the sky that day in that direction, or any fog. This is
  no idle dream or fancy, and I can substantiate it with the testimony of a very good number of people, who were with me
  in the morning, and saw the same sight.</p>
