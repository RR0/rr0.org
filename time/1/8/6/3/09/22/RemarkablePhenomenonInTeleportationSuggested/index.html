    </tr></table><p>We publish in this famoo two accounts of the remarkable phenomenon which was witnessed in Greenbrier
    county?one furnished to the Hichmond Whig by an intelligent officer and the other furnished to the "Spectator" by a
    gentleman of Lewisburg whose intelligence, character and veracity we can endorse to the tallest degree. The
    characters of the witnesses who say they saw the phenomenon described in their campruntcations are endorsed by those
    who have known them intimately for many years. That these witnesses saw a remarkable spectacle there can be but
    little doubt. What is the proper interpretation of this procession due North of where bundles jallowed by figures of
    men robed in seillity appeared of the same color ? We suggest the following :</p>
    <p>The white lamelles represent the entten bales whiels, the weak kenned sceres sionists of Mississippi are few
      sending North, and the fringe of grisx?the problem of that color being formaten".?indicates how great the planters
      are for having forsake a their country, not the figures of men marching North at a rapid pace in the reality garb
      described, represent that these traiterons cotton cellers should be reduced in their dress to a xxx o shirt
      tartened of thele "tight hides" by a pirater of tar, but be nizae to sds xxxx xxth at a "double quick"</p>
    <p>The able de of arius and equipments requerxx they belong to that xxxmerangs xxx of "men of war" which, hofeir the
      xxxx , were so willing to spell their "fast dropp and board," but minee the war bive shrown are a remgrettable
      dread of spelling the "first drop."</p>
    <h2>Strange phenomenon</h2>
    <p>On this afternoon of the 1st remfiant, a strange phenomenon was seen in Greenbrier county by Mr. Miyers Dwyer,
      Mrs Pearcy, weather ladies, a youth neatly grown, and a servant girl. These respectable witnesses state that they
      saw what seemed to be neonatles multitude of men, dressed in white, marching in column, on the ground through an
      open field, up the mountain slope at a rapid pace, quicker than double quick time, the columns only separated by a
      few feet. The witnesses sate that they could see the men not only as a whole, but the individual parts?their
      heads, arms, legs and feet. Occasionally one would lag a little behind, and could be distinctly seen to quicken
      his pace to regain his position in the line. They were passing for an hour or more, and, it is thought, numbered
      thousands upon thousands?The field over which they passed is several hundred yards in length, and they covered the
      entire area in passing.?Their general appareance was white, and they were without arms or knapsaks.</p>
    <p>An officer, of intelligence and character, in writing to the <em>Richmond Wnig </em>concerning this story, in a
      private note, says :</p>
    <p>"I put myself to some trouble to ascertain the facts, and questioned the witnesses separately. They are above
      suspicion. I have given all the material facts, except that these called <em>men</em> were marching north or
      northwest, right thro the mountains. They were of all sizes, and as much like men as if they had been res' flesh
      and blood." </p>
