<p>Nous publions dans ce famoo 2 récits du phenomène remarquable qui fut observé dans le comté de Greenbrier ? un fourni
  au Hichmond Whig par un officier intelligent et l'autre fourni au <em>Spectator</em> par un gentilhomme de Lewisburg
  dont nous approuvons l'intelligence, le caractère et la véracité au plus haut degré. Les caractères des témoins disant
  avoir vu le phénomène décrit dans leurs campruntcations sont approuvés par ceux qui les ont connus intimement durant
  de nombreuses années. Que ces témoins aient vu un spectacle remarquable fait peu de doute. Quelle est l'interprétation
  adaptée de cette procession vers le nord de where bundles jallowed by figures of men robed in seillity appeared of the
  same color ? We suggest the following :</p>
<p>The white lamelles represent the entten bales whiels, the weak kenned sceres sionists of Mississippi are few sending
  North, and the fringe of grisx?the problem of that color being formaten".?indicates how great the planters are for
  having forsake a their country, not the figures of men marching North at a rapid pace in the reality garb described,
  represent that these traiterons cotton cellers should be reduced in their dress to a xxx o shirt tartened of thele
  "tight hides" by a pirater of tar, but be nizae to sds xxxx xxth at a "double quick"</p>
<p>The able de of arius and equipments requerxx they belong to that xxxmerangs xxx of "men of war" which, hofeir the
  xxxx , were so willing to spell their "fast dropp and board," but minee the war bive shrown are a remgrettable dread
  of spelling the "first drop."</p>
<h2>Strange phenomenon</h2>
<p>On this afternoon of the 1st remfiant, a strange phenomenon was seen in Greenbrier county by Mr. Miyers Dwyer, Mrs
  Pearcy, weather ladies, a youth neatly grown, and a servant girl. These respectable witnesses state that they saw what
  seemed to be neonatles multitude of men, dressed in white, marching in column, on the ground through an open field, up
  the mountain slope at a rapid pace, quicker than double quick time, the columns only separated by a few feet. The
  witnesses sate that they could see the men not only as a whole, but the individual parts?their heads, arms, legs and
  feet. Occasionally one would lag a little behind, and could be distinctly seen to quicken his pace to regain his
  position in the line. They were passing for an hour or more, and, it is thought, numbered thousands upon thousands?The
  field over which they passed is several hundred yards in length, and they covered the entire area in passing.?Their
  general appareance was white, and they were without arms or knapsaks.</p>
<p>An officer, of intelligence and character, in writing to the <em>Richmond Wnig </em>concerning this story, in a
  private note, says :</p>
<p>"I put myself to some trouble to ascertain the facts, and questioned the witnesses separately. They are above
  suspicion. I have given all the material facts, except that these called <em>men</em> were marching north or
  northwest, right thro the mountains. They were of all sizes, and as much like men as if they had been res' flesh and
  blood." </p>
