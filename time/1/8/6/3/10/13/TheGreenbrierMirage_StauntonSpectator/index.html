    </tr></table><p>A lady in Monroe co. furnishes the following explanation of the phenomenon recently witnessed in
    Greenbrier.</p>
    <p>It is well known that an army of Yankees, N. Y. eral thousand in number, have an ecampment at Fayette Court
      House, in these county of Fayette, which adjoins Greebrier county. At the very hour mentioned, namely, three
      o'clock, P. M., they are daily subjected to a drill, in which they go through all their various military
      exercices. It is not probable &amp; more than probable that these serial soldiers were produced by the same cause
      which produce the spectre of the Brochen, and other similar apparitions. That string to the accidental
      condensation of some atmospheric vapors at the precise time they were drifting, on the evening particularly
      specified?atmospherical spectacle was formed by the hand of nature in the mountagnous locality of Mr. Piercy's
      residence, and that the figures seen by Mr. P's tamnly were the images of this body of Yankees, who were then
      marching in regular order, and reflected in the air in their natural color and forms. </p>
