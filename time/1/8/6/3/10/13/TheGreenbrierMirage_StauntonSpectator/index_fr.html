<p>Une dame à Monroe co. fournit l'explication suivante du phénomène récemment observé à Greenbrier.</p>
<p>Il est bien connu qu'une armée de Yankees, N. Y. eral thousand in number, have an ecampment at Fayette Court House,
  in these county of Fayette, which adjoins Greebrier county. At the very hour mentioned, namely, three o'clock, P. M.,
  they are daily subjected to a drill, in which they go through all their various military exercices. It is not probable
  &amp; more than probable that these serial soldiers were produced by the same cause which produce the spectre of the
  Brochen, and other similar apparitions. That string to the accidental condensation of some atmospheric vapors at the
  precise time they were drifting, on the evening particularly specified?atmospherical spectacle was formed by the hand
  of nature in the mountagnous locality of Mr. Piercy's residence, and that the figures seen by Mr. P's tamnly were the
  images of this body of Yankees, who were then marching in regular order, and reflected in the air in their natural
  color and forms. </p>
