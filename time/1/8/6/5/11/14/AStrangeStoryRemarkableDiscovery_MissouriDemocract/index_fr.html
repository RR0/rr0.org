<p>M. James Lumley, un vieux trappeur des Montagnes Rocheuses, qui s'était arrêté à la Maison Everett pendant plusieurs
  jours, nous fait une déclaration particulièrement remarquable, une qui, si elle est authentifiée, produira la plus
  grande excitation dans le monde scientifique.</p>
<p> Mr. Lumley states that about the middle of last September, he was engaged in trapping in the mountains about
  seventy-five or one hundred miles above the Great Falls of the Upper Missouri, and in the neighborhood of what is
  known as Cadotte Pass. Just after sunset one evening, he beheld a bright luminous body in the heavens, which moved
  with great rapidity in an easterly direction. It was plainly visible for at least five seconds, when it suddenly
  separated into particles, resembling, as Mr. Lumley describes it, the bursting of a sky-rocket in the air. A few
  minutes later, he heard a heavy explosion, which jarred the earth very perceptibly, and this was shortly after
  followed by a rushing sound, like a tornado sweeping through the forest. A strong wind sprang up about the same time,
  but suddenly subsided. The air was also filled with a peculiar odor of a sulphurous character. </p>
<p>These incidents would have made a slight impression on the mind of Mr. Lumley, but for the fact that on the ensuing
  day he discovered, at the distance of about two miles from his camping place, that, as far as he could see in either
  direction a path had been cut through the forest, several rods wide-giant trees uprooted or broken off near the
  ground- the tops of hills shaved off and the earth plowed up in many places. Great and widespread havoc was everywhere
  visible. Following up this track of desolation, he soon ascertained the cause of it in the shape of an immense stone
  driven into the side of a mountain. An examination of this stone, or so much of it as was visible, showed that it was
  divided into compartments that in various places it was carved with curious hieroglyphics. More than this, Mr. Lumley
  also discovered fragments of a substance resembling glass, and here and there dark stains, as though caused by a
  liquid. He is confident that the hieroglyphics are the work of human hands, and that the stone itself, although but a
  fragment of an immense body, must have been used for some purpose by animated beings.</p>
<p>Strange as this story appears, Mr. Lumley relates it with so much sincerity that we are forced to accept it as true.
  It is evident that the stone which he discovered, was a fragment of the meteor which was visible in this section in
  September last. It will be remembered that it was seen in Leavenworth, Galena and in this city by Col. Bonneville. At
  Leavenworth it was seen to separate into particles or explode. </p>
<p>Astronomers have long held that it is probable that the heavenly bodies are inhabited -- even the comets -- and it
  may be that the meteors are also. Possibly, meteors could be used as a means of conveyance by the inhabitants of other
  planets, in exploring space, and it may be that hereafter some future Columbus, from Mercury or Uranus, may land on
  this planet by means of a meteoric conveyance, and take full possession thereof -- as did the Spanish navigators of
  the New World in 1492, and eventually drive what is known as the "human race" into a condition of the most abject
  servitude. It has always been a favorite theory with many that there must be a race superior to us, and this may at
  some future time be demonstrated in the manner we have indicated.</p>
