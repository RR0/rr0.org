<h2>Zetetic Astronomy</h2>
<p>The term "zetetic" is derived from the Greek verb <em>zeteo</em> ; which means to search or examine; to proceed only
  by inquiry; to take nothing for granted, but to trace phenomena to their immediate and demonstrable causes. It is here
  used in contradistinction from the word "theoretic," the meaning of which is, speculative--imaginary--not
  tangible,--scheming, but not proving.</p>
<p>None can doubt that by making special experiments and collecting manifest and undeniable facts, arranging them in
  logical order, and observing what is naturally and fairly deducible therefrom, the result must be more consistent and
  satisfactory than the contrary method of framing a theory or system--assuming the existence and operation of causes
  for which there is no direct evidence, and which is only be "admitted for the sake of argument," and for the purpose
  of giving an apparent and plausible, but not necessarily truthful explanation of phenomena. All theories are of this
  character. <q>Supposing instead of inquiring, imagining systems instead of learning from observation and experience
    the true constitution of things. Speculative men, by the force of genius may invent systems that will perhaps be
    greatly admired for a time; these, however, are phantoms which the force of truth will sooner or later dispel; and
    while we are pleased with the deceit, true philosophy, with all the arts and improvements that depend upon it,
    suffers. The real state of things escapes our observation ; or, if it presents itself to us, we are apt either to
    reject it wholly as fiction, or, by new efforts of a vain ingenuity to interweave it with our own conceits, and
    labour to make it tally with our favourite schemes. Thus, by blending together parts so ill-suited, the whole comes
    forth an absurd composition of truth and error. * * These have not done near so much harm as that pridefand ambition
    which has led philosophers to think it beneath them to offer anything less to the world than a complete and finished
    system of nature ; and, in order to obtain this at once, to take the liberty of inventing certain principles and
    hypotheses, from which they pretend to explain all her mysteries.</q> <span class="source">"An Account of Sir Isaac Newton's Discoveries." By Professor Maclaurin, M.A., F.R.S., of the Chair of Mathematics in the University of Edinburgh. </span>
</p>
<p><q>Theories are thing of uncertain mode. They depend, in a great measure, upon the humour and caprice of an age,
  which is sometimes in love with one, and sometimes with another.</q></p>
<p>The system of Copernicus was admitted by its author to be merely an assumption, temporary and incapable of
  demonstration. The following are his words:--<q>It is not necessary that hypotheses should be true, or even probable ;
    it is sufficient that they lead to results of calculation which agree with calculations. * * Neither let any one, so
    far as hypotheses are concerned, expect anything certain from astronomy ; since that science can afford nothing of
    the kind; lest, in case he should adopt for truth things feigned for another purpose, he should leave this study
    more foolish than he came. * * The hypothesis of the terrestrial motion was nothing but an hypothesis, valuable only
    so far as it explained phenomena, and not considered with reference to absolute truth or falsehood.</q></p>
<p>The Newtonian and all other "views" or "systems" are little better than the "hypothesis of the terrestrial motion "
  of Copernicus. The foundations or premises are always unproved ; no proof is ever attempted ; the necessity for it is
  denied; it is considered sufficient that the assumptions shall <em>seem</em> to explain the phenomena selected. In
  this way it is that one theory supplants another; that system gives way to system as one failure after another compels
  opinions to change. This will ever be so; there will always exist in the mind a degree of uncertainty ; a disposition
  to look upon philosophy as a vain pretension; a something almost antagonistic to the highest aspirations in which
  humanity can indulge, unless the practice of theorising be given up, and the method of simple inquiry, the " zetetic "
  process be adopted . " Nature speaks to us in a peculiar language; in the language of phenomena, she answers at all
  times the questions which are put to her; and such questions are experiments." <span class="source">"Liebig's Agricultural Chemistry," p. 39. </span>Not
  experiments only which corroborate what has previously been <em>assumed</em> to be true; but experiments in every form
  bearing on the subject of inquiry, before a conclusion is drawn or premises affirmed.</p>
<p>We have an excellent example of zetetic reasoning in an arithmetical operation; more especially so in what is called
  the "Golden Rule," or the "Rule-of-Three." If one hundred weight of any article is worth a given sum, what will some
  other weight of that article be worth ? The separate figures may be considered as the elements or facts of the inquiry
  ; the placing and working of these as the logical arrangement; and the quotient or answer as the fair and natural
  deduction. Hence, in every zetetic process, the conclusion arrived at is essentially a quotient, which, if the details
  be correct, must, of necessity, be true beyond the reach or power of contradiction. </p>
<p>We have another example of the "Zetetic" process in our Courts of Justice. A prisoner is placed at the bar; evidence
  for and against him is advanced; it is carefully arranged and patiently considered; and only such a verdict given as
  could not in justice be avoided. Society would not tolerate any other procedure ; it would brand with infamy whoever
  should assume a prisoner to be guilty, and prohibit all evidence but such as would corroborate the assumption. Yet
  such is the character of theoretical philosophy! </p>
<p>The zetetic process is also the natural method of investigation; nature herself teaches it; it is her own continual
  suggestion; children invariably seek information by asking questions, by earnestly inquiring from those around them.
  Fearlessly, anxiously, and without the slightest regard to consequences, question after question, in rapid and
  exciting succession will often proceed from a child, until the most profound in learning and philosophy will feel
  puzzled to reply. If then both nature and justice, as well as the common sense and practical experience of mankind
  demand, and will not be content with less or other than the zetetic process, why should it be ignored and violated by
  the learned in philosophy? Let the practice of theorising be cast aside as one fatal to the full development of truth;
  oppressive to the reasoning power; and in every sense inimical to the progress and permanent improvement of the human
  race.</p>
<p>If then we adopt the zetetic process to ascertain the true figure and condition of the Earth, we shall find that
  instead of its being a globe, and moving in space, it is the directly contrary—A Plane ; without motion, and
  unaccompanied by anything in the Firmament analogous to itself.</p>
<p>If the Earth is a globe, and 25,000 miles in circumference, the surface of all standing water must have a certain
  degree of convexity—every part must be an arc of a circle, curvating from the summit at the rate of 8 inches per mile
  multiplied by the square of the distance. That this may be sufficiently understood, the following quotation is given
  from the <em>Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>, art. "Levelling." "If a line which crosses the plumb-line at right angles
  be continued for any considerable length it will rise above the Earth's surface (the Earth being globular); and this
  rising will be as the square of the distance to which the said right line is produced; that is to say, it is raised
  eight inches very nearly above the Earth's surface at one mile's distance ; four times as much, or 32 inches, at the
  distance of two miles; nine times as much, or 72 inches, at the distance of three miles. This is owing to the globular
  figure of the Earth, and this rising is the difference between the true and apparent levels; the curve of the Earth
  being the true level, and the tangent to it the apparent level. So soon does the difference between the true and
  apparent levels become perceptible that it is necessary to make an allowance for it if the distance betwixt the two
  stations exceeds two chains. </p>
<p>Let B. D. be a small portion of the Earth's circumference, whose centre of curvature is A. and consequently all the
  points of this arc will be on a level But a tangent B. C. meeting the vertical line A. D. in C. will be the
  apparent</p>
