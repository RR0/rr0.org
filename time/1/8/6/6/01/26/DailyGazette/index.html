<p>The Cincinnati Gazette says considerable excitement exists in the neighborhood of Stepping Stone Landing on account
  of a supposed apparition that makes its appearance in that vicinity. It is said to assume a variety of shapes &ndash;
  at times flourishing a dagger, and then appearing as a horse with a human head. The crew of the Clermont and Magnolia
  have both been favored with a sight at this phenomenon, which[,] unlike most of its family, appears by daylight.</p>
