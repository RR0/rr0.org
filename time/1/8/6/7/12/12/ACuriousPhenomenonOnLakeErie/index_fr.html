<blockquote>
  <p>La déclaration qu'un vaisseau a été vu brûlant au large de Erie la nuit de mardi est corroborée par plusieurs
    personnes vivant sur les montagnes au sud de la ville, qui disent l'avoir vu.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Le mardi soir mentionné, le 29 octobre, vers 19 h, mon attention fut attirée par un membre de ma famille vers une
  lumière brillante sur le lac, ayant tout à fait l'apparence d'un vaisseau en feu. Bringing several objects into range,
  j'ai regardé la lumière pendant un moment pour m'assurer de voir s'il y avait un quelconque mouvement perceptible.</p>
<p>Le vent soufflait fort à ce moment en bas au lac et un vaisseau aurait naturellement dérivé rapidement to leeward, at
  all events as soon as the propelling power should be interfered with the fire. No motion, however, in any direction
  was to be discovered, and at once concluded that it was nothing more than the "mysterious light," which for many years
  past, at longer or shorter intervals, has been seen by the inhabitants at this point on the lake shore. The light has
  made its appearance generally, if not always, in the fall of the year, and usually in the month of November, and
  almost always during or immediately after a heavy blow from the southwest. The most brilliant exhibition of the light
  I have ever seen was during the night of the 24th or 25th, as nearly as I can recollect, of November, 1852. It had
  been my fortune to witness the burning of the steamer Erie, near Silver Creek, several years before, and the
  resemblance which this light bore to that of the burning steamer was so strong that I confidently expected the arrival
  of the boats from the wreck during the night. Others with myself watched the light for perhaps two hours, and with the
  aid of a good night-glass obtained what seemed to be a very distinct view of the burning vessel.</p>
<p>The object appeared to be some 200 or more feet in length upon the water, and about as high above the water as an
  upper cabin steamer, such as was in use upon the Lake twenty years ago. At times the flames would start up in spires
  or sheets of light, then away from side to side, and then die away, precisely as would be the case with a large fire
  exposed to a strong wind; and two or three times there was the appearance of a cloud of sparks, as if some portion of
  the upper works had fallen into the burning mass below. The sky and water were beautifullly irradiated by the light
  during its great brilliancy.The light gradually subsided, with occasional flashes until it disappeared altogether. The
  light of Tuesday evening, although very brilliant for a time, was not nearly so brilliant nor of so long duration as
  that of 1852.</p>
<p>I am told that this light was seen by mariners on the lakes as long as fifty years ago, but I am not aware that it
  has ever been made the subject of philosophical speculation or investigation, or, in fact, has ever obtained the
  notoriety of a newspaper paragraph before. The only theory approaching plausibility I have heard is that the shifting
  of the sands caused by the continued and heavy winds of autumn has opened some crevices or seams in the rock of the
  lake bottom through which gas escapes, and that this gas, owing to some peculiar condition of the atmosphere with
  which it comes in contact, becomes luminous, or perhaps ignited, and burning with a positive flame. That there are
  what are called "gas springs" in the water along this portion of the lake shore is a well-known fact, and that highly
  inflammable gas in large quantities exist at a comparatively shallow depth on the shore, has been sufficiently proved
  by the boring of wells at different points, as at Erie, Walnut Creek, and Lock Haven, and by natural springs at
  Westfield and Fredonia.</p>
<p>But whatever the cause, the light is a curious fact, and well worthy the attention of those interested in the
  investigation of the phenomenon of nature.</p>
