    <blockquote>
      <p><q>La déclaration qu'un vaisseau a été vu brûlant au large de Erie la nuit de mardi est corroborée par
        plusieurs personnes vivant sur les montagnes au sud de la ville, qui disent l'avoir vu.</q></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Le mardi soir mentionné, le 29 octobre, vers 19 h, mon attention fut attirée par un membre de ma famille vers une
      lumière brillante sur le lac, ayant tout à fait l'apparence d'un vaisseau en feu. Bringing several objects into
      range, j'ai regardé la lumière pendant un moment pour m'assurer de voir s'il y avait un quelconque mouvement
      perceptible.</p>
    <p>Le vent soufflait fort à ce moment en bas au lac et un vaisseau aurait naturellement dérivé rapidement to
      leeward, at all events as soon as the propelling power should be interfered with the fire. No motion, however, in
      any direction was to be discovered, and at once concluded that it was nothing more than the "mysterious light,"
      which for many years past, at longer or shorter intervals, has been seen by the inhabitants at this point on the
      lake shore. The light has made its appearance generally, if not always, in the fall of the year, and usually in
      the month of November, and almost always during or immediately after a heavy blow from the southwest. The most
      brilliant exhibition of the light I have ever seen was during the night of the 24th or 25th, as nearly as I can
      recollect, of November, 1852. It had been my fortune to witness the burning of the steamer Erie, near Silver
      Creek, several years before, and the resemblance which this light bore to that of the burning steamer was so
      strong that I confidently expected the arrival of the boats from the wreck during the night. Others with myself
      watched the light for perhaps two hours, and with the aid of a good night-glass obtained what seemed to be a very
      distinct view of the burning vessel.</p>
    <p>The object appeared to be some 200 or more feet in length upon the water, and about as high above the water as an
      upper cabin steamer, such as was in use upon the Lake twenty years ago. At times the flames would start up in
      spires or sheets of light, then away from side to side, and then die away, precisely as would be the case with a
      large fire exposed to a strong wind; and two or three times there was the appearance of a cloud of sparks, as if
      some portion of the upper works had fallen into the burning mass below. The sky and water were beautifullly
      irradiated by the light during its great brilliancy.The light gradually subsided, with occasional flashes until it
      disappeared altogether. The light of Tuesday evening, although very brilliant for a time, was not nearly so
      brilliant nor of so long duration as that of 1852.</p>
    <p>I am told that this light was seen by mariners on the lakes as long as fifty years ago, but I am not aware that
      it has ever been made the subject of philosophical speculation or investigation, or, in fact, has ever obtained
      the notoriety of a newspaper paragraph before. The only theory approaching plausibility I have heard is that the
      shifting of the sands caused by the continued and heavy winds of autumn has opened some crevices or seams in the
      rock of the lake bottom through which gas escapes, and that this gas, owing to some peculiar condition of the
      atmosphere with which it comes in contact, becomes luminous, or perhaps ignited, and burning with a positive
      flame. That there are what are called "gas springs" in the water along this portion of the lake shore is a
      well-known fact, and that highly inflammable gas in large quantities exist at a comparatively shallow depth on the
      shore, has been sufficiently proved by the boring of wells at different points, as at Erie, Walnut Creek, and Lock
      Haven, and by natural springs at Westfield and Fredonia.</p>
    <p>But whatever the cause, the light is a curious fact, and well worthy the attention of those interested in the
      investigation of the phenomenon of nature.</p>
