<p>The Nevada Territorial Enterprise of Nov. 28th, says, a most singular phenomenon was witnessed from that city the
  preceding morning, at 4 o'clock, by miners and others who where astir at that early hour. The phenomenon was of a
  celestial character, and was connected with the rising of the morning star. Some hundreds of persons saw the wonder
  and looked on in astonishment during its duration. The sky was perfectly clear in every direction, and the eastern
  horizon was peculiarly blue and bright, not the slightest sign of mistabout the ridges of the distant eastern ranges,
  yet the morning star rose of a blood-red-color, and with a bright white halo, apparently five or six feet in diameter,
  surrounding it. From the lower part of this halo there extended downward a tail apparently some eight feet long and
  two feet in width at the upper part. The tail was slightly curved, of a sabre shape, bluntly rounded at the lower end,
  and both it and the halo appeared to be filled with thousands of small and exceedingly brilliant stars. This strange
  sight lasted some fifteen or twenty minutes. </p>
