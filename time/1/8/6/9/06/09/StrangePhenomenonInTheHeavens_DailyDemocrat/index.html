<p>Yesterday morning, about half past two o'clock, a meteor or ball of fire made its appearance in the western sky, and
  remained visible for at least half an hour. It was immense in size, being apparently about as large as the head of a
  flour barrel?larger than the moon when full. It was of a birght glowing red color, and at intervals of a few minutes,
  darted forth on every side bright rays like the straws of a broom, and from the ends of these were sent out sparks
  like those from a Roman candle. Suddenly this would cease, and only the circle or ball of fire remained, when again
  the rays would blaze out around the whole circumference of the central ball.</p>
<p>In company with Mr. Mayien, doorkeeper of Pike's Opera House, we welebed this strange meteor for at least half an
  hour, when it went down behind Mount Davidson, still blazing and spattering forth sparks and jets of fire. It appeared
  to move with the rest of the heavenly bodies?no faster or slower, and went down behind the mountain as steadily as
  would have been the ease with the moon itself. It was impossible to judge as to the distance of the meteor. It
  appeared near enough to have been in the atmosphere on the earth, indeed appeared to be but a few miles away, yet it
  may have been a world on fire millions of miles away. Its intermittent action and the vehemence with which the rays
  and sparks were darted forth was the most wonderful part of the phenomenon?though it was sufficiently wonderful to see
  such an immense ball of fire hanging over the western horizon, even in its quiescent state. It was the strangest sight
  we ever saw in the heavens, and we would have cheerfully hot ten cents that the end of all things was at hand. Few
  persons were abroad at the time, sad we have been unable to find a gentleman beside the gentlement named, who saw it.
  What it was God only knows, but we are inclined to think it was a slar being consumed, and shall not be surprised to
  hear that one of considerable magnitude is missing ? Territorial Enterprise, May 16. </p>
