    </tr></table><p>Hier matin, vers 2 h 30 environ, un météore ou une boule de feu fit son apparition dans le ciel à
    l'ouest, et resta visible pendant au moins 1/2 heure. Elle était de tailel immense, apparemment a peu près de la
    taille d'un barril de flour ? plus grand que la Lune quand elle est pleine. It was of a birght glowing red color,
    and at intervals of a few minutes, darted forth on every side bright rays like the straws of a broom, and from the
    ends of these were sent out sparks like those from a Roman candle. Suddenly this would cease, and only the circle or
    ball of fire remained, when again the rays would blaze out around the whole circumference of the central ball.</p>
    <p>In company with Mr. Mayien, doorkeeper of Pike's Opera House, we welebed this strange meteor for at least half an
      hour, when it went down behind Mount Davidson, still blazing and spattering forth sparks and jets of fire. It
      appeared to move with the rest of the heavenly bodies?no faster or slower, and went down behind the mountain as
      steadily as would have been the ease with the moon itself. It was impossible to judge as to the distance of the
      meteor. It appeared near enough to have been in the atmosphere on the earth, indeed appeared to be but a few miles
      away, yet it may have been a world on fire millions of miles away. Its intermittent action and the vehemence with
      which the rays and sparks were darted forth was the most wonderful part of the phenomenon?though it was
      sufficiently wonderful to see such an immense ball of fire hanging over the western horizon, even in its quiescent
      state. It was the strangest sight we ever saw in the heavens, and we would have cheerfully hot ten cents that the
      end of all things was at hand. Few persons were abroad at the time, sad we have been unable to find a gentleman
      beside the gentlement named, who saw it. What it was God only knows, but we are inclined to think it was a slar
      being consumed, and shall not be surprised to hear that one of considerable magnitude is missing ? Territorial
