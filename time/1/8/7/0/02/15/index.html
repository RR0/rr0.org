<p>The Boston papers publish the following as a strange but well authenticated story:</p>
<p>The engineer of the freight train on the Boston and Lowell railroad, which leaves Boston about 3 o'clock in the
  morning, has on several occasions discovered a red light swinging at a furious rate at the Woburn station, where the
  train stops for water. The light would sometimes be in the front and sometimes in the rear of the train. When the
  engineer would stop his train and questioned some one to learn why the signal to stop was made, the messenger would be
  greatly surprised to see the light vanish. Investigation has proved that no person was there with a lantern, and the
  brakes man and conductor concur, also, in having beheld the phenomenon, which, so far as is known, is without visible
  cause. Some laborers living on the line of the above station state that a few mornings since they were coming down the
  road on a hand-car, when they suddenly heard the approach of the engine and train, and knowing that no train was due
  in the vicinity at that hour, they became greatly frightened, and, jumping out of the car, threw it off the track to
  await the train which they thought was coming at a rapid pace upon them, but which, it is needless to say, did not
  come. The superstitious regard the affair as a forewarning of some disaster, while the spiritualists have the ready
  theory that it is the spirit of a man who was killed there some two years ago.</p>
