    singulières, &amp;c. </p>
    <p>Le <em>Republican </em>de Goshen (N. Y.) <em></em>du 15 inst. a l'histoire singulière suivante :</p>
    <p>"Des résidents de la Route Basse, dans la ville de Wawavanda, à environ 1,5 mile de Gardnerville, et au voisinage
      de quoi se trouve ce qui a autrefois été connu comme le Rudlum's lime-kiln, ont été considérablement excités
      durant les dernières semaines par une boule de feu, qui a été vue à différents moments de la nuit et en
      différentes localités dans un rayon de 0,5 mile. To more fully understand the stories in relation to it, and to
      give the crudulous room to strip the narrative of its superstitious family in the neighborhood has been sorely
      afflicted within a few years; first the mother, then a daughter, the father and the two remaining daughters ? the
      latter 2 dying within a year or so or one another ? and all three of the daughters taken in the prime of young
      womanhood, idolized by their family and loved by all for their gentle qualities of heart. We would not pain the
      remaining members of the family thus referred to by mention of the affliction, but for the purpose, as above
      stated, of giving to superstition the credit of a rair portion of the tales told such as, that one person is said
      to have seen a light in every window of the house on a certain night, and another saw the light at another time
      approach the thouse and apparently enter at a window. Such tales are told, and, of course, among the
      superstitiously inclined, are attributed to the domestic affliction of the family. The point we wish to impress
      here is that such interpretations of the character of the phenomenon are entirely out of place and unjust. A light
      was probably seen in different parts of the house at the time referred to, and could be easily explained in
      various ways, such as a person going from one room to another. A young man, son of a well-known gentleman who
      resides in the vicinity, while driving along the road one evening, saw this light approaching in a direct line
      toward him, and he expected to come in contact with it, but it disappeared when within a few feet of him. This
      person is not naturally of a timid disposition, but was thoroughly terrified, and drove into a neighnor's yard,
      intending to stop at the house until daylight, but finding that they had retired for the night, put the whip to
      his horse and went home, where he arrived in a state of terror, and left his horse standing at the door for
      another member of the family to unhitch. This is but an instance of similar experience by several. It is not a
      story told by children or weak-minded grown pere sons alone, but is qualified by persons of maturn age?not by two
      or three, but manyin whose minds superstition has never, until the occurence of the events described, had an
      abiding place or even a temporary hold. It is no trick of a mischievous person, as it has been closely approached,
      and proved to be simply a strange, weird-looking light, unaccompanied by human agency, coming and going apparently
      at the bid of some unseen power. Thoughtful and sensible persons are astounded at its freaks and ghostly
      character?persons who have faced death unflinchingly, quail before this wandering, curious, spirit-like taper as
      it moves here and there about the highway and over fields and fences, seemingly an uneasy visitant from the spirit
      world, mocking the mortals of this mundane sphere." </p>
