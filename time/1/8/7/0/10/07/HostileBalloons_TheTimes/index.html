<p>The following extraordinary statement appears in the Nouvelles du Jour, a Belgian paper. The intelligence was
  conveyed in a note to that journal from one of their correspondents at the seat of war, which note was conveyed to
  Brussels by a carrier piegeon :? </p>
<p>"Paris, Oct. 1.</p>
<p> "Nadar returned yesterday to Paris. His return was not, however, without much trouble, although his balloon was
  directed by a good wind and favourable currents since his departure from Tours. But let me relate the particulars of
  his voyage in chronological order. He left Tours at 6 o'clock in the morning, and the bold aeronaut arrived in view of
  Paris at 11 o'clock, floating about 3,000 metres above the fort of Charenton. At the same time as the Intrépide, which
  was the name of M. Nadar's balloon, appeared in sight, a second balloon was seen in the horizon. M. Nadar was observed
  to display a long streamer with the French national colours. Immediately afterwards a national flag floated from the
  car of the other ballon. Vigorous hurrahs and cries of 'C'est Durouff,' from the garrison of the fort, greeted the
  appearance of the two aeronauts, whose balloons gradually approached. Suddenly, and when at a short distance from each
  other, a loud report was heard in the air, which report was followed by a series of explosions. These were at first
  supposed to be victorious signals or demonstrations, until M. Nadar was seen to fling himself into the netting of his
  balloon, and to cling to its sides. During this time the other aeronaut continued discharching shots at M. Nadar and
  his balloon. The Intrépide was descending rapidly, and it appeared evident to the spectators below that some
  incomprehensible event had happened above. But mark what the French flag of the neighbouring balloon came to. It was
  withdrawn, and a black and yellow standard was observed to be floating in its place. All was explained. 'Treason !'
  'It is a Prussian ballon !' 'He has fired on the Intrépide !' were the cries that burst simultanenously from the
  French people. Nadar was supposed to have been lost. He was seen to descend rapidly in his car, and his balloon had
  once more nearly reached the earth. He, however, casts out his ballast, and he again ascends. M. Nadar again clambers
  up the network of this balloon, and, by a marvellous effort, he succeeds in stopping the hole made in his balloon by
  the shot of this adversary. The Intrépide the becomes the assailant, and several shots were fired from the car into
  the Prussian balloon, which suddenly whirled about and fell to the ground with giddy velocity. As soon as it reached
  the earth a detachment of Ublans, who were on the plain, and who had been following the aerial combatants throughout
  this exciting struggle, rushed forth and, surrounding the balloon, received their champion?God knows in what
  condition. They then hastened off at full speed to the Prussian advanced posts. In the meantime M. Nadar descended
  safely at Charenton where he still is at this moment."</p>
<p>The <em>Echo du Parlement</em>, commenting on this recital, observes :? "While the <em>Nouvelles du Jour</em> was
  publishing that extraordinary account of an aerial combat, we read in the correspondence addressed from Versailles to
  <em>The Times</em> of the 30th of September the following paragraph :?'An inexplicable phenomenon has just been
  witnessed at Versailles. Two balloons attached to each other were seen hovering over Paris, moved by a strong east
  wind in the direction of the forest of St. Germain. While the gentleman who narrated these facts to me was gazing at
  the aeronauts, his little daughter asked him to let her view the balloons through his spyglass. Scarcely had she
  distinguished the objects in the air when she exclaimed, 'They have fallen.' The balloons had disappeared suddenly
  behind the trees." The Brussels journal also states that a smaller balloon was perceived about the same time above
  Neffe, near Bastogne, near which place it seemd to have slowly descended. It was supposed to have ascended from the
  garrison of Metz. </p>
