<p>A few weeks ago the eastern papers came to us with lengthy accounts of the appearance of phantom trains on some of
  the Pennsylvania railroads. Since then we have heard nothing regarding these singular atmospheric freaks until
  yesterday when a gentleman from Beloit related that twice within the last three weeks similar apparitions have been
  visible on the Madison division of the Chicago &amp; North Western railroad, between Roscoe and Beloit[,] and each
  time at about the same spot. On both occasions the phantom train was seen by the engineer, conductor, brakesmen [sic]
  and passengers on the evening express from the south and it appeared to be moving at a moderate rate of speed a short
  distance ahead of the express train. So close was their proximity that the latter was stopped for fear of a collision
  and in a brief space of time the vision disappeared entirely from view. Enquiry at the stations along the line
  satisfied those who had witnessed the spectacle that no real train was within twenty-five or thirty miles of them, and
  they are at a loss to account for the singular illusion. The superintendent of the road recommends his men to change
  their whisky, but they have little faith in his suggestion, because they never drink. The affair has created no little
  consternation in the minds of the superstitious, and a proportionate amount of curiosity has taken possession of those
  who believe that there is a natural cause for every unaccountable occurrence. The killing of a man by the evening
  express, last Saturday night [May 18], at the very spot where the phantom train is said to have appeared on two
  different occasions, is a triumph for the former class, who could scarcely wish for more direct evidence of
  supernatural agency in connection with the ghostly visitation. Like phantom ships at sea, to their minds this
  phenomenon is a presage of death.</p>
