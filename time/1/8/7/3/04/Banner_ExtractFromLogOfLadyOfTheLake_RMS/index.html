    <p>At from 6.30 to 7 P.M. a curious-shaped cloud appeared in the S.S.E. quarter, first appearing distinct at about
      25° from the horizon, from where it moved steadily forward, or rather upward, to about 80°, when it settled down
      bodily to the N.E. Its form was circular, with a semicircle to the northern face near its centre, and with four
      rays or arms extending from centre to edge of circle. From the centre to about 6° beyond the circle was a fifth
      ray broader and more distinct than the others, with a curved end:?diameter of circle 11°, and of semicircle 2&frac12;°.
      The weather was fine, and the atmosphere remarkably clear, with the usual Trade sky. It was of a light grey
      colour, and, though distinctly defined in shape, the patches of cirro-cumulus at the back could be clearly seen
      through. It was very much lower than the other clouds ; the shape was plainest seen when about 55° to 60° high.
      The wind at the time was N.N.E., so that it came up obliquely against the wind, and finally settled down right in
      the wind's eye ; finally lost sight of it through darkness, about 30° from the horizon at about 7.20 P.M. Its tail
      was very similar to that of a comet. The men forward saw it nearly 10 minutes before I did, and came aft to tell
      me of it. This may give a rough idea of its shape and track ; its general appearance was similar to that of a halo
      round the sun or moon. </p>
