<p>22nd March, 1870. Lat. N. 5° 47', long. W. 27° 52'.</p>
<p>At from 6.30 to 7 P.M. a curious-shaped cloud appeared in the S.S.E. quarter, first appearing distinct at about 25°
  from the horizon, from where it moved steadily forward, or rather upward, to about 80°, when it settled down bodily to
  the N.E. Its form was circular, with a semicircle to the northern face near its centre, and with four rays or arms
  extending from centre to edge of circle. From the centre to about 6° beyond the circle was a fifth ray broader and
  more distinct than the others, with a curved end:?diameter of circle 11°, and of semicircle 2&frac12;°. The weather
  was fine, and the atmosphere remarkably clear, with the usual Trade sky. It was of a light grey colour, and, though
  distinctly defined in shape, the patches of cirro-cumulus at the back could be clearly seen through. It was very much
  lower than the other clouds ; the shape was plainest seen when about 55° to 60° high. The wind at the time was N.N.E.,
  so that it came up obliquely against the wind, and finally settled down right in the wind's eye ; finally lost sight
  of it through darkness, about 30° from the horizon at about 7.20 P.M. Its tail was very similar to that of a comet.
  The men forward saw it nearly 10 minutes before I did, and came aft to tell me of it. This may give a rough idea of
  its shape and track ; its general appearance was similar to that of a halo round the sun or moon. </p>
