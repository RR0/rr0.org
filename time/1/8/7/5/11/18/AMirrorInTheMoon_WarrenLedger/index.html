<p>A most remarkable discovery is reported from the astronomical observation established by the Russian government
  several years ago at Pamlateska, the highest point, with one exception, on the Himalayan range. For several months a
  peculiar bright spot had been discovered, shining from the extreme edge of the <a
      href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/lune/index.html">moon</a>'s disc, at a point where no mountains break
  the continuity of its perimeter. This light suddenly disappeared and remained invisible for nearly twelve months. It
  has lately reappeared in greater brilliancy than ever, and the immense power of the telescope attached to the above
  observatory, so well known in the scientific world, has developed the fact that the light proceeds from some huge
  burnished substance, acting as a mirror, which must be at least 100 feet in diameter. The most astonishing thing in
  the matter is the almost complete proof that this is actually a mirror of artificial construction, and the theory of
  the savans at Pamlateska is, that it is erected for observations of a scientific character, principally to observe the
  phases of the earth's surface.</p>
<p>It is well known that the immense height of that portion of the moon which is turned toward the earth, not only
  through the well known laws of gravitation, keeps that portion of her surface presented towards us, but also renders
  it uninhabitable. It is supposed that the side turned from us may have an atmosphere suitable for an animal life, and
  that intelligent beings observing the halo of light shed around its horizon by reflections from the earth, may have
  taken this means to ascertain the cause. Some ingenious device to place a mirror at a height where animal life could
  not be sustained, was the result. It is to be hoped that this discovery may lead to others in regard to our
  interesting satellite. </p>
