    </tr></table><p>A most remarkable discovery is reported from the astronomical observation established by the Russian
    government several years ago at Pamlateska, the highest point, with one exception, on the Himalayan range. For
    several months a peculiar bright spot had been discovered, shining from the extreme edge of the <a
        href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/lune/index.html">moon</a>'s disc, at a point where no mountains break
    the continuity of its perimeter. This light suddenly disappeared and remained invisible for nearly twelve months. It
    has lately reappeared in greater brilliancy than ever, and the immense power of the telescope attached to the above
    observatory, so well known in the scientific world, has developed the fact that the light proceeds from some huge
    burnished substance, acting as a mirror, which must be at least 100 feet in diameter. The most astonishing thing in
    the matter is the almost complete proof that this is actually a mirror of artificial construction, and the theory of
    the savans at Pamlateska is, that it is erected for observations of a scientific character, principally to observe
    the phases of the earth's surface.</p>
    <p>It is well known that the immense height of that portion of the moon which is turned toward the earth, not only
      through the well known laws of gravitation, keeps that portion of her surface presented towards us, but also
      renders it uninhabitable. It is supposed that the side turned from us may have an atmosphere suitable for an
      animal life, and that intelligent beings observing the halo of light shed around its horizon by reflections from
      the earth, may have taken this means to ascertain the cause. Some ingenious device to place a mirror at a height
      where animal life could not be sustained, was the result. It is to be hoped that this discovery may lead to others
      in regard to our interesting satellite. </p>
