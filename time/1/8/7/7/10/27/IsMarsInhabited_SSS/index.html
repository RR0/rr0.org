<p>Is this <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/mars/index.html">neighboring world</a> the abode of living creatures?
  This question is beyond the present power of science to answer. But would it not be strange beyond expression if a
  world, with land and water, and changing seasons, and apparently all the conditions required by life, so like our
  earth that it is even possible that man could exist upon its surface, should roll on through the ages uninhabited and
  unenjoyed? Our earth teems with life in its remotest corner, yet some Martial astronomer may at this moment be
  wondering what is the use of us, and whether our planet is the abode of intelligent beings. After the wonders that
  science has already achieved, he would be bold who should say that this problem can never be solved. Unfortunately, we
  can not hope for much from the improvement of our telescopes and the increase of their magnifying power. The
  disturbances produced by our atmosphere are aggravated by every such increase. But when the problem of life in other
  worlds is solved?if it ever shall be?it seems safe to say that it will be by the attentive study of our near neighbor.
