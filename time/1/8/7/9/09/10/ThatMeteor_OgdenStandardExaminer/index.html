    <p>EDITOR JUNCTION: How strange it is this generation of man is so unbelieving in signs shown in the heavens; that
      they should foretell coming events is to masses preposterous. and yet sacred as well as profane history often
      speaks of them as preceding great calamities coming upon cities and nations. Josephus makes particular mention of
      them prior to the destruction of Jerusalem. This, however, is no stranger than the unbelief in dreams and visions
      by the many of this age, and yet they will say corresponding causes produces the same effects. History repeats
      itself, etc. <span class="people">Jesus</span> speaks of signs that should be given prior to his second coming;
      the wise would be looking for
      them, while the unbelieving would perish as the anterdeluvians did.</p>
    <p>The strange phenomenon seen in the western sky last evening has its meaning. I am of the opinion this was not
      higher that the clouds and was not seen west of Salt Lake, and therefore conclude its significance was entirely
      confined to Utah. More particularly am I of this belief from the fact that about 12 o'clock last night nearly the
      same sign was seen over Ogden City, or a little west of the city.</p>
    <p>Now, gentle reader, don't think I am going to predict the destruction of Ogden City. Not so. But we may round up
      our shoulders for the worst. A severe scourge, either of wind, fire of sickness is at our door. Other parts of
      Utah east of the lake will also feel the same.</p>
    <p>Respectfully,</p>
    <p>L. D. RUDD.</p>
    <p>OGDEN CITY, Sept. 6, 1879. </p>
