<p class="abstract">Le "professeur" Rudd livre ses id�es en relation � ce qui suit. </p>
<p>EDITOR JUNCTION: How strange it is this generation of man is so unbelieving in signs shown in the heavens; that they
  should foretell coming events is to masses preposterous. and yet sacred as well as profane history often speaks of
  them as preceding great calamities coming upon cities and nations. Josephus makes particular mention of them prior to
  the destruction of Jerusalem. This, however, is no stranger than the unbelief in dreams and visions by the many of
  this age, and yet they will say corresponding causes produces the same effects. History repeats itself, etc. <span
    class="people">Jesus</span> speaks of signs that should be given prior to his second coming; the wise would be
  looking for them, while the unbelieving would perish as the anterdeluvians did.</p>
<p>The strange phenomenon seen in the western sky last evening has its meaning. I am of the opinion this was not higher
  that the clouds and was not seen west of Salt Lake, and therefore conclude its significance was entirely confined to
  Utah. More particularly am I of this belief from the fact that about 12 o'clock last night nearly the same sign was
  seen over Ogden City, or a little west of the city.</p>
<p>Now, gentle reader, don't think I am going to predict the destruction of Ogden City. Not so. But we may round up our
  shoulders for the worst. A severe scourge, either of wind, fire of sickness is at our door. Other parts of Utah east
  of the lake will also feel the same.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>L. D. RUDD.</p>
<p>OGDEN CITY, Sept. 6, 1879. </p>
