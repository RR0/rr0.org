<p> About 7 o'clock Friday evening a brilliant bolide or fire-ball appeared in the northerstern sky directly noder the
  constellation of Casiopea and not far above the horizon. It moved across a portion of the northern heavens and
  disppeared in a moment. Its path could be traced by a curved, luminous line of yellowish light for ten minutes after
  the meteor had become invisible. The crescent of light which remained visible so long presented a spectacle of unusual
  interest. Meteors commonly leave no trail. The atmosphere was last night charged with so much smoke from the mountain
  fires as to interfere with the view of the phenomenon. It seems to have been observed over a large extent of
  territory. A dispatch from Salt Lake thus describes the sight as witnessed in that eity:</p>
<blockquote><p>This evening, a few minutes after 7 o'clock, a brilliant meteor shot across they sky in a northwesterly
  direction, leaving in its wake a silver streak apparently miles in length, which finally began to vibrate like a
  serpent, then changed to zigzag like kightning. This singular phenomenon lasted 85 minutes and was witnessed by
  thousands of people.</p></blockquote>
<p>It was also observed at Carson, as appears by the following from the <em>Appeal</em> of this morning:</p>
<p>"A brilliantly red meteor shot over the Capitol building, in a northeasterly direction, at 6:30 o'clock last evening.
  It was a beautiful sight, witnessed by a number of gentlemen who were sitting in front of the Ornesby House."</p>
<p>The <em>Enterprise</em>, whose reporter has an astronomical turn, is silent on the subject. The inference is that
  Virginia didn't see it. </p>
