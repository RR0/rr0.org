    </tr></table><p> About 7 o'clock Friday evening a brilliant bolide or fire-ball appeared in the northerstern sky
    directly noder the constellation of Casiopea and not far above the horizon. It moved across a portion of the
    northern heavens and disppeared in a moment. Its path could be traced by a curved, luminous line of yellowish light
    for ten minutes after the meteor had become invisible. The crescent of light which remained visible so long
    presented a spectacle of unusual interest. Meteors commonly leave no trail. The atmosphere was last night charged
    with so much smoke from the mountain fires as to interfere with the view of the phenomenon. It seems to have been
    observed over a large extent of territory. A dispatch from Salt Lake thus describes the sight as witnessed in that
    eity:</p>
    <p>"This evening, a few minutes after 7 o'clock, a brilliant meteor shot across they sky in a northwesterly
      direction, leaving in its wake a silver streak apparently miles in length, which finally began to vibrate like a
      serpent, then changed to zigzag like kightning. This singular phenomenon lasted 85 minutes and was witnessed by
      thousands of people."</p>
    <p>It was also observed at Carson, as appears by the following from the <em>Appeal</em> of this morning:</p>
    <p>"A brilliantly red meteor shot over the Capitol building, in a northeasterly direction, at 6:30 o'clock last
      evening. It was a beautiful sight, witnessed by a number of gentlemen who were sitting in front of the Ornesby
      House."</p>
    <p>The <em>Enterprise</em>, whose reporter has an astronomical turn, is silent on the subject. The inference is that
      Virginia didn't see it. </p>
