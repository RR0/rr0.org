<p>The mystery that surrounds the lost Prof. Wise balloon and its human freight, which ascended from St. Louis thirteen
  days ago, increases. A balloon has been seen at great height over different points, the latest report coming from
  Albion, this State, where an airship was seen early on Thursday morning [October 9] moving in a southwesterly
  direction. Possibly the aeronauts have lost all control of their balloon and are making a "wild" trip through the
  air.</p>
