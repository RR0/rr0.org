<p class="abstract">An Air Ship Seen High in the Air by a Number of People at Dubuque Yesterday Morning.</p>
<p>Special Telegram to The Inter Ocean.</p>
<p>DUBUQUE, Iowa, Oct. 10. &ndash; People who were up at a very early hour this morning were astonished at seeing what
  appeared to be a large balloon going over the city. It was seen by quite a number of persons in different parts of the
  city, and was visible for an hour. It was at a great height, and appeared to have a car attached. It finally
  disappeared on the horizon, moving in a southwesterly direction. There is much speculation as to what the mysterious
  stranger could have been.</p>
<p>To the Western Associated Press.</p>
<p>DUBUQUE, Iowa, Oct. 10. &ndash; Thomas Lloyd, a compositor on the <em>Times</em>, saw a balloon early this morning.
  He watched it for over an hour, and called the attention of the telegraph operator to it. It was up very high, and the
  car could be seen, but no person. It was seen in the southeast, and traveled south slowly, rising and falling in its
  course. Numbers of others also claim they saw the air ship.</p>
