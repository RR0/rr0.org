<p>A balloon supposed to be the missing "Pathfinder&rdquo; was seen on the night of September 28 (the date of the
  ascension) to pass over Miller Station [Indiana], which is some thirty miles distant from Chicago, by Louis Faber, an
  engineer on the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad. Mr. Faber says that at the time he was on the platform of
  his engine in conversation with the operator at the depot, when the operator called his attention to some dark body
  high up in the air, which, upon close scrutiny, they plainly saw was a balloon. It was near midnight at the time, but
  the moon shone brightly so that the air-ship was distinctly seen. It was less than a mile away, and appeared, Mr.
  Faber said, to be sailing in a northeasterly direction very rapidly toward the lake, which is only about half a mile
  from Miller Station. John Bulla, a fireman on Mr. Faber's engine, also saw the balloon and corroborates Mr. Faber's
  statement concerning it.</p>
<p>Mr. G. S. Partridge, of Pontiac, Mich. (thirty miles northwest of Detroit), a responsible man, says that on Thursday
  last [October 2? October 9?], about 3 p.m., he saw a large balloon well up pass that city, going from west to east.
  Could see the basket, but could not make out the inmates. He thinks it was the Wise balloon. This is the latest
  information touching the fate of Professor [John] Wise and Mr. [George] Burr, his companion, and at present few
  entertain the hope that the venturesome travelers are alive, they having been thirteen days lost.</p>
