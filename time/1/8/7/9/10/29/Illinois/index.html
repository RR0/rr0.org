<p class="abstract">A Balloon Sighted.</p>
<p>ROCKFORD, October 28. A balloon, supposed to be the <i>Pathfinder</i>, was seen passing over the city at a great
  height, toward the north-west, this morning, and again in the afternoon, going east, at a much less altitude, the car
  being plainly visible, and some persons claiming they could see dark objects in the car.</p>
