<p>The mystery of the missing balloon "Pathfinder" has been cleared up by the finding of the body of Mr. Burr, who
  accompanied Professor Wise, on the shore of Lake Michigan, near Miller's Station, Ind. It is now very evident that the
  balloon and its passengers were lost in the lake on the night of the day they ascended from St. Louis, four weeks
  ago.</p>
