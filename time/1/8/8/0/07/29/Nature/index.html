<p>The storms about this part of Surry have been lately local and violent, and the effects produced in some instances
  curious. Visiting a neighbour's farm on Wednesday evening (21<sup>st</sup>), we found a field of standing wheat
  considerably knocked about, not as an entirety, but in patches forming, as viewed from a distance, circular spots.</p>
<p>Examined more closely, there all presented much the same character, viz., a few standing stalks as a centre, some
  prostrate stalks with their heads arranged pretty evenly in a direction forming a circle round the centre, and outside
  these a circular wall of stalks which had not suffered.</p>
<p>I send a sketch made on the spot, giving an idea of the most perfect of these patches. The soil is a sandy loam upon
  the greensand, and the crop is vigorous, with strong stems, and I could not trace locally any circumstances accounting
  for the peculiar forms of the patches in the field, nor indicating whether it was wind or rain, or both combined,
  which had caused them, beyond the general evidence everywhere of heavy rainfall. They were to me suggestive of some
  cyclonic wind action, and may perhaps have been noticed elsewhere by some of your readers.</p>
