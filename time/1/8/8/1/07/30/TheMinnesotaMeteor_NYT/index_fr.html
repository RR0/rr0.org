    <p><em>To the Editor of the St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer-Press :</em></p>
    <p>St. Paul, 26 juillet ? J'ai eu la bonne fortune d'avoir une vue splendide du <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/rentree/meteore/index.html">météore</a> du dernier soir, appelé
      comète, (maintenant que les airs et les têtes des gens sont pleins de comètes) par notre correspondant de
      Lanesboro. Should say that his description of the body and its movements was generally very good, save that the
      application of the terms feet and inches to the apparent size of a body of wholly undefined distance conveys no
      distinct idea to the mind. Feet and inches at what distance? As seen by myself, about 8:30 P.M., the meteor came
      from the south-eastern heavens, below the star Altair, some 15° or 20° above the horizon. It was exceedingly
      brilliant, with a well-defined head, as large or larger than the planet Venus at her brightest, and seemed to move
      about as fast as a rocket at a square's distance does just before it explodes. There was to me a sense of
      retardation in its movement, just as there is in a case of a rocket : but this was probably only apparent, because
      it looked so much like a bright rocket ready to explode, and because, in fact. I was expecting to see it explode
      every instant. Its direction was toward the north-west, toward which it crept as a fiery serpent, disappearing
      some 10° above the horizon. I use the word "crept" because its movement was in no sense the darting motion of the
      ordinary meteor, but a deliberate, majestic course, giving one a great sense of the power with which it moved
      through at least 100° of the heavens. At its highest point I should think it was about 30° above the horizon. My
      estimate of the time the meteor was visible is from six to eight seconds, certainly not ten seconds. I well know
      how much this disagrees with the estimate or your other correspondents, but we must try to get at the facts. A
      mere fraction of a second only is occupied by an ordinary meteor, and the best observers tabulate those that
      occupy a second in going 10° as slow. I should call this one rather slow, much slower than the ordinary meteor.
      Its tail probably some 10° in length. </p>
