<p>An extraordinary phenomenon was seen near Sandhurst, Victoria, on Dec. 7. A ball of fire, described in various ways,
  was seen to rush parallel with the earth round the corner of a house inhabited by a family named Donnelly and direct
  its course to the back of the Creek, rising and falling from eight feet to one foot from the ground. Five minutes
  before the inhabitants were startled by a terrible smell of sulphur, and it was thought that the powder magazine was
  about to explode. Donnelly lifted up a bit of wood from the ground at the back of the house, but had to drop it
  immediately, as the wood singed his finger. His daughter was also at the back, and as the ball of fire rushed past, it
  nearly blinded her. Another person employed at the place was nearly knocked down. A terrific clap of thunder took
  place at the same moment. The weather was extremely oppressive in the morning. About 4 o'clock a heavy thunderstorm
  passed over the town towards the southwest.</p>
