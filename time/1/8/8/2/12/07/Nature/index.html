</figure><p>Having read in the English journals how very extensively and simultaneously the remarkable display of aurora
  borealis was observed in Europe and the United States, I beg to forward the inclosed report from Prof. Tacchini (see
  below), taken from a newspaper in Rome, describing that splendid phenomenon as it appeared in this country on the
  evening of the 17th inst, which probably may interest some of your readers. I would merely add that on the evening in
  question I was travelling between Spezzia and this city, when my observation was absorbed by the brilliancy of the
  beautiful phenomenon as seen from the a railway carriage, and which accords very closely with the appearance of it in
  Rome. Soon after sunset the north-western sky was diffused with richly-coloured roseate tints blending into crimson at
  the horizon, which continued up to 7 p. m. ; the transparency of this apparently roseate cloud was a'so a very
  remarkable feature, for the stars of the Great Bear were seen through it with little diminution of lustre ; the sunset
  was very noticeable, which I remarked before branching from the coast where I had the sea horizon, and I never saw a
  more distinct and clear disappearance of the sun at sea below the horizon, even to the clearness of the atmosphere.
  Aurora borealis is as seldom seen in this country that its appearance caused much public curiosity.</p>
