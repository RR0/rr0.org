    </table><p>The Month of November 1882 was rendered remarkable by the appearance of the largest sun-spot seen during
    the last eleven years, and by the occurence of a series of remarkable auroral and magnetic storms, in precise
    coincidence with the period during which the spot was visible. But the most unique and striking phenomenon of this
    period occured during the great auroral storm of November 17 at about 6 P. M., when a bright beam of light rose from
    the eastern horizon and passed majestically accross the sky in much the same manner as any ordinary celestial body
    might do, but with several hundred times their rapidity. So beautiful and wonderful an appearance deserved that the
    fullest possible attention should be paid to it ; and with this view Mr. Rand Capron has collected as many
    observations of it as he could procure, and has discussed them in an interesting paper appearing in the
    'Philosophical Magazine' for May.</p>
    <p>Mr. Capron has tabulated some twenty-six observations of the phenomenon, of which all but five were made in
      England. Most of these are incomplete in many particulars of which we could wish had been remarked ; and the
      exactitude of the observations actually made leaves much to be desired ; but the phenomenon appeared so suddenly,
      disappeared so soon, and was altogether so unusual and striking, not to say awe-inspiring, that it is rather
      satisfactory to find so much recorded than surprising that more information has not been secured. Mr. Capron's own
      spectroscopic observations, for instance, satisfactorily establish the true auroral character of the object,
      against the theory warmly advocated by several observers that it was a "meteor" or "meteoroid ;" and Mr. Capron
      sums up other principal particulars as follows :?"Time of appearance, a little after 6 P. M. Time of flight, about
      75 seconds. Apparent approximate length and breadth, 27° x 3&frac13;. Direction of flight, magnetic E. to W."</p>
    <p>The shape of the beam is described in very various language ; "cigar" or "spindle"-shaped represents pretty
      accurately the opinion of most. "Pearly white" or "greenish white" are amongst the descriptions of the colour of
      its light, which seems to have closely corresponded to the "citron" tint of the auroral line (W.L. 5569); and as
      to its quality, the comparison to an "electric glow <em>in vacuo</em>" gives as accurate an idea as any. To most
      English observers it seemed pretty well defined in outline; but some noticed a feathery or splintered appearance
      about its edges. Prof. Oudemans noticed a remarkable dark marking, 10° in length, down the centre (and his
      observation is confirmed by observers at Brussels and Chatham), as if the beam had really the shape of "a
      pulled-out ring," "what one might anticipate of an elastic gaseous or fluid-like body flying at considerable speed
      through a resisting medium."</p>
    <p>The most interesting point, and the one to which a considerable part of the paper is devoted, is the question of
      the height of the object; and Mr. Capron fixes this, with considerable probability, as about 133 miles. From this
      height it would follow that its rate of motion was about 10 miles per second. This rate of motion is so much
      slower than the average speed of bolides, as to strengthen the conclusion drawn from the spectroscopic
      observations, that the phenomenon was truly auroral, and not of a "meteoric" character, a conclusion still further
      strengthened by the direction of its flight, viz., as nearly as can be ascertained, from magnetic E. to W.</p>
    <p>With regard to the character of the beam, Mr. Capron quotes Prof. <a href="/people/h/HerschelWilliam/index.html">Herschel</a>,
      who "has seen abortive bright streamers move along stationary milk-white auroral bands; and this 'shuttle
      phenomenon' was, he thinks, a streamer-base, or 'tendency to shoot up rays,' travelling as a nucleus or
      concentration of light along an arc or bow otherwise invisible, as steamer-bases, though more faintly visible,
      frequently do along luminous sharp-edged phosphorescent-looking arches." Certainly our own impression at the time
      was in complete accordance with this view, "that the beam itself may have been the transient lighting-up by a
      passing glow of an otherwise invisible arc." </p>
