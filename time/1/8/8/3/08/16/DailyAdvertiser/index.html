<p>A mysterious light on a railroad track near Amsterdam, N.Y., occasions grand, gloomy and peculiar emotions. The
  light ordinarily keeps nearly three feet above the track, but occasionally is thirty feet in the air, or on the rails.
  It is reported that fifty citizens, politics not mentioned, hid behind a fence to see what the appearance was, but
  their testimony is conflicting and inconclusive, though the fact that this body of freemen was careful to have a fence
  between it and this elusive luminary, shows that the observers agreed in thinking it something dangerous. Politicians
  sometimes solve problems by being on the fence, but Amsterdam people must come out from behind the fence, or their
  investigations will be fruitless. Doubtless some democratic editors will connect this alarming appearance with
  "republican corruption."</p>
