<p>To the Editor of <em>The Times</em>. </p>
<p>Villaldama (Mexique) 25 octobre ? Comme demandé, j'inclus cette lettre. La raison de mon long silence est que rien
  d'importance suffisante n'était arrivé pour mériter une lettre ; mais hier a eu lieu ici un des événements naturels
  les plus extraordinaires jamais came under the purview of any citizen of this place. Before reciting it I wish to say
  that, though this is a meteor story, it is not of the Mulhetton character; as any citizen of this place will testify,
  should any one be anxious enough about its authenticity to write concerning it. </p>
<p>Just on the outskirts of town there is a family of five (father, mother, son and two daughters) living in an adobe
  house, with a thatched roof. This is characteristic Mexican home, and it is quite a happy family. Yesterday morning
  the father and son went out to their work, leaving the old lady and daughters at home attending to the household
  duties. After the work incident to getting breakfast ready and the home cleaned up, they sat down to their sawing. One
  of the girls was at the machine, and they were all singing as happy as birds. The sky was as clear at this particular
  time as the sun-blessed clims of Italy ever was. Not a sign of any impending danger was present. </p>
<p>Soudain les jeunes femmes furent surprises par un merveilleux bruit, comme si quelque chose passait soudain à travers
  les airs. Le bruit dura pendant 2 ou 3 s, lorsqu'il cessa, et elles furent transfigurées par la vision la plus
  extraordinaire qu'ai jamais contemplé des yeux humains. A travers la feuille d'une machine à scier sur laquelle 1 des
  jeunes femmes était assise, se trouvait un brandon enflammé, semblable en forme et taille à un pied de biche. Upon
  examination it was found to have passed through the roof of the house, then changed its curve to a right angle, with
  its apparent line of entrance and struck the leaf of the sewing machine, making a hole through it about two inches in
  diameter. It then entered the rock floor, going into it about one foot and a half.</p>
<p>The ladies immediately sent to the field for the mean of the family. They made haste to come home, and were as much
  surprised as were the women at the strange object. The question as to how to get it out of the machine without being
  burned was a serious one. They got two pairs of tongs and succeeded in getting it out. But imagine their surprise
  when, upon attempting to remove the tongs from it, they found it impossible. The tongs seemed to have become part of
  the heavenly visitor, and they have not as yet been disclosed from it, and, strange to say, every piece of iron that
  touches this indescribable brand adheres so closely to it as to seem to become a part of it. Any other metal that
  comes in contact with it immediately slips off as though it were greased, and neither, apparently, sustain any damage
  by the proximity.</p>
<p>It has now been thirty-six hours since this strange meteor, as it may properly be termed, struck the earth, and it
  is, to all intents and purposes, as hot as when it first reached here, and emits the same strange, red glow. As before
  said, any metal except iron receives no damage by being touched to it, but wood, paper, or, in fact, anything have
  metal, that has yet been experimented with, seem to melt and disappear as if in a vapor, immediately upon being
  brought into contact with it. Only one substance seems to have say affect upon it, and this is water. When that was
  poqre upon it, it seemed to melt away and go up with the strange that addended from it. It was upon diminished that,
  while being down not ... it th the lsldkslx, it would entirely destroy it. It cannot be arches, and, caught be
  houffles with departeds naty iron ... </p>
<p>It has been thrown into the yard, where it still lies, and at night is of sufficient brillancy to read by at a
  distance of 100 feet. This is one of the greatest curiosities that has ever visited the earth, and should be bought by
  some naturalist.</p>
