<p class="abstract">Fiery d'un météore Blazing Which Racmily Fell in Mexico. </p>
<p>A brevet Joe Mulbatton has got into the Laredo <i lang="en">Times</i> office, and <a
    href="../../../10/28/VillaldamaVim/index.html">dans une lettre depuis Villaldama, Mexico</a>, he tells about a
  blazing meteor, crowbar in term, that fell from the heavens through the roof of a Mexican's house and through the leaf
  of a sewing machine at which a young lady was working at the time and then into the stone floor to the distance of a
  foot and a half. The <i lang="en">Times</i> correspondent says: "It has now been 48 hours since the strange meteor, as
  it may probably be termed, struck the earth, and it is, to all intents and purposes, as hot as when it first reached
  here, and emits the same strange, reg glow. As before said, any metal except iron receives no damage by being touched
  to it, but wood, paper, or in fact anything gave metal that has yet been experimented with seem to melt and disappear
  as if in a vapor immediately upon being brought into contact with it. It has been thrown into the yard, where it still
  lies, and at night is of sufficient brillancy to read by at a distance of 100 feet. This is one of the greatest
  curiosities that has ever visited the earth, and should be bought by some naturalist." </p>
