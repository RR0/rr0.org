    <p>Parras, Mex., Nov. 17, 1883.</p>
    <p>To the Editor of The Times:</p>
    <p>It is an old saying that nature is very even in her dispositions, and that every object is adapted to its
      surroundings. Even men are said to seek their level as naturally as water, and I will admit that this
      unquestionably is the rule, but one in a while we must with exceptions to all rules, and the fact I am about to
      relate is an instance of one of these exceptions. In fact, I would not be wide of the mark to say that exceptions
      from the rule on all questions in Mexico.</p>
    <p>The is indeed a land of wonders, and the better one becomes acquainted with it, the more is he impressed with
      this fact. But my letter shall not consist altogether of a introduction, and I will immediately proceed to the
      recitation of my story.</p>
    <p>As you possibly remember, I wrote you last from Villaldama just after the falling of that wonderful
      crowbar-shaped meteor ; the falling of which I see was doubted by some, and I was compared to the Mulhatton, when
      as a great many of the citizens Villaldama will testify, I was not guilty of a falsehood, and should have not been
      the object of such an odious comparison. From Villaldama I proceeded to Monterey, where I stayed nearly two weeks.
      Thence I visited Saltillo, where I remained several days, when the idea struck me to come to this romantic little
      place. It is about eighty miles from here in Saltillo, and the sight to be seen on the wagon road leading from
      here to that place is not equalled in all this country. I came by private conveyance, having only one companion (a
      friend from Texas) and the driver. We hired the ambulance in Saltillo, and the driver was furnished by the man who
      owned the outtit. He was a Hilweruian, and wa a regulation driver. He could talk more in less time than any man
      you ever saw. He has lived a great while in Mexico, and is very well acquainted with its customs. He speaks the
      language like a native, and knows every place of interest in this part of the country. His fond of information is
      unextinguishable ... </p>
