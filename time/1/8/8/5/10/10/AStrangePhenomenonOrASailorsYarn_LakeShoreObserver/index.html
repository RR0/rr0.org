<p>QUEBEC, October 10.â€”Captain Hanson, of the back Pauline, from Cardiff, for Quebec, recounts a strange phenomena. In
  latitude fifty-five degree west, longitude forty-six degrees north, on September 2, during a rain storm a brilliant
  ball of fire lodged on the dock, and for a few minutes played about from the cabin to the forecastle prostrating the
  captain and two seamen with a loud report, the fiery visitor disappeared as suddenly as it appeared, without damaging
  the vessel.
