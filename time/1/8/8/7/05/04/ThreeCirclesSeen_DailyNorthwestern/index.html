    <h2>A Strange Phenomenon Observed To-day in the Heavens.</h2>
    <p>One of the strangest phenomena observed in the city for some time was noticeable this morning about nine o'clock.
      Three immense circles were observed in the vicinity of the <a
          href="/place/systeme/solaire/Soleil/index.html">sun</a>, which formed the center of the smallest. Partially
      encircling this was a larger one, and lying near the latter was one of still greater circumference. The appearance
      of the circles seems to have been noticed simultaneously from all portions of the city, and within a minute after
      the first observance scores of people were seen ready with theories concerning the cause of the phenomenon. The
      circles appear to have been caused by the reflection of the <a
          href="/place/systeme/solaire/Soleil/index.html">sun</a> upon the moist atmosphere. The smallest ring was of a
      reddish hue, and the larger ones which were white almost faded from view against the blue sky. The circles
      probably indicate a storm or colder weather, it being thought by many that the phenomenon was caused by the <a
          href="/place/systeme/solaire/Soleil/index.html">sun</a>'s reflection on particles of crystalized vapor which
      are floating in the air. </p>
