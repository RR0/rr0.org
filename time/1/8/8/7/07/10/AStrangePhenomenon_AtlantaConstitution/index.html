    </tr></table><p> SANDERSVILLE, Ga., July 9.?[Special.]?Yesterday afternoon almost remarkable spectacular was seen
    here. The sun, setting behind a western bank of cloud, threw a lateral reflection of perfect symmetry, across the
    entire heaven, resting upon the eastern horizon, and widening at the zenith. Owing to the irregularity of the
    cloud's summit, other smaller pathlike illuminations were defined, all seeming to radiate from both horizons and to
    meet over head. The sun appeared to have set in the east, also. The curious sight was noted with much wonderment by
    many of our citizens, who did not remember ever having seen the heavens similarly spanned before. </p>
