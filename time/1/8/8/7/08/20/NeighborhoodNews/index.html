<p>[excerpt]</p>
<p>A Martin's Ferry correspondent of the <span class="place">Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]</span> <em>Dispatch</em>, under
  date of August 15th, says,
  "Your correspondent awoke this morning at 5 o'clock with a heavy feeling in his head and a kind of numbness in his
  limbs. When he got his eyes open he saw the room flooded with a peculiar orange tinted light. At first it could not be
  understood, but a glance at an open, unblinded window showed that all out of doors was in the same condition. It
  seemed so unnatural that he called other members of the household and found that two of them had already awakened
  under similar circumstances. In a few minutes windows were thrown open in many houses in the neighborhood, and half
  dressed people pushed their heads out to look at the curious phenomenon. The entire space from earth to the sky seemed
  to be floating full with light clouds of this strange, bright orange color, while a steady pouring rain was
  descending. All objects appeared as they would look through a piece of orange colored glass, except that outlines of
  forms were shaded in blue, which faded away to green and a bright orange color in the heavier parts. The sun had not
  yet risen, but one could see a distance of 300 or 400 yards distinctly, and all space seemed to be filled with
  peculiar yellow light.
