<p class="abstract"> Lights in the Form of a Human Hand Dismay the Superstitious </p>
<p>A strange spectacle was visible in the northern sky at Findlay, Ohio, a few nights ago, which has caused the greatest
  consternation. It was the representation of a human hand of immense proportions. Early in the evening the sky in the
  north had a peculiar look, which as the night wore on took the form of flashes of light, becoming more brilliant and
  unnatural as the night advanced. About 11 o'clock those watching the phenomenon were terrified to see the plumes of
  light concentrating into a distinct object, which soon assumed the shape of a giant's hand, well formed, and as
  distinct as if painted upon the black background of the sky. The hand appeared to be a shadowy substance through which
  waves of light of a blood red color surged as regularly as heart beats in a human breast and then fell off at the ends
  of the fingers in drops of the same color, almost as large as hot hair balloons. The first finger of the hand pointed
  downward toward the sleeping city as if warning the people of some woe about to fall on them. The spectacle lasted for
  about a half hour, and was witnessed by hundreds, who were breathless with excitement until slowly it began to fade
  away and finally disappeared. </p>
