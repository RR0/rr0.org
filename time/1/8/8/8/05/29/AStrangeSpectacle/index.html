    <p>A strange spectacle was visible in the northern sky at Findlay, Ohio, a few nights ago, which has caused the
      greatest consternation. It was the representation of a human hand of immense proportions. Early in the evening the
      sky in the north had a peculiar look, which as the night wore on took the form of flashes of light, becoming more
      brilliant and unnatural as the night advanced. About 11 o'clock those watching the phenomenon were terrified to
      see the plumes of light concentrating into a distinct object, which soon assumed the shape of a giant's hand, well
      formed, and as distinct as if painted upon the black background of the sky. The hand appeared to be a shadowy
      substance through which waves of light of a blood red color surged as regularly as heart beats in a human breast
      and then fell off at the ends of the fingers in drops of the same color, almost as large as hot hair balloons. The
      first finger of the hand pointed downward toward the sleeping city as if warning the people of some woe about to
      fall on them. The spectacle lasted for about a half hour, and was witnessed by hundreds, who were breathless with
      excitement until slowly it began to fade away and finally disappeared. </p>
