<p class="abstract2">Une voie électrique ozonique au cœur du territoire ? Ses effets sur l'Homme et l'Animal ? Un
  marriage à Bug Medicine Valley.</p>
<p><q>Oui</q>, dit le jeune Daniel Bloom, alors qu'il sat cooling his heels in the Hotel Ryan, <q>J'ai vécu dans le
  Dakota. C'est là que je me suis marié. Our courtship was a trifle more romantic and sensational than any plot which
  the Rider Haggards and Robert Louis Stevensons have yet evolved from the mazes of transcendentalism.</q></p>
<p>Becoming at once interested, I asked if an outline sketch of the case would infringe upon any confidential
  relations.</p>
<p>"Not in the least," answered Mr. Bloom, good-naturedly. "It's altogether a scientific affair. I am a devoted of
  science. Tom Edison I regard as the greatestman of the nineteenth century. From boyhood up the study of electric
  phenomena as displayed in lightning the aurora borealis, cyclones and other atmospheric disturbances has been a
  passion.</p>
<p>"Well, you will hardly credit, what I am about to tell you. Nevertheless, in the valley of the Big Medicine, not a
  hundred miles from tho Missouri river, there is electrical expale pathway from the heavens to the earth, which fairly
  rival the biblical legend of Jacob's ladder."</p>

  <p>"It was," he continued, "in the spring of 1884?No, in 1885, just three years ago?that I homestended a quarter
    section of land in the valley of the Big Medicine and purchased another quarter adjoining my claim.</p>
  <p>It was my intention to start, in a small way, a stock ranch, do a little diversified farming, and, perhaps, settle
    for life. I commenced with only twenty head of cattle, and kept bachelor's hall. My nearest neighbor, Paxton, lived
    a mile south. The northern portion of my ranch bordered on Medicine creek and was bluffy. The top of these bluffs
    was covered with all kinds round and irregular boulders, granite, flints, graphites, cornelians, etc. I am an
    indifferent geologist, and ones I imagined I had discovered a petrifaction. The stone bore a strong resemblance to a
    dead log. I carried some of the flinty fibers to the president of the Pierre university. He at once informed me that
    I was mistaken. They were not petrifactions at all.</p>

  <h2>Des animaux terrorisés</h2>
  <p>At the base of one of my bluffs, on a broad plateau running back from the Medicine, my cattle used to feed.
    Although I had often watched them from the brow of the bluff, it struck me as singular that each individual head of
    them appeared to instinctively avoid the vicinity of a small cluster of round bowlders heaped together on the
    plateau. From my position on the bluffs this cluster of dark gray stones forcibly reminded me of a huge nest of the
    fabled roc's eggs, a bird which, you know, played

    these stones the animal suddenly threw up its head, snorted, and with tail erect and every evidence of supreme
    terror, scampered back in the direction of the herd. I also went back and tried to drive them all up to the rock
    pile. Each one broke away when within about the same distance and stampeded up the canyon.</p>

  <h2>Dans une atmosphère étrange</h2>
  <p>"lAnd now occurred the strangest incident connected with my discovery. While watching the retiring cattle my
    attention was attracted to an opaque moving body in the air, which was neither a kite, bird or balloon. Nor was it
    falling directly toward the earth, according to the known laws of gravitation, but sailing in a particular
    horizontal line, curving suddenly when about 800 feet away from the neat of rocks, and descending upon them in the
    arc of a circle. I saw that it was another rock. It impinged upon one of tho larger stones?did not strike it exactly
    on top, but on the side?and there it hung as though cemented to the surface.</p>
  <p>", 'This in an aerolite!' I exclaimed, darting forward to secure my prize. But imagine my sensations when I found
    myself in an entirely new atmosphere. The air was as cool as a refrigerator car in July. Besides this I then
    experienced a strange, prickling sensation throughout my entire body, exactly like a shock from a battery. Passing
    my hand through my hair I discovered that each one was standing out from my head like quills, while my mustache was
    like a bunch of hog's bristles. I ran back to my former position and the phenomena instantly disappeared. I was in
    an atmosphere warmer by thirty degrees?the usual weather of June in that locality. The peculiar conduct of my cattle
    was now partially accounted for. They had been there before me.</p>
</section>

  <h2>La puissance magnétique des pierres</h2>
  <p>"But the appearance of the aerolite, the powerful magnetic attraction of the other stones, this was beyond my
    immediate comprehension, and again I advanced toward them. Again I found myself in the strong electric current. But
    I walked bravely up to the roc's nest. With the new addition there were but eleven stones in all, each about twelve
    inches in diameter, clinging tenaciously together and arranged something like cannon balls in a navy-yard?all except
    the newcomer. They actually hung against the side of the topmost rock. Rising my foot, I kicked it stoutly. It fell
    away to tho distance of three or four feet, and then, to my utter amazement, rolled toward the base of the small
    pyramid and again fastened itself like a leech against a base rock."</p>
  <p>"Magnetism?"</p>
  <p>"Well, yes, I should say so. I concluded to smoke on this mystery, and, having filled my pipe, drew a steel match
    box from my pocket. It left my hand before I had time to open it, flew against one of the rocks with a sharp click,
    and stuck there like a frosted fly to a ceiling. There were no other rocks in the immediate vicinity, and I was

    direction from which I had entered this mysterious arena, I proved that the diameter of the ozonic pathway or belt,
    was In the neighborhood of 100 feet. Indeed, I did not retire a moment too soon, for upon entering the normal
    atmosphere of the valley I fell on the sod in a limp mass. It was fully an hour before I recovered strength
    sufficient to carry me home to my shack.</p>

    mine on my land would have occasioned greater or more pleasurable surprise. My mind was filled with a vague sense of
    tho possibilities of my discovery. It was high noon the next day before I found time to revisit the mysterious
    locality. And then another sensational surprise awaited me. For eight years I had been annoyed by a mild, though
    vexatious, case of salf rheum or eczema, on my left ankle. This disease is accompanied by an almost continuous
    burning sensation. Once only had it in that time disappeared for a brief period, and that was after a long series of
