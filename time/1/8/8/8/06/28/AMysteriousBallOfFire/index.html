<p>NEW YORK, June 27. - A flying ball of fire struck the ground, exploded, and scattered sparks and stones for twenty
  feet in every direction in East Twenty-fifth street, between Second and Third avenues, yesterday. Workmen engaged on a
  new building were paralyzed with fear, and would not return to work for some hours. Dwellers in the neighborhood
  rushed with blanched faces to windows and doors, and pedestrians, who were blinded by the flash of the meteor and
  stunned by the explosion, fled to sheltering doorways or fell horror-stricken where they stood. No lives were lost.
  The sky had rapidly cleared after the first severe thunder shower, and about 1:05

Almost simultaneously a dazzling brilliant sphere, about two\nfeet in diameter and emitting countless white sparks, was seen in the air,\ndescending rapidly.  In its train was a streak of vivid fire like the tail of a\ncomet.  The flying fire-ball came in a southwesterly direction, and was first\nnoticed at about the height of the house-tops.  It struck in a heap of gravel\nbrick, planks and other building material in the gutter facing 219, and sharp\nreports like that of a thousand pistol-shots followed.  There was a strong\nsmell like that accompanying lightning-strokes, and several persons near\nreceived severe electric shocks.  Big sparks flew out and the gravel and bricks\nwere scattered.  The first of the astounded witnesses of the phenomenon to\nrecover his wits was Engineer Barrett, of engine company 16, who had been\nstanding in the doorway of the engine-house a few feet away.  He ran to the\nspot where the fire-ball had struck and found a two-inch plank, burned and\ntwisted, with a hole as clean as if made with an augur bored completely through\nit.  A half-brick was afterward picked up which had been bored in the same way\nas the plank, and probably received the first stroke.  Mrs. Gordon, Mrs. Riley,\nand two other women who were at the dinner-table in the basement of 221, saw\nthe ball descending, and aver that after it struck they saw it rebound past\ntheir window and up into the air again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfont size\u003d\"3\" face\u003d\"Times New Roman\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size:12.0pt\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfont size\u003d\"3\" face\u003d\"Times New Roman\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size:12.0pt\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfont size\u003d\"3\" face\u003d\"Times New Roman\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size:12.0pt\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e  \n\n    \n    \u003cspan width\u003d\"1\" style\u003d\"color:white\"\u003e__._,_.___\u003c/span\u003e\n    \n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n              \u003cspan\u003e\n          \u003ca href\u003d\"https://groups.yahoo.com/group/magonia_exchange/message/5806;_ylc\u003dX3oDMTM1MmRldmRhBF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzEyNTgyODA1BGdycHNwSWQDMTcwNTA4MzY2MwRtc2dJZAM1ODA2BHNlYwNmdHIEc2xrA3Z0cGMEc3RpbWUDMTIwNTcwOTcyMAR0cGNJZAM1ODA2\" target\u003d\"_blank\" onclick\u003d\"return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)\"\u003e",1]  );    //-->
