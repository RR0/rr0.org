<p>A most singular scene was witnessed on Long lake during a storm recently says the <span class="place">Hartford (Conn.)</span>
  <i lang="en">Times</i>. The lake is three miles long, and is divided into three bays. About 3:15 o'clock a vivid flash
  of lightning illuminated the scenery, followed by a terrific peal of thunder. The wind by this time was blowing with
  cyclonic force. Suddenly there came a roar, and far down the lake a huge flame of fire could be seen. The water for
  yards ahead was parted as though by a gigantic plow, and the billows seemed to rise at the side of this furrow of
  fully twenty feet.</p>
<p>The ball of fire seemed to force the water aside, and so deep did it go that the bottom of the lake could almost be
  seen as it passed through the narrows. The parted waters, with their singular propeller, advanced toward the head of
  the lake with great rapidity. When within one hundred yards of the shore there came another flash of lightning, and
  the fire disappeared as suddenly as it had come.</p>
<p>The residents along the lake who witnessed the strange phenomenon were greatly alarmed. They insist that the ball of
  fire was fully ten feet long, and half of the mass appeared to be buried in the waters of the lake. It was many hours
  before the waters of the lake became calm. </p>
