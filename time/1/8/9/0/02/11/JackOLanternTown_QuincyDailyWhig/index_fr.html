</p>
<p>Avez-vous déjà entendu parler des "lumières mouvantes" de la vallée de Lackawanna ? Elles présentent une phase
  intéressante d'un phénomène qui a exercé une influence étrange sur les esprits de nombreuses personnes dans les
  hameaux miniers du nord-est de la Pennsylvanie, et particulièrement dans et autour du village d'Archbald, qui se
  trouve un peu au nord du mi-chemin entre Scranton et Carbondale. La seule mention des "lumières" à un quelconque
  résident d'Archbald suffit à convey the significant meaning which usually attaches in that neighborhood aux mystérieux
  miroitements de minuit qui sont fréquemment vus survolant la rivière peu profonde qui court à travers la ville,
  dérivant le long du versant de la montagne ou flottant au-dessus des sommets des maisons.</p>
<p>Ces lumières mystiques ont été vues à toutes heures de la nuit par des personnes fermement convaincus qu'elles sont
  manifestées par des mains fantômatiques. Une certaine vieille demoiselle qui a souvent vu les "lumières" avers
  solennellement avoir à divers moments observé une chandelle tenue par une main spectrale, et carried swiftly along the
  mountain side and over the house tops in the dead of night. That she saw the light there can be no doubt whatever, but
  the hand was furnished by her imagination?that is certain.</p>
<p>These lights have been seen most frequently emerging from the mouth of an old, abandoned colliery called the
  Sebastopol mine, where it is said several persons met a violent death several years ago. Others have seen them dancing
  across the village graveyard, and others yet at the dilapidated water wheel. It is needless to say that these
  particular landmarks have been regarded with no small degree of awe for years past, but the terror is not so great now
  as it was ten or fifteen years ago, when the "lights" were usually spoken of with bated breath by those who actually
  believed that they were manipulated by the spooks and hobgoblius, who took a sort of flendish delight in frightening
  the poor mortality that were not well versed in the scientific causes from which such phenomena proceed.</p>
<p>The "oldest inhabitants" could of course tell some hair raising stories concerning the ghostly lights and the
  thrilling experiences of the pioneers who encountered them. Among the stories current of bygone days, or rather
  nights, when these haunting lights were first observed, is one of a mysterious glimmer that actually spoke to one of
  the "old settlers" on his way home from the upper end of the village. Of course it was past the midnight hour, "when
  churchyards yawn," and the hero of the adventure, Phil Creban by name, was returning from a raffle with a fine fat
  turkey he had won under his arm. Just as Mr. Creban was passing the "Bottomless mine" a light started up from the
  mouth of the shaft, and, after hovering about for a few seconds, as if undecided as to the course it should take, it
  flickered merrily to his side. Phil Creban was a man of powerful physique and rare courage, but he confessed afterward
  that when he saw the uncanny light keeping him company for a hundred rods or so it made him feel rather shaky. This
  was nothing, however, until the light began to talk to him.</p>
<p>"You are out rather late, Phil, for a man of family," it began.</p>
<p>Thinking silence was golden under the circumstances, Mr. Crehan made no reply, but hastened forward. As he did so the
  light darted ahead of him, and with a laugh, which he described as a "light laugh," it said: "Oh, not so fast, Phil; I
  am not so easily left behind. I see you had good luck at the raffle," said the light rather sarcastically, and as it
  spoke it fastened itself to the head of Mr. Crehan's turkey, giving the gobbler the quaint appearance of having an
  illuminated head.</p>
<p>But this time Phil plucked up some courage, and he replied, with a slight show of temper: "Well, what if I did? I
  don't see that it's any of your business."</p>
<p>"It wouldn't be if you played fair," retorted the light, "but you know you won the turkey by cheating, and if you
  attempt to east the bird it will choke you."</p>
<p>Mr. Crehan knew that his playing had not been entirely fair, but it startled him to think that this flickering
  intangible thing with a voice should be aware of his conduct. The threat of choking so terrified him that he actually
  lost his appetite for turkey. In his desperation he blew at the offending light with all his power of lung, hoping to
  extinguish it, but the result was that instead of going out, as he intended it should, the tiny light burst into a
  great sheet of flame, which entirely enveloped the turkey, and Mr. Crehan in his terror flung away the blazing bird
  and ran home as fast as he could. Instantly the light disappeared, leaving the darkness more intense than ever, and
  there was a loud peal of mocking laughter which echoed all along the mountains.</p>
<p>When next Phil Crehan met the men who were interested with him at the raffle he noticed that they grinned rather
  suspiciously when they asked hom how he enjoyed his turkey, but he did not care about investigating the matter any
  further, as his recollection of his experience with the spooky light was anything but pleasant.</p>
<p>The queer lights have been seen by scores of others, and a good many believe that they are carried about by spooks
  and hobgoblins. Those who made a study of the movements of the luminous visitors noticed that they were frequently
  observed moving from a lonely spot where a man was found dead, to a dilapidated shanty in which a poor woman was
  burned to death some years ago. Another favorite spot for the lights was around the haunted dwelling in which a widow
  was found dead in her bed. Other equally grewsome scenes are mentioned, including the bottomless shaft, in which a
  party of men were drowned long ago and which is situated at the foot of the abrupt slope called Dutch Hill.</p>
<p>The mystery of the haunting lights is easily explained. They are nothing more nor less than the old fashioned
  will-o'-the-wisp, sometimes spoken of a the ignus fatuus. They arise from the gases generated in the old mines, where
  the decaying timber of the props and other prolific causes contribute to their existence. Rising out of the mines at
  night and floating about like tiny comets, they present a strange study and are well calculated to strike fear to the
  stoutest heart. The town of Archbald is probably not more subject to these luminous visitants than other mining towns,
  but its sheltered situation between two hills gives it special opportunities for studying the phenomenon that has
  given rise to many a ghost story and weird tradition.?Scranton Cor. New York Times. </p>
