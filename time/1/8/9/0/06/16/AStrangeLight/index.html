<p> Last night a mysterious light was observed by many citizens passing over Atlanta from the western to the eastern
  horizon. It appeared about the size of the gas-jet flame, and beamed brightly, even in the clouds that obscured the
  horizon.</p>
<p> No one knew what it was, but the general belief was that it was a toy balloon carrying a candle. It created a small
  sensation as it slowly passed over the city and went down in the western suburbs.</p>
