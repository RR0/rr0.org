<p class="abstract">A Remarkable Story Comes from Clifton, Indiana.</p>
<p><span class="place">LIBERTY, Ind.</span>, Feb. 1. - A very strange occurrence was reported here yesterday by Ben
  Snyder, correspondent for
  the statistic bureau at Washington. Upon investigation it was proven to be a fact by other reliable men from the same
  place, near Clifton, in this county.</p>
<p>Wednesday [January 27] there came a cold, sleety rain, and with it came a shower of worms which were curiosities, for
  nothing like them has ever been seen in this part of the country. They were about an inch in length, of a dark brown
  color, and had six legs, which were well to the front of the body, the body being as large around as a ten-penny wire
  nail. Under the microscope it was found that the body of the worm was covered with very fine hair, and had eyes
  similar to a fly, so numerous that it was impossible to count them. The shower covered an area of five miles.</p>
