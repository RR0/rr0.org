<p class="abstract">A Strange Sight.</p>
<p>[excerpt]</p>
<p><span class="place">PARIS, Tex</span>., June 15. &ndash; Buckhorn, a full-blood Cherokee Indian who lives near <span
    class="place">Tahlequah</span>, who has the reputation of a man of veracity, relates the following as a fact, which
  was witnessed by himself and six others:</p>
<p>On last Saturday night [June 4] we had a little dance at a neighbor's house, and on Sunday morning as we started home
  &ndash; myself and five others &ndash; we saw in the west a yellow cloud rise, having all the appearance of a thunder
  head. This cloud had an apparently tumbling motion. When the cloud got nearly overhead one of the boys said: "Look at
  that strange sight in the heavens." We looked up and saw a wonderful sight indeed. By this time the front edge
  of the cloud had passed the zenith moving north, and directly in the rear of the front edge there were eight brilliant
  stars or meteors moving in the same direction in which the storm cloud was moving. There were two rows of these
  meteors and four stars or meteors in a row, making eight meteors in a row. These meteors moved along slowly, and at
  regular intervals would appear to quickly revolve or tumble, and at the moment of the tumbling motion brilliant
  flashes of yellow light would emit from them. By the time we had got about 250 yards away these eight meteors had
  disappeared toward the northeast. Then two others were seen near the earth, apparently a little above the tree tops.
  One of these last named meteors seemed to be coming straight toward us. These eight meteors, together with the two in
  the rear, moved apparently about two feet and then quickly tumbled and emptied flashes of brilliant yellow light. This
  occurred on the morning of June 5, 1892, about 6 o'clock. Starr Crittenden, one of Buckhorn's crowd who saw this
  phenomenon, confirms the statement with this addition, however, that the meteors were seen through a black cloud that
  moved in front of the yellow cloud. He also says that there were eight of these stars and that they threw out flashes
  of brilliant yellow light. One of the eight persons who saw this sight was Mrs. Pumpkin, who saw it from her home near
  by.</p>
