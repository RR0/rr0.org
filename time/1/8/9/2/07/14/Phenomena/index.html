<p class="abstract">Strange Sight in the Northern Heaven's Last Evening.</p>
<p>A peculiar phenomenon was seen last evening in the northern sky. It first appeared soon after nine o'clock as two
  bright spots in the northeast and the northwest. The spots soon broadened out extending toward each other until they
  formed one vast rainbow of light that completely encircled the heavens. Later the phenomenon assumed another phase and
  great streams of wavy light flowed up from the north and played hide and seek among the shadows of the atmosphere. It
  was a pretty sight, one of the strangest features of which was its seemingly close proximity to the earth, the waves
  of light being apparently only just above the tree tops. The sight was witnessed by a large number of people. How late
  it continued no one seems to know, but it was seen long after midnight. It is believed to be some form of the aurora
  which of late has executed several phenomenal wonders somewhat similar, though not so extensive as the scene of last
  evening.

<p>This seems to be a period of phenomena. Only recently the moon became quite frisky, appearing at one time in the form
  of a crescent at the intersection of a perfect figure in the form of a cross. Again it appeared in the border instead
  of the center of the halo that surrounded it. Just now it is engaged in a series of maneuvering with the planet
  Mars.</p>
