<p>WAXAHACHIE, Tex., Aug. 31. &ndash; A strange and unaccountable object was noticed about 11 o'clock last night moving
  through the air in a northwesterly direction, but so far THE NEWS reporter cannot find any one willing to stake his
  reputation for wisdom by giving the thing a name. Several persons were aroused from sleep by hearing a man halloa [cry
  out a greeting]. On getting up they discovered a strange object moving along at some distance above the housetops. The
  "what is it&rdquo; was as large [as] or larger than a sugar hogshead and seemed to be a kind of balloon. One witness
  says there were several colored lights attached to the thing. The halloaing undoubtedly proceeded from the airship,
  indicating that a man was taking an aerial voyage. The wonder was seen passing over the northern part of the city and
  was witnessed by persons at least a quarter of a mile apart. Nobody knows how far it traveled or the nature of its
  mission. Those who saw it are responsible, truthful people.</p>
