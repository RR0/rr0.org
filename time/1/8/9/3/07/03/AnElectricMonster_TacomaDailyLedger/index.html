<p class="abstract2"> W. L. McDonald Struck Senseless in Attempting to Rescue a Shocked Comrade
</p>
<p class="abstract2"> Nearly 150 Feet Long and Covered With Coarse Hair--A Fishing Party’s Trip Cut Short
</p>
<p>A party of Tacoma gentlemen have good reason to remember the morning of the 2nd of July as long as life remains in
  their bodies--and to quote the exact words of one of the party, "There are denziens (sic) of the ocean that man never,
  in his most horrible and fantastic nightmare, even saw the likes of."
</p>
<p>On Saturday morning a party, composed of the following well known gentlemen, set sail on the sloop “Marion” from the
  boat house at the end of the wharf for a three days' fishing and hunting excursion on the Sound. The party consisted
  of Auctioneer William Fitzhenry, H. L. Beal, W. L. McDonald, J. K. Bell, Henry Blackwood, and two eastern gentlemen
  who are visiting the coast, and it is from the lips of one of these gentlemen, who declines to allow his name to be
  used, as he says that shortly before he left the east he took the Keeley cure, and he fears that if his name was used
  in connection with this article, his eastern friends might think he had “gone back” and got 'em again.
</p>
<p>The party were well supplied with all the necessaries of life, as well as an abundance of its luxuries, though it
  must not be inferred from this fact that the luxuries played any part in creating the sights seen on that memorable
  morning. Of course, as a person having much respect for truth, I merely chronicle the story as told me, and leave each
  reader of this remarkable yarn to judge for themselves the necessary amount of credence to give it.
</p>
<p>"We left Tacoma," said the eastern man, "about 4:30 p. m., Saturday, July 1st, and as the wind was from the
  southeast, we shaped our course for Point Defiance, intending to anchor off that point and try our luck with rod and
  line. We cast anchor about 6 o'clock, the wind having died out, and had fair success fishing. The wind coming up again
  pretty strong, Mr. McDonald suggested getting under way for Black Fish Bay, Henderson Island, as he knew of a fine
  trout stream running into the bay and also an excellent camping place near the fishing ground. So about 8 o'clock we
  weighed anchor and shaped our course for Black Fish Bay, which place we reached about 9:30. We landed and made
  everything snug about the boat and made a nice camp on shore, and as it was by this time 11 o'clock, we all turned in
  to get a little sleep as it was agreed upon that at the first streak of daylight we should all get up. About 100 yards
  from our camp was the camp of a surveying party, but as it was so late, we decided that we would not disturb them but
  that we would call upon them the followingmorning, and would probably get some valuable pointers as to the best places
  to fish and hunt on the island. After a few jokes had been cracked, the boys laid down and in a short time everything
  about camp became as still as death. It was, I guess, about midnight before I fell asleep, but exactly how long I
  slept, I cannot say, for when I woke, it was with such startling suddenness that it never entered my mind to look at
  my watch, and when after awhile I did look at my watch, as well as every watch belonging to the party, it was stopped.
  <span class="note">In Ufology the presence of a UFO is usually accentuated by the effect on instruments affected by an electromagnetic
  field. The watch being magnetized would indicate the possibility of a UFO or at least an object of strong
  electromagnetic force.</span>
</p>
<p>“I am afraid, sir, that you willfail to comprehend how suddenly that camp was awoke.
</p>
<p>"Since the creation of the world, I doubt if sounds and sights more horrible were ever seen or heard by mortal man.
  I was in the midst of a pleasant dream when, in an instant, a most horrible noise rang out in the clear morning air,
  <span class="note">(unusual in a ufological sense, but the sound of an electric generator, which I would think to be uncommon at that
  period, MIGHT be a cause as it is heard in some up-close UFO cases)</span> and instantly the whole air was filled with
  a strong current of electricity that caused every nerve in the body to sting with pain, and a light as bright as that
  created by the concentration of many arc lights kept constantly flashing. <span class="note">(There are many cases that mimic this
  scenario. Comments such as hair standing on end because of the electronic effect are well documented. The event,
  taking place at night, again introduces the ionized air effect that causes UFOs to glow at night in various colors due
  to power settings [See: Unconventional Flying Objects by NASA scientist Paul Hill])</span> At first I thought it was a
  thunder storm, but as no rain accompanied it, and as both light and sound came from off the bay, l turned my head in
  that direction, and if it is possible for fright to turn one's hair white, then mine ought to be snow white, for right
  before my eyes was a most horrible looking monster.” By this time every man in our camp, as well as the men from the
  camp of the surveyors, were gathered on the bank of the stream, and as soon as we could gather our wits together we
  began to question if what we were looking at was not the creation of the mind, but we were soon disburdened of this
  idea, for the monster slowly drew in toward the shore, and as it approached, from its head poured out a stream of
  water that looked like blue fire. <span class="note">(I have at least three cases where water was pushed forward, not by the UFO per say,
  but by its surrounding field. It led to boats being almost swamped by water and in another case by two people on the
  beach almost sucked into the sea by the undertow caused by the water forced towards them. The coloration of the water,
  “looked like blue fire”, MIGHT be explained by the coloration of the UFO at the time of sighting or its described “arc
  lights.”)</span> All the while the air seemed to befilled with electricity, and the sensation experienced was as if
  each man had on a suit of clothes formed of the fine points of needles <span class="note">(Again, as above, static or other electric effects as
  previously mentioned)</span>. One of the men from the surveyor's camp incautiously took a few steps in the direction
  of the water, and as he did so the monster darted towards the shore and threw a stream of water that reached the man,
  and he instantly fell to the ground and lay as though dead.
</p>
<p>"Mr. McDonald attempted to reach the man's body to pull it back into a place of safety, but he was struck with some
  of the water that the monster was throwing and fell senseless to the earth. By this time every man in both
  partieswaspanic-stricken, and we rushed to the woods for a place of safety, leaving the fallen men lying on the beach.
  <span class="note">(As will be seen later, the men were not harmed, but evidently suffered from an electric shock. Again, the field of
  the UFO is evidently an electronic manifestation and affects all things that come in contact with it – and, in this
  case, water is a good conductor.)</span>
</p>
<p>"As we reached the woods the 'demon of the deep’ sent out flashes of light that illuminated the surrounding country
  for miles, <span class="note">(illumination that is noted in many UFO cases)</span> and his roar--which sounded like
  the roar of thunder--became terrific. When we reached the woods we looked around and saw the monster making off in the
  direction of the Sound, and in an instant, it disappeared beneath the waters of the bay, but for some time we were
  able to trace its course by a bright luminous light that was on the surface of the water. <span class="note">(It disappeared “beneath the waters” and was traceable by
  a luminous light that was “on the surface of the water.” This is the text of several cases where a UFO either enters
  or exits the water. A solid light <span class="note">(not of the light wheel category)</span> is seen over or under the sea and is referred to
  as being seen “through” the surface.)</span> As the fish disappeared total darkness surrounded us, and it took us some
  time to find our way back to the beach where our comrades lay, and we were unable to tell the time, as the powerful
  electric force had stopped our watches. We eventually found McDonald and the other man and were greatly relieved to
  find that they were alive, though unconscious. So we sat down to await the coming of daylight. It came, I should
  judge, in about half an hour, and by this time, by constant work on the two men, both were able to stand, and both
  agree that the moment the water the monster threw touched them, they became immediately unconscious." On being asked
  to give some description of the fish, for it was, he said, "an electrical fish,” the eastern man said:
</p>
<p>"This monster fish, or whatever you may call it, was fully 150 feet long, and at its thickest part I should judge
  about thirty feet in circumference. <span class="note">(I would think that he would have meant “diameter.”)</span> Its
  shape was somewhat out of the ordinary in so far that the body was neither round nor flat but
  oval, <span class="note">(These dimensions are quite common in
  ufology, and if the shape he mentions is that of the length, it then fits quite nicely into the “cigar shape,” which
  is so familiar to us.)</span> and from what we could see, the upper part of the body was covered with a very coarse
  hair. The head was shaped very much like the head of a walrus, though, of course, very much larger. Its eyes, of which
  it apparently had six, <span class="note">(six eyes on a nautical creature? or are these possibly windows?)</span>
  were as large around as a dinner plate and were exceedingly dull, and it was about the only spot on the monster that
  at one time or another was not illuminated. At intervals of about every eight feet from its head to its tail, a
  substance that had the appearance of a copper band encircled its body, and it was from these many bands that the
  powerful electric current appeared to come. The bands nearest the head seemed to have the strongest electric force,
  and it was from the first six bands that the most brilliant lights were emitted. Near the center of its head were two
  large horn-like substances, though they could not have been horns for it was through them that the electrically
  charged water was thrown <span class="note">(or appeared to be
  thrown)</span>.
</p>
<p>"Its tail, from what I could see of it, was shaped like a propeller and seemed to revolve, and it may be possible
  that the strange monster pushes himself through the water by means of this propeller like tail. <span class="note">(This neither fits a
  nautical species nor a UFO)</span>
</p>
<p>"At will this strange monstrosity seemed to be able to emit strong waves of electric current, giving off an electro
  motive force which causes any person coming within the radius of this force to receive an electro
  tonus <span class="note">[Dictionary –
  The ability of a muscle to contract in response to a stimulus]</span>. This fish probably receives its power from some
  submarine cavern of volcanic origin which owing to its peculiar construction, and having an extra large deposit of
  copper, it charges the fish that inhabit that region with a strong electric force that is displayed by this peculiar
  specimen. The peculiar shaped copper-like bands may be caused by the strong magnetic force of the fish and the copper
  deposits of the ocean, as the strong current would form the copper into a solution, whilst the strong attraction of
  the fish would naturally form an electric battery, drawing towards it this solution, thus forming deposits on the
  fish, so that in reality the electric fish is completely encompassed in copper, and its rapid movement through the
  water is constantly generating frictional electricity, which, I should judge, would in a measure account for the fish
  being so constantly and powerfully charged with electricity, though far from its original source of supply. One of the
  strange characteristics of this fish, and one by which it undoubtedly obtains its food, is its high electric control
  of dense and foggy atmosphere surrounding it, which amalgamates with the electrification of the fish, making a
  potential which causes any living creature, such as birds or insects, flying through the air to fall dead into the
  water. Of course, that is merely a theory, and I may be mistaken as to its origin or where it goes to, but one thing I
  do know, that I would not encounter the same monster again for the universe, and you can ask the rest of the party and
  you will find that they all agree with me, that to be within so short a distance of such a terrible monster and yet
  live to tell the story is something that only happens once in 1000 years. I hardly need to tell you that we were not
  long in getting under way for Tacoma, and I can assure you that I have no further desire to fish any more in the
  waters of this bay. There are too many peculiar inhabitants in them. I am going to send a full account of our
  encounter to the Smithsonian Institute, and I doubt not but what they will send out some scientific chaps to
  investigate.
</p>
<p>"Now I must be going, as I have to leave on tonight's train, but if you need any further particulars you can obtain
  them from any of the party. No, I do not know who composed the survey party; all I know about them is that they are
  from Olympia and that they were on the island running farm lines on some disputed land.”
