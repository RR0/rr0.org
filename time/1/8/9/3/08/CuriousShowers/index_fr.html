<p>En août de l'année dernière les habitants de <span class="place">Bjelina, en Bosnie</span>, reçurent un phénomène
  méteorologique assez inhabituel sous la forme d'une pluie de poissons qui accompagna un violent orage venu du
  nord-ouest. L'aspect le plus étrange de l'événement était que les poissons étaient vivants et ressemblaient à des
  whitings, et qu'ils avaient été pris dans les caniveaux par les enfants, et apportés des champs par des paysans
  interrogateurs, des prairies et des routes. Possibly, had there been scarcity in the neighborhood, this curious shower
  would have been hailed as a direct intervention of Providence on behalf of the inhabitants ; but, as there seems to
  have been no distress, there is no knowing what they thought comparatively rare, is explicable on perfectly natural
  grounds. The fish were undoubtedly taken up into the air by a waterspout, carried along by atmospheric currents, and
  dropped, as it happened, over the village of Bjelina. They had not been held 'in suspension,', so to speak, for long,
  because the fish were alive when they fell to the ground.</p>
<p>But mere distance from a large expanse of water does not count, for these fish-showers are known to have occured many
  hundreds of miles away from the nearest coast. In South America, some years ago, a tract of country forty-three miles
  square was found thick with fish ; and?to omit a host of other such instances abroad?in England on at least one
  occasion some pasture-land a considerable distance from the sea was found strewn with bushels of small fishes. We know
  ourselves of a shower of fish-bones which fell only last year in the hear of Wales. Such showers are frequent enough
  at sea, and every sailor can tell of their occurence. Mariners can laso tell of showers of dust, of small animals, or
  of plants falling upon their vessels thousands of miles out on the ocean. These are explained on much the same
  principle as the fish-showers on land, with the substitution of a sandspout for a waterspout.</p>
<p>Mud-showers and frog-showers, of which we hear rather frequently, are caused in the same way. M. Peltier has put a
  frog-shower on record as having happened within his own experience. He speaks of seeing the frogs fall on the roofs of
  the houses, and rebound from thence on to the pavement below. A mud-shower occured along the Union Pacific Railway at
  Onaga on the 4th of April 1892. The rain, we are assured, commenced early in the day. and soon the south and east
  sides of all the houses were covered with yellow clay. A Union Pacific train which ran through the storm had its
  windows covered ; and the headlight was so completely plastered that the light was shut in, and the train ran in
  darkness into Rossville, where the mud had to be scraped off. As far east as Topeka the windows showed that the edge
  of the mud-storm had extended this far. It is said to have been even more severe fifty miles north-west.</p>
<p>Blood rain and black rain are only variation of this phenomenon. Of the latter, we hear nothing worth speaking of
  nowadays ; but an almost historic shower of this sort fell at Montreal in the earlier part of this century, and
  enveloped the then youthful city in a black pall, which must have been worse than a prime London fog, seeing that it
  gave the inhabitants the idea that the last day had come, or was at least on the point of coming. "Blood" rain is
  caused by the presence of infinitely little plants, animalcules, or minerals in the globules. In one instance of a
  shower that fell at Bristol and in the Bristol Channel, the analytical examination showed that the red colour was due
  to ivy-berry seeds. In medieval times, blood rain was a prodigy ; in the East it was connected with the belief that
  man was produced from blood that fell from heaven.</p>
<p>It was a portent as remarkable as the 'bloody host,' which, while it flourished, probably caused the death of more
  Jews in this country than any other individual superstition directed against that people. It is described as an
  appearance of blood flowing from bread when bitten ;' but it manifested itself in other articles of food besides
  bread, and sometimes seemed to drop from the air. It will be remembered by historical readers that while Alexander was
  besieging Ture, this prodigy and the other one of 'blood rain' occured in one day, much to the consternation of the
  soldiers.</p>
<p>More curious than blood rain in regard to the mere colour was the red, violet, and grass-green shower which fell in
  the south of France many years ago, and made a patchwork of the big lake, whereon its manifestation was the more
  noticeable. This shower, again, was caused by untold myriads of differently-coloured animalcules.</p>
<p>Spider-showers are another curiosity worthy of mention in this connection. The spiders are gossamers ; and all those
  who have read White's <em>Natural History of Selborne</em> will call to mind his description of the showers he
  observed. One of these, he tells us, continued nearly a whole day, and the gossamers descended from a surprising
  height ; for when one gentleman ascended a hill near at hand, some three hundred feet high, he found that the spiders
  were dropping from a region in the atmosphere that was still beyond the reach of his gaze. Dr Martin Lister named his
  aerial spider 'the bird,' from the facility with which it can traverse the air ; and upon one occasion, when he
  observed a shower of them at York, he ascended to the top of the Minster, and found that even at that altitude he was
  still below their level?that they were descending from some region above that standpoint. Darwin, another observer of
  spider-showers, describes one which he saw in 1832, when on board the <em>Beagle</em>, at the mouth of the La Plata
  River, when the vessel was some sixty miles from land ; and he seems to have been the first to notice that each
  parachute of gossamer carried a spider aeronaut, for he not only observed them arrive on board the ship, but he also
  saw them reproduce a new parachute, and on this frail bark launch forth again 'on the bosom of the palpitating air.'
</p>
<p>These gossamer showers are great mysteries, and once seen, cannot very readily be forgotten ; for the air on these
  occasions becomes literally crowded with the tiny parachutes mentioned, which are composed of a few threads of almost
  invisible gossamer, with a small but lively spider attached. This may be regarded as the most beautiful thing in
  strange showers.</p>
<p>The most marvellous, perhaps, is manifested in the way of hail-showers?that is, if we are to take for truth all we
  hear on this head. There is no reason in the world to doubt the assertion that hailstones, like rain, have been known
  to fall from a perfectly cloudless sky. But those of little faith may very well doubt the stories that have been told
  about the size of the stones themselves. Bluish hailstones weighing one hundred pounds each are said, by Count de
  Mezeray, to have fallen in Italy in the year 1510. Hailstones 'as big as a man's fist' are almost as common as
  potatoes. A storm that occured in 1809 is said to have broken over two hundred thousand panes of glass in London alone
  ; and in Hertfordshire, another storm is reported to have caused the death of several people. Blocks of ice weighing
  four and a half pounds fell at Cazorla, in Spain, on June 5, 1829 ; and in the south of France, in October 1844, other
  blocks fell which turned the scale at eleven pounds. </p>
