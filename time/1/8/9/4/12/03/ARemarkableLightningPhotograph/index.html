<p>Mr. Cowper Ranyard, the British scientist, who is making a collection of photographs of lightning flashes, has
  recently obtained a very remarkable one from an amateur photographer of Newcastle-on-Tyne. It is a perfect image of
  one of the rarest of electric phenomena?a clear-cut flash of "ball lightning." It is said to be the only photograph of
  such a thing ever made. The luminous spot on the plate bears a strong resemblance to the disk of a sunflower, being a
  plain circle of light, surrounded by numerous tongues of flame shooting from the periphery of the wheel in every
  direction. Besides the image of the main flash, the plate is streaked and speckled with many smaller luminosities,
  supposed to be pictures of stray points of electricity that have separated from the main ball. </p>
