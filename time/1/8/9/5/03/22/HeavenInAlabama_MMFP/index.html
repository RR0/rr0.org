<p> Montgomery, Ala., March 21.?Many persons have recently witnessed a remarkable manifestation in Jas. Regdon's
  cottage, near the state line in Cheetaw county. Each occurence has begun with loud rumbling, which upon reaching the
  roof of the cottage dies away into a continous ticking as of a telegraph instrument. Upon one occasion when a child
  feel asleep in bed, the ticking began upon the floor, suddenly a stream of light penetrated the floor and enveloped
  the sleeping child. When she awoke she said she had been in heaven and that the Saviour had told her he had manifested
  himself in the ticking upon the roof. The phenomenon is regarded by pastors as a miracle and is bringing hundreds to
  conversion in that neighborhood. </p>
