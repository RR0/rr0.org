<p> The day before yesterday we received a telegram sent by an amateur journalist. He informed us that David Schwarz
  from Zagreb has invented an airship which he hopes he could direct on his own free will. The inventor is now finishing
  his airship on Tempelhof field near Berlin. The huge airship is built out of aluminium alloy, the composition of which
  is being kept secret by the inventor. The first test with that airship will be carried out on 27th of this month, when
  the German general staff returns from the inspection trip to Vienna .<span class="note">The launch will be postponed to 10-08, as the emperor Wilhelm could not be available on 09-27</span>
