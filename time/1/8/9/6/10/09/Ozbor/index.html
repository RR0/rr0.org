<p>Yesterday, on Thursday, October 8th 1896, Schwarz's airship managed to lift only a few metres above the ground, while
  the soldiers were holding it with ropes. It is said that the gas used in the airship was bad, and thus the airship
  could not perform as expected. It was decided that the airship would be filled once again with good gas and
  tested.</p>
