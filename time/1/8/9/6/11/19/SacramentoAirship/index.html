<p class="abstract"> Was It an Air-Ship or a Will-o'-the-Wisp?<br> Stories That are Floating Around Concerning the
  Supposed Floating Visitor.</p>
<p>Regarding the aerial visitor that passed over Sacramento Tuesday evening, and which was described at the time as
  being a pure white light of about double the power of an electric arc light, many queer stories are told.</p>
<p>Whether the light was a meteor, or attached to a balloon, or whether it was a genuine flying machine, is not
  positively known, though ninety-nine out of 100 men in the city regard the matter in the light of a huge hoax. The
  stories told by some of the parties who saw the light follow, and the reader can pay his money and take his
  choice:</p>
<p>R. L. Lowry, who was formerly in the employ of the street railway company in this city, but who has been absent for
  some time and only recently returned, says he was near East Park and saw the apparatus when it was not more than fifty
  feet from the ground. He declared that the machine was cigar-shaped and was operated by four men who sat aside the
  cigar and moved as though they were working their passage on a bicycle. He stated that the machine was fitted with
  wing-like propellers after the fashion of those of an ocean steamer.</p>
<p>T. P. De Long, whose residence is not mentioned in the city directory, said he saw the light and heard voices, but
  couldn't hear what was said.</p>
<p>Daniel Curl, a horse-trainer, is authority for the statement that he not only saw the light, but heard someone
  suggest that "they go up higher."</p>
<p>F. E. Briggs, a motorman on a G-street car, said he saw the light and called attention to it. His passengers
  requested him to stop, which he did. He heard singing which appeared to come from the direction of the light, and
  seemed to be wafted down in gusts</p>
<p>M. F. Shelley, a motorman on a G-street car, saw the light and heard a voice shouting orders.</p>
<p>C. H. Lusk, Secretary of the street-car company, noticed the light. He said it had an up-and-down and side-to-side
  motion.</p>
<p>G. C. Snider, foreman of the street-car barn, saw the light, and gave it as his opinion that it was an aerial machine
  of some kind.</p>
<p>Frank A. Ross, Assistant Manager of the street railway company, said he had talked with many persons concerning the
  matter, and, having seen the light, is fully assured that it was some kind of a flying machine.</p>
<p>Thomas Allen stated very seriously that a flying machine, the invention of a citizen of Sacramento, actually did
  ascend from the vicinity of Oak Park, and that four men, among whom was Nat Liebling, ascended with it. The machine,
  he related, was fastened to the earth with a cable, which broke and let the aerial wonder float away. It would not,
  owing to a defect in the steering apparatus, be guided, and sailed around at random. First it made for Suisun, but
  after having accomplished half the journey veered around, once more passed over the city, and is now at a point near
  Arcade Station, ten miles northeast of this city.</p>
<p>It puzzles one to understand how the machine could have started from Oak Park, which is southeast of the city, and
  passed over from the northeast to the southwest, and it is also puzzling to know how Nat Liebling could have taken
  such a wild, wild ride, when he was seen near the Postoffice only two hours later.</p>
<p>There are other puzzling things also, but the average citizen will choose what he wishes, and the burning question
  still is, "What was it?"</p>
