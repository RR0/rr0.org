<p> Says it is Operated by a Combination of Compressed Air and Electricity. A letter received here from an
  ex-Portlander, now engaged on one of the San Francisco newspapers, vouches most seriously for the existence of the
  California airship, conspicuously advertised by the San Francisco press, but which elsewhere is being stigmatized as a
  "fake." The writer enjoys such an exceptionally good reputation for his earnestness of purpose and veracity, that it
  justifies the publication of his statement. The letter is penned in a confidential strain to a friend, which is the
  only circumstance precluding the announcement of the writer's name. He says that he has had ocular proof of the
  existence of this aerial contrivance which must, in the course of a few years, completely revolutionize the mode of
  travel on this globe. And the rapidity with which distances can be reached, he adds, will render the earth a
  comparatively small area of land and water.</p>
<p> "Through the medium of a mutual friend." continued the sanguine newspaper man, "I personally met the inventor of
  this airship -- a man destined by his creation to revolutionize our entire social fabric. Do not think that I have
  gone daft upon this subject; but what the eye sees and that which the hand feels, must certainly have an existence.
  You will not gainsay me that? Before proceeding I wish to say that the reason why I have not exhaustively written upon
  this subject for the paper I represent, is that we have a regular scientific man on our staff, and no one meddles with
  the assignments or details of another."</p>
<p>Continuing his communication the writer says that he became acquainted with the inventor of the airship
  unprofessionally, in the Redwoods of San Mateo county, Cal., about 10 days ago. There he also saw the airship in which
  he himself, his friend, and the inventor took a flight that night.</p>
<p>"A sense of honor, founded upon a promise I made to my host on that occasion," says the writer, "precludes me from
  giving you a description in detail of this most wonderful invention of this civilization. Do I wonder that the people,
  the masses, are skeptical? No! For didn't they doubt the possibilities of such geniuses as Fulton and Morse?</p>
<p>"The newspaper cuts I have so far seen of this ship are not fair reproductions of the original. But some of the
  descriptive articles I have recently seen come near solving the scientific features of the ship.</p>
<p>"The airship in which I made my ascent is 22 feet long, 7 feet of beam, as we would term it in nautical parlance, and
  7&frac12; feet high from the ground. It is merely a rough model for experimental purposes, devoid of all the elegant
  and comfortable interior fittings later airships planned after this model will contain."</p>
<p>The master of the air, the writer adds, which has solved the problem of controlling the many and strong counter
  currents prevailing at a height of a mile or more above the surface of the earth, is mainly operated with a
  combination of compressed air and electricity. The storage-room for this motive power does not take up more than two
  cubic feet. He adds that the most remarkable feature in connection with this marvelous invention is an apparatus by
  means of which the breathing atmosphere may be normalized. For instance, at a height of 10 miles or more above the air
  inside of the ship, can be made as dense as it is on the earth's surface. Again, the ship may plow through space at a
  speed of 500 miles an hour, and the normal breathing of those within the ship will not in the least be discomforted.
  The night herein referred to, the writer and his friends went to Los Angeles and returned, at an altitude of five
  miles, as shown by the air meter, and when they came back to the starting point, they felt as buoyant and refreshed as
  if they had had a good night's rest. While no one in Portland, well acquainted with the writer would for a moment
  question his truthfulness, yet none here will believe in the existence of that marvelous airship until he or she sees
  it, and that in full operation, too.</p>
