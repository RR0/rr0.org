  <h2>Is It Used in the Newly Discovered Air Ship?</h2>
  <p>It will be remembered that some years ago a man discovered a wonderful metal in Pine Nut, Nevada. This peculiar
    metal was contained in clay and the man discovered it by using some of the clay for a back to his stove. Some hours
    after building a fire in the stove he found that the back had disappeared and in place of it was a clear white metal
    with scarcely any weight to it. </p>
  <p>Now the man who discovered and used that metal was in Oroville yesterday. In fact he has been here a number of
    days. He does not want his name published but we met him and talked with him for fifteen or twenty minutes. We do
    not know of course whether he has anything to do with this mysterious air ship or not, but if there was any truth in
    the report of the wonderful metal discovery it is possible that he has kept the secret and used the new metal in
    constructing this wonderful floating ship.</p>
