<p class="abstract"> A Conductor and Three Passengers Positive They Saw It</p>
<p class="abstract2">About a Thousand Feet High, traveling Faster Than the Train and in the Direction of Alameda</p>
<p>DAVISVILLE, December 7. -- Conductor Corbell, who runs a freight train on the main line, was here this morning and
  told an interesting story about seeing an airship.</p>
<p>Last Friday evening [December 4] his train ran into Oakland. While between Dixon and Elmira, and between 6:30 and 7
  o'clock, a man named Byrns, who was riding in the caboose, saw two bright lights to the right of the track and
  traveling parallel with the train.</p>
<p>After watching it a few minutes he called the conductor. The phenomenon was so unusual that the conductor called two
  men traveling on the train in charge of some stock. These four men saw the lights distinctly and their stories agree
  perfectly. They were about one thousand feet high and traveling in the same direction as the train. Their speed was
  greater than that of the train, however, and they watched the lights until they disappeared in the southwestern
  heavens.</p>
<p>One of the lights was as large as the head light of an engine. One of the stockmen offered to wager two carloads of
  fat cattle that there was no delusion about it but that it was a genuine airship.</p>
<p>George Little and his wife, of Davisville, partially confirm this story. A few minutes after six o'clock they saw
  something in the air that tallies exactly with the description given by the conductor.</p>
