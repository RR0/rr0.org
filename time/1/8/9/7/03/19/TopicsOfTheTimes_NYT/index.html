<p>That mysterious airship which some months ago disturbed the minds?or dreams?of people living in the far West has
  appeared again, this time at Omaha. The vessel, therefore, has not been in dry dock all this time, but seems to be
  making its way eastward by easy flights. It still has an electric headlight for the only distinctly visible feature,
  but nothing is now said about the strains of music that used to be heard, and the aerial passengers no longer drop
  overboard empty bottles to dash themselves and the hopes of thirsty night wanderers to pieces on the ground. One Omaha
  observer says: "We thought at first that it was a balloon, but if there is such a thing as an airship, I believe that
  this was one. There was a bright light about a foot diameter, and some of us who saw it thought that we could
  distinguish some dark body below the light, but we might have been mistaken in that." They might, indeed, they
  might. </p>
