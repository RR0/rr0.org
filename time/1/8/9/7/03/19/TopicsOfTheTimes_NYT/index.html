    </tr></table><p>That mysterious airship which some months ago disturbed the minds?or dreams?of people living in the
    far West has appeared again, this time at Omaha. The vessel, therefore, has not been in dry dock all this time, but
    seems to be making its way eastward by easy flights. It still has an electric headlight for the only distinctly
    visible feature, but nothing is now said about the strains of music that used to be heard, and the aerial passengers
    no longer drop overboard empty bottles to dash themselves and the hopes of thirsty night wanderers to pieces on the
    ground. One Omaha observer says: "We thought at first that it was a balloon, but if there is such a thing as an
    airship, I believe that this was one. There was a bright light about a foot diameter, and some of us who saw it
    thought that we could distinguish some dark body below the light, but we might have been mistaken in that." They
    might, indeed, they might. </p>
