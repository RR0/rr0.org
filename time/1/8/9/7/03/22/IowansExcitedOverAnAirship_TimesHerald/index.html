<p class="abstract">Aerial Mystery Floats About in the Neighborhood of Sioux City Every Evening</p>
<p>Sioux City, Iowa, March 21. - Those who wish to see Sioux City"s air ship should be out between 9 and 11 p.m.
  with their telescopes covering the heavens between Smith"s Villa addition and the Nebraska side of the Big Muddy. </p>
<p>It was seen three weeks ago by train crews on the Sioux City L Road. Twice after that the same men had glimpses of
  the machine. Now several residents of the western part of the city claim to have been added to the list. </p>
<p>The witnesses do not insist that the aerial mystery is an air ship, but they positively deny that it can be a
  balloon. It is evidently under perfect control, travels in a beeline at a uniform distance from the earth and carries
  a row of lights at each side of the color of incandescent lamps.</p>
