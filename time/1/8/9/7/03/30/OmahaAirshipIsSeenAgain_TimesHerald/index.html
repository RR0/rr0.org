<h2>This time Many Citizens Look at the Mysterious Visitor and Watch It Come and Go</h2>
<p> Omaha, Neb., March 29, - The mysterious air ship was seen again last night by a number of Omaha people. It hove in
  sight about the time church services were over and in half an hour had disappeared. </p>
<p> This time the "air ship" came into view in the southeastern portion of the horizon. It was in the shape of a big
  bright light, too big for a balloon, and glowed steadily. </p>
<p> It sailed over the city to the northwest and there disappeared behind the houses and bluffs. It moved very slowly
  and seemed to be quite near the earth. Nothing but the light was visible. A big crowd at Twenty-fourth and Lake
  Streets watched the trip of the visitor. </p>
