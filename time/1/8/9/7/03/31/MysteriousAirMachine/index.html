    <p>OMAHA, Neb., March 30.?The indications are that John O. Pries of this county is the author of the mysterious
      flying machine which has been seen in the sky recently, though he vigourously denies that such is the case. </p>
    <p>Pries is a unique character, occupying his time at his country residence, near Omaha, in experimenting with air
      ships, constructing models, and studying aeronautics. </p>
    <p>There is no doubt that the light seen in different parts of the State is the same, since the discriptions by
      dozens of people who have seen it always agree. Sometimes it is seen rushing very rapidly, and again is stationary
      or moving slowly. </p>
