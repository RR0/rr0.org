<p class="abstract">Galesburg Folk Imagine They Saw One High in Air</p>
<p> Galesburg, Michigan, April 1?The incredulity with which reports of a wandering airship have been received has been
  much qualified by events which occurred here last evening. </p>
<p> About 10 o'clock a brilliant white light suddenly appeared, accompanied by a sharp crackling sound, evidently coming
  from above. These phenomena lasted for probably 30 seconds and startled the spectators, one of whom positively asserts
  that he saw a huge black object tipped with flame, at a great distance above the earth. </p>
<p> A Mrs. Wyngate, residing just over the line of Charleston Township, asserts that she distinctly heard voices from
  above, at the time of the occurrence. </p>
<p>[Last evening was March 31, 1897]</p>
