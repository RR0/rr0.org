<p class="abstract">Nebraska and Kansas No Longer Enjoy A Monopoly in the Mysterious Machine</p>
<p>It was not to be supposed that the people of Nebraska and Kansas were long to have the monopoly of gazing on
  mysterious air ships that soared in the heavens after dark and dazzled the wondering and awe-struck spectators with
  their brilliant searchlights. But it was the general understanding that Indiana would next be chosen for the
  visitation because of the national reputation of the Chicago correspondents at Winamac, Anderson and Pink Mink
  Marsh</p>
<p>And now comes sober, cultured and conservative Evanston and gravely deposes that on the third day of April, A.D.,
  1897, AT 8:40 P.M., a mysterious light, evidently that of an air ship, was seen passing rapidly over the city, going
  west-northwest. The light was very bright, more like an electric light than anything else, and gave out a curious sort
  of flash at intervals. It seemed to be about a quarter of a mile above the earth. At 8:55 it mounted high in the
  heavens and was rapidly lost to sight. </p>
<p>The story is probably true, for the Evanstonian who reported to The Times-Herald was afraid of being laughed at and
  declined to give his name. </p>
