<title>Was It a Flying Machine?</title>

<p>One evening about three weeks ago a thing was observed in the sky here very much like that described in the dispatch
  appended [a much-circulated story about the initial appearances of airships in Kansas; I am not recycling it here].
  The star, kite, flying-machine, or whatever its name or nature, was visible here for upwards of an hour. It was a
  little north of the zenith when first noticed and gradually sank from sight beneath the northern horizon. While we and
  scores of others were gazing at it[,] its movements were erratic, floating backward and forward from east to west, but
  all the time with a northerly inclination. It gave out a bright, steady and unchanging red light. The first impression
  made was that the object was a kite illuminated by some electrical device, but the subsequent appearance of the
  phenomena [sic], as noted by telegrams from widely separated parts of the country, leads to the conclusion that it was
  a veritable flying machine, apparently not under absolute control, but yet obeying with some exactitude the course
  determined by its helmsman.</p>
