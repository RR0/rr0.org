<p class="abstract">People in an Iowa town Get a glimpse Of the Mysterious Nocturnal Flyer </p>
<p>Belle Plaine, Iowa, April 7. - The air ship that has been mystifying western people has been observed in this
  county. One of the most reputable physicians of Vinton says that all the members of his family observed the mysterious
  aerial machine last night and distinctly heard it swishing through the air.</p>
<p>The air ship first appeared down in the southwest about 9 o'clock and could plainly be observed to travel in a
  swaying manner, like a bird flying against a wind, and darting to and fro, would rise up quickly and lower itself with
  a gentle, easy motion and seemed under perfect control of the navigator. </p>
<p>It was going in a northeasterly direction. </p>
