<p> The air ship story which so wrought upon the mind of the Wesley correspondent to the Algona Republican this week has
  been thoroughly exploded and its explanation is as novel as it is true. It now turns out that there was no air ship
  seen at all but that the mysterious object sighted floating in the heavens was in fact only a newly hatched bed bug
  which had crawled out onto the outer end of an eyewinker to dry and that the red-like glare of the distant light
  peeping through its apparent windows was in reality only the red rays of the setting sun refracted and reflected into
  the observer's eye by the tiny animal's tender crystal-like body. This simple explanation we trust will put at rest
  the aroused curiosity of the superstitious world which has been so recently excited by the Wesley correspondent above
  named. </p>
