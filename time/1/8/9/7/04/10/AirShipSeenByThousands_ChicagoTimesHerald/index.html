<p class="abstract"> Strange Sight Attracts Attention for The Second Time in Evanston and Is Also Noticeable in Chicago
  Visible at Other Points </p>
<p>That "airship" has been seen again - that is, in this vicinity. To be sure, it was also seen in Kankakee,
  Mount Carroll and other places at the same time, but the people in those cities must have been mistaken
  &ndash; or else there is a whole flock of airships cavorting about through the heavens. The real "airship", the one
  that was seen here, seems to have a fondness for Evanston, for that classic city enjoyed its second sight from an
  orchestra seat, while Chicago strained its eyes from the second balcony. There is no doubt that Evanston saw something
  and what else could it be but an airship? There is also no doubt that Evanston was excited &ndash; and &ndash; inside
  the four mile limit, too. The first man who saw it gave the alarm. The alarm spread, and in half an hour the streets
  were crowded with excited people, with their faces turned up to the sky.</p>

  <h2>Excitement In Chicago</h2>
  <p>In Chicago the excitement was not so great, but hundreds are willing to make affidavit that it wasn't a vagrant
    star whose sole mission is to convince mankind that the problem of aerial navigation has been solved. Men who work
    at night climbed to the roofs of sky scrapers and gazed at the strange sight through field glasses, marine glasses
    and smoked glasses. Officer Steve Rowan went up on the Great Northern Theater roof garden and looked at it. He says
    it is a diamond detective's star that will be presented to him for making that remarkable arrest of a "strong arm"
    woman the other night. Democrats were convinced it was a resplendent platter containing appointments to city
    offices. Various newspaper men, staid, sober and sensible at other times, wouldn't go home on their regular night
    cars, but hung around until daybreak just to see the end of the thing. </p>
  <p>The light was first seen in the heavens about 9 o'clock. It was apparently closer to Evanston than to Chicago. Its
    first visit to Evanston was on April 3. That night Chicago didn't get a glimpse of it. It was seen at 8:40 o'clock,
    going west-northwest. The light was very bright, more like an electric light then any other, and gave out curious
    flashes at intervals. It was apparently one quarter of a mile high. At 8:55 it mounted high in the heavens and was
    soon lost to sight. </p>

  <h2>Evanstonians Who Saw It</h2>
  <p>Last night's appearance of the phenomenon at Evanston gave rise to all manner of speculation in that suburb. Most
    of those who have read and laughed at the accounts from Nebraska, Kansas and Iowa about the supposed airship which
    has been taking a jaunt in those localities did not think it any laughing matter. Those who witnessed the passing of
    the lights in the heavens describe the sight much in the same way as the telegrams from the other side of the
    Mississippi River have done, and some of them are seriously wondering if some inventor has not succeeded in getting
    a big joke on the country. </p>
  <p>One who was among the first to observe it says the object had all the appearance to him of being two cigar-shaped
    bodies attached by girders. He says he recognizes the fact that his imagination may have played no little part, and
    he was reluctant about committing himself. </p>
  <p>Robert Lowen, who lives at 1920 Sherman Avenue, Evanston, noticed the moving light in the sky. The light appeared
    to be over the lake and was moving in a westerly direction. Lowen got a field glass and was able to discern four
    lights a short distance apart and moving in unison. The first was a bright white light and appeared to be operated
    like a searchlight. Behind it was a green light and farther to the rear were green and white lights set closely
    together. F. Newland, employed in Hill &amp; Garwood's drug and candy store, saw the ship. So did R.C. Libberton of
    the Evanston life saving crew, who was on duty at the station during the early evening. The large glass at the
    station was called into use and each person who looked through it declared that lights both green and white could be
    plainly seen. </p>
  <p>While all this was going on in Evanston persons in the northwest section of Chicago were taking on interest in the
    aerial mystery. A great crowd gathered near MIlwaukee and Oakley Avenues and gazed at the object, trying to figure
    out what it might be. It was called an airship for lack of a better name. It was said the object looked very much
    like a balloon, but the "red light" was plainly discernible. Many mounted roofs in the neighborhood and all the
    field glasses in the vicinity were called into play. </p>
  <p>Nearly an hour after the strange lights had faded in the western heavens George Clem of Niles Center telephoned to
    the Evanston police that the residents of Niles had seen the light passing westward, a short distance south of the
    village. </p>
  <p>It was decided to notify Professor Hough, the astronomer at the observatory, and learn if the peculiar phenomenon
    had been seen through the observatory telescope. At the time Professor Hough was taking an observation of Jupiter
    and had his instrument pointed directly across the lake. He said that the object had not crossed the range of the
    telescope and that to change the instrument would be the work of several hours. </p>
  <p>Professor Hough evidently did not take stock in any "air ship" theories, and advanced the opinion that the strange
    light was caused by the effect of the atmosphere on the star Alpha Orionus <span class="note">plus commun√©ment
      connue sous le nom de Betelgeuse. Le terme moderne est Alpha Orionis ou, A Orionis</span>, which is of the first
    magnitude, and is in the constellation Orion. It rises early in the evening, and its course across the heavens is
    about the same as that of the moon. In Chicago it is first visible about 7 o'clock this time of the year. It reaches
    the zenith, he says, about the time when the mysterious phenomenon described as an airship was seen last night. The
    professor says the star is unusually bright in a clear atmosphere, and appears to be close to the earth. The star
    gradually disappears during the evening, and as it grows dimmer the effect of the atmosphere causes it to change
    color. Professor Hough made an observation late last night, but the conditions were not favorable. He says he will
    try again tonight. </p>
