<title>Un "aéronef" vu par des milliers des personnes</title>

<p class="abstract">Une observation étrange attire l'attention pour la seconde fois à Evanston et est également notable
  à Chicago visible depuis d'autres points.</p>
<p>Cet "aéronef" a été vu à nouveau - c'est-à-dire, dans le voisinage. Pour sûr, il a aussi été vu à Kankakee, Mount
  Carroll et d'autres lieux au même moment, mais les gens dans ces villes doivent s'être trompés - ou alors, il y a
  toute
  une flopée d'aéronefs cavorting about à travers les cieux. Le véritable "aéronef", celui qui a été vu ici, semble
  avoir un penchant pour Evanston, cette ville classique ayant apprécié sa 2de observation depuis un fauteuil
  d'orchestre, tandis que Chicago contraignait ses yeux depuis le 2d balcon. Il ne fait pas de doute que Evanston a vu
  quelque chose et que cela pouvait-il être d'autre qu'un aéronef ? Il ne fait pas de doute non plus que Evanston était
  excitée - et - à l'intérieur de la limite de 4 miles, également. Le 1er homme à l'avoir vu a donné l'alarme. L'alarme
  s'est répandue, et en 30 mn les rues étaient remplies de gens excités, les visages tournés vers le ciel.</p>

  <h2>Excitation à Chicago</h2>
  <p>L'apparition du phénomène de la nuit dernière à Evanston gave rise to all manner of speculation in that suburb.
    Most of those who have read and laughed at the accounts from Nebraska, Kansas and Iowa about the supposed airship
    which has been taking a jaunt in those localities did not think it any laughing matter. Those who witnessed the
    passing of the lights in the heavens describe the sight much in the same way as the telegrams from the other side of
    the Mississippi River have done, and some of them are seriously wondering if some inventor has not succeeded in
    getting a big joke on the country. </p>
  <p>One who was among the first to observe it says the object had all the appearance to him of being two cigar-shaped
    bodies attached by girders. He says he recognizes the fact that his imagination may have played no little part, and
    he was reluctant about committing himself. </p>
  <p>Robert Lowen, who lives at 1920 Sherman Avenue, Evanston, noticed the moving light in the sky. The light appeared
    to be over the lake and was moving in a westerly direction. Lowen got a field glass and was able to discern four
    lights a short distance apart and moving in unison. The first was a bright white light and appeared to be operated
    like a searchlight. Behind it was a green light and farther to the rear were green and white lights set closely
    together. F. Newland, employed in Hill & Garwood's drug and candy store, saw the ship. So did R.C. Libberton of the
    Evanston life saving crew, who was on duty at the station during the early evening. The large glass at the station
    was called into use and each person who looked through it declared that lights both green and white could be plainly
    seen. </p>
  <p>While all this was going on in Evanston persons in the northwest section of Chicago were taking on interest in the
    aerial mystery. A great crowd gathered near Milwaukee and Oakley Avenues and gazed at the object, trying to figure
    out what it might be. It was called an airship for lack of a better name. It was said the object looked very much
    like a balloon, but the "red light" was plainly discernible. Many mounted roofs in the neighborhood and all the
    field glasses in the vicinity were called into play. </p>
  <p>Nearly an hour after the strange lights had faded in the western heavens George Clem of Niles Center telephoned to
    the Evanston police that the residents of Niles had seen the light passing westward, a short distance south of the
    village. </p>
  <p>It was decided to notify Professor Hough, the astronomer at the observatory, and learn if the peculiar phenomenon
    had been seen through the observatory telescope. At the time Professor Hough was taking an observation of Jupiter
    and had his instrument pointed directly across the lake. He said that the object had not crossed the range of the
    telescope and that to change the instrument would be the work of several hours. </p>
  <p>Le professeur Hough evidently did not take stock in any "air ship" theories, and advanced the opinion that the
    strange light was caused by the effect of the atmosphere on the star Alpha Orionus <span class="note">[plus communément connue sous le nom de Betelguese. Le terme moderne est Alpha Orionis ou, A Orionis]</span>,
    which is of the first magnitude, and is in the constellation Orion. It rises early in the evening, and its course
    across the heavens is about the same as that of the moon. À Chicago it is first visible about 7 o'clock this time of
    the year. It reaches the zenith, he says, about the time when the mysterious phenomenon described as an airship was
    seen last night. The professor says the star is unusually bright in a clear atmosphere, and appears to be close to
    the earth. The star gradually disappears during the evening, and as it grows dimmer the effect of the atmosphere
    causes it to change color. Professor Hough made an observation late last night, but the conditions were not
    favorable. He says he will try again tonight.</p>
