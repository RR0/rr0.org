<p> Emmetsburg, Iowa, April 9. - Thursday <span class="note">[7 avril]</span> evening a large reddish light was seen
  passing westward from this city and also from Rodman. It resembled a locomotive light and was perhaps 1,000 feet above
  the earth. The editor of the West Bend Journal saw it while waiting for a train and a long account of it in his paper.
  It is thought to have been a balloon or an airship. The persons who saw it are thoroughly responsible.</p>
