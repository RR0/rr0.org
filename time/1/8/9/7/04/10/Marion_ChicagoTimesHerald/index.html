<p> Marion, Iowa, April 9, - An air ship passed in a southerly direction over this town at 2:05 o'clock this morning. It
  was seen by the night operators of the Western Union Telegraph Company and others. It appeared to be about 500 feet
  above the ground. The outlines were distinctly visible against the sky. The ship gave out two bright lights of an
  electric glow.</p>
