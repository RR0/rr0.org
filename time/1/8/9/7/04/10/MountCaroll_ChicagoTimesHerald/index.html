<p> Mount Carroll, Ill., April 9. - Hundreds of people whose honesty and truthfulness are beyond dispute saw an
  airship about 8:40 this evening. It came from the northeast and when opposite this city changed its course and went
  due west at terrific speed. It was in sight at least ten minutes. It appeared oblong in shape and carried a great red
  light. So many people saw it that there is no disputing the fact that something unusual appeared. The people who saw
  it were in various parts of the city.</p>
