<h2>Airship at That Point Was Moving West at a Terrific Rate of Speed</h2>
<p> Mount Carroll, Ill., April 9. &ndash; {Special} &ndash; Hundreds of persons on the streets tonight &ndash; persons
  whose honesty and truthfulness are beyond dispute &ndash; viewed the airship about 8:40 o'clock. It came from the
  northeast, and when opposite this city changed its course and went due west at a terrific speed. It was in sight at
  least ten minutes. It appeared oblong in shape and carried a great red light. In length it did not appear to be over
  eight or ten feet, and two or three feet high. So many people saw it there is no disputing the fact that something
  unusual appeared. </p>
