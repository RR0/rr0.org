<p class="abstract">Le vagabond de la nuit surprend tout le monde sauf le Prof. Hough</p>
<p class="abstract2">Appears All Along from Evanston to South Chicago - Some observers Declare they see wings -
  Astronomer Says It Is Alpha Orionus - Secretary Of Aeronautic Association Says He Expected the Travelers from Frisco
  Sunday, but They're Ahead of Time.
</p>
<p>Either the long expected airship from the Pacific coast reached Chicago at 8:30 o'clock last evening or the fixed
  star, Alpha Orionus, shone with unusual brilliance, which was augmented by the tricks of refraction. Hundreds of
  persons in Evanston, Niles Center, Schermerville, South Chicago and even in Chicago looked at the strange phenomenon
  off in the eastern sky and were convinced it was the storied vehicle of the heavens that has been worrying the
  inhabitants of Podunk and Squab Corners for a fortnight. </p>
<p>At 2 a.m. the ship, or star, or meteor, or what-not appeared over the western horizon, to spectators in Chicago
  looking out on Madison Street, as of the size and color of an orange. It hung in the sky for a time, and bore more of
  the appearance of the full moon than a star. Its nature is somewhat of a mystery. </p>
<p>Prof. G.W. Hough of Dearborn Observatory, Evanston, was one person in the classic suburb who refused to be
  hypnotized by the spectacle. He persisted it was a plain star of the first magnitude, had been in the sky for some
  years, and carried none of the present population of San Francisco, as the "airship" is known to do. </p>
<h3>Some Of The Witnesses</h3>
<p>Thorne and Libberton of the Evanston life-saving crew and Capt. Lawson and his wife stake their fortunes with the
  airship side of the proposition. J.W. Donnell, once President of the Chicago Aeronautic Society, a resident of
  Evanston, is with them. N.D. Wright, editor of the index, is an airship partisan, and scoffs at the star in Orion.
  George D. Corson, N.P. Williams, L.W. Conkey, Robert Milne, Charles Burkett, and G.W. Hill, all of Evanston, are ready
  to testify that the spectacle was an airship. </p>
<p>In numbers they are weightier than Prof. Hough. But he turned a telescope on the heavenly visitor and they had only
  field glasses. </p>
<p>Various descriptions were given of the strange object that set the above citizens and nearly eight hundred others
  agape in Davis Street, Evanston, but the descriptions agreed on points of major interest. The object descried sweeping
  through the heavens bore vari-colored lights, according to all accounts. All declare the brightest light was white,
  and seemed to be backed by a reflector that could be turned swinging its searching rays from side by side through the
  night air. </p>
<p>Behind this some discerned a small red light, which others failed to observe; but again all agreed that still
  farther behind the big white headlight could be seen a smaller white light, and a green light, side by side, and
  Evanston is a prohibition town. </p>
<h3>Position In The Sky</h3>
<p>According to the reports from different points the course of the heavenly vagrant in passing over the city was
  erratic enough to satisfy the highest requirements of aerial navigation. At Evanston the object was first observed in
  the east, over the lake and low in the sky. It came nearer and nearer, being watched in its flight by a small crowd
  that grew into a multitude before the vision had disappeared. Evanston observers say the moving object seemed to be
  about 400 feet above the earth, and that it held a practically true course westward. It was during this period of its
  flight that the same phenomena were observed by residents in Niles Center and Schermerville, though at a greater
  distance. </p>
<p>A little more than a half hour later similar lights were described out over the lake, east of the city, and bound
  southward, the red, or starboard light being plainly seen. </p>
<h3>Disappears Over South Chicago</h3>
<p>The latest glimpse of the traverser of darkness was caught by South Chicagoans at about 9:30 o'clock, when numerous
  persons state they saw an object like that already described approach the land from out over the lake, and, after
  reaching a point some distance inland, turn slowly to the northwest and fade away into the night and darkness. These
  persons offer affidavits and previously good reputations. </p>
<p>At several points the moving wonder was observed by persons equipped with small telescopes or powerful field
  glasses, and these persons claim to have descried the outlines of a structure bearing the lights. The consensus of
  judgment, on the uncertain basis for estimating dimensions of bodies moving through the air at unknown distances, is
  that the main body of the night-flyer was about seventy feet in length, of slender proportions, and fragile
  construction. To this body, it is reported, were attached the movable headlight and the other lights described. A few
  observers claim they also saw, a short distance above the body, lateral structures resembling wings or sails. These
  appeared to be about twenty feet in width, and, as they were seen from one side, their length could not be accurately
  estimated. </p>
<p>But there is general interest in what Prof. Hough says. He turned his telescope on the object at 10 o'clock. After
  noting the time and declination of the light he announced that it was a fixed star in the constellation Orion. Alpha
  Orionus is its scientific name, it being a star of the first magnitude. </p>
<p>He said the star is simply following its regular course in the heavens and can be seen any evening with the naked
  eye when the sky is clear. It rises early in the evening and is discernible at 7:45 o'clock. </p>
<p>At 8 o'clock it is at its highest and on a clear night resembles a ball of fire. The effect of the atmosphere upon
  the star's rays makes the light appear to change from white to red and then to green. The star disappears with the
  constellation of Orion in the northwest portion of the heavens at about 10:45, setting a few minutes later each night
  until it becomes a daystar. </p>
<p>Late last night some of the believers in the airship theory were willing to accept Prof. Hough's explanations, as it
  agreed with their observations. Prof. Hough will make further observations tonight </p>
<h3>Hasmar Thinks It Is the Ship</h3>
<p>In Chicago there was a general disposition to laugh at the "airship" theory, but Attorney Max L. Hasmar, Secretary of
  the Chicago Aeronautical Association, does not smile at it. To him the fact of the airship moving across the country
  was not a surprise. </p>
<p>"There is only one thing that surprises me in the presence of the airship tonight," said Mr. Hasmar. "We expected it
  Sunday and it is hard for me to believe the vessel arrived here so soon unless the conditions were exceptionally
  favorable. Yes, I have a good idea concerning all this mystery. I know one of the men who is in the airship. The car
  contains three people, but the exaggerated stories concerning the ship are laughable." </p>
<p>"Spectators have announced it as their belief that the ship was composed of steel. This is a mistake. Its is paper.
  There is the customary inflated gas reservoir, but the inventors have discovered the secret of practical propulsion.
  They can steer the vessel in any direction they desire." </p>
<p>"Word was received here several weeks ago that the party had started from San Francisco, and that the ship would
  stop here for the purpose of registration. The end of the trip is to be at Washington City, where the ship will be
  brought to earth and given up to inspection." </p>
<h3>RECEPTION SET FOR SUNDAY</h3>
<p>"We had intended to give the party a reception here next Sunday. It must be very cold traveling at this season of
  the year, but I understand the inmates of the car are well bundled up. The only new feature applied to the propulsion
  is the fact that the posterior of the propeller is flexible and elastic, while the anterior is rigid. The fans have a
  peculiar twisting motion. President Octave Chanute of the Chicago Society has full information concerning the ship.
  He, with a number of other wealthy men interested in the problem, has furnished the money for the venture. Mr. Chanute
  is in California at the present time. I would not care to furnish details as to the experiment, as it would be unfair
  to the inventors and would take off the edge of public interest." </p>
<p>The Aeronautical Society's Secretary was serious, but the Hough idea of this heavenly apparition found favor with
  the masses and the joke seemed to lie in Davis Street, Evanston. </p>
<p>(Note; Mr. Hasmar will have his name spelled as Kasmar in subsequent editions of other papers and in subsequent
  editions of this one.) frv </p>
