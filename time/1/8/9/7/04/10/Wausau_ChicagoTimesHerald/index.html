<p>Wausau, Wis., April 9. - What was supposed to be an air ship was seen passing over this city last night about
  10 o'clock. Lights could be distinguished from a dark object far up in the heavens, which had the appearance of being
  shaped like an egg. It was viewed by at least fifty persons.</p>
