<p> Kankakee, Ill., April 9. - About 100 prominent citizens of Kankakee saw an air ship going in a northeasterly
  direction at 9 o'clock tonight. The vessel was probably 1,000 feet above the earth and moving very rapidly at this
  distance. The headlight appeared as large as an ordinary electric arc light. At one time the vessel rose very rapidly
  and afterward seemed to drop a long distance. In addition to the headlight spectators claimed to have noticed smaller
  lights behind, indicating that the vessel is of considerable size. It was apparently headed toward Chicago and
  traveled very rapidly, after hovering over Kankakee about ten minutes. Among the prominent citizens who watched the
  progress of the machine were ex-United States Marshal R.D. Sherman, Trainmaster Coopman of the Illinois Central
  Railway and Attorney, William R. Hunter. </p>
