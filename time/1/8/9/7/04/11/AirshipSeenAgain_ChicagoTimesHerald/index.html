<title>Airship Here Again</title>

<p class="abstract"> Mystery of the Sky With Its Colored Lights Is Observed Hovering Over Chicago and Various Iowa Towns
  Simultaneously</p>
<p>The "airship", shooting star, Alpha Orionus or whatever the thing may be that has set citizens to gazing skyward
  every night since its first appearance has again floated across the heavens. It was seen again last night in sections
  of the city. </p>
<p> Persons were discovered on the extreme west side who are willing to vouch that the so-called "ship" was more nearly
  of that nature than of the celestial character ascribed to it by the astronomers. Considering the serious discussion,
  which has been indulged in, they were ready to debate the matter without fear of being ridiculed, and their opinions
  were coolly arrived at. </p>
<p> A crowd gathered at the corner of West Chicago and Hamlin Avenues, a point where the smoke of the city does not
  obscure the sky as a rule, and they watched the mysterious "light" for half an hour, beginning at 9:45 o'clock. In the
  party were R.W. Allen of the Saxe Pharmacy, 1788 West Chicago Avenue, and Dr. George F. Pierce of the same address.
  Both were of the opinion that the object was not a star, and they were ready to give serious reasons why they thought
  so. </p>

  <h2>What R. W. Allen Saw</h2>
  <p><q>"I really consider myself fortunate</q>," said Mr. Allen, "<q>in being permitted to see the mysterious "ship"
    there has been so much talk about, and I am willing to take all the consequences of expressing the opinion that
    Professor Hough is wrong. It is not a star, and it has nothing to do with the solar system. Myself and half a dozen
    other men in the neighborhood took special pains to note every manifestation of the object, and certainly no star
    ever acted in the manner displayed by the lights we saw. There was a perceptible undulation in its motion, and the
    dips succeeded one another as about the rhythm of the pulse beat. It moved very rapidly and disappeared off toward
    the northwest, near the horizon, vanishing by degrees. The colors, red, white and green, which it exhibited, were
    too distinct to have been the result of atmospheric refraction."</q></p>
  <p><q>"We first noticed the object almost overhead, only a narrow arc intervening between it and the zenith. It bore
    away from us at a rate unmistakable for the ordinary movement of stars. I do not think it could have been a balloon,
    though I was not able to distinguish any form. I am willing to give the airship the benefit of the doubt." </q></p>

  <h2>Ridiculed By Astronomers</h2>
  <p> The "airship" is more omnipresent then the sea serpent. It was observed at about the same time Friday night at
    various points in Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin. It was the talk of Evanston yesterday, and in Chicago astronomers
    offered scientific explanations, while laymen shook their heads and wondered. </p>
  <p><q>"No astronomer possessed of sanity</q>," said Sherburne W. Burnham yesterday, "<q>would pay any attention at all
    to the rumors that are going around. If he happened to see the kind of lights in the sky that form the germ of what
    people think they see, he would pass right by it without ever thinking of it again. So would everybody else who
    hasn't been stirred up by stories of airships and who wasn't on the lookout for them. As for this being supernatural
    in any way, one knows easily what to say about that. I have been watching the skies for a good many years now, and I
    have yet to see the first supernatural event." </q></p>
  <p> Professor George Hough sat in his private office at Dearborn Observatory in Evanston, and, pointing to an outline
    of the course of the star Alpha Orionus, lying on the desk before him, said: </p>
  <p><q>"This is the airship. It has been roaming through its regular course in the firmament these 10,000,000 years,
    and why it should have been settled upon in the last three weeks and pointed out as the headlight of a mysterious
    aerial vessel is a thing hard to explain. Alpha Orionus appears on the meridian at 5 o'clock and becomes visible at
    8 o'clock. At that time it resembles a strong white electric light." </q></p>
  <p><q>"It first becomes noticeable in the central southwest portion of the sky. At an unusually rapid rate for a
    star </q><span class="note">[cette remarque peut sembler surprenante dans la mesure où nous savons aujourd'hui que l'ensemble du champ des étoiles se déplace ensemble au même rythme, qui est la rotation de la terre]</span><q>
    it takes its course toward the northwest, finally disappearing in that corner. As the star begins to sink, the
    atmospheric conditions cause it to appear to be of a reddish hue on the underside and green on the upper portion
    when seen through a glass. The center of the body is white." </q></p>
  <p> Dispatches to the Times-Herald announce the appearance of the mysterious aerial traveler at several places last
    night. </p></section>
