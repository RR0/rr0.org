<h2>Aeronautical Society Expects It to Light on the Indiana Sand Dunes In a few days</h2>
<p> The huge ball of red, green, and orange light which startled residents of every village and township between Niles
  Center and South Chicago on Friday evening may not have been an airship after all. Only the most imaginative of those
  who viewed it are willing to take an oath to seeing the outlines of hull, keel, and propeller. But if it was not the
  real article, do not blame the Chicago Aeronautical Society. It is doing the best it can, and it promises that, in
  case it turns out the celestial visitor was nothing more than a common everyday fixed star of the first magnitude, to
  have a genuine air-coaster in the neighborhood of Chicago before the end of this week.</p>
<p> The official representative of the Aeronautical Society, in the absence of President Chanute in California to
  witness the start, is Secretary Max L. Kasmar. Mr. Kasmar is not inclined to think the manifestation of Friday evening
  was the California airship, because he thinks that the vessel hardly had time to travel so far.</p>
<p> "It has been scarcely three weeks since the journey was begun," he said, "and, unless conditions of wind and weather
  have been unusually favorable, I do not see how the ship could get here before tomorrow at the earliest, and I think
  it more probable that it will be the middle of the week before Chicagoans have an opportunity of seeing the invention.
  I have been expecting some communication from the California people telling me when to look for the ship. The
  arrangement was for the ship to stop in the sandhills of Indiana, where Mr. Chanute was experimenting last fall, and
  the society has been planning a quiet reception for the navigators." </p>
<p> "There is no doubt at all the ship started from San Francisco and is now somewhere between this city and the Rocky
  Mountains." </p>
<p> "The inventors do not say this ship is the final solution of the problem of aerial navigation. We hope one day to do
  away with the balloon feature altogether. Mr. Chanute's experiments in aeroplane coasting were made in the hope of
  demonstrating that a balloon is theoretically unnecessary." </p>
<p> "The present trip has been planned to arouse curiosity, but not to satisfy it until Washington D.C. is reached. It
  is intended to demonstrate the feasibility of aerial navigation." </p>
<p> Prof. George Hough said again yesterday, as he smiled; "Alpha Orionus has been roaming through its regular coarse in
  the firmament 10,000,000 years and why it should have been settled upon in the last three weeks and pointed out as the
  headlight of a mysterious aerial vessel is a thing hard to explain." </p>
