<p> Burlington, April 10. - In order to test the credulity of the people on the airship question, members of the
  Hawkeye's staff sent up a common tissue paper hot-air balloon outside the city tonight so that the wind would carry it
  over the town. The test was eminently satisfactory, and the Hawkeye's telephone has been kept busy all evening with
  messages describing the airship. Some people swore they saw red and green lights, and one perfectly sober and
  reputable citizen offered to make affidavit that he heard voices. The experiment satisfies the Hawkeye that the
  Nebraska - Iowa - Illinois air ship is a pure fake. </p>
