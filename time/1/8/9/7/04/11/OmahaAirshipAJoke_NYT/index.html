<p class="abstract">Sent up to Humbug Guileless Ak-SarBens Members.</p>
<p>Omaha, Neb., April 10.?The airship seen by the Ak-Sar-Bens members Monday night, which created such a sensation in
  Omaha, is now declared to be a balloon, and the men who sent it up are Roy Arnold and Jack Rogers. They are practical
  jokers, and they bought an enormous balloon to send up April 1, but it rained that night, so they held it for a later
  date.</p>
<p>Last Monday they took the balloon to the hollow back of the State Institute for the Deaf, where they inflated it. It
  went soaring up through the air to deceive and humbug the guileless Ak-Sar-Bens. Suspended from the balloon was a
  wicker basket filled with a composition resembling shavings, which they vouched off just as it ascended and this was
  the light. </p>
