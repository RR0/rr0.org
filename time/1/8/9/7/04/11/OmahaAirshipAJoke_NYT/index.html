    <p>Omaha, Neb., April 10.?The airship seen by the Ak-Sar-Bens members Monday night, which created such a sensation
      in Omaha, is now declared to be a balloon, and the men who sent it up are Roy Arnold and Jack Rogers. They are
      practical jokers, and they bought an enormous balloon to send up April 1, but it rained that night, so they held
      it for a later date.</p>
    <p>Last Monday they took the balloon to the hollow back of the State Institute for the Deaf, where they inflated it.
      It went soaring up through the air to deceive and humbug the guileless Ak-Sar-Bens. Suspended from the balloon was
      a wicker basket filled with a composition resembling shavings, which they vouched off just as it ascended and this
      was the light. </p>
