<p class="abstract"> Covers Vast Area Of Ground</p>
<p class="abstract2">Is Seen Simultaneously in Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan by Persons Whose Veracity is
  Unquestioned</p>
<p>Waukegan, Ill., April 12. - Several young people here who were out late last night claim to have seen the air
  ship. Harry Detweller and a few friends, who were taking a stroll, had their attention attracted by a mysterious
  moving light in the heavens, which, from description, they at once believed to be the famous air ship. "Ted" Wheeler
  was another who saw it. He describes it as a brilliant red light, which moved north in a vacillating course at quite a
  speed, and was not at all like a star or comet. He watched it for an hour.</p>
<p>Kenosha, Wis., April 12. - Citizens of Kenosha are certain that they saw the air ship at between 7:15 and 8
  o'clock Sunday <span class="note">[11 avril]</span> evening. That the much seen and talked about affair passed here is
  based upon the story of R.H. Slosson, who was elected judge at the recent judicial election. He says that at 7:15
  o'clock he sighted a huge white light with a small green light an either side. Its progress was slow and hardly
  discernible. The center light resembled a huge star except that it moved. The green lights were much smaller, and
  moved steadily with the big white light in the same relative position.</p>
<p>New Carlisle, Ind., April 12. &ndash; One hundred prominent citizens of this place saw an air ship going in a
  northwesterly direction at 8:30 o'clock last night. The vessel was probably 500 feet above the earth and moving very
  rapidly. At one time it rose very slowly and afterward seemed to drop along distance. In addition to the headlight,
  spectators claimed to have noticed smaller lights of blue, green and red behind, indicating that the vessel is of
  considerable size. It was in sight at least ten minutes.</p>
<p>Grand Rapids, Wis., April 12. &ndash; The mysterious airship which has puzzled the people of Missouri Valley and
  other points se much passed over here at 9 o'clock last evening, and was watched by 100 reputable citizens. A peculiar
  red light was clearly visible, moving rapidly in the western heavens. A few excited persons claimed to have discerned
  plainly a framework of some sort surrounding the red light, which shone with flickering luster. Be it balloon, air
  ship or meteor, it was distinctly seen. </p>
<p>Clinton, Iowa, April 12. &ndash; There was considerable excitement here to-night when a thousand people were looking
  at the air ship. Professor Freenheim, an astronomer here of much note, put his large glass on it and found it to be
  the planet Venus, which is very brilliant now. </p>
<p>Elkhart, Ind., April 12. &ndash; A large number of persons here claim to have seen the air ship passing over this
  city from 10 to 12 o'clock last night. It presented all the peculiarities that have been so generally described. </p>
<p>Ripon, Wis., April 12. &ndash; The air ship, or whatever may be the object that has caused so much sky gazing of
  late, was distinctly seen last night by about 200 or more of Ripon's inhabitants. On their way home 100 or more
  stopped at the home of ex-State Land Commissioner Jerre Dobbs, who called their attention to the ship. </p>
<p>Battle Creek, Mich., April 12. &ndash; What is believed to be the mysterious air ship visited this city to-night at
  9 o'clock. It was two miles west of the city and a mile high when first noticed. It emitted a shower of red sparks
  similar to a skyrocket, the sparks seeming to follow a loud report. The outlines of the object were then plainly
  visible. Fully fifty people from different parts of the city have reported seeing the strange visitor. Among those who
  saw it are L.E. Clawson, attorney; W.A. Cady, jeweler; Dr. McGuffin, Dr. McNeal, J.H. Dorsey, manager of the Western
  Union Telegraph Company; Thomas Barry, ex-alderman; M.J. Loomis, photographer, and many guests at the sanitarium. </p>
<p class="note"> [Dispatches to the Times-Herald show that the air ship was also seen at Mount Morris, Ill.; Moline,
  Ill.; Anderson, Ind., and Eau Claire, Wis.]</p>
<p>F.W. Alex, Joseph B. Durand and Frank Ray, all reputable citizens of Lake Forest, say they saw the airship Sunday
  <span class="note">[11 avril]</span> night, and, though none is absolutely sure that what he saw was not a star, they
  are equally unwilling to state positively that it was not an air ship. It was seen between 8 and 9 o'clock in the
  northwest part of the heavens.</p>
<p>R.J. Thompson secretary of the Illinois commission to the Tennessee Centennial says the commission will pay $25,000
  for an actual air ship to exhibit at the exposition. </p>
