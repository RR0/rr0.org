<h2> It Was Moving In a Northwesterly Direction</h2>
<p> The Kansas air-ship has visited Benton Harbor. The distinction of seeing the aerial wonder does not now alone belong
  to Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and Kansas towns.</p>
<p> The ship made its flight across the heavens over this city last night and was seen exclusively by residents on
  Morton Hill. John Lee, residing on Territorial St. is among those who were so fortunate as to get a glimpse of the
  marvelous vessel.</p>
<p> It came in sight about 7:45 and traveled rapidly north-northwest. It was in view for fully fifteen minutes. To Mr.
  Lee it had the appearance of a huge ball of fire when viewed with the naked eye but with operas glasses leveled upon
  it Mr. Lee claims its aspect greatly changed, It threw off a variety of colored lights of soft, mellow luster. </p>
