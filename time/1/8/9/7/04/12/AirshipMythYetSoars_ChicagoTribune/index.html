<h2>Headed For Dune Park And An Amusement Privilege</h2>
<h3>Alleged Photograph of the Queer Aerial Visitor Showing Its Mechanism And Its Daring Navigation Pronounced a "Fake"
  By a Expert
</h3>
<h3>Mechanical Impossibilities in the Way of Such a Picture, Night Gasers Report Seeing The Flying Machine</h3>
<p> Chicago's air-ship romance has fallen into practical hands. If the progress made by "photographers on the spot"
  yesterday is carried to its legitimate end the aerial monster will be picked up soon on the shining sands of Dune Park
  and will be exhibited by a local amusement company as the solution of the greatest problem tackled by mankind &ndash;
  navigation of the air. </p>
<p> At Rogers Park yesterday two men exhibited pictures "taken of the air ship" as it sailed over the suburb hard by
  Evanston at 6 a.m. A reporter for The Tribune secured one of the pictures, as did reporters for other Chicago
  newspapers. The prints were peddled out eagerly to all the nimble scribblers who would take them. </p>
<p> The picture given to The Tribune was submitted to an expert photographer for an opinion as to its genuineness. He
  looked at it and smiled. </p>
<h3>Pronounced A Fake</h3>
<p> "It is a fake," he said, "It would be impossible for a camera to take such a picture, except from a doctored
  photograph. In my opinion a picture was taken out in Rogers Park. Then the airship was filled in. After that a picture
  was taken of the prepared print." </p>
<p> "The reason why I pronounce this bit of enterprise a "fake" is because such a result is a perspective impossibility.
  With the relative proportions shown of various objects and the supposed airship no camera could have caught so much
  within the scope of its lenses." </p>
<p> "In this case a small instrument was used. It looks like a kodak's work. To have taken the airship with such a
  little lens the photographer would have had to point the instrument up towards the sky. He couldn't possibly get a lot
  of foreground and buildings in the picture." </p>
<p> The "fake" photograph is a gem of its kind. It is 31/2 X 21/2 inches in size. In the left foreground is a spur of
  the St. Paul's Evanston Division tracks. In the middle foreground are three good-sized and one small building. Well
  toward the front is an individual who appears to have a camera in his uplifted hands taking a picture of the aerial
  visitor. This suggests the thought that perhaps this wonderful kodak takes pictures of itself and its manipulator as
  well as of airships. </p>
<h3>How the "Ship" Looks</h3>
<p> But the heavenly soarer is the great feature of the wonderful work of art. High above the roofs of the buildings,
  the telegraph poles, and the leafless trees it rides in majesty. Its cigar-shaped body tips toward the "stern" where
  it terminates in a tail like that of a fish. Depending from the balloon part is a long, narrow cage with a propeller
  at the end. If a powerful glass is used one may see the outlines of two daring navigators. </p>
<p> It is supposed these aeronauts will be discovered soon nestling with their landed ship among the sandy stretches of
  Dune Park, around the bend of the lake in Indiana, where Chanute's experiments thrilled an expectant world last
  fall. </p>
<p> After that it would be natural for them to yield to the persuasions of the amusement concern mentioned and move into
  Chicago to exhibit to gaping thousands their flying machine and tell what fun they have had keeping the inhabitants of
  many cities guessing the last few weeks. </p>
<p> A number of policemen and firemen in South Chicago and Englewood reported last night that they saw the mysterious
  object floating about in the air which has been going by the name of "airship". They described it much in the same
  manner as others have done. </p>
<p> Late yesterday afternoon the airship was seen "hovering over Lincoln Park." </p>
<p>As usual it was also seen elsewhere.</p>
