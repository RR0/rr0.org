<p>Fontanelle, Iowa, April 12: The airship was seen here at 8:30 (p.m.) tonight and was viewed by the whole
  population.</p>
<p> It came from the south-east and was not over 200 feet above the tree-tops and moved very slowly, not to exceed ten
  miles per hour. The machine could be plainly seen, and is described as being 60 feet in length, and the vibration of
  the wings could be plainly seen.</p>
<p> It carried the usual colored lights, and the working of the machinery could be heard, as also could the strains of
  music as from an orchestra.</p>
<p> It was hailed but passed on to the north, seeming to increase its speed, and disappeared. There is no doubt in
  Fontanelle that it is the real thing, and is testified to by the most prominent citizens, etc.</p>
