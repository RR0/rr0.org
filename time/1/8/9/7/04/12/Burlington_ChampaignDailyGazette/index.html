<p>Burlington, In., April 12 &ndash; In order to test the credulity of the people on the airship question, members of
  the Hawkeye's staff sent up a common tissue paper hot air balloon outside the city Saturday night so that the wind
  would carry it over the town. The test was eminently satisfactory and the Hawkeye's telephone was kept hot all evening
  with messages describing the airship, some people swearing they saw red and green lights, and one perfectly sober and
  reputable citizen offering to make affidavit that he heard voices. The experiment satisfies The Hawkeye that the
  Nebraska-Iowa-Illinois airship is a pure fake. </p>
