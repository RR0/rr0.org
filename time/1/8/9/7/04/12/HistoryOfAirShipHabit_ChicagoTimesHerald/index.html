<p class="abstract">First Seen in California in November</p>
<p class="abstract2">Its Gradual Progress Across The Continent</p>
<p>Now that it has become a fad to scan the skies at night, look for a moving light, and then say one has seen a
  mysterious air ship, the history of the birth and growth of this newest craze is a matter of interest. The first air
  ship seen &ndash; one that seemed actually to fly and appeared to be under the control of its pilot &ndash; with the
  last six months was near Sacramento, Cal., many of the inhabitants of that city declaring that about 1 o'clock on the
  morning of Monday Nov. 16, they saw an air ship passing rapidly over that city. Some merely declared they saw a bright
  light and nothing else, while others went so far as to assert they saw a cigar-shaped flying machine and heard voices
  from it. Some residents of Oakland across the bay from San Francisco, also declared they saw the same sight a few
  nights previously. According to George D. Collins, a lawyer of San Francisco, it was a real air ship, and made a
  journey.</p>
<p>Two months and a half elapsed before further news came from the west regarding a navigator of the air, and this
  information was sent from Omaha. On the night of March 14 considerable interest was awakened by a supposed air ship
  which a considerable number of persons all of them reputable, said they had seen. The view of this object, however,
  appears to have been confined to Omaha. The "thing" as the Omahans called it, flashed into view about 9 o'clock. It
  appeared to be coming from the southeast. It had the appearance of a big engine headlight, and floated off toward the
  west and north, and finally disappeared behind some buildings. It was in sight for something over an hour, the people
  who saw it estimating that it was a few minutes after 9:30 o'clock when it sank out of sight.</p>
<p>On the night of March 29 the strange object was again observed, this time by the majority of the people of Omaha.
  Then followed a sight of the ship in Denver.</p>
<p>Once more the stranger disappeared and remained out of sight until April 3, when a telephone message was received
  from Evanston saying that about 8:40 o'clock p.m. a mysterious light, evidently that of an air ship, was seen passing
  rapidly over that city, going west-northwest. Friday night, for the first time, it was seen in Chicago, and for the
  second time in Evanston. To Chicago the visitor came, to all appearances, from the west, but few of those who saw it
  agreed in its description. Some eyes saw cigar-shaped frames fastened together with girders; the vision of others was
  obscured by the flapping of great wings.</p>
<p>Twenty or more different cities in the west have reported within the last month that they have seen the air
  ship.</p>
<p>Professor George Hough of Dearborn Observatory, Northwestern University, Evanston and Sherburne W. Burnham maintain
  that the mysterious light seen is the star known as Alpha Orion. </p>
