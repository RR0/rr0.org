<p class="abstract">Declares He Lives in Omaha and Asks For Thirty Five Acres in Which to Exhibit His Machine</p>
<p> Omaha, Neb., April 11. &ndash;{Special}- The mysterious airship, which has caused the veracity of many reputable
  citizens to be questioned, promises to be cleared up within a few days through the medium of the trans-Mississippi
  exposition. Either this is the fact or a stupendous hoax is to be perpetrated on the exposition authorities. In the
  first mail yesterday Secretary Wakefield received a letter dated at Omaha and bearing the postmark Omaha. The letter
  was signed "A.C. Clinton" and read as follows. </p>
<p><q>"To the Exposition Directors: My identity up to date has been unknown, but I will come to the front now, if you
  guarantee me 870,000 square feet of space. I am the famous airship constructor and will guarantee you positively of
  this fact in a week. The airship is my own invention, and as I am an Omaha man I wish it to be held as an Omaha
  invention. It will carry safely twenty people to a height of from 10,000 to 20,000 feet. I truly believe I have made
  the greatest invention and discovery ever made. Will see you April 17, 1897 at the headquarters." </q></p>
<p> The writer gave no address. The amount of space asked for by the writer of this letter is nearly thirty-five
  acres. </p>
