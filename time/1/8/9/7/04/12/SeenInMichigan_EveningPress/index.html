<p class="abstract">Ship of Space Startled Holland Last Night</p>
<p class="abstract2">It Coquetted About Over Black Lake and Then Darted Out of Sight</p>
<p>Holland, Michigan, April 12 -- Hundreds of Holland people believe they saw the air ship at 8:55 last night floating
  over Black Lake. It was a large dark mass, apparently lighted with colored electric lights. </p>
<p>After remaining stationary for several minutes it darted northwest and was soon lost sight of. The machine moved in
  a zigzag style and seemed under perfect control. </p>
