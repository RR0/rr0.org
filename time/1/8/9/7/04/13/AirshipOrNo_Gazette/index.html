<p>The strange body that passed over the city Monday <span class="note">[12 avril 1897]</span> evening and that was
  taken by many for an airship was seen by the proprietor of the Gazette, as well as many other citizens. It came from
  the southeast and passed to the northwest, nearly over the center of the city at a rate of speed that must have been
  forty too sixty miles an hour. When about two miles northwest of the city the object seemed to change its course from
  northwest to due north. All that could be distinguished was a reddish-green light of great brilliancy that threw out
  rays on all sides and was six times as large as any star in the heavens. Airship, or whatever it may be, there is some
  strange skylarking about the heavens that has been seen by thousands and thousands of people in different portions of
  the country. What it is, astronomers ought to be getting on to it by this time. The object was first heard of several
  weeks ago in western Nebraska, then at different points in Kansas, then in Iowa, and Illinois, and now in Michigan.
  Sunday evening an object of the same description passed over South Bend and Niles. </p>
<p> The object, when it passed over Kalamazoo appeared to be about half a mile high. It is more likely that it was fifty
  and perhaps three times that many miles from the earth and is some wandering body not down on the chart. One thing is
  certain, it goes through space like a rocket. </p>
