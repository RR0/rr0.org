<p> Champaign is fully abreast of the times when it comes to seeing airships, and has at least one citizen who has seen
  what he supposes to be the object which the newspapers have been talking on so much about the past few days. Dr. J.B.
  Wood saw it. Last Saturday evening, he states to a reporter, he left his office in Imperial building, shortly after 8
  o' clock, to walk to his home on the corner of New street and Springfield avenue. When outside the business district,
  his attention was directed to a peculiar light in the heavens in the northwest. At the first glance he was satisfied
  it was not a star. <q>"It had a red appearance entirely too red to be the light of a star</q>", said he to the
  reporter, <q>"and appeared to be a long object. I stopped so that I might get a good look at it, and was satisfied it
    was not a star, when I saw it was moving rapidly to the northwest. I walked on in the direction of my home hoping to
    call the attention of the members of the household to it, but before I reached home I saw it gradually disappear
    from sight, and that was my first and last experience with the airship." </q></p>
<p> It was reported on the streets Monday that night employees of the Illinois Central had seen just such an object as
  that described by Dr. Wood. In the same direction, and they also thought they had seen the airship. </p>
<p> E.H. Copeman, of Kankakee, trainmaster of the Chicago section of the Illinois Central, well known in this city, was
  here this morning. He is another of the men who saw the airship, the latter part of last week, and the story he tells
  corresponds almost identically with that of Dr. Wood. He was with a party of gentlemen in Kankakee last Friday <span
      class="note">[9 avril]</span> night, and their attention was called to a peculiar light in the heavens in the
  northwest. Mr. Copeman says it had the brightness of a locomotive headlight and that it moved rapidly. He and the
  gentlemen with whom he was sitting watched it till it went entirely out of sight.</p>
