<h2>Benton Harbor has Seen the Airship</h2>
<p> Benton Harbor eyes are as sharp as anybody's and the rest of the world needn't think it can eclipse our vision when
  there are airships to be seen. </p>
<p> Several of our people have seen the airship that has already startled the inhabitants of seven states and was last
  reported to be hovering over Chicago. No less then three persons, so it is reported about town today saw the thing,
  head lights, tail lights, outriggers, illumination, and all. To be sure, no one can give an accurate description of
  the "critter", for that's one of the peculiarities of the airship seen elsewhere, and we want our airship to be as
  mysterious as anybody's. Moreover, everybody who sees it disagrees with everyone else as to its precise
  characteristics, altitude, rapidity of flight, Etc., but these are trifling details not to be considered at all as
  reflecting either on the accuracy of the beholders or the clearness of their eyesight.</p>
<p> Here as elsewhere, the nature of the airship is not known, but it comes from Mars or any other planet we hope it has
  brought sufficient "atmosphere" of its own to exist until it reaches terra firma or gets near enough to be
  photographed.</p>
<p> Even New Troy residents claim to have seen the alleged airship, which has caused so much excitement. Some of the
  citizens of that quiet little village are ready to take their oath that an airship passed within 2,000 feet of
  them. </p>
