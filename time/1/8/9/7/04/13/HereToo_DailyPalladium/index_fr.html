<p class="abstract">Benton Harbor a vu l'aéronef</p>
<p>Les yeux de Benton Harbor sont aussi aiguisés que ceux de quiconque d'autre et le reste du monde n'a pas besoin de
  penser qu'il peut éclipser notre vision lorsqu'il y a des aéronefs à voir.</p>
<p>Plusieurs de nos habitants ont vu l'aéronef qui a déjà effaré les habitants de 7 états et a été rapporté en dernier
  survoler Chicago. Pas moins de 3 personnes, so it is reported about town today saw the thing, head lights, tail
  lights, outriggers, illumination, and all. To be sure, no one can give an accurate description of the "critter", for
  that's one of the peculiarities of the airship seen elsewhere, and we want our airship to be as mysterious as
  anybody's. Moreover, everybody who sees it disagrees with everyone else as to its precise characteristics, altitude,
  rapidity of flight, Etc., but these are trifling details not to be considered at all as reflecting either on the
  accuracy of the beholders or the clearness of their eyesight.</p>
<p>Here as elsewhere, the nature of the airship is not known, but it comes from Mars or any other planet we hope it has
  brought sufficient "atmosphere" of its own to exist until it reaches terra firma or gets near enough to be
  photographed.</p>
<p>Even New Troy residents claim to have seen the alleged airship, which has caused so much excitement. Some of the
  citizens of that quiet little village are ready to take their oath that an airship passed within 2,000 feet of
  them. </p>
