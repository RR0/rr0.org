<p>WARSAW, Ind., April 13. - The air ship which has been causing such excitement was seen here last night. It was first
  noticed about 7:30 p.m. northwest of this city, traveling in a northerly direction[,] and disappeared in about half an
  hour. A swaying motion could be plainly seen, and at times a red light was also visible.</p>
