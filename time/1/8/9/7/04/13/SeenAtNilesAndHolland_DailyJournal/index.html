<p>Niles, April 12 ? The mysterious object which has been inhabiting the heavens for the past two weeks and which is
  believed to be an airship was visible from this city last night <span class="note">12 avril</span> and those who saw
  it are positive that the object was not a star. The first discoverers of the supposed airship were W.H. Snyder, a
  prominent jeweler of this city, and Henry Wilbur, a Chicago travelling man. It was then plainly visible and was
  rapidly moving northwest. No outlines could be distinguished but in the lead was a bright electric light. Following it
  were two lights, one red and the other green. They notified other citizens and the mysterious aerial visitor was
  watched until it disappeared from view. Reports from nearby points state that the same object was viewed. </p>
