<p class="abstract"> What is Supposed to be It, Seen by Many Citizens Here Last Evening </p>
<p>What is believed by many to be the much talked of, and mysterious airship, made itself visible to many residents of
  Michigan's Queen City, last evening <span class="note">[12 avril]</span> about 8:55 o'clock. </p>
<p>It was seen and distinctly described by persons who were at the time in widely divergent portions of the city. </p>
<p>L.E.Clawson Esq. and J.H. Dorsey observed it from the window of the former's office in the post office block. </p>
<p>Ex. Ald. Thos. Barry, station agent at Nichols, saw it from that point; Dr. McGuffin from a point near the
  sanitarium. Others who witnessed the sight were W.A. Cody, M.J. Loomis, Dr. McNeil, and A.B. Williams Esq. In all some
  fifty people witnessed the curious sight. </p>
<p>The "ship" when observed, appeared to be about two miles west of the city, travelling in a southeasterly course. At
  first it seemed to be about a mile high, then suddenly, it is averred by many who saw it, a report was heard which
  sounded at the distance like a gun, sparks flew forth, and the ship, which looked to be between 25 and 30 feet in
  length, commenced to settle slowly about half way down to terra firma, stopped for a few moments, a buzzing sound was
  heard, sparks again flew forth as from an emery wheel, and the uncouth object commenced to slowly raise in an almost
  perpendicular position. Suddenly the lights went out on the air monster and it at once became invisible. The sky was
  perfectly clear at the time. </p>
<p>The time that the ship was visible would not exceed five minutes. </p>
<p>The subject of the airship has been the main one under discussion today, but while many scoff at the idea of its
  being an airship, they cannot gainsay the fact that at least a strange phenomena was seen in the face of so many
  reputable citizens who observed the sight. If it was not an airship, what was it? </p>
<p>Of course there has been much joking concerning it, and among the explanations offered was one that it was the
  brilliancy of the new city administration reflected in the sky, while another explained that it was the Republican
  balloon raising over the sanitarium on a trip skyward. </p>
