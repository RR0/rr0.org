<p class="abstract">It Was Seen by Responsible Citizens In a Number of Cities </p>
<p class="abstract2">SETTLED WITHIN HALF A MILE Of Earth at Battle Creek?Red an Green Lights Were Seen and the Buzz of
  Machinery was heard </p>
<p>Battle Creek ? The airship, which is supposed to be in Michigan, was seen by some twenty reputable citizens in
  widely separated points of this city, at 8:55 o'clock last night, apparently from on to two miles west of the city and
  travelling in a southeasterly course, almost a mile high. Suddenly an explosion took place which sounded like the
  report of a gun. Sparks flew and the ship began to slowly settle to within half a mile from the earth. It remained
  down but a few moments, when a buzzing sound was heard. Again the sparks flew out, as if from an emery wheel, and the
  machine began to rise slowly in a perpendicular position again. Suddenly the light went out, after which it was
  impossible to see anything of the ship. The machine is described as about 25 or 30 feet long. It was only visible
  about five minutes. The sky was perfectly clear. </p>
<p>Niles ? The mysterious object which has been inhabiting the heavens for the last two weeks and which is believed to
  be the airship, was visible from this city Sunday [11 avril] night and those who saw it are positive that the object
  they gazed at was not a star. It was rapidly moving northwest. No outline could be distinguished, but in the lead was
  a bright electric light. Following it were two lights, one red and the other green. The mysterious aerial visitor was
  watched until it disappeared from view. Reports from near by points state that the same object was seen. </p>
<p>Holland ? A large black mass hovered over Black Lake for a few moments Sunday night, and then started off toward the
  northwest. Bright colored lights streamed out from in front and behind the object. People here think it was an
  airship.</p>
