<h2>Un rêve du futur modernisé</h2>
<h3>Chicago n'est pas la seule cité venteuse où les vaisseaux aériens naviguent et où des firmes à la pointe du progrès
  font des affaires
</h3>
<p> La nuit dernière <span class="note">[12 avril]</span> près de 400 personnes ont vu ce qui est considéré être le
  mystérieux aéronef qui is prowling about the higher altitudes in the vicinity of Michigan. It was supposed to be the
  same flying machine that was seen in Chicago last Sunday and at Holland, Mich, yesterday. It looked like a speck of
  black in the sky, with a sort of searchlight upon the front and green and white lights in the middle and at the end.
  It traveled with enormous speed and its course seemed to be toward the moon, wherever that was. Suspended from the
  side was a large banner upon which was a large advertisement calling attention to the fact that the Bodenstein
  Clothing Company has a great trouser sale on 200 pair of fine hairline pants made to sell for $5.00, only $3.50. The
  firm was interviewed this morning and it was learned that they had supplied the airship crew with bicycle caps,
  sweaters, and belts in consideration of the advertisement in question. </p>
<h2>Une pluie d'étincelles marque le chemin de l'aéonef dans le Michigan</h2>
<h3>A nouveau la nuit dernière l'envahisseur céleste était pleinement visible</h3>
<h3>Il a esquivé et grésillé au-dessus de Battle Creek et a finalement disparu dans l'espace</h3>
<p> Battle Creek, April 13 ? An air ship was seen to pass west of this city last evening about 8:45 o'clock. The object
  seemed to be about a half mile high when first seen. There appeared to be something that burst, and thousands of
  sparks flew from it and it dropped toward the ground as from a skyrocket. Then it began to settle toward the
  ground.</p>
<p> When within about a quarter of a mile from the ground it seemed to stop and made a sizzling sound that could be
  distinctly heard. Then it began to rise rapidly and almost perpendicularly, when the lights went out. It had two
  lights, one red, in front, and a light blue one behind. The distance between the lights appeared to be about thirty
  feet.</p>
<p> When seen by twenty-five or more people in various parts of the city it was moving in a southerly or southwesterly
  direction. Among those who witnessed the strange craft were I.E. Clawson, a prominent attorney; W. A. Cody, a jeweler;
  Dr. McGuffin, Dr. McNeil, J. H. Dorsey, manager of the Western Union Telegraph Co's office, ex-alderman Thomas Berry
  and M. J. Loomis, photographer. </p>
