<p>Deputy Sheriff Holmes, Deputy Stabler, Officer John Williamson and Marshal Mason, with Special Officer McCune, had a
  meeting in the court house tower at 3 o'clock this afternoon to look for the airship. They have heard a good deal
  about the airy mystery, and so have Butcher Sterr and Dairyman Chappell, and the man that led off the McCune cow, but
  they feel that the whole affair is a fake. They have run up against a good many rum things in their experience, but
  never before have they heard of electric lighted airships and stolen cow stories in the month of April. They would
  have had the talk in the tower, but concluded that they would defer the conference until a later date. The officers
  admit that they made the chase for the cow thief in the patrol wagon - but that is all they desire to have published
  about the affair. Nothing more.</p>
