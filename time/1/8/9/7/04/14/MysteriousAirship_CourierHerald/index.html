<p>Niles, April 13 -- About a dozen people saw what they believe was the airship last night. It came from a
  southwesterly direction and was going about 40 miles an hour in a northwesterly direction. It seemed then to be about
  half a mile high. It looked like an immense ball of fire. Although the night was clear, the ship's outlines were not
  visible. Editor A. J. Shakespeare, of the Gazette, is among those who saw it.</p>
