<h2>It Explodes Near Kalamazoo</h2>
<h3>Wisconsin People Believe the Aerial Visitor a Ringling Advertisement Alights Twice in Illinois Seen in Other
  Cities
</h3>
<p> Kalamazoo, Mich., April 13 &ndash; People of Pavilion have made some startling reports, and, if true, then the much
  talked of airship was not only a reality, but is now a thing of the past.</p>
<p> George W. Somers and William Chadburn, old soldiers, claim to have seen the ship on Sunday evening, when they
  remained up until a late hour in attendance upon a sick horse. The descriptions given by them are somewhat at
  variance, but both agree in the assertion that the apparition was illuminated at both ends and moved rapidly. They had
  scarcely time for their observation when a dull explosion was heard and the object disappeared. They declare the
  report to have been like that of heavy ordnance and to have been immediately succeeded by a distant sound of
  projectiles flying through the air. Wondering greatly, they proceeded to the house, where they passed an excited and
  sleepless night.</p>
<p> Mr. and Mrs. Wallace say they heard the explosion distinctly, but thought it was thunder. But the discoveries of the
  morning are sufficient to establish the veracity of the two actual observers. In one place, two miles from Scott's
  there was found a large coil of heavy wire, evidently a part of some electric appliance. At another point a propeller
  blade of some very light material was discovered in a partially fused condition.</p>
<p> Three men engaged in shingling a barn in Comstock township affirm that, upon resuming work on the morning following
  the occurrence, they found their completed work covered with minute fragments which had in some instances penetrated
  the shingles and entered the boards beneath. </p>
<h3>Think It an Advertising Scheme</h3>
<p> Madison, Wis., April 13 &ndash; The "air ship" problem has been solved. It isn't a star, but its promoters may take
  credit for being orbs of the first magnitude, in the matter of advertising. Railroad men who reached Madison report
  that the much-talked-of aerial machine was seen at Baraboo, and that as the sky was thoroughly overcast with clouds
  there was no Alpha Orionis about it. It first appeared over the east end of the city and after drifting westward about
  a mile, sailed back again and hovered over the winter quarters of Ringling Brother's circus. Suspicion was at once
  aroused that the "air ship" was nothing other than a clever, well-devised and better-executed advertising scheme of
  the circus men. It was recalled then that one of the Ringling brothers had been in Baraboo Sunday and had taken some
  large and mysterious bundles from the train to the winter quarters. It was further recalled that he was seen about the
  city little during the day, and that more than usual life was manifested in the big building down on the riverfront.
  It was then remembered that the ship of the air made its appearance in Chicago almost simultaneously with the advent
  to that city of the Ringlings, and that Omaha, DesMoines and other points where it has been seen are already marked
  out for the circus next summer. The western aphelion of its orbit, if such it may be called, was rather significantly
  over the winter quarters of the Gollmar circus, an institution owned by cousins of the Ringlings.</p>
<p> To the skeptical observers at Baraboo, the "air ship" had the appearance of being controlled from the two circus
  grounds, about a mile apart. In the evening a heavy rain came on, and this had the effect of completely obscuring the
  strange aerial visitor and preventing the people from noting its later movements. The belief cannot be dissipated from
  the minds of Baraboo people that Mr. Ringling, who made a flying visit to their city Sunday, knows more about the
  matter than he had told even to his friends. They are of the opinion that the "air ship" was a succession of balloons
  or something of that kind, which were aimed to prey upon the curiosity of an incredulous public to the end that
  shining half-dollars would pour into the big wagon where tickets for the "big show" are sold. </p>
<h3>It Lands in Illinois</h3>
<p> Carlinville, Ill., April 13 &ndash; The mysterious airship which is the talk of the country has been seen in the
  northern part of this (Macoupin) county. About 2:30 o'clock Monday afternoon it alighted on the farm of Z. Thacker,
  one mile north of Nilwood. It was seen by William Street, "Ed" Teeples and Frank Metcalf. It remained about fifteen
  minutes and continued north. At 6 o'clock it was seen gracefully alighting in a grove two miles south of Girard and a
  mile north of the mining camp of Green Ridge. A large crowd of miners from the latter place started to inspect the
  strange apparition. As they approached within a half-mile it arose and sped north. The Chicago and Atton operators
  wired ahead to be on the watch, and at 8 o'clock it passed over Girard, at the apparent rate of thirty miles an hour.
  It was last sighted at Williamsville, about 8:45 o'clock, headed for Peoria. Those who saw it say it had a boat which
  was cigar shaped, with oars or wings extending from the side, and a canopy on top similar to that of a picnic stand.
  Near Green Ridge an operator, who was hunting avers that he saw a man working about it, apparently fixing the
  machinery. The fact of its alighting twice and remaining such a long time in the same locality leads to the conclusion
  that the machinery was injured in some manner.<br> (Dispatches to The Times-Herald convey the information that the air
  ship was also seen since Sunday night at Emporia, Kan.; Wabash, Ind.; Muncie, Ind.; Ripon, Wis., and Perry, O.T.) </p>
