<p> Kalamazoo (Michigan), 13 avril - Des habitants de Pavilion ont fait des signalements effarants, et, s'ils sont
  vrais, alors l'aéronef dont on a tant parlé n'était pas seulement une réalité, mais est maintenant une chose du
  passé.</p>
<p> George W. Somers et William Chadburn, d'anciens soldats, déclarent avoir vu le vaisseau le soir de dimanche, alors
  qu'ils restaient debout jusqu'à une heure avancée en service sur un cheval malade. Les descriptions données par eux
  sont varient quelque peu, mais tous deux s'accordent sur l'affirmation selon laquelle l'apparition était illuminée aux
  2 extrémités et se déplaçait rapidement. Ils avaient eu à peine le temps de commencer à l'observer qu'une explosion
  [dull] fut entendue et que l'objet disparût. Ils déclarent que the report to have been like that of heavy ordnance and
  to have been immediately succeeded by a distant sound of projectiles flying through the air. Wondering greatly, they
  proceeded to the house, where they passed an excited and sleepless night.</p>
<p> Mr. and Mrs. Wallace say they heard the explosion distinctly, but thought it was thunder. But the discoveries of the
  morning are sufficient to establish the veracity of the two actual observers. In one place, two miles from Scott's
  there was found a large coil of heavy wire, evidently a part of some electric appliance. At another point a propeller
  blade of some very light material was discovered in a partially fused condition.</p>
<p> Three men engaged in shingling a barn in Comstock township affirm that, upon resuming work on the morning following
  the occurrence, they found their completed work covered with minute fragments which had in some instances penetrated
  the shingles and entered the boards beneath. </p>

  <h2>Think It an Advertising Scheme</h2>
  <p> Madison, Wis., April 13 - The "air ship" problem has been solved. It isn't a star, but its promoters may take
    credit for being orbs of the first magnitude, in the matter of advertising. Railroad men who reached Madison report
    that the much-talked-of aerial machine was seen at Baraboo, and that as the sky was thoroughly overcast with clouds
    there was no Alpha Orionis about it. It first appeared over the east end of the city and after drifting westward
    about a mile, sailed back again and hovered over the winter quarters of Ringling Brother's circus. Suspicion was at
    once aroused that the "air ship" was nothing other than a clever, well-devised and better-executed advertising
    scheme of the circus men. It was recalled then that one of the Ringling brothers had been in Baraboo Sunday and had
    taken some large and mysterious bundles from the train to the winter quarters. It was further recalled that he was
    seen about the city little during the day, and that more than usual life was manifested in the big building down on
    the riverfront. It was then remembered that the ship of the air made its appearance in Chicago almost simultaneously
    with the advent to that city of the Ringlings, and that Omaha, DesMoines and other points where it has been seen are
    already marked out for the circus next summer. The western aphelion of its orbit, if such it may be called, was
    rather significantly over the winter quarters of the Gollmar circus, an institution owned by cousins of the
    Ringlings.</p>
  <p> To the skeptical observers at Baraboo, the "air ship" had the appearance of being controlled from the two circus
    grounds, about a mile apart. In the evening a heavy rain came on, and this had the effect of completely obscuring
    the strange aerial visitor and preventing the people from noting its later movements. The belief cannot be
    dissipated from the minds of Baraboo people that Mr. Ringling, who made a flying visit to their city Sunday, knows
    more about the matter than he had told even to his friends. They are of the opinion that the "air ship" was a
    succession of balloons or something of that kind, which were aimed to prey upon the curiosity of an incredulous
    public to the end that shining half-dollars would pour into the big wagon where tickets for the "big show" are
    sold. </p></section>

  <h2>Il atterrit dans l'Illinois</h2>
  <p> Carlinville (Illinois), 13 avril - Le mystérieux aéronef qui est le sujet de discussion du pays a été vu dans la
    partie nord de ce comté <span class="note">[Macoupin]</span>. Vers 14:30 lundi après-midi, il descendit sur la ferme
    de Z. Thacker, à un mile au nord de Nilwood. Il a été vu par William Street, "Ed" Teeples et Frank Metcalf. Il est
    resté 15 mn environ et a continué au nord. À 18:00 il a été vu descendant gracement dans une plantation à 2 miles au
    sud de Girard et à un mile au nord du camp de la mine de Green Ridge. Une grande foule de mineurs de ce dernier
    endroit a commencé à inspecter l'étrange apparition. Alors qu'ils s'approchaient à moins de 1/2 mile il s'éleva et
    fonça vers le nord. Les opérateurs de Chicago et d'Atton télégraphièrent vers là-bas pour qu'ils soient sur le
    qui-vive, et à 20:00 il passa au-dessus de Girard, à la vitesse apparente de 30 miles/h. Il a été vu pour la
    dernière fois à Williamsville, vers 20:45, en direction de Peoria. Ceux qui l'ont vu disent qu'il avait un boat
    which was cigar shaped, with oars or wings extending from the side, and a canopy on top similar to that of a picnic
    stand. Near Green Ridge an operator, who was hunting avers that he saw a man working about it, apparently fixing the
    machinery. The fact of its alighting twice and remaining such a long time in the same locality leads to the
    conclusion that the machinery was injured in some manner.<br> (Dispatches to The Times-Herald convey the information
    that the air ship was also seen since Sunday night at Emporia, Kan.; Wabash, Ind.; Muncie, Ind.; Ripon, Wis., and
    Perry, O.T.) </p>
