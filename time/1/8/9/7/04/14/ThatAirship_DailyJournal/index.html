<h2>It Blew Up and Went to Pieces Before It was Seen in Battle Creek</h2>
<p> Galesburg, April 13 ? George W. Somers and William Chadburn of Pavilion Township claim the alleged airship went to
  pieces in that vicinity Sunday night <span class="note">[11 avril]</span>. They heard a dull explosion and the lights
  on the supposed airship went out. The next morning, it is said that part of the propeller and some wire were found
  which proved that the thing had burst.</p>
