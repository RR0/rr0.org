<h2> As Seen at Algona and Other Iowa Towns Saturday Night. All Kinds of Stories.</h2>
<h3>Geo. Boyle at Whittemore is Keeping Up His Record in Good Shape, but it Looks As Though Whittemore Saw Our Paper
  Balloon
</h3>
<p> Algona people rest easy again since last Saturday night. There had been a feeling of "goneness" or something lacking
  ever since the REPUBLICAN'S reporter at Wesley gave an account of the famous airship having been seen at that place.
  Algona people mean to be strictly up to date in all things, and when the aerial craft made its appearance here
  Saturday evening it was hailed with joy by the citizens af all denominations and political parties. There had been
  some fears that Bailey or Britt would turn loose his fertile imagination in so promising a field and get a "scoop" on
  the Algona papers, but it seems his mind had been lulled into temporary forgetfulness by allowing it to rest on the
  subject of "Divorce by Telephone" or something else. </p>
<p> Saturday night about 10 o'clock word came by telephone that the airship could be seen at Swea City. Armstrong and
  other places in northern Kossuth and inquiry was made if it could be seen here. A number of responsible and veracious
  citizens immediately repaired to the roof of the State Bank building; and without glasses of any kind (or bottles,
  either for that matter) could plainly distinguish the mysterious object which has filled the columns of the daily
  newspapers with conjecture for the past ten days. It was floating in the northwest heavens and seemed to be only seven
  or eight miles away. It had the appearance of being very low down, probably not over eight hundred or a thousand feet
  in the air. It appeared to a man who was perfectly sober to be a locomotive headlight and was very brilliant with a
  mellow light. It was moving toward the southwest at a good rate and was not to be confused with the stars or any other
  heavenly bodies. It remained in view about forty minutes and gradually disappeared in the west. Its course was
  irregular and at times it had a dipping motion. The light changed at times to red, white and green. Some say that two
  smaller lights were to be distinguished directly in the rear of the main light, and moving as it moved. Others say
  that it looked like an electric trolley car at a distance and that they could actually see the sparks from the trolley
  as it glanced along the wire. It has been stated that voices were distinctly heard coming from the strange vessel
  singing the chorus from "My Love is a Man in the Moon," but this is probably an exaggeration as the distance was too
  great. Large parties watched the phenomena from the top of the State Bank and Thorington House observatory.</p>
<hr>
<p>After the airship proper had completed its course and sank from view, some of those who were disappointed in not
  seeing it were treated to something that was almost as satisfactory as the real thing. A few practical jokers secured
  an immense paper balloon and sent it up from the State Bank building. It went up "beautifully" and floated off to the
  west. It isn't safe to say "airship" to some who ran six or eight blocks to get a pair of field glasses to gaze at the
  "wonder." </p>
<hr>
<p>Mayor Boyle, J.M. Farley and other prominent citizens of Whittemore say the airship was seen at Whittemore Saturday
  night. It came from the northeast and went directly over the town, seeming to be only about 300 feet in the air. The
  next morning over five hundred keys were picked up in the streets and on top of the houses. The keys are all brand new
  and of the same general style. D.A. Haggard has two of the keys. Some people are so mean as to insinuate that the
  Whittemore airship was the paper balloon, sent up from here, although the keys are not so easily accounted for. Mr.
  Farley says they are worth $125, and ordinary practical jokers don't spend that sum to mystify people. </p>
<p> The airship was seen by towns along almost a direct line from Cedar Rapids to Minneapolis Saturday night and at some
  places it came so close to the earth that its shape could be made out. It followed the line of the B.C.R. &amp; N. and
  the reports corroborate each other. </p>
<hr>
<h2>SOME "VERACIOUS" ACCOUNTS</h2>
<p> Omaha comes to the front with a solution of the whole mystery. A dispatch says that it will be cleared up within a
  few days through the medium of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. In the first mail yesterday Secretary Wakefield
  received a letter dated at Omaha. The letter was signed "A.C. Clinton," and read as follows: </p>
<p><q>"To the Exposition Directors; My identity up to date has been unknown, but I will come to the front now, that is,
  if you will guarantee me 870,000 square feet of space. I am the famous airship constructor, and will guarantee you
  positively of this fact in a week. The airship is my own invention, and as I am an Omaha man. I wish it to be held as
  an Omaha invention. It will safely carry twenty people to a height of from 10,000 to 20,000 feet. I truly believe I
  have the greatest invention and discovery ever made. Will see you April 17, 1897, at the headquarters." </q></p>
<p> At Rhodes, Iowa the account says it came so near that the sound of machinery could be heard, which soon became so
  loud as a heavy train of cars. All at once the aerial monster took a sudden plunge downward and was immersed in the
  reservoir of the C.M. &amp; St. P. railway which is almost a lake, covering about eight acres of land. No pen can
  describe what followed. The boiling lava from Vesuvius pouring into the sea could only equal it. The light was so
  large and had created so much heat that the horrible hissing which occurred when the monster plunged into the lake,
  could be heard for miles, and the water of the reservoir was so hot that the naked hand could not be held in it. </p>
<p> The depot agent at Lanark, Ill., makes the other fellows feel sick, when he tells his story. He says that at about
  3:35 in the morning he heard a terrible noise, and at first he thought a cyclone had spring up, but upon peering out
  of the window he discerned a monster object slowly descending to the ground. Its immense wings wafted gently up and
  down. It reached earth without a jar, save that the rudder demolished a wing on a frame house. He rang the fire bells
  and soon every inhabitant in the city was out. At first they were terror stricken, but it soon dawned upon them that
  the monster object was in reality an airship. Soon after its landing a man now more than two feet in height came out
  of the ship. He wore an immense beard of a pinkish hue, and his head was ornamented with some ivory like substance. He
  was heavily clothed in robes resembling the hide of a hippopotamus. His feet were uncovered near the ankles, but
  lashed firmly on the soles were two immense pieces of iron ore. About his neck was string on which were 23 diamonds.
  When asked where he came from he made no reply, being apparently deaf. He said nothing and made motions indicating
  that he wanted something to eat or drink. He drank two bucketsful of water and ate three sides of bacon, after
  declining to take ham. A short time later after three other persons, similar in stature and similarly attired came out
  of the ship by means of a long peculiar rope, which reached to the ground. They could not speak or hear. One carried a
  staff of gold. </p>
