<p>The airship was plainly seen by several reliable citizens of Benton Harbor and St. Joseph ? so they allege ? and
  declare that it is no fake. It was seen about 8:00 Tuesday night <span class="note">[13 avril]</span>, with blue, red,
  and green lights, and was moving rapidly in a northwesterly direction. The outlines could not be discerned, owing to
  the lights it bore and its great altitude over Lake Michigan.</p>
