<p>Some of our citizens imagined that they saw the airship again Wednesday night. It appeared in the sky off west of the
  city and for an hour, so those who claim to have seen it say. It sailed southward until the lights disappeared. </p>
<p>Dr. Scott, of St. Joseph, was among those who are willing to take oath they saw it. </p>
<p>Yesterday a report came from Galesburg, Mich., to the effect that the vessel exploded over Pavilion Township and
  that portions of the electric appliances and a point of the propeller blade were found, besides other small pieces of
  the "ship".</p>
<p>In Chicago, a policeman came the nearest to solving the airship mystery than any of them. He found a large tissue
  paper balloon made of red, white, and blue paper with the lower portion burned.</p>
<p>Dr. Geo. Ball saw the airship last night and called the attention of John A. Crawford to it as they were walking
  down from supper. Of course, the Doctor does not think the light which he saw, came from an airship but he says it was
  a strange light and he is going to climb the roof of the highest building in town tonight and watch for the strange
  visitor with a glass. The light which they saw, was in the southwest and was visible form about ten minutes and then
  faded from view.</p>
<p>Miss Quackenbush, cashier at Morrow & Stones Annex, was among those who saw the ship last night and even thinks
  she saw the outlines of it.</p>
