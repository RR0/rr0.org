<p>Brevities ? Again last evening at about 8 o'clock the airship, or what has been called such was visible to Battle
  Creek residents many of whom saw the aerial wonder as it traveled rapidly westward in plain sight, and a few moments
  passed from view on its hurried course. Those who saw it last evening do not describe it as vividly as those who
  witnessed the novelty on Monday evening. They say it looked very much like a star or an electric arc light seen at a
  distance, only that the color changed from that of a star to a reddish cast. The most general explanation made of the
  object is that it is some kind of a meteor or shooting star, but unlike them in the changing of color, and the
  direction of its course, meteors having almost invariably a downward course. That the mysterious object of last
  evening was not of human origin is plainly evidenced by the speed at which it was moving, and that too being against
  the wind.</p>
