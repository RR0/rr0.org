<p class="abstract">Mayor Boyle's Description of the Mysterious Air Ship </p>
<p class="abstract2">People are Sighted and the Sound of Strange Music Heard &ndash; Town Deluged With Keys</p>
<p> Whittemore, Iowa, April 14. &ndash; To the Editor: The all absorbing topic, the theme that is discussed morning noon
  and night, is the air ship, so called, that was seen Saturday night passing over our quiet city. When first observed
  by our people it seemed as far east as Algona, and a little to the south of the city. At this time it was at a great
  altitude slowly descending and coming directly toward Whittemore. When within about a mile the headlight became so
  intensely bright that a person could gaze at it with difficulty. The light had the appearance of an electric light and
  was swaying from side to side giving the ship the appearance of rocking. It passed directly over the city and those
  who saw it say about two miles high. As it passed to the west a better view was obtained. In appearance it resembled
  an immense cigar, with an intensely bright light at the forward end and a deep, dark red light at the rear, with a
  green and blue light at either side, about midway from the ends. Opinions differ as to the size of the craft, none
  putting it less than twenty nor more than thirty five feet in length, and from six to nine feet in breadth. Our city
  marshal and E.C. Merrill, landlord of the St. Nicholas, both of whom got a splendid view of the wonderful craft, give
  the best and most accurate description of it. They agree as to the length and lights.Kortie stands ready to swear that
  he saw the forms of human beings, and also said that he heard the sound of music from above. The music being of
  peculiar tone and different from any he ever before heard. The ship after passing Whittemore, seemed to rise until
  when in the vicinity of Emmetsburg it had attained the same altitude it had when first observed.</p>
<p> And now comes the most mysterious phenomenon connected with the passing of the heavenly traveler. On Sunday morning
  the early riser was astonished to find our streets and sidewalks strewn with keys of a most peculiar pattern, no two
  of which were alike, and none of which bore the mark of any manufacturer of this mundane sphere. The number seems
  limitless, some four hundred being found Sunday and Monday and quite a number since. Mr. Frank Eller who found 85
  Sunday morning, says about a dozen of them found were stuck in the pine plank of the walks lending evidence to the
  theory that those mysterious keys came from the mysterious visitor of the night previous. Landlord Merrill found some
  on the roof of his house, others were found on the roofs of the German American Bank, the Thos. McGovern building and
  also on the Whittemore State Bank, almost convincing proof that the mystery if solved, the solution must come from the
  realms above.</p>
<p> But the strangest coincidence connected with this whole matter is that Prof. Snyder of Eagle Grove had just
  concluded a series of prophetic lectures here, and prophesied, and had proved it by Holy writ that the end of the
  world was near. The coming of the navigator of space on the eve of these lectures, the presence of the keys, put the
  people of our quiet city to thinking that perhaps the heavenly visitor was a messenger from the celestial city, and of
  all the towns in Iowa, Whittemore alone had found favor, and had been recognized as worthy of any consideration, and
  this blessing showered upon us was a sure manifestation and indication that we were the chosen people, and, perhaps,
  alone possessed the keys to open the pearly gates.</p>
<p> The above is an honest, unvarnished and correct statement of the matter and the keys can be seen at the mayor's
  office by any who care to take the trouble to go there. </p>
<p> The air ship was seen again Tuesday night by nearly all of our people. It was seen over the city about 8 0'clock
  going in a northerly direction. </p>
<p>(The Saturday evening sighting reported in the above letter to the editor was Saturday, April 10, The Tuesday night
  report is April 13)</p>
