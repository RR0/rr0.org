<p>Apropos of the recent talk about an airship, Arthur T. Nettleton, of New Milford, Conn., writes to the Newtown
  (Conn.) Bee saying that a history of Connecticut, published in London in 1781, chronicled the appearance of an airship
  in Connecticut in 1646. The people of New Haven had sent a ship to England that year to procure a patent for the
  colony and a charter for the city. Some time after the vessel sailed a storm arose, and a day of prayer and fasting
  was observed in the hope that the safety of the ship would thereby be insured. At the close of the day the people
  looked up in the sky and saw their ship under full sail, and the sailors steering her from west to east. She came over
  the meeting where they had fasted and prayed and then was met by a Euroclydon, which rent the sails and overset the
  ship; in a few moments she fell down near the weather-cock on the steeple and instantly vanished. The people all
  returned to the meeting, where the minister gave thanks to God for answering the desires of his servants and giving
  them an infallible token of the loss of their ship and charter. </p>
