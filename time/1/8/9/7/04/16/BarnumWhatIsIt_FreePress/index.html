<p class="abstract"> Many More Michigan Citizens Report Having Seen It</p>
<h3 class="abstract2">Caused Excitement at Hart, Olivet, and Middleville</h3>
<p> Hart, Mich., April 15 -- At about 9 o'clock last night a large dark object was seen floating over Shelby which was
  supposed to have been the much talked of airship. As described it was about like a large balloon with two lights, one
  white and one green. It was witnessed by a large crowd.</p>
<p> Olivet, Mich., April 15 -- The airship was observed in this place last night about 11 o'clock by a large number of
  responsible persons including a number of students. It appeared from the northeast and was headed in the direction of
  Albion. Only three red lights could be distinguished and it was at too great a height to make out its outline. It was
  moving very rapidly and disappeared in a short time. No explanation could be given at the college this morning.</p>
<p> Middleville, Mich., April 15 -- A sensation was caused in our village last evening by what those who saw it called
  an airship. When first discovered, about 9 p.m., it was southwest of town but it was moving northward and downward.
  But for its moving and changing lights, red, blue, green, it might have been taken for a star. At about 10:30 p.m.
  another one rose east of the village and floated up and southwest. A car attachment had colored lights and scattered
  sparks and what was supposed to be smoke. </p>
