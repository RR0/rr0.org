<p>Unidentified flying objects are nothing new for the people of Vincennes. In 1897 a mysterious airship passed over the
  city twice on the night of Friday, April 16. According to the Vincennes Morning Commercial, the airship first appeared
  about nine o'clock, traveling along the extreme eastern portion of the horizon: A sphere of golden light was first
  seen in the vicinity of the Union Depot, from down in the city. Those near the ship claimed they could clearly see the
  dark lines of its car, although no passengers were observed. </p>
<p>Many reputable citizens witnessed the flight. From his home on Burnett's Heights, Sam Judah said he could plainly see
  the ship with its fluttering wings, its movements resembling a side wheeler steam-boat, sailing through the air with
  incredible velocity. </p>
<p>From his doorway, where he had gone to look at his thermometer, Col. Ewing saw the light, which he at first thought
  was a falling star, but as it moved so slowly, soon became convinced that it was the inevitable airship. Ewing watched
  it for about four minutes. </p>
<p>Anton Simon noticed a ball of fire, moving in a north-westerly to southeasterly course, which he later realized was
  an airship. </p>
<p>Victor Schonfeld, somewhat of an expert observer, having made airships and balloons, a life-long study, and having
  even made several ascensions in his time, testified that this was a genuine airship. </p>
<p>Among many others who saw the airship were Col. M.P. Ghee, Thomas Eastham, Judge DeWolf, Will Mason, Scott Emison,
  Jesse Foulks, all highly reputable witnesses. </p>
<p>The airship first passed rapidly overhead in a southwesterly direction. An hour and a half later, it was seen again,
  passing over the northern portion of the city, traveling in a northwesterly direction: </p>
<p>The last time it seemed to pass directly over the fairgrounds (present-day Gregg Park) and traveled more slowly than
  in its first swift passage straight over the city. </p>
<p>It is thought that the navigator turned his flying machine around and started back, or that the ship landed near the
  city and started back. </p>
<p>Some say voices could be heard in the airship, and one gentleman, who saw it from Burnett's Heights says he could see
  a man moving about in the ship and that he appeared to be adjusting the machinery. </p>
<p>The Commercial concluded: Other cities have seen the airship and now Vincennes is strictly "up to date'. </p>
<p>In fact, the Vincennes encounter was only one of some 200 sightings made by thousands of people in 19 states, during
  our nation's first UFO flap of 1896-1897. </p>
<p>In his article, Close Encounters of the Earliest Kind, in the December, 1979 issue of American Heritage magazine, Ron
  Genini described the beginning of the flap in (where else?) California, in November of 1896. There were elements of
  hoax in some of the accounts, but many people believed they saw something. Many of the eyewitness accounts agreed that
  a traveling light or airship moved against the wind at an altitude of from 50 to 2,000 feet. It was cigar- or
  egg-shaped, with wing-like propellers or fan-like wheels revolving rapidly . . . and a doubly powerful arc light at
  its bottom center. </p>
<p>Soon, hoaxters got into the act, claiming to have ridden the flying machine, or to have talked with its crew, or even
  to have invented it. When some of these hoaxes were exposed, newspapers became skeptical, questioning the veracity or
  sobriety of witnesses, and making the airship the butt of jokes. After the excitement died down on the West Coast, the
  airship reappeared in the skies of the Midwest and South in April, 1897. In the first chapter of his book The UFO
  Controversy in America, <span class="people">David Michael Jacobs</span> details the many sightings over Chicago, St.
  Louis, Milwaukee, Omaha, Kansas City, Dallas, and many other cities and towns. </p>
<p>Colored or intensely bright white lights were the most characteristic feature of the airship descriptions; in many
  other particulars the descriptions agreed with those from California--a cylindrical, or cigar-shaped body with a
  propeller or propellers. </p>
<p>As Jacobs points out, the first modern airship or dirigible was built in France in 1898, but there is no record of
  any American inventor producing an airship at this time. And the speeds attributed to the mysterious
  airship--estimated at up to 200 miles per hour -- far exceeded anything possible at the time. Again, there were some
  hoaxters, and again the newspapers were skeptical. </p>
<p>In Vincennes, the evening Western Sun, having been scooped by the morning paper, wrote a kind of tongue-in-cheek
  parody: </p>
<p>The Air Ship Sails the Azure Depths like a Tongue of Light; It Floats through Space Leaving Multitudes of Worshipping
  People on the Earth Beneath-- Supposed to Contain Five Passengers and to be Enroute to Jacksonville, Fla. <br> The Sun
  described the effects upon the supposed superstitious inhabitants of that aristocratic colored suburb known as
  "Idaho,' who were scared to death. </p>
<p>A few days later the airship lent itself to advertising: </p>
<p>The airship seems to be an assured fact. But it is not attracting so much attention as the slashing prices that are
  being made on hardware and bicycles at Scott &amp; Sons. Millers Drug Store on Main Street used the airship to draw
  attention to its ice cream and sodas. </p>
<p>There was not another sighting flap until 1946. </p>
<p>The chief difference was that while people in 1896-7 thought that the UFO's were man-made objects, in the modern ear
  the tendency is to believe that they are not of this earth. </p>
<p>A winged ship in the sky was how the San Francisco Call described a mysterious airship seen at Sacramento on Nov. 17,
  1896. The illustration closely matches the description of one seen over Vincennes in April, 1897. </p>
<p>FLYING MATTRESS? -- With wings like mattress ticking, a California airship is depicted shining its light earthward.
  Also shown is a four-man crew in a canopied cockpit. Singing to the accompaniment of a phonograph supposedly could be
  heard coming from the craft.</p>
