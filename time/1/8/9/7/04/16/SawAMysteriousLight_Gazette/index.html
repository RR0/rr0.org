<p> Constantine, April 15--- No less than from four to ten responsible citizens saw a mysterious light moving in a
  northwesterly direction here last night at 10:45. It varied in height from 40 to 75 feet, so they claim. </p>
<h2>A New Version</h2>
<h3>Prairie Ronde Wheel Horses <br> Think They Saw Prosperity <br> Seeking a Landing Place</h3>
<p> Schoolcraft, April 16--- This village was visited last night by the airship. William G. Knight says it was going at
  the rate of a mile a minute. Arch Finley, the Globe Trotter, says that he and William Lucas saw it at about the same
  time. Horace Kinney and Zach Fletcher of Prairie Ronde, report that they saw the same thing but thought it was
  prosperity looking for a place to light.</p>
