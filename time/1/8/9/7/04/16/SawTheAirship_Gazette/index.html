<p class="abstract">Unsubstantiated Statement of Two Bay City Men</p>
<p> Two residents of Bay City claim they saw the mysterious "airship" floating over that city at an early hour this
  morning. They were about two miles from the city when the celestial visitor went sailing across the sky. So far as
  known no one in Saginaw saw the ship and the Bay City men may have drawn largely upon their imagination.</p>
<p> Captain Baskins, of the west side police force, stated this morning that some of the officers doing duty on the west
  side last night had reported seeing the airship, which fact he considered the best evidence of their good
  conduct. </p>
