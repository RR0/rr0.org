<h2>Occupants of the Aerial Craft Drop a Swordfish in the Lake and Sail away</h2>
<p> Cleveland, O., April 15 &ndash; {Special} &ndash; S.H. Davis of Detroit says that while out on his fish tug, the Sea
  Wing, yesterday the fishermen noticed a queer looking boat not far away. Capt. Joseph Singler, master of the tug, and
  Mr. Davis agree that it appeared to be about forty feet in length. It had a cabin covering about one-fourth of the
  deck surface. A man dressed in a checked nunting suit and wearing a long peaked cap was fishing from the boat. He was
  apparently about 25 years of age. A handsome woman sat at his side, with a boy of 10 at her feet. As the Sea Wing
  neared the curious craft a gayly decorated object was slowly inflated and rose to the length of the ropes by which it
  was attached to the boat. It was a balloon, cylinder shaped, about fifty feet long. Slowly the boat rose into the air
  until it stood directly over the tug, about 500 feet from the water. It circled like a hawk for several minutes.
  Suddenly there was asplash in the water. A large swordfish had been dropped from the airship. The fish was stunned and
  is now on exhibition in a tank at the fire tug, Cleveland, O. A sail was dropped from the airship and the mysterious
  people were carried away by the high wind. Mr. Davis said the boat had a wheel similar to those on steamers. This it
  is stated acts as a propeller in the air as well as on the water.</p>
<p> Mount Vernon, Ill., April 15 &ndash; {Special} &ndash; What is thought to have been the mysterious airship was seen
  here by more then a hundred persons last night. Mayor Wells, who had an excellent view of the mysterious visitor from
  the observatory attached to his residence, says it resembled the body of a huge man swimming through the air with an
  electric light at its back.</p>
<p> Carlyle, Ill., April 15 &ndash; {Special} &ndash; The airship was seen this evening traveling rapidly in a
  northwesterly course. </p>
<p> South Haven, Mich., April 15 &ndash; {Special} &ndash; The much talked of airship seen here last evening headed
  westward. Elder Ketchum says it was cigar shaped and moved with remarkable speed.</p>
<p> Quincy, Ill., - {Special} &ndash; The Wabash passenger train which arrived here at 10 o'clock tonight raced for
  fifteen minutes with the alleged airship. They first sighted the thing near Perry Springs, firty-two miles east of
  Quincy, and raced with it to Hersman, when it pulled ahead of the train and disappeared. The train was running forty
  miles an hour. All of the passengers saw it, but all they could see was two lights, one white, the other red.</p>
<p> Hillsboro, Ill., April 15 &ndash; {Special} &ndash; What is supposed to be the airship was seen in the western
  heavens by a number of reputable citizens last evening. </p>
