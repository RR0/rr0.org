<p>Cleveland, O., 15 avril - {Special} - S. H. Davis de Detroit dit qu'alors qu'il était dehors sur son fish tug, le
  Sea Wing, hier les pêcheurs remarquèrent un bateau à l'air étrange pas si loin de là. Le capitaine Joseph Singler,
  maître du tug, et M. Davis s'accordent sur le fait qu'il semblait faire dans les 40 pieds de long. Il avait un
  habitacle couvrant près de 1/4 de la surface du pont. Un homme vêtu d'un checked nunting suit et portant wearing a
  long peaked cap pêchait depuis le bateau. Il avait apparemment dans les 25 ans. Une belle femme s'asseya à son côté,
  avec un garçon de 10 ans à ses pieds. Alors que le Sea Wing s'approchait le curieux appareil a gayly decorated object
  was slowly inflated and rose to the length of the ropes by which it was attached to the boat. It was a balloon,
  cylinder shaped, about fifty feet long. Slowly the boat rose into the air until it stood directly over the tug, about
  500 feet from the water. It circled like a hawk for several minutes. Suddenly there was asplash in the water. A large
  swordfish had been dropped from the airship. The fish was stunned and is now on exhibition in a tank at the fire tug,
  Cleveland, O. A sail was dropped from the airship and the mysterious people were carried away by the high wind. Mr.
  Davis said the boat had a wheel similar to those on steamers. This it is stated acts as a propeller in the air as well
  as on the water.</p>
<p>Mount Vernon, Ill., April 15 - {Special} - What is thought to have been the mysterious airship was seen here by more
  then a hundred persons last night. Mayor Wells, who had an excellent view of the mysterious visitor from the
  observatory attached to his residence, says it resembled the body of a huge man swimming through the air with an
  electric light at its back.</p>
<p>Carlyle, Ill., April 15 - {Special} - The airship was seen this evening traveling rapidly in a northwesterly
  course. </p>
<p>South Haven, Mich., April 15 - {Special} - The much talked of airship seen here last evening headed westward. Elder
  Ketchum says it was cigar shaped and moved with remarkable speed.</p>
<p>Quincy, Ill., - {Special} - The Wabash passenger train which arrived here at 10 o'clock tonight raced for fifteen
  minutes with the alleged airship. They first sighted the thing near Perry Springs, firty-two miles east of Quincy, and
  raced with it to Hersman, when it pulled ahead of the train and disappeared. The train was running forty miles an
  hour. All of the passengers saw it, but all they could see was two lights, one white, the other red.</p>
<p>Hillsboro, Ill., April 15 - {Special} - What is supposed to be the airship was seen in the western heavens by a
  number of reputable citizens last evening. </p>
