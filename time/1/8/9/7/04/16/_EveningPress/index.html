<p> Reynolds, it is claimed, not only had the pleasure of looking at the airship, but several people had the rare good
  fortune to become acquainted with the navigator. The thing swooped down from the sky and a half a dozen farmers
  immediately surrounded it. While they were examining the strange craft a creature nine and a half feet in height
  clambered over the side and grew eloquent in an unknown tongue. One of the farmers hospitably extended his hand, but
  in the country the visitor comes from this seems to be considered an affront. The big fellow swung one of his legs and
  the farmer retired in disorder with a broken hip. Then the unknown sprang into his aerial craft, turned on some
  strange power and the whole thing darted away. There is no still in the vicinity of Reynolds that is known to the
  revenue authorities and a sharp lookout is being kept for moonshiners.</p>
