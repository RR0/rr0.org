<p><span class="place">Aurora, Wise Co., Tex.</span>, April 18 -- (To The News) -- About 6 o'clock this morning the
  early risers of Aurora were astonished at the sudden appearance of the airship which has been sailing through the
  country.</p>
<p>It was traveling due north, and much nearer the earth than ever before. Evidently some of the machinery was out of
  order, for it was making a speed of only ten or twelve miles an hour, and gradually settling toward the earth. It
  sailed directly over the public square, and when it reached the north part of town it collided with the tower of Judge
  Proctor's windmill and went to pieces with a terrific explosion, scattering debris over several acres of ground,
  wrecking the windmill and water tank and destroying the judge's flower garden. </p>
<p>The pilot of the ship is supposed to have been the only one on board, and while his remains are badly disfigured,
  enough of the original has been picked up to show that he was not an inhabitant of this world.</p>
<p>Mr. T.J. Weems, the United States Army signal service officer at this place and an authority on <a
    href="/science/discipline/hard/nat/univ/astro">astronomy</a>, gives it as his opinion that the pilot was a
  native of the planet Mars. </p>
<p>Papers found on his person -- evidently the records of his travels -- are written in some unknown hieroglyphics and
  cannot be deciphered. </p>
<p>The ship was too badly wrecked to form any conclusion as to its construction or motive power. It was built of an
  unknown metal, resembling somewhat a mixture of aluminum and silver, and it must have weighed several tons. </p>
<p>The town is today full of people who are viewing the wreck and gathering specimens of strange metal from the debris.
  The pilot's funeral will take place at noon tomorrow. </p>
