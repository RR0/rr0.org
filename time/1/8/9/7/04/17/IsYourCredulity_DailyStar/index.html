  Marion eyes. This is no joke. Don't smile.</p>
<p>For many days the metropolitan papers have been teeming with dispatches from various points of the compass where the
  wonderful aerial navigator has been seen, describing its appearance, lights and sounds.</p>
<p>Friday night [April 16] H. R. Bolander, superintendent of the Ohio Bicycle works, of this city, who is something of
  an astronomer in a small way, was out in his yard with a mirror scanning the heavens for a glimpse of the moons of
  Jupiter.</p>
<p>At about 8 p.m. Mr. Bolander says he was surprised to see in his mirror the bright lights from a peculiar looking
  airship. Quickly looking up he observed that the machine was cigar shaped and had a bright, spreading light looking
  something like the illumination that a large incandescent light would produce. Bolander says the airship was very high
  up and was moving in a southwesterly direction. He could hear no sounds emanating from the mysterious aerial visitor,
  but says he is a little hard of hearing.</p>
<p>The flying machine was also seen by John Reed, the State street railway watchman, L. R. Gurley, and other reliable
  men.</p>
<p>Some might say that it must be a peculiar kind of a liquor that would make a man see flying machines, but then it is
  well known that these men are teetotalers, and no such excuse will go with them.
</p>
<p>The celebrated flying machine has been seen in Marion. That's settled.</p>
