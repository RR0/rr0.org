<title>The Airship Alighted Near Williamston Last Night</title>

<p>(ou 18 avril 1897)</p>
<p>Williamston, Mich., April 17 - (Special) - This morning at a point a mile and a half south and west of this village,
  a balloon or flying machine alighted. The air ship was seen about an hour before it alighted by a dozen farmers or
  more, who had been watching it. On its attempt to light, they gathered around, but a good many of them did not remain
  long after the landing of the ship. A strange man, if man he might be called, was in charge of the ship. While he
  seemed to have plenty of clothes, he seemed to have no use for them, as he was almost naked, and seemed to be
  suffering from the heat. He is about 91/2 feet tall and his talk, while musical, is not talk at all, but seems to be a
  repetition of bellowing. One of the farmers who was somewhat braver, attempted to go near him, and got a kick that
  will last him for some time, having got his hip broken. </p>
<p>Great excitement prevails here, and lots of people are flocking here from Okemos and Locke to view the strange being
  at a distance, as no one dares to go near. He seems to be trying to talk to the people. The people here are
  incredulous and those who have not seen refuse to believe, although 6 of the best people are here and affirm that it
  is the truth. From their excited manners, we are led to believe that no hoax exists. At 8:10 last evening the air ship
  passed south and a little west of this village. Hundreds of people watched its flight. </p>
