  Airship stories are now coming in from Irondequoit, a town close to Rochester and not far enough from New York to
  enable one to believe that the metropolis will much longer be spared by the epidemic which has worked such havoc in
  the West. CYRUS WHEATLEY, a man whose very name is a guarantee of bucolic respectability, solemnly declares to the
  residents of his natal village and to reporters from the city which is Monroe County's pride, that while he and his
  hired man were returning home Wednesday night [April 14] after ministering to the needs of a neighbor's sick Jersey
  cow, they saw the now famous apparition. It had the usual brilliant headlight, and green and red lamps were displayed
  on either side of it in the reckless way which has already been noted as a violation of the navigation laws
  characteristic of airship Captains. Neither Mr. WHEATLEY nor his servitor could see the aerial vessel itself, but they
  know it was there, for the lights couldn't have been careering through space by themselves. This is obviously true,
  and the inevitable conclusion, unless a farmer can be unveracious, is that the marvel of the skies is now in New York
  State and will soon be over this defenseless city. Some of Mr. WHEATLEY's envious neighbors say that what he saw was
  an electric car on a high trestle, but rumors of a big jug of hard cider go with their end of the story, and we do not
  care to dwell upon so uncharitable a theory.</p>
