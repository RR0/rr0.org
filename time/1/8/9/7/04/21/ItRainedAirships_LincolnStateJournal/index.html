<title>It Rained Airships</title>

<p>Monday evening was prolific in airships in Nebraska. One was seen in the east at Table Rock, Pawnee county, another
  at Juniata, Clay county, in the northwest, and a third at Bradshaw, York county, at about the same hour. Three of
  these heavenly messengers at once do pretty well and it is possible that there are about ninety counties where one was
  seen but not reported on account of the bashfulness of the beholders. It fairly rains airships these days. And yet a
  half dozen or so have evidently shaken out their main sails and struck for the east.</p>
<p>It is time the government weather bureau got a move on it and it should at once direct all its agents to keep a
  lookout for airships. It will be interesting to have a census of them published as soon as possible. Perhaps there are
  a thousand of them all told.</p>
<p>The airship has been making a great sensation in Texas, where the people are supposed to have acquired immunity from
  all serious visual disorders arising from the current beverage. A solemn churchman of Dallas saw the ship and
  describes it minutely: "<q>It was shaped like a Mexican cigar, with great wings resembling those of an enormous
    butterfly. It was brilliantly illuminated by two great searchlights, and was sailing in a southeasterly direction
    with the velocity of the wind, presenting a magnificent spectacle."</q></p>
