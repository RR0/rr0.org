<p>Josserand: Considerable excitement prevails at this writing in the usually quiet village of Josserand, caused by the
  visit of the noted airship, which has been at some many points of late. Mr Frank Nichols, a prominent farmer living
  about two miles east of here, and a man of unquestioned veracity, was awakened the night before last near the hour of
  twelve by a whirring noise similar to that made by machinery. Upon looking out he was started upon beholding brilliant
  lights streaming from a ponderous vessel of strange proportions which rested upon the ground in his cornfield.</p>
<p>Having read the dispatches, published in the <em>Post</em>, of the noted aerial navigators, the truth at once flashed
  over him that he was one of the fortunate ones, and with all the bravery of Priam at the siege of Troy Mr Nichols
  started out to investigate. Before reaching the strange midnight visitor he was accosted by two men with buckets who
  asked permission to draw water from his well. Thinking he might be entertaining heavenly visitors instead of earthly
  mortals, permission was readily granted. Mr Nichols was kindly invited to accompany them to the ship. He conversed
  freely with the crew, composed of six or eight individuals about the ship.</p>
<p>The machinery was so complicated that in his short interview he could gain no knowledge of the workings. However, one
  of the crew told him the problem of aerial navigation had been solved. The ship or car is built of a newly-discovered
  material that has the property of self-sustenance in the air, and the motive power is highly condensed electricity. He
  was informed that five of these ships were built at a small town in Iowa. Soon the invention will be given to the
  public. An immense stock company is now being formed and within the next year the machines will be in general use. Mr
  Nichols lives at Josserand, Trinity County, Texas, and will convince any incredulous one by showing the place where
  the ship rested.</p>
