<p> Iowa Falls, 14 avril -- De nombreuses personnes ici sont sûres que la notoriété de l'aéronef des derniers jours
  repose au fond de la rivière Iowa non loin au-dessus de cette ville. Peu après le crépuscule le soir dernier,
  plusieurs personnes ont été attirées par un éclair comme celui d'un météore à travers les cieux et assisté d'un bruit
  whirring that the passage of a heavy body through the air at a rapid rate might make. The light and the dark form
  which seemed to follow it approached the earth at a terrific speed, and parties living near the river declare that it
  struck the water and immediately sunk out of sight. Those who reached the point of the object's disappearance first
  claim that the water was churned into a whirlpool and that for a long distance the water was seething and boiling. The
  theory advanced by many is that the airship, while passing over this section, became unmanageable, and in the efforts
  of the people aboard to land, shot downward and plunged headlong into the river and after striking the bottom, the
  propelling power of the ship dashed the waters into a foam. Nothing can be seen from the surface and nothing has come
  to the surface that might indicate the ship or its occupants, and the supposition is that the occupants were killed or
  drowned and with them the secret of the ship. Searching parties are now being organized to search the river and, if
  possible, raise the wreck. Thousands are expected here every hour by special trains from all parts of the compass and
  the whole matter has caused a big sensation. The field is a green one for enterprising correspondents and the advance
  phalanx is expected in the morning.</p>
