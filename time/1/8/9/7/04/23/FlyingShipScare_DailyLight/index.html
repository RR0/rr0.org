<p class="abstract">They Stopped at the Mineral Wells for Refreshments.</p>
<p>Georgetown, April 21. &ndash; (Special.) -- The correspondent was reliably informed by a gentleman this morning that
  his aunt told him, that her nephew told her that his baby was attacked last night with the colic, that he went out in
  the yard to pull some catnip to make tea for the baby, and while out there a dark cigar shaped monster passed through
  the air going in a southerly direction. He also said that this morning when he went to the mineral well to get his
  usual supply of water he found signs near the well indicating that some large heavy body had been lying on the ground;
  the grass and vegetation was crushed and broken down. There was also the remains of a jug recently broken. The jug
  seemed to be of foreign make and artistic design. Strange sounds were heard up in the air last night, by parties
  returning from the German picnic at Walbury, at a late hour, [who] say they heard singing and shouting high up in the
  heavens. There was much excitement here today over the matter. Business in many instances had not suspended but the
  attendance at the open air religious services at the court house square have materially increased.</p>
