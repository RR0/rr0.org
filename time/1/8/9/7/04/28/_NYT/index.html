<p>---- That story about an airship will not [go] down, though the airship itself occasionally does, if there is any
  confidence to be placed in the evidence of witnesses whose truthfulness on other subjects would not be doubted. The
  New Orleans Picayune has been interviewing Rabbi A. LEVY of Beaumont, Texas, and quotes him as declaring, with all the
  solemnity a ministerial position and unimpeachable character will give, that he has himself seen the sky boat close at
  hand and has conversed with its passengers. The vessel alighted, the rabbi says, on a farm near his home, one night
  about fifteen days ago. Hearing the news, Mr. LEVY went to the place and learned that the aerial navigators had
  descended to renew their stock of water. "It was as dark as pitch," continued the rabbi, "and I could see very little
  except the outlines of the ship. It was about 150 feet long, the body being shaped something like the shuttles used in
  an ordinary sewing machine. On either side were immense wings, about 100 feet long. It seemed to be made of some light
  material, what I could not say. I spoke to one of the men when he came into the farmer's house, and shook hands with
  him. It is run by electricity, but how it is applied I do not know. I did hear him say where it was built, but I can't
  remember the name of the place or the name of the inventor. He said that they had been traveling a great deal, and
  were testing the machine. I was so dumfounded that I could not frame an intelligent question to ask, so you see I can
  give you but very meager details. One thing I do know, and that is that an airship is an accomplished fact, for I have
  seen it, and many of my friends have seen it flying in the air."</p>
