<p>VICTORIA, Aug. 2. &ndash; The illuminated aerial visitor that has been mystifying the people of the Northwest for
  several months past made two recent appearances near Victoria. Three ladies camping at Sidney, a few nights ago, saw
  it, and watched it for half an hour. It appeared to be moving slowly to the north. One lady described it as a red
  column of fire apparently 50 feet long.</p>
<p>Sunday morning [August 1] about 2 o'clock it was seen by Messrs. Tatum, Young and Wolfendeen, who camped near
  Goldstream. It worked in a northwesterly direction. The three men watched it until daylight, when it disappeared. It
  was shaped like a balloon, but its light was more brilliant than it would be possible to light a balloon. The light
  was the color of electric light, and the object was steadily throwing out rays. It was not very high. From
  descriptions, the object would appear to be a visitor from the skies. It was not affected by the wind.</p>
