<p class="abstract">A Halgonian Thinks he saw Prof. <a href="/people/a/AndreeSalomonAugust/index.html">Andree</a>'s
  Balloon.</p>
<p>Boston, Mass., Nov. 4. &ndash; A special to the Globe from Halifax, N.S., says: A well known and reliable citizen
  says he saw a huge balloon pass over this city yesterday. It was plainly visible, and he thought it was attached to a
  car. It was sailing along in a western direction, and was constructed on a much larger scale than any balloon seen
  here. He believes it was Andree's balloon.</p>
