<p class="abstract">Seen on the Erie Rail Road Near Rittman By Several Witnesses.</p>
<p>Word has been received at Medina, Ohio, a few days ago that several Rittman people have seen a phantom train at the
  River Styx bridge on the Erie Railroad. The first appearance of this awe inspiring train was last week, Saturday night
  [November 3], and was witnessed by Dr. Fisher and a companion.</p>
<p>The doctor had been to see a sick patient and was driving leisurely along about 11 o'clock when his attention was
  attracted by the noise of a swiftly moving train. He casually watched the train, and saw its glaring headlight, and
  dense cloud of smoke rolling up from the smokestack. He paid no more attention to the train, but just before it
  reached the bridge the shrill whistle of the engine calling for brakes caused the man to glance back. On came the
  train with the speed of a whirlwind as it swept down the grade, throwing out great streaks of fire from the wheels.
  Just then they heard the "chuck chuck" of the engine, as if it had been reversed, and the escaping of the air of
  the air brakes. Then a strange sight met their gaze as they sat spellbound. The train was enveloped in flames, which
  shot up in every direction, the escaping steam making a terrific noise, and the cracking of timber and breaking off of
  iron bars was plainly heard, but above all came the piercing shrieks of human beings pinned beneath the wreckage. The
  noise was plainly heard by a number of others.</p>
<p>The doctor and his companion started immediately for the wreck for the purpose of rendering assistance, but to their
  surprise upon reaching the bridge they found every thing perfectly quiet and no signs of a wrecked train.</p>
<p>Near this spot the ill-fated train No. 5 jumped the track last spring, and the engineer was killed, ever since which
  many people have believed that the place is haunted. &ndash; Cleveland Leader.</p>
