<p>SAYVILLE, L.I. [Long Island], Dec. 9. &ndash; A mysterious balloon, which the two men who saw it say appeared to be
  propelled by some motive power other than wind, was seen yesterday at Moriches. The men who saw the balloon were H. L.
  Terry of Sayville and Alfred Chichester of Centre Moriches, both of whom are reputable business men.</p>
<p>They say that there seemed to be issuing from the balloon either smoke or steam from either side like the exhaust of
  an engine. Both gave the same description of the mysterious object. They say it had every appearance of being
  propelled by some kind of an engine. There was not a cloud in the sky at the time, and they insist that they could not
  be mistaken in thinking the object they saw was a balloon.</p>
<p>It approached steadily over the ocean, passed across the Great South Bay, and disappeared from view in the
  northwestern sky.</p>
<hr>
<p>PORT JEFFERSON, L.I., Dec. 9. &ndash; Information that a balloon guided apparently by some mysterious propelling
  power had been seen at Moriches yesterday and that its course was in a northwesterly direction was received with
  interest here. If the balloon had maintained the course it was following at Moriches it would have passed over this
  part of the coast, but inquiry at various points along the shore has failed to bring further news of the mysterious
  object.</p>
