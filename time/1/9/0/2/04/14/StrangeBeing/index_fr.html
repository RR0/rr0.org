<p class="abstract">Terrorise les résidents du comté de Allen près de Beaver Dam</p>
<p>La personne qui a écrit ce qui suit a à l'évidence been sleeping under a crazy quilt, or else he is trying to work
  the city press for a few stray dimes. Here is what has been sent out from Columbus Grove:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Un être étrange, apparemment moitié homme, moitié bête, est vu dans le comté autour de Rockport et Beaver Dam <span
    class="note">Aujourd'hui appelé "Beaverdam"</span>. The creature puts in an appearance at or near farmhouses.</p>
  <p>For some time the farmers in that vicinity have been troubled by nightly visits, apparently from intruders bent on
    securing money or other valuables. It was the scheme of the prowler to attempt to open a window or fumble at the
    door locks, then move on to the rear part of the house, and after giving the gates and such outposts a good shake
    disappears as quickly as he came. The family of Frank Conkleman left their home because of these visits, and while
    they were gone the strange being was seen.</p>
  <p>The creature is described as resembling a man, although possesses [sic] of features coarse and rough, and is said
    to be covered with hair. The inhabitants of that staid old country vicinity are half crazed with excitement, and the
    female portion will not venture outside after nightfall.</p>
  <p>It is firmly believed that the strange creature is an insane person who has been at large for some time. The being
    is attired in dress peculiar to one of the male sex, although scantily clad. A searching party will be organized to
    capture the fellow, if possible, although his fleetness of foot and abilities at fence jumping almost preclude any
    idea of so doing.</p>
