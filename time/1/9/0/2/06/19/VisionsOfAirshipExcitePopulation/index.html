<p class="abstract">Citizens of Little Chute, Wis., to Get Up Early in the Morning to Confirm Story.</p>
<p>Milwaukee, Wis., June 19. - Up in Outagamie county, in this state, there are reputable citizens who will swear that
  they have seen an airship. At 3 o'clock Friday morning a large part of the population of Little Chute, a village four
  miles east of Appleton, will be out of their beds looking for the wonder in the air which two inhabitants of the
  village say they have seen.</p>
<p>Peter Plugers, city marshal, while going home Monday [June 16] at 3 o'clock, saw the airship. John Lucassen saw it
  Tuesday morning at about the same time. They described it as about forty feet long and carrying four lights. The body
  of the machine was boat shaped.</p>
<p>It seemed to each of the observers to be several miles away. It would descend almost to the horizon and then dart up
  again until it was near the zenith. It disappeared both times in the south.</p>
