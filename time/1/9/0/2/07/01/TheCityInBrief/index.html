<p>A monster airship passed over this city shortly after 3 o'clock this morning, says a McGregor paper. The ship
  displayed red and green lights and was going at a high rate of speed due west. A faint buzzing noise could be heard,
  presumably coming from the huge fans which propel the machine. The machine is presumed to be the one invented by B. U.
  Surovitz, the Wisconsin farmer.</p>
