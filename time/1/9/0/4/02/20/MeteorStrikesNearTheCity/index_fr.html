<p class="abstract">Un fermier nommé Smith presque Overcome par le gaz</p>
<p class="abstract">Was so Thick That No One</p>
<p class="abstract">Could See Their Hands Before Their Faces for Some Hours &#8212; Un phénomène étrange </p>
<p>Presque suffoqué par les vapeurs du gaz, avec sa femme et 3 enfants hystériques de peur, M. Smith, un fermier près du
  blind institute, a réveillé les reésidents de la household de J. O. Selleck sur l'avenue centrale le soir dernier et
  leur a raconté l'histoire d'avoir rencontré une vague de matière gazeuse à quelques rods away that had almost overcome
  him and his family. Les enfants criaient and fearful and Mrs. Smith was equally fearful, so that the party was taken
  into the Selleck home while Mr. Selleck, George Clark, his son-in-law, Mr. Miltimore and son, and Mr. Smith drove back
  to the scene to discover the cause of the trouble.</p>
<h2>The story</h2>
<p>The story Mr. Smith tells is of a wonderful sight and a still more wonderful phenomenon of nature. As he and his wife
  were driving home from the city at about half-past nine they noticed a huge star-like light appear suddenly in the
  sky. It became brighter and brighter and suddenly seemed to swoop down and be swallowed up in the snowbanks that lined
  the road near the Blind Institute. As they turned onto the road after leaving the bridge the smell of a strange gas
  became so strong that Mr. Smith was nearly overcome and with difficulty was able to turn about and drive back to Mr.
  Selleck's.</p>
<h2>Awful Smell</h2>
<p>When the party composed of Mr. Selleck, Mr. Clark, Mr. Miltimore and his son and Mr. Smith returned to the road where
  the smell had been the strongest they were greeted by a dense fog-like substance which was so thick they could not see
  their hands in front of their faces, let alone the horde they were driving, which was but a few feet away. This
  extended for several rods along the road and in places was even more dense than others. The smell was at times almost
  suffocating. It is described as resembling that of a gas retort or of the gas which escapes from the door of an open
  engine.</p>
<h2>Vain Search</h2>
<p>Although the gentlemen remained in the vicinity of the supposed meteor for some hours they were unable to discover
  the meteor itself. This morning a party covered all the fields in the vicinity in a vain search and again this
  afternoon a large party is out trying to locate the meteor. According to Mr. Smith just before the meteor struck the
  earth he heard a rushing sound like some huge body falling through the air and then came the blinding fog of noisome
  smell.</p>
<h2>Prof. Comstock</h2>
<p>Professor Comstock at the Washington observatory at Madison was called up by the Gazette office over the telephone at
  noon today, and asked regarding such a phenomenon. He said: "It is undoubtedly a meteor. What caused the smell I can
  not say. That is some special condition of the soil in which it struck. Were it in an oil or coal country it could
  easily be explained, but as I do not know the land about Janesville I can not state what it was. Under ordinary
  conditions the smell would have been only that of a steam arising from a hot substance, like metal falling into a tub
  of water."</p>
<h2>Is Authority</h2>
<p>Prof. Comstock is authority for all phenomena of the heavens and while he says that there is nothing strange in the
  falling of a meteor he is surprised at the accompanying smell. Possibly this may develop and unknown coal field right
  in Janesville and possibly the meteor will be found to have contained a strange gaseous substance that was released
  when it struck the earth. </p>
