<p> Janesville, Wisconsin, 21 avril - A. H. Smith, un fermier près du blind institute, awakened members of J. O.
  Selleck's family, and told them a story of having encountered a wave of gaseous matter a few rods away that had almost
  overcome him and his family. Mr. Selleck, George Clark, his son-in-law, R. C. Miltmor, and son, and Mr. Smith drove to
  the scene to discover the cause of the trouble.</p>
<p> When the party reached the road where the gas had been the strongest, they saw a dense, foglike substance, which was
  so thick they could not see their hands in front of their faces. This extended several rods along the road, and in
  places was more dense than others. The fumes were almost suffocating.</p>
<p> Although the party remained in the vicinity of the supposed meteor for several hours[,] they were unable to discover
  the meteor itself. Next morning a party scoured the fields in the vicinity in a vain search, and again the afternoon a
  large party tried to locate the meteor.</p>
<p> Mr. Smith says that as he and his family were driving home from the city at about 9:30 o'clock they noticed a huge
  starlike light appear suddenly in the sky. It became brighter and brighter, and suddenly seemed to swoop down and be
  swallowed up in the snowbanks that lined the road near the blind institute. As they turned on the road after leaving
  the bridge[,] the smell of a strange gas became so strong that Mr. Smith was nearly overcome and with difficulty was
  able to turn about and drive back.</p>
<p> Prof. Comstock at the Washburn Observatory, in Madison, was asked regarding the phenomenon, and said:</p>
<p>"It was undoubtedly a meteor. What caused the smell I cannot say. That is some special condition of the soil in which
  it struck. Were it in an oil or coal country it could be explained, but, as I do not know the land about Janesville, I
  cannot state what it was. Under ordinary conditions the smell would have been only that of a steam arising from a hot
  substance, like metal falling into a tub of water."</p>
