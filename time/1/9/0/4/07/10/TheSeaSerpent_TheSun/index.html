<p class="abstract">Sighted Lately Off the Coast of Maine as Reported by Skippers.</p>
<p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE SUNâ€”<em>Sir:</em> The masters and crews of three coasting vessels plying between Penobscot
  Bay and Casca Bay assert that they have seen the sea serpent within a few days. The general appearance, length,
  circumference and evolutions of the alleged sea serpent seen by three mariners correspond in the fullest details with
  the sea serpent which Commodore Edward Preble, U. S. N., saw in Penobscot Bay when he was serving as a midshipman in
  the Continental Navy.</p>
<p>At that time Preble was in charge of a pinnace, which had a swivel mounted in her bow. On discerning the serpent,
  which seemed to be asleep on the surface of the water, and well within range of the swivel, Preble aimed and fired the
  gun. "The shot wounded the serpent, which thereupon raised its head, which was as large as a horsehead, humped its
  middle, which was of the circumference of twelve feet, and moved away at the velocity of about twenty knots an hour."
  The story of that sea serpent was one of the stock tales that Preble used to tell Bainbridge, Decatur and Lawrence at
  this table in the waters of Tripoli. A recent report of the voyage of a French cruiser gives an account of a sea
  serpent which in every detail corresponds with the description set down by Commodore Preble of the serpent seen by him
  in Penobscot Bay.</p>
<p>During interviews with several masters and sailors along this coast who claim to have seen the sea serpent within a
  few days, I learned that they had never heard the sea serpent adventure related by Commodore Preble ; nor had they
  heard the sea serpent story told a few weeks ago by the commander of the French cruiser. Sailormen along this coast
  who tank up with the prohibition brand of whiskey sold by the liquor agents appointed by the State of Maine usually
  see snakes, blue devils and sea serpents cavorting from the horizon to the zenith. But the sailor folk who have just
  come to this port with tales of the sea serpent are all sober and truthful men. A generation agone there were many old
  sailormen along New England's coast who believed in ghosts, devils, flends set to watch Capt Kidd's buried gold,
  warlocks, banshees and vampires. According to the superstitious marines of those days, masters, mates and sailors lost
  at sea invariably appeared as dripping wet ghosts knocking on the windows of their homes along this coast. In those
  times the sailorman who was not ready to swear that he had seen the Flying Dutchman and the sea serpent on several
  occasions was accounted a landlubberly lockadoodle who had made nothing more than a short voyage to the fishing
  grounds or to Cuba. To-day the sailor who claims he has seen a sea serpent believes that he is stating a bald
  fact.</p>
