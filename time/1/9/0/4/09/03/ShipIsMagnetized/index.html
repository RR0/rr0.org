<p class="abstract">Queer Freak Occurs off Delaware Breakwater. </p>
<p class="abstract">Steamer <em>Mohican</em> Passes Through a Cloud of Phosphorus Which Causes Strange Happenings on
  Board. </p>
<p>As the British ship <em>Mohican</em> made for the Delaware breakwater the other day it encountered a strange
  phenomenon. A cloud of phosphorus enveloped the vessel, magnetizing everything on board. Capt. Urquhart tells the
  story and the crew vouch for the details. </p>
<p>"I noticed a strange gray cloud at a distance, and watched it as it came closer. The vessel and crew were given a
  fiery coating before the sailors saw it," said the captain. "They rushed about the deck in consternation. I looked at
  the needle and it was flying around like an electric fan. I ordered several of the crew to move the iron chains lying
  on the deck, thinking that it would divert their attention.</p>
<p>"But the sailors could not budge the chains, although they did not weigh more than 75 pounds. Everything was
  magnetized, and chains, bolts, spikes and bars were as tight to the deck as if they had been riveted. The cloud was so
  dense that it was impossible for the vessel to proceed. I could not see beyond the decks, and it appeared as if the
  whole world was a mass of glowing fire.</p>
<p>"The frightened sailors fell on the decks and prayed. The hair in our heads and beards stuck out like bristies. We
  noticed that it became difficult to move our arms and legs.</p>
<p>"Suddenly the cloud began to lift. The phosphorescent glow of the ship and crew began to fade. Gradually the
  magnetism of the steel died. At the same time the stiffness left our hair. In a few minutes the cloud has passed over
  the vessel and we saw it move off over the sea. </p>
<p>"I never encountered a cloud like that. It must have been composed of some magnetized substance which was combined
  with phosphorus." </p>
