<p>Tiffin, Ohio, Dec. 10. &ndash; This evening at six o&rsquo;clock a mysterious light was observed in the heavens south
  of this city. It was apparently 2,000 feet from the surface and nearly as bright as an arc light. Many think the light
  came from an airship. After 30 minutes the light disappeared in a southerly direction.</p>
