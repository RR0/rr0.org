<p class="abstract">Dazzling Lights Are Seen in the Sky By a Converted Woman</p>
<p class="abstract2">Bedroom of Woman Visited by Angels</p>
<p class="abstract2">All of Wales Roused by the Marvelous Phenomena--Materialists Say That the Lights Are Due to Natural
  Causes</p>
<p>Special Cable, London, March 11.--Mrs. Mary Jones, the wife of a farmer at Egryn, is rapidly becoming one of the most
  noteworthy personages in the Welsh religious revival.</p>
<p>She roused the countryside early in January by her simple and earnest appeals, and she touched the superstitious side
  of her countrymen's nature by the visions which she saw and the lights in the sky which hovered over houses and guided
  her to the salvation of souls during the past two months.</p>
<p>The "Lights of Egryn" have become a household word in the Principality, and they are regarded as a "divine seal" set
  upon the mission of Mrs. Jones.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones is a slim, gentle-looking woman. She has the light hair and expressive eyes of the true Celt, but her
  voice and her manner give the impression of unnatural reserve.</p>
<h2>A Vision of Angels</h2>
<p>She claims to have seen visions. Six angels, she said, came into her bedroom. They were fair and shapely in form.
  They knelt, prayed and vanished.</p>
<p>The following account of the mysterious lights which have so astonished the district during the last weeks is told by
  an "Express" representative who was taken to see the phenomena by one of the converts of the revival:</p>
<p>It was nearly eight when we set out. The convert led the way by a few paces, and when a couple of miles were passed
  he began to scan the flanking hills with feverish, eager, expectant gaze.</p>
<p>"That," he said, pointing to a high brick structure which faced the road, "is Egryn chapel, where the revival
  started, and where already some fifty converts have been added to the church."</p>
<p>"I hope we may see the lights," he said, and added, half apologetically, half pityingly: "It is not given to every
  one to see them. Spiritual things are not discernable of all men."</p>
<p>The road now rose quickly, and at the summit the farmer suddenly stopped, excitedly seized my arm, and shouted
  triumphantly: "Yonder are the lights!"</p>
<p>He pointed with outstretched arm and shaking finger to the spot where, among the uncertain shadows, the dark outline
  of the chapel appeared to rest upon the hills. Beyond I saw some half-dozen lights. They gleamed, scintillated,
  jumped, and then vanished, to reappear at brief intervals.</p>
<h2>Miraculous Light</h2>
<p>"Now you will believe," said my guide, who seemd to take it for granted that I should at once accept the phenomena as
  miraculous.</p>
<p>A still more remarkable light appeared after the farmer and I had parted company. Faint at first, it rapidly gained
  dazzling intensity, when from a globelike center it flung out nine long, distinct radiations. It lingered for a full
  sixty seconds and expired.</p>
<p>A similar display occurred on the road while once a curious gleam shot across my path and circled around me.</p>
<p>There were several visitors around Mrs. Jones' door when I reached it on Sunday evening. She gave a cordial welcome
  to each. "I hope you have seen the lights," she said, adding immediately, "they are the visible signs of my work, and
  I want every one to believe in them."</p>
<p>I thought that she looked anxious, and again and again she endeavored to impress upon me the divine character of her
  mission. She insisted, among other things, that a star--her star, she styled it--settled over the chapel at
  [Rhondda?--nearly illegible] where she preached on Saturday night, and that mysterious lights accompanied her on her
  journey home. "One of them lashed into my carriage," she said. "It was a glowing ball of fire of exceeding brightness,
  but perfectly harmless."</p>
<h2>Strange Vision</h2>
<p>Some of her visions are most extraordinary. She is probably not acquainted with the story of Goethe's "Faust," but
  she insists that she has seen the devil, who reversing the mephistophelean method, changed from human form into a
  dog.</p>
<p>"I saw some one coming," she said, "I thought it was my brother. Then it shrank into a small, snarling, ferocious
  hound, which ran yelping into the darkness." Nothing will shake her conviction, which is credited by the
  countryside.</p>
<p>"It would not matter so much," said a well-known resident at Barmouth,"if Mrs. Jones would managed to preserve a
  monopoly of these dangerous symptoms, but other people, unfortunately, have caught some thing of her spirit, and they,
  too, are dreaming dreams and seeing visions."</p>
<p>"One man told me quite seriously yesterday that he had resisted the devil, although he was profered [sic] a bottle of
  elixir of life and renewed youth and vigor."</p>
<p>"In so far as the revival is rational, good is being done, but it certainly seems as if the border-line were
  passed."</p>
<p>Mrs. Mary Jones went last night to Arthog, a thinly populated hamlet at the foot of the bold and striking summit of
  Cedar Idris. She journeyed there by train, and, owing to a slight hoarseness, did not return home the same night.</p>
<p>It was a dark, damp, desolate night. Thick mists veiled the hills and overhung the sky, while a steady downpour of
  rain intesified the prevailing gloom.</p>
<p>Undismayed by the weather, the villagers proceeded to the chapel in large numbers, while visitors at Barmouth who
  have been attracted there by Mrs. Jones' growing fame, willingly trudged the two weary miles along the deserted
  sillhides.[sic]</p>
<h2>Welsh Glory Song</h2>
<p>The proceedings at the chapel bore a striking resemblance to those in the Rhondda Valley. "Diolch Iddo," the "Glory
  song" of the Welsh revival, seemed to lay hold of the congregation, who sang themselves into a sort of religious
  frenzy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones' entrance was quiet and undramatic. She appeared perfectly calm and self-possessed, but it was noticeable
  that bright, feverish lights gleamed fitfully in her eyes, and that a brooding melancholy at times settled upon her
  face.</p>
<p>There was no star over the chapel; there were no guiding lights to lead the way there.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones occupied the pulpit alone, but, as in Evan Roberts' meetings, there was no attempt to arrange the order of
  the service. Now and again she broke into loud and earnest exhortations, or swayed rythmically to the stirring singing
  of the congregation.</p>
<p>"Tell mother I'll be there," has reached even these out-of-the-way Welsh villages, and it was sung last night with
  all the touching power of the huge crowds in the Albert Hall.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones speak fluently with emphasis. The hearers hung upon her words in a silence that was almost painful. The
  fact is that they regard her as an inspired woman set divinely apart<br> from sacred missions.</p>
<p>Large crowds awaited her return from the chapel, and whiled away the hours by singing "Diolch Iddo." They ex- pected
  to see the lights, but no glory light appeared to relieve the unpierced blackness of the hills. Only the shifting
  gleams from some cattle driver's lamp shone occasionally from the wide spreading meadows.</p>
<p>It would seem that atmospheric conditions have something to do with the appearance of the lights. This, of course,
  would at once deprive them of any claims to the supernatural.</p>
