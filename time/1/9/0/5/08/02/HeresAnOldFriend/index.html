<p>COSHOCTON, Ohio, Aug. 2. - Clarence Hay, a local jeweler, and two companions say they saw an airship sail over
  Walhonding, a village 10 miles above here, last night, bound southeastward and showing three red lights astern and one
  green at the bow. They think it to be the airship that Chicago papers have gossiped of making the journey from Chicago
  to Washington.</p>
