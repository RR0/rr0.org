<p>Several of the people living around eight-mile lake are again trying to solve the problem of the mysterious light
  that has been visible, so it is stated, for many years back. The light is easily discernable in an easterly direction
  from Captain McDonald's house and that gentleman and a party of visitors started from his ranch one night recently to
  locate the ghostly glim [?]. They traveled a considerable distance, but as they still seemed to be as far away from
  the source as ever, gave the investigation up. Many persons claim to have seen this strangely elusive light, but when
  you ask them what they think it is or whence it comes[,] they all shake their heads and say, "I pass." Possibly
  it is of a phosphorescent nature, although this theory is contradicted by some.</p>
