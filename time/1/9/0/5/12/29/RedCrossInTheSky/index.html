<p class="abstract">Remarkable Phenomenon Reported at Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Atlantic City, Dec. 29. - Superstitious persons are alarmed here tonight at a wonderful spectacle seen last night in
  the sky when, just after the sun had set, a perfect cross, deep red in color, was seen in a bank of dull gray clouds.
  After 10 minutes the cross disappeared as suddenly as it came.</p>
<p>Persons rushed from their homes to the street to watch the inspiring sight while frightened negroes fell on their
  knees in terror.</p>
<p>Passengers on trains from Philadelphia witnessed the phenomenon from windows and vestibules.</p>
