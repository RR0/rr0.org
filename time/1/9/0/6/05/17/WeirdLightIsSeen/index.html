<p class="abstract">Ghostly Light in Monticello Grave Yard Causes Sensation</p>
<p>Cascade. &ndash; The town of Monticello, near here, is in the throes of a great excitement over a ghostly light which
  has been seen repeatedly by residents in the neighborhood of Oakwood cemetery. The apparition frightened a German
  farmer who was passing by the graveyard, and he returned to town and related the wierd [sic] tale. He did not venture
  home until the following morning.</p>
<p>The Chaloupka boys were riding by the place one night when the mysterious light appeared over the gravestones. They
  used all possible haste to get home, and now when they are obliged to go home that way they gallop their horses past
  the scenes of the ghostly visitant. A farmer named Morris also saw the apparition.

<p>A crowd of boys under the leadership of L. Locher went out to lay the ghost. They jokingly boasted of what they would
  do with him, but when they reached the cemetery their gaity [sic] and bravery vanished like a breath. In the midst of
  the tombstones they saw an unnatural illumination that almost frightened them to death. Trembling[,] they followed it,
  until it crossed over to a nearby field and disappeared in the darkness. The next night a still larger crowd went out
  to fathom the mystery. They returned after having a good scare. On the next night about forty young men and boys went

  field of graves they rushed home. No reasonable theory has been advanced for the strange light in the cemetery.</p>
