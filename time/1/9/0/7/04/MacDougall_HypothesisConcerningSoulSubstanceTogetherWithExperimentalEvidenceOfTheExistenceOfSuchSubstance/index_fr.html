<p>Si la continuité personnelle après l'événement de la mort du corps est un fait, si les fonctions psychiques
  continuent d'exister en tant qu'individualité ou personnalité après la mort du cerveau et du corps, alors cette
  personnalité ne peut sortir que sous forme d'un corps occupant l'espace, à moins que les relations entre l'espace
  objectif et les notions d'espace dans notre conscience, établies dans notre conscience par l'hérédité et l'expérience,
  soient totalement anéanties au moment de la mort et qu'un nouvel ensemble de relations entre espace et conscience
  s'établisse soudainement dans la personnalité en continuité. Cela constituerait une brèche inimaginable dans la
  continuité de la nature.</p>
<p>Il est impensable que la personnalité et la conscience prolongeant l'identité personnelle puisse exister, et
  existent, mais n'occupent pas l'espace. Il est impossible de se représenter l'idée qu'elle n'occupe pas l'espace,
  ayant une personnalité ; car ce serait équivalent à penser que rien est devenu ou a été quelque chose, que le vide à
  une personnalité, que l'espace lui-même soit plus que de l'espace, ce qui ne sont que contradictions et
  absurdités.</p>
<p>Puisqu'il est donc nécessaire à la continuité de la vie consciente et de l'identité personnelle après la mort,
  qu'elles doivent avoir une base qui occupe l'espace, ou une substance, survient alors la question du poids de cette
  substance ; est-elle pondérable ?</p>
<p>La chose essentielle est qu'il doit y avoir une substance comme base de la conscience et de l'identité personnelle en
  continuité, car sans substance occupant l'espace, la personnalité ou un ego conscient en continuité après la mort est
  impensable.</p>
<p>Selon la dernière conception de la <a href="/science">science</a>, la substance, ou la matière occupant l'espace, est
  divisible en ce qui est gravitatif, solides, liquides, gaz, tous ayant un poids, et l'ether qui n'est pas gravitatif.
  Il me semble impossible que la substance de l'<a href="/croyance/Ame.html">âme</a> puisse consister en de l'ether. Si
  la conception est vraie que l'ether est continu et ne doit pas être conçu comme des masses séparées ou comme capable
  d'exister comem tel, nous avons ici la base la plus solide pour croire que la substance de l'<a
    href="/croyance/Ame.html">âme</a> que nous cherchons n'est pas l'ether, parce qu'un des tout premiers attributs de
  l'identité personnelle est la qualité d'être distincte et séparée. Nothing is more borne in upon consciousness, than
  that the ego is detached and separate from all things else - the nonego.
</p>
<p>We are therefore driven back upon the assumption that the soul substance so necessary to the conception of
  continuing personal identity, after the death of this material body, must still be a form of gravitative matter, or
  perhaps a middle form of substance neither gravitative matter or ether, not capable of being weighed, and yet not
  identical with ether. Since however the substance considered in our hypothesis is linked organically with the body
  until death takes place, it appears to me more reasonable to think that it must be some form of gravitative matter,
  and therefore capable of being detected at death by weighing a human being in the act of death.
</p>
<p>Mon 1er sujet était un homme mourant de la tuberculose. Il me sembla préférable de choisir un patient mourant d'une
  maladie produisant une grande fatigue, la mort ayant lieu avec peu ou pas de mouvement musculaire, puisque dans un tel
  cas l'aiguille pourrait être maintenue plus parfaitement en équilibre et toute perte ayant lieu serait facilement
  remarquée.
</p>
<p>Le patient fut en observation pendant <time>P3H40M</time> avant la mort, reposant sur un lit arranged on a light
  framework built upon very delicately balanced platform beam scales.
</p>
<p>The patient's comfort was looked after in every way, although he was practically moribund when placed upon the bed.
  He lost weight slowly at the rate of one ounce per hour due to evaporation of moisture in respiration and evaporation
  of sweat.
</p>
<p>During all three hours and forty minutes I kept the beam end slightly above balance near the upper limiting bar in
  order to make the test more decisive if it should come.
</p>
<p>Au terme des <time>P3H40M</time> il expira et soudain coincidemment avec la mort l'extrêmité de l'aiguille chuta avec
  une audible stroke hitting against the lower limiting bar and remaining there with no rebound. La perte fut mesurée
  être de 3/4 d'une once <span class="note">Soit 21,3 g</span>
</p>
<p>This loss of weight could not be due to evaporation of respiratory moisture and sweat, because that had already been
  determined to go on, in his case, at the rate of one sixtieth of an ounce per minute, whereas this loss was sudden and
  large, three-fourths of an ounce in a few seconds.
</p>
<p>The bowels did not move; if they had moved the weight would still have remained upon the bed except for a slow loss
  by the evaporation of moisture depending, of course, upon the fluidity of the feces. The bladder evacuated one or two
  drams of urine. This remained upon the bed and could only have influenced the weight by slow gradual evaporation and
  therefore in no way could account for the sudden loss.
</p>
<p>There remained but one more channel of loss to explore, the expiration of all but the residual air in the lungs.
  Getting upon the bed myself, my colleague put the beam at actual balance. Inspiration and expiration of air as
  forcibly as possible by me had no effect upon the beam. My colleague got upon the bed and I placed the beam at
  balance. Forcible inspiration and expiration of air on his part had no effect. In this case we certainly have an
  inexplicable loss of weight of three-fourths of an ounce. Is it the soul substance? How other shall we explain it?
</p>
<p>My second patient was a man moribund from tuberculosis. He was on the bed about four hours and fifteen minutes under
  observation before death. The first four hours he lost weight at the rate of three-fourths of an ounce per hour. He
  had much slower respiration than the first case, which accounted for the difference in loss of weight from evaporation
  of perspiration and respiratory moisture.
</p>
<p>The last fifteen minutes he had ceased to breathe but his facial muscles still moved convulsively, and then,
  coinciding with the last movement of the facial muscles, the beam dropped. The weight lost was found to be half an
  ounce. Then my colleague auscultated the heart and and found it stopped. I tried again and the loss was one ounce and
  a half and fifty grains. In the eighteen minutes that lapsed between the time he ceased breathing until we were
  certain of death, there was a weight loss of one and a half ounces and fifty grains compared with a loss of three
  ounces during a period of four hours, during which time the ordinary channels of loss were at work. No bowel movement
  took place. The bladder moved but the urine remained upon the bed and could not have evaporated enough through the
  thick bed clothing to have influenced the result.
</p>
<p>The beam at the end of eighteen minutes of doubt was placed again with the end in slight contact with the upper bar
  and watched for forty minutes but no further loss took place.
</p>
<p>My scales were sensitive to two-tenths of an ounce. If placed at balance one-tenth of an ounce would lift the beam
  up close to the upper limiting bar, another one-tenth ounce would bring it up and keep it in direct contact, then if
  the two-tenths were removed the beam would drop to the lower bar and then slowly oscillate till balance was reached
  again.
</p>
<p>This patient was of a totally different temperament from the first, his death was very gradual, so that we had great
  doubts from the ordinary evidence to say just what moment he died.
</p>
<p>My third case, a man dying of tuberculosis, showed a weight of half and ounce lost, coincident with death, and an
  additional loss of one ounce a few minutes later.
</p>
<p>In the fourth case, a woman dying of diabetic coma, unfortunately our scales were not finely adjusted and there was
  a good deal of interference by people opposed to our work, and although at death the beam sunk so that it required
  from three-eighths to one-half ounce to bring it back to the point preceding death, yet I regard this test as of no
  value.
</p>
<p>My fifth case, a man dying of tuberculosis, showed a distinct drop in the beam requiring about three-eighths of an
  ounce which could not be accounted for. This occurred exactly simultaneously with death but peculiarly on bringing the
  beam up again with weights and later removing them, the beam did not sink back to stay for fully fifteen minutes. It
  was impossible to account for the three-eighths of an ounce drop, it was so sudden and distinct, the beam hitting the
  lower bar with as great a noise as in the first case. Our scales in the case were very sensitively balanced.
</p>
<p>My sixth and last case was not a fair test. The patient died almost within five minutes after being placed upon the
  bed and died while I was adjusting the beam.
</p>
<p>In my communication to Dr. Hodgson I note that I have said there was no loss of weight. It should have been added
  that there was no loss of weight that we were justified in recording.
</p>
<p>My notes taken at the time of experiment show a loss of one and one-half ounces but in addition it should have been
  said the experiment was so hurried, jarring of the scales had not wholly ceased and the apparent weight loss, one and
  one-half ounces, might have been due to accidental shifting of the sliding weight on that beam. This could not have
  been true of the other tests; no one of them was done hurriedly.
</p>
<p>My sixth case I regard as one of no value from this cause. The same experiments were carried out on fifteen dogs,
  surrounded by every precaution to obtain accuracy and the results were uniformly negative, no loss of weight at death.
</p>
<p>A loss of weight takes places about 20 to 30 minutes after death which is due to the evaporation of the urine
  normally passed, and which is duplicated by evaporation of the same amount of water on the scales, every other
  condition being the same, e.g., temperature of the room, except the presence of the dog's body.
</p>
<p>The dogs experimented on weighed between 15 and 70 pounds and the scales with the total weight upon them were
  sensitive to one-sixteenth of an ounce. The tests on dogs were vitiated by the use of two drugs administered to secure
  the necessary quiet and freedom from struggle so necessary to keep the beam at balance.
</p>
<p>The ideal tests on dogs would be obtained in those dying from some disease that rendered them much exhausted and
  incapable of struggle. It was not my fortune to get dogs dying from such sickness.
</p>
<p>The net result of the experiments conducted on human beings, is that a loss of substance occurs at death not
  accounted for by known channels of loss. Is it the soul substance? It would seem to me to be so. According to our
  hypothesis such a substance is necessary to the assumption of continuing or persisting personality after bodily death,
  and here we have experimental demonstration that a substance capable of being weighed does leave the human body at
  death.
</p>
<p>If this substance is a counterpart to the physical body, has the same bulk, occupies the same dimensions in space,
  then it is a very much lighter substance than the atmosphere surrounding our earth which weighs about one and
  one-fourth ounces per cubic foot. This would be a fact of great significance, as such a body would readily ascend in
  our atmosphere. The absence of a weighable mass leaving the body at death would of course be no argument against
  continuing personality, for a space-occupying body or substance might exist not capable of being weighed, such as the
  ether.
</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the ether might be that substance, but with the modern conception of science that the
  ether is the primary form of all substance, that all other forms of matter are merely differentiations of the ether
  having varying densities, then it seems to me that soul substance which is in this life linked organically with the
  body, cannot be identical with the ether. Moreover, the ether is supposed to be nondiscontinuous, a continuous whole
  and not capable of existing in separate masses as ether, whereas the one prime requisite for a continuing personality
  or individuality is the quality of separateness, the ego as separate and distinct from all things else, the nonego.
</p>
<p>To my mind therefore the soul substance cannot be the ether as ether; but if the theory that ether is the primary
  form of all substance is true, then the soul substance must necessarily be a differentiated form of it.
</p>
<p>S'il est définitivement prouvé qu'il y a chez l'être humain une perte de substance à la mort non expliquée par les
  voies de perte connues, et que cette perte de substance n'intervient pas chez le chien comme mes expérimentations
  sembleraient le montrer, alors nous avons ici une différence physiologique au moins entre l'humain et le canin et
  probablement entre l'humain et toutes les formes de vie animale.
</p>
<p>Je sais qu'un grand nombre d'expérimentations devraient être menées avant que le sujet puisse être prouvé au-delà de
  toute possibilité d'erreur, mais si une expérimentation plus avancée et suffisante prouve qu'une une perte de
  substance a lieu lors de la mort et n'est pas expliquée par les voies de perte connues, l'établissement d'une telle
  vérité ne peut être que de la plus haute importance.
</p>
<p>One ounce of fact more or less will have more weight in demonstrating the truth of the reality of continued
  existences with the necessary basis of substance to rest upon, than all the hair-splitting theories of theologians and
  metaphysicians combined.
</p>
<p>If other experiments prove that there is a loss of weight occurring at death, not accounted for by known channels of
  loss, we must either admit the theory that it is the hypothetical soul substance, or some other explanation of the
  phenomenon should be forthcoming. If proved true, the materialistic conception will have been fully met, and proof of
  the substantial basis for mind or spirit or soul continuing after the death of the body, insisted upon as necessary by
  the materialists, will have been furnished.
</p>
<p>It will prove also that the spiritualistic conception of the immateriality of the soul was wrong. The postulates of
  religious creeds have not been a positive and final settlement of the question.
</p>
<p>The theories of all the philosophers and all the philosophies offer no final solution of the problem of continued
  personality after bodily death. This fact alone of a space occupying body of measurable weight disappearing at death,
  if verified, furnishes the substantial basis for persisting personality or a conscious ego surviving the act of bodily
  death, and in the element of certainty is worth more than the postulates of all the creeds and all the metaphysical
  arguments combined.
