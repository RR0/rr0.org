<p>GOLDFIELD, Nev., July 11.-A report from Walker lake says that a monster serpent has been seen in the northern end of
  the lake. Dan Cornelison, a mining man of good reputation for veracity, brought the story to Goldfield. Cornelison
  says that both he and a companion named John McCorry saw the reptile while fishing from a boat half a mile from the
  northern shore of the lake. It was then making its way toward the east shore of the lake. Conerlison says that on
  first sight he took the serpent for a man in a skiff and that when it disappeared for a moment he thought that the
  boat had capsized and rowed toward the spot, when it suddenly reappeared, giving them a good view of its proportions,
  which they estimated to be about 30 feet in length and 6 feet across the back. Another resident of that vicinity, a
  man named Peters, is said to have discovered the serpent some time ago reposing in shallow water near the shore, and
  on being aroused it disappeared in deep water. There is also said to be a legend among the Plute Indians near Shurs
  concerning the existence of a great serpent in Walker Lake. </p>
