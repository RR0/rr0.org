<p>SPECIAL TO THE NEWS.</p>
<p>Crowley, La., Oct. 10. -- At 8:30 a.m. Wednesday several persons distinctly saw an airship passing over Crowley and
  traveling westward. Mrs. John Fontennot and her son were among those who saw the airship at the hour named. Mrs.
  Fontennot says that the airship was high enough that it was occasionally hidden behind clouds. As the morning was
  cloudy and the barometer shows a very low register, it is believed that the machine was not over half a mile high. It
  is stated that the airship was cigar-shaped and from the center was suspended by ropes what appeared to be a car. Mrs.
  Fontennot was not able to distinguish persons in the car. The airship remained in sight about ten minutes.</p>
