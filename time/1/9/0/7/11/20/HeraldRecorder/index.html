<p>Rutland [Vermont] reports that several citizens at about one o'clock Monday morning [November 11] saw a mysterious
  reddish light of great power pass over the city. The citizens agree that it must have been an airship, as it was about
  2,000 feet away and was going at a very rapid speed. In any other state than Vermont this might be considered a
  compromising vision.</p>
