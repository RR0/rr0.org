<p>A parachute was seen this morning sailing over Brownsville apparently at as great height above the earth. Doubtless
  it had escaped from some carnival company somewhere in the interior, but where it came from no one could tell. It
  apparently descended somewhere in the rear of Fort Brown, or possibly on the other side of the river below
  Matamoros.</p>
