<p>A short time ago a mysterious air craft, which was said by some to be a parachute and by others a small balloon, was
  seen sailing over Brownsville going over into Mexico. Noting more was heard of the matter, and it could not be
  ascertained where it descended, or whether it came down to terra firma at all. Its strange appearance was almost
  forgotten, until Saturday afternoon what is supposed to be the same mysterious craft was again seen cleaving the azure
  sky over the direction of Matamoros, and this time, it was noticed that it was steering towards the United States. It
  finally disappeared in a northeasterly direction. Quite a number of persons at the ferry saw it and watched it for
  some time. It was so high that its shape could not be plainly distinguished, but it was thought to be somewhat oblong
  and appeared to have a large basket dangling from it. Just what is the meaning of the strange air craft no one can
  say. Some think it may be a new smuggling scheme or trick for bringing in Chinese or other tabooed foreigners in
  defiance of the customs and immigration authorities, while other surmise that it is merely an airship, whose owners
  are taking a winter outgoing in this balmy atmosphere.</p>
