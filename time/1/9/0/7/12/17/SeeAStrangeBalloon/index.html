<p>New York, Dec. 17. &ndash; Jamaica, L.I. <span class="note">NDLR: Long Island</span>, was all worked up late last
  night by the appearance of a huge balloon over the town. It is stated that the balloon carried a lighted lantern,
  suspended from a rope dangling twenty feet below the basket. The fact that a light was carried in such close proximity
  to the huge gas bag caused even more surprise than the unexpected appearance of the big airship. No report of an
  ascension has been received here.</p>
