<p>Many Witness Vow They Beheld a Baloon Or Air Ship On Thursday Night.</p>
<p>Many people in South Lorain declare that on Thursday evening about seven o'clock an airship was seen going directly
  west, says the Lorain News.</p>
<p>No other explanation is given for the mysterious object floating in the sky. It was seen by Mr. Rathbun, the Pearl
  street druggist, H. Kohlmeyer, A. E. Growl and others. The proprietor and employees of the O. C. Prosser barber shop
  claim that they saw two ropes dangling and that there were four lights in the rear and one in front. The light in
  front was manipulated like a searchlight. Frank Chidester, a painter, is positive that he distinguished a man in it
  and tried to give a wireless message to come down and let him paint the machine.</p>
