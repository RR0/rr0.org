<p>Some small boy residing east of Delphos has the joke on residents of that canal town, many of whom thought that his
  kite was an airship. The Herald makes the following comment: Saturday afternoon, about four o'clock, the attention of
  many Delphos people was called to a strange looking air craft that was seen high up in the heavens, east of Delphos
  several miles, and many were the conjectures formed as to what it really was. The object seemed to be moving
  north-east, and at times stationary. The air ship, the balloon, or whatever it was, was cigar-shaped, and was so far
  away that it was almost impossible for those watching it to tell whether a basket or framework was carried beneath the
  gas bag. No reports have been received of an airship wandering about in the heavens, in these parts, and the whole
  thing is a mystery.</p>
