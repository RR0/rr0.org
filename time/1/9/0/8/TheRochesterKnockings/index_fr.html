<p>Un phénomènes singulier apparut ici <time>1847</time>, qui fit connaître à l'étranger le nom de notre ville citée
  dans le titre. L'année précédente John D. Fox vécu avec sa famille à <span
      class="place">Hydeville (comté de Wayne)</span>. La maison qu'ils occupaient devint la scène de bruits mystérieux,
  pas forts au début mais à la fin si violents qu'ils dérangaient le voisinage, et ces manifestations furent finalement
  attribués à l'instrumentalité de 2 petites filles—<span class="people" title="Margaretta Fox">Margaretta</span>, âgée
  de 12 ans, et Kate, âgée de 9. Ni les parents ni aucun des visiteurs ne put résoudre le mystère de l'origine de ces
  sons, qui avaient maintenant pris la forme de coups ou claquements sur les murs, sols et plafonds de la demeure,
  lorsqu'ils étaient produits. Afin de prévenir toute collusion possible entre les enfants, elles furent séparées, la
  1ʳᵉ puis l'autre allant à Rochester pour vivre aec leur soeur aînée, Melle Lea Fish. As long as, either remained at
  home the noises continued there ; when the last one had departed they ceased entirely. Melle Fish. originally
  skeptical, soon became as expert a medium as either of her little sisters and the sounds soon came to be announced as
  messages from the departed spirits in another world. Seances were given at the residence of the Fox family, who had by
  this time removed to Rochester, and in the houses of persons whose intelligent interest or morbid curiosity impelled
  them to witness the manifestations, and in almost every instance the presence of any one of the three sisters was
  sufficient to obtain responses more or less satisfactory. The usual method was for some one in the group to call out
  slowly the letters of the alphabet and when the right one was reached there would be a rap or knock of approval, by
  which laborious process the entire sentence would here to be spelled out.</p>
<p>The whole city became greatly excited. and while most people were incredulous many became profound believers in the
  truth of the alleged revelations. At least a public demonstration was given in Corinthian hall on November 9th, 1849,
  after which a committee of five citizens was agreed upon by those present to make a thorough investigation and report
  at a subsequent meeting. A few days later they reported that they had been unable to discover the means by which the
  noises were produced. This did not satisfy the general expectation; the people wanted exposure, and they must have it;
  so another committee was appointed, with the same result, and finally a third. All the fifteen members of these
  different committees were men of the very highest standing is the community, of unblemished character and all of them
  without exception, absolute disbelievers in the new system. This last committee, determined to succeed where the
  others had failed, made a more thorough investigation than their predecessor, subjecting the mediums to the most
  rigorous tests and having their clothing examined by trustworthy women, selected for the purpose, to see if any
  artificial appliances were concealed. On the appointed evening Corinthian hall was crowded, but unfortunately the
  audience comprised a large number of lawless rowdies who went there for the purpose of creating a disturbance, and
  equally unfortunately the mediums were present on the stage to hear what they felt confident would be their
  vindication. The committee reported that, all their tests bad been futile and that the rappings had been plainly
  audible when the girls were standing on feather pillows or on glass, without shoes, and when placed in other
  positions. A moment of stillness and than a mad rush for the platform. Blood would have been shed despite all the
  efforts of the police and the lives of the girls might have been sacrificed had it not been that S. W. D. Moore, then
  police justice and afterward mayor of the city, a man of unusual size and strength, sprang forward and with his
  powerful arm beat back the foremost of the mob until their intended victims had been taken out by a back door and
  conveyed to a place of safety. After that outbreak the Fox sisters were allowed to pursue their activities without
  molestation and all the various phases of modem spiritualism were eventually evolved from the "Rochester
  knockings."</p>
