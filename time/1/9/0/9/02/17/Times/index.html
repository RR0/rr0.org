<p>We have been favoured with the perusal of a letter from on board the Warren Hastings, recently launched at
  Portsmouth, and now moored at the Mother bank, which states a singular occurrence that took place on board that ship
  on the 14th instant, for the truth of which we can vouch: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The morning being fine, it was deemed necessary to get up the topgallant masts, which occupied some hours. About
    three o'clock in the afternoon the atmosphere was overcast to the westward, and every appearance indicated the
    approach of a violent storm. Several alert sailors were sent aloft to strike the topgallant masts as speedily as
    possible, but while lowering them the wind blew tremendously, and the rain fell in torrents, accompanied by heavy
    claps of thunder. In the midst of the confusion occasioned by the storm, three distinct balls of fire were emitted
    from the heavens; one of them fell into the main- topmast cross-trees, killed a man on the spot, and set the
    main-mast on fire, which continued to blaze for about five minutes, and then went out. The seamen both aloft and
    below were almost petrified with fear. At the first moment of returning recollection, a few of the hands ran up the
    shrouds to bring down their dead companion, when the second ball struck one of them, and he fell, as if shot by a
    camion, upon the guardiron in the top, from which he bounded off into the cross- jack braces. Finding that he still
    survived, he was relieved from his perilous situation, and brought upon the deck with his amis much shattered and
    burnt. This poor fellow was expected to undergo immediate amputation, as the only means of saving his life. The
    third ball came in contact with a Chinese, killed him, and wounded the main-mast in several places; the force of the
    air, from the velocity of the ball, knocked down Mr. Lucas the chief mate, who fell below, but was not much hurt.
    For some time after the storm subsided, a nauseous, sulphureous smell continued on board the ship.</p>
