<p>Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES.</p>
<p>LONDON, May 15. &ndash; Punch's famous cartoon, "Who said rats?&rdquo; might be fittingly adapted nowadays with "Who
  said Germans?&rdquo; as its legend. Almost every day brings a new scare, and the morning paper which does not supply
  the average Englishman with a Teutonic thrill over his breakfast is cast aside as flat, stale, and unprofitable.</p>
<p>One of the most recent scares was carried into Parliament by Sir George Doughty, who had learned that the Germans
  were secretly practicing maneuvers for a raid on the east coast of
  <!--  D(["mb","Britain.  Sir\nGeorge claims that two German steamers with troops on board have secretly\nsteamed to the mouth of the Humber, without\nbeing observed by the British authorities, on several occasions.\u003c/span\>\u003c/font\>\u003c/p\>\n\n\u003cp\>\u003cfont size\u003d\"3\" face\u003d\"Times New Roman\"\>\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size:12.0pt\"\> \u003c/span\>\u003c/font\>\u003c/p\>\n\n\u003cp\>\u003cfont size\u003d\"3\" face\u003d\"Times New Roman\"\>\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-size:12.0pt\"\>A mysterious airship\nwhich carries a huge searchlight and flies about the eastern counties o'\nnights, but is never seen in the daytime, is the cause of another scare.

<p>A mysterious airship which carries a huge searchlight and flies about the eastern counties o' nights, but is never
  seen in the daytime, is the cause of another scare. At first it was suggested that it was the work of some British
  inventor who wished to keep his achievement secret, but this idea had reluctantly to be abandoned. Then it was said to
  be a British Army airship, but the public achievements of the War Office in this direction do not encourage such
  optimism, and the great mass of the people are confident it is a German war balloon.</p>
