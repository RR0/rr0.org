    <p>Although is is nearly two months since the mysterious airship, which is claimed to have been seen at night by
      many people in all parts of Eastern England, was first noticed, there is not the faintest clue to an elucidation
      of the mystery.</p>
    <p>There seems little doubt that something has been seen, for the stories of witnesses living many miles from one
      another all agree on certain vital points. With few exceptions they all speak of a torpedo-shaped object
      possessing two powerful searchlights, which comes out only at night. From the careful observations made by some of
      the witnesses it seems reasonable to assume that the airship travels very swiftly and is held by its owner in
      complete control.</p>
    <p>Both the War Office and the Aeronautical Society have made extensive inquiries, but neither can throw any light
      on the matter. In view of recent German activity in aerial navigation, it has been suggested that the airship is
      one from across the North Sea, but this can be discarded in favour of a wiser presumption that it is the property
      of an English inventor who wishes to keep his production a carefully guarded secret.</p>
    <p>It was about 5 a.m. on March 23 last that Police-constable Kettle, a Peterborough constable, detected a strange,
      cigar-shaped craft passing over the city. He told his friends, but they were sceptical, and refused to be
      convinced. Two days later a report came from Mr. Banyard, of March, a place fifteen miles distant, that he had
      seen an airship similar to the one described by Kettle. Still those who heard the stories maintained an attitude
      of incredulity. Mr. Banyard's news was corroborated, however, by a Mrs. Day, who saw the airship about the same
      time on the same night. From March 25 to the present date scores of people have seen the mysterious visitant.
      Confirmation have been received from Coventry, St. Neots, Clacton, Northampton?places many miles apart?from
      residents who all declare that they have seen it.</p>
    <p>Mr. C. W. Allen, of Market Harborough, states that he saw "an oblong airship with lights in front and behind,
      flying swiftly through the air". Time, about 11 o'clock.</p>
    <p>Miss H. M. Bovilbe, of Southend, writes that she saw "a dark object looming out of the sky. It was about a
      quarter of a mile above the houses and trees. There were two powerful searchlights ont it." Time 11:20 p.m.</p>
    <p>Mr. E. S. Free of Clacton, describes how he saw the craft, which he states is sausage shape. Time 10.30 p.m.</p>
    <p>Other statements bear out the above, and in each case the time is either between ten and twelve o'clock or early
      morning. We append a list of witnesses who have seen the remarkable airship, with, when possible, the dates on
      which they noticed it.</p>
