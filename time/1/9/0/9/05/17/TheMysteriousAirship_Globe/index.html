    <p>Mr. Egerton Free, of High Cliff, Preston Park Estate, Clacton-on-Sea, yesterday (says the "Daily Mail") made the
      following statement:?</p>
    <p>On Friday, May 7, he observed what he described as a long, sausage-shaped, dirigible balloon, which manoeuvred at
      an apparent height of 600 ft. for some minutes above the cliffs about a mile and a half north-east of
      Clacton?quite near Mr. Free's house. The balloon was almost over Little Holland Gap, where the troops were landed
      in the combined British naval and military manoeuvres in <a href="../../../../7/index.html">1907</a>. The airship
      then passed away in a north-easterly direction towards Frinton-on-Sea and Harwich.</p>
    <p>Next morning, Saturday, May 8, Mr. Free found on the cliffs a curious object on a pot over which the dirigible
      had passed in its course. It was 5ft. long, of steel and stout india-rubber, and weighed 35lb. It is now in Mr.
      Free's possession, and has been photographed by his permission.</p>
    <p>The object found by Mr. Free is a stout ovoid dark grey rubber bag, between 2ft. and 3ft. in length, enclosed in
      a network mesh, with a stout steel rod passing through the centre of it and projecting about 1ft. from each end.
      One end of the rod is capped with a steel disc, exactly resembling a miniature railway-waggon buffer.</p>
    <p>On the india-rubber bag are stamped the words, "M&uuml;ller Fabrik Bremen."</p>
    <p>The Bremen correspondent of the "Daily Mail" states that there are no M&uuml;ller works in that city. The firm of
      Otto Moeller, patent anchor works, Bremen, have no knowledge of any such object as that found by Mr. Free. </p>
