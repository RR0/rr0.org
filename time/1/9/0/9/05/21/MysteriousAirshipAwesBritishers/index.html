<p class="abstract">People Claim They Have Seen It Regularly Flying Over the City of London. </p>
<p>London, May 20. - The mysterious aeroplane or airship, the alleged performances of which in or over England
  have been mentioned by the Sun, is becoming a perpetual nightmare. The newspapers for some time past have recorded
  daily the testimony of various persons who declare they have heard or seen it flying over the eastern counties and the
  North Sea.</p>
<p>Now this latest Flying Dutchman has turned up suddenly in the neighborhood of Cardiff, where a wayfarer, according to
  his own account, saw a cigar-shaped airship aground on the summit of Caerphilly mountain, a little after midnight this
  morning. He tells a very circumstantial story. He relates how he watched the two men forming the crew repairing the
  machine until they saw the watcher when they hastily embarked and soared away.</p>
<p>A local newspaper reporter went to the scene and found the ground had been torn as though by a ploughshare. Curious
  printed papers, one in French, containing technical directions[,] and numerous newspaper cuttings dealing with
  aeronautics were lying around.</p>
<p>While some newspapers profess skepticism all print the details. A large portion of the public[,] possessed with the
  anti-German mania, are convinced that their arch-enemy is among them.</p>
