  <h2>Témoins indépendants</h2>
  <p>M. Percival Spencer, l'aéronaute de la firme des Frères Spencer, déclare : ? <q>Ces aéronefs mystérieux ne peuvent
    avoir que 2 explications. La 1<sup>ère</sup> et la plus probable explanation est qu'il s'agit de model balloons, of
    which a large number are being sold, and which range in length from 25 to 10 ft. Occasionally petrol is used to
    supply the lifting power to these balloons, and it might give a luminous flame, which would light up the country for
    miles round, and would have the appareance, at all events to the unsophisticated rustic of a searchlight. Reports of
    the throbbing of a motor in the airship can only be explained by the assumption that these model airships have been
    near at hand and within hearing when their vessels were seen. The other theory might be that the aerial vessels
    which have been seen are two or three of the men-carrying ariships which have been supplied by this firm, and which
    the owners have been using. We have supplied no less than five during the past season, and of these two have found
    their way, one to the Easters Counties and one to Cardiff. I entirely ecost any idea that a foreign aerial vessel
    has crossed the North Sea, knowing as I do the conditions which have prevailed during the past few days."</q></p>
  <p>Assez tôt jeudi we received information from trustworthy and perfectly independent witnesses of a something,
    without body or parts, but with searchlights, having been seen at Wroxham, Catton, and Tasburgh, at times that would
    correspond, and taking a direction that could be consistent. The first story came from Tasburg, and the fullest
    enquiries are now being made into it. The next report came from Catton, and the third from Wroxham. The Catton
    observer, who gives her degree likely to know the Worxham observer, probably never been in Traverse Street or seven
    miles from Norwich, and Tasburgh eight miles, and the times at which the airship, or whatever it was, was soon, are
    fairly what one would expect them to be.</p>
  <p>Taking them in the order of time we must begin with Wroxham. A well-known gentleman, who lives there, was on his
    way home on a motor cycle, and had reached the bridge over the river when the light of his lamp went out. This was
    at about 11.30, probably just before. While he was examining this lamp, what he describes as a flashlight was
    directed upon him from above and kept upon him for half a minute. He was dazzled by the light and could not see any
    airship nor did he detect any sound, the ship, in his opinion, being too high in the air for the whirring of the
    machinery to reach him. That it was an airship he has no doubt whatever, and his opinion in this direction was
    confirmed when on reaching home his brother told him that while at Sprowston that same night he saw a strange light
    in the sky, but could not see from where it came.</p>
  <p>M<sup>me</sup> Turner, du 1, Traverse Street, Waterloo Road, Catton, Norwich, appela le bureau de la <em>Eastern
    Daily Press</em> le jeudi, et dit avoir vu les lumières de l'aéronef le soir précédent et entendu le sifflement des
    roues. Mme Turner fit la déclaration suivante : ? <q>Je rentrais chez moi du théatre la nuit dernière. J'ai quitté
      le théatre à 23 h 02, et suis arrivé à ma rue vers 23:30. Alors que j'arrivais dans ma rue un éclair de lumière
      vint sur moi tout d'un coup et fit paraître la rue comme en plein jour. J'étais seule, mais il y avait 2 jeunes
      gens dans la rue, un jeune se tenant près de sa bicyclette et à côté d'une jeune démoiselle. J'ai entendu l'un
      d'eux dire, "Qu'est-ce que c'est ?" J'ai pu entendre un bruit comme le sifflement de roues. J'ai regardé en l'air.
      J'ai vu une grosse étoile de lumière à l'avant et un gros projecteur derrière. J'ai vu aucun corps de l'aéronef,
      juste vu la lumière et entendu le bruit. Il venait du N. N. E., de la direction de l'Ecole de Angel Road, et
      volant très bas, si bas qu'il aurait touché le pinacle de l'école s'il était passé directement au-dessus.</q></p>
