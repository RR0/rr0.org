    <h2>Témoins indépendants</h2>
    <p>M. Percival Spencer, l'aéronaute de la firme des Frères Spencer, déclare : ? <q>Ces aéronefs mystérieux ne
      peuvent avoir que 2 explications. La 1<sup>ère</sup> et la plus probable explanation est qu'il s'agit de model
      balloons, of which a large number are being sold, and which range in length from 25 to 10 ft. Occasionally petrol
      is used to supply the lifting power to these balloons, and it might give a luminous flame, which would light up
      the country for miles round, and would have the appareance, at all events to the unsophisticated rustic of a
      searchlight. Reports of the throbbing of a motor in the airship can only be explained by the assumption that these
      model airships have been near at hand and within hearing when their vessels were seen. The other theory might be
      that the aerial vessels which have been seen are two or three of the men-carrying ariships which have been
      supplied by this firm, and which the owners have been using. We have supplied no less than five during the past
      season, and of these two have found their way, one to the Easters Counties and one to Cardiff. I entirely ecost
      any idea that a foreign aerial vessel has crossed the North Sea, knowing as I do the conditions which have
      prevailed during the past few days."</q></p>
    <p>Assez tôt jeudi we received information from trustworthy and perfectly independent witnesses of a something,
      without body or parts, but with searchlights, having been seen at Wroxham, Catton, and Tasburgh, at times that
      would correspond, and taking a direction that could be consistent. The first story came from Tasburg, and the
      fullest enquiries are now being made into it. The next report came from Catton, and the third from Wroxham. The
      Catton observer, who gives her degree likely to know the Worxham observer, probably never been in Traverse Street
      or seven miles from Norwich, and Tasburgh eight miles, and the times at which the airship, or whatever it was, was
      soon, are fairly what one would expect them to be.</p>
    <p>Taking them in the order of time we must begin with Wroxham. A well-known gentleman, who lives there, was on his
      way home on a motor cycle, and had reached the bridge over the river when the light of his lamp went out. This was
      at about 11.30, probably just before. While he was examining this lamp, what he describes as a flashlight was
      directed upon him from above and kept upon him for half a minute. He was dazzled by the light and could not see
      any airship nor did he detect any sound, the ship, in his opinion, being too high in the air for the whirring of
      the machinery to reach him. That it was an airship he has no doubt whatever, and his opinion in this direction was
      confirmed when on reaching home his brother told him that while at Sprowston that same night he saw a strange
      light in the sky, but could not see from where it came.</p>
    <p>M<sup>me</sup> Turner, du 1, Traverse Street, Waterloo Road, Catton, Norwich, appela le bureau de la <em>Eastern
      Daily Press</em> le jeudi, et dit avoir vu les lumières de l'aéronef le soir précédent et entendu le sifflement
      des roues. M<sup>me</sup> Turner fit la déclaration suivante : ? <q>Je rentrais chez moi du théatre la nuit
        dernière. J'ai quitté le théatre à 23 h 02, et suis arrivé à ma rue vers 23 h 30. Alors que j'arrivais dans ma
        rue un éclair de lumière vint sur moi tout d'un coup et fit paraître la rue comme en plein jour. J'étais seule,
        mais il y avait 2 jeunes gens dans la rue, un jeune se tenant près de sa bicyclette et à côté d'une jeune
        démoiselle. J'ai entendu l'un d'eux dire, "Qu'est-ce que c'est ?" J'ai pu entendre un bruit comme le sifflement
        de roues. J'ai regardé en l'air. J'ai vu une grosse étoile de lumière à l'avant et un gros projecteur derrière.
        J'ai vu aucun corps de l'aéronef, juste vu la lumière et entendu le bruit. Il venait du N. N. E., de la
        direction de l'Ecole de Angel Road, et volant très bas, si bas qu'il aurait touché le pinacle de l'école s'il
        était passé directement au-dessus.</q></p>
