<h2> Agile Wraith Climbs Trees and Hills,<br> Then Hides in Pond.</h2>
<p>WORCESTER, MASS., May 25. -- Northbridge has a ghost, or a ghost has Northbridge, residents of the heretofore
  peaceful village are uncertain which. For several nights, at about the same hour, a mysterious light, varying in size
  from a small bulb to that of a bushel measure, has appeared and performed queer antics on the high ledge near
  Wayside.</p>
<p>First treated as a joke, continued nightly repetitions have caused the phenomenon to become a serious reality and the
  village and its neighborhood are discussing the affair, while scores of citizens are seriously frightened. At least
  three families are packing up their household goods with the announced intention of moving out of town.</p>
<p>One night fully 200 persons assembled in the vicinity of the ledge, but when the light appeared many women screamed
  and hurried home, evincing no desire to continue the investigation. Half a dozen armed men had the temerity to go to
  the top of the ledge, and, in close formation, shoulder to shoulder, tried to catch up with the light. Like a <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/feufollet/index.html">will-'o-the-wisp</a> the light zigzagged along the
  ledge, climbing up the trunk of a tall pine tree, from which point it was visible for a considerable distance,
  descended rapidly within a few yards of the watchers and, mounting the crest of the hill, disappeared in the nearby
  pond.</p>
