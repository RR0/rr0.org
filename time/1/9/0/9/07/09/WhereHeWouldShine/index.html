<p>Fiction is losing a leading light in the correspondent of the Associated Press at Woodstock. A few months ago he had
  [train robber] Bill Miner lurking in the fastnesses of Oxford county; later he had mysterious flying machines hovering

  yeomanry of Sweaburg. Evidently to this young man, truth is stranger than fiction.</p>
