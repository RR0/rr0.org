<p><em>Special to The New York Times.</em></p>
<p>MIDDLETOWN, July 31. &ndash; A mysterious airship which flies only at night is causing considerable excitement and
  keeping the people of Orange County residing between Goshen and Newburg up nights in their efforts to get a look at
  it. For the past month persons who have been out late nights have reported seeing an airship, but few believed the
  stories.

<p>For a week or more the flying machine had not been seen, but at 11 o'clock last night it made its reappearance near
  Goshen. It was flying high in the air and carried a light which attracted attention.</p>
