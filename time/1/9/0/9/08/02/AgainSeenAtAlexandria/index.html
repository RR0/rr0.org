<p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
<p>ALEXANDRIA SOUTH, August 2.</p>
<p>The mysterious light was again seen in the western sky just above the horizon on Saturday and Sunday nights [July 31
  and August 1] by quite a large number of people. On Saturday it was observed at 7 o'clock and also at 9 p.m., and last
  night at 7 o'clock. The strange visitor was traveling slowly direct west, being visible for two minutes, when it
  suddenly disappeared, no one apparently noticing where it went. Several persons state that it disappeared even quicker
  than it came. One reliable person described it as something in the form of a chandelier, having one large head light
  and three smaller lights lower down. Beyond the lights nothing else was noticed, no object or form being visible.
  Another person informed me that if his suggestion might be pardoned it appeared to him as if the light was hung from
  the heavens by a chain, for everything pointed as if it was not as high in the sky as the stars. Star-gazing has now
  become quite popular, and crowds may be seen discussing the mysterious lights, but the only solution so far arrived at
  is that those who have seen the light declare emphatically that it is no airship.</p>
