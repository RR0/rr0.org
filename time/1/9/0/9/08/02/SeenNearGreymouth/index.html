<p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
<p>The captain and lieutenant of the Salvation Army, writing to the Star, say, with reference to the reported airship
  and mysterious lights seen in various places: -- "We beg to state that on Tuesday week, July 20, at about 10 o'clock
  at night, while returning from our fortnightly meeting at Ngahere to Blackball, and while going through the
  [illegible] near the township, we saw a bright light we could not account for. The light was away on the ranges to the
  left of Ford's Creek, and slowly ascending at length disappearing towards Paparoa. We attributed the same to someone
  carrying a large lantern, but could not understand how it was managed. The next night (Wednesday) we were out visiting
  rather late, and coming back sat over the fire till about 12, till the lieutenant went outside and saw apparently the
  same light away over the Grey River on the skyline. He called my attention to it, but it had disappeared before I took
  the trouble to look."

On Saturday\nit was observed at 7 o'clock and also at 9 p.m., and last night at 7 o'clock. \nThe strange visitor was traveling slowly direct west, being visible for two\nminutes, when it suddenly disappeared, no one apparently noticing where it\nwent.  Several persons state that it disappeared even quicker than it came. \nOne reliable person described it as something in the form of a chandelier,\nhaving one large head light and three smaller lights lower down.  Beyond the\nlights nothing else was noticed, no object or form being visible.  Another\nperson informed me that if his suggestion might be pardoned it appeared to him\nas if the light was hung from the heavens by a chain, for everything pointed as\nif it was not as high in the sky as the stars.  Star-gazing has now become\nquite popular, and crowds may be seen discussing the mysterious lights, but the\nonly solution so far arrived at is that those who have seen the light declare\nemphatically that it is no airship.</span></font></p>\n\n<div style="border-bottom:solid windowtext 1.0pt\">\n\n<p><font size="3\" face="Times New Roman\"><span style="font-size:12.0pt\"> </span></font></p>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>",1]  );    //-->
