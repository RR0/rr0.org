<p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
<p>The mystery of the strange lights seen in the sky at night time is the topic of the day. Lights resembling
  searchlights have been seen here on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings between the hours of 6 and 12. I have
  interviewed some of the persons who have seen it, and they all say they saw a very strong light in the vicinity of
  Dome Hill. As this hill is about five miles away it would be impossible to give an accurate account of anything seen
  at such a distance, but the light was clearly discernible.</p>
