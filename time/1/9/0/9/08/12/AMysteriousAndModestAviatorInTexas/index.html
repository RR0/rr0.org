<p>A mysterious airship, a kind of tramp craft of the sky, is prowling over Texas, if we may credit the reports of
  veracious witnesses in several sections of the state somewhat removed. It seems to have been seen first in Central
  Texas and last &ndash; that is, up to the time of this writing &ndash; in East Texas. In Central Texas it carried
  "three or four passengers,&rdquo; but in East Texas not even one could be descried. However, as it flew over East
  Texas it was burning a headlight of dazzling brilliance which blinded the observers, so that one's first impulse was
  to fear that the passengers had fallen overboard between these two sections is dispelled. There is also considerable
  reassurance in the circumstances that there have been no reports of the finding of crushed and mangled bodies.

<p>When [Edgar Allan] Poe imposed his balloon hoax on the public the balloon was seen nightly &ndash; never in daytime
  &ndash; until Poe himself was moved to confess that his story was made of nothing more substantial than the filaments
  of his own fertile fancy. Readers of Texas newspapers will recall the case of the belled buzzard, which is an instance
  proving the power of the imagination quite as well as did Poe's balloon hoax. This tintinabulating buzzard was
  descried first in Northeast Texas, near Paris, if memory is not at fault; thence he floated leisurely down into Bell
  County, his course being closely marked every day by a string of circumstantial reports based on the testimony of men
  whose names, residences and occupations were given. We recall distinctly that a number of ministers were among those
