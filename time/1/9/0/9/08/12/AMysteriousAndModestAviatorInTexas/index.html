<p>A mysterious airship, a kind of tramp craft of the sky, is prowling over Texas, if we may credit the reports of
  veracious witnesses in several sections of the state somewhat removed. It seems to have been seen first in Central
  Texas and last &ndash; that is, up to the time of this writing &ndash; in East Texas. In Central Texas it carried <q>three
    or four passengers</q>, but in East Texas not even one could be descried. However, as it flew over East Texas it was
  burning a headlight of dazzling brilliance which blinded the observers, so that one's first impulse was to fear that
  the passengers had fallen overboard between these two sections is dispelled. There is also considerable reassurance in
  the circumstances that there have been no reports of the finding of crushed and mangled bodies.

<p>When [Edgar Allan] Poe imposed his balloon hoax on the public the balloon was seen nightly - never in daytime - until
  Poe himself was moved to confess that his story was made of nothing more substantial than the filaments of his own
  fertile fancy. Readers of Texas newspapers will recall the case of the belled buzzard, which is an instance proving
  the power of the imagination quite as well as did Poe's balloon hoax. This tintinabulating buzzard was descried first
  in Northeast Texas, near Paris, if memory is not at fault; thence he floated leisurely down into Bell County, his
  course being closely marked every day by a string of circumstantial reports based on the testimony of men whose names,
  residences and occupations were given. We recall distinctly that a number of ministers were among those who testified
  to having seen the belled buzzard, the particular significance of which circumstance we need not point out. But the
  belled buzzard disappeared, and, what is more, in a section of the state where news gathering facilities are
  excellent.</p>
