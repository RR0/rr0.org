  <h2>WAS IT TOY BALLOON OR FLYING MACHINE? &ndash; SEEN AT COATICOOK.</h2>
  <p>The story of the airship in last night's Record, has created a good deal of talk and surmise around town. Several
    responsible parties have come forward with the statement that they too saw the lights going in the same direction
    and about the same hour.

    London street, said that about eight o'clock on Monday evening [August 9] he was sitting on the lawn in front of his
    house when he observed two lights in the air, as if over the Rand Drill. As the sun had gone down like a ball of
    fire he first thought that it was caused from the reflection from the West on a couple of ducks. When the lights got
    out of the range of the rays[,] he found that this was not so. The lights, he said, appeared to be attached to
    something that was in motion, and going rapidly.</p>
  <p>Mr. Sorel, Belvidere street, drew the attention of Mr. Maguire to the strange sight.</p>
  <p>The lights may have been attached to a balloon, but if they were[,] it must have been to a large one for an
    advertising or toy balloon could hardly have traveled such distance as these lights had apparently covered.</p>
