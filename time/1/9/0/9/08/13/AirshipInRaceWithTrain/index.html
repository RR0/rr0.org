<p>Peoria, Ill., Aug. 13. &ndash; Conductor Walkins, in charge of a work train on the Rock Island railroad, and members
  of his crew report having had an exciting race with a mysterious airship from Chillicothe, Ill., to the city limits of
  Peoria, a distance of twelve miles.</p>
<p>The ship appeared to be about 200 feet up in the air, bore lights on the front and rear, and for several miles gave
  the train a lively race. Near Peoria the ship took flight westward and disappeared over the bluffs. </p>
<p>No one could be discerned on the craft, it being too dark, but the huge black body of the ship, which was described
  as cigar shaped, was plainly visible. It apparently was under perfect control.</p>
