<p>Magog, Aug. 20. &ndash; (Special) &ndash; The strange lights seen in the sky by different parties and presumed to be
  an airship, were observed Wednesday night [August 18] from Richard McDermott's farm two miles from Magog on the
  Waterloo road. About half-past eight in the evening, Mr. McDermott on going outside noticed an unusual light in the
  northeast, and called the rest of the family. The light was quite large and cast a bright glow over the sky. At first
  it moved in an easterly direction when a second light was seen at a short distance from the first[;] in a few seconds
  a third light was noticed. Then gradually it changed its course and traveled north, the small lights being hidden and
  the large one slowly growing dimmer, until at a quarter to nine it was so far away as to be no longer visible.</p>
