<p>Magog, Aug. 20. - (Special) - The strange lights seen in the sky by different parties and presumed to be an airship,
  were observed Wednesday night [August 18] from Richard McDermott's farm two miles from Magog on the Waterloo road.
  About half-past eight in the evening, Mr. McDermott on going outside noticed an unusual light in the northeast, and
  called the rest of the family. The light was quite large and cast a bright glow over the sky. At first it moved in an
  easterly direction when a second light was seen at a short distance from the first[;] in a few seconds a third light
  was noticed. Then gradually it changed its course and traveled north, the small lights being hidden and the large one
  slowly growing dimmer, until at a quarter to nine it was so far away as to be no longer visible.</p>
