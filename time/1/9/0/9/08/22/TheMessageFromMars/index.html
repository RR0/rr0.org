<p>There is a planet that is attracting much attention at the present time which rises every night in the east and is
  rivaled only by the moon in brightness. It is Mars, that planet, which astronomers have been trying to prove is
  inhabited. Mars is closer to the earth now than it has been for many years. It will rise tonight between nine thirty
  and ten o'clock and cannot be mistaken by those wishing to see it. The people in several localities of Texas have been
  mistaken [sic] the star for the headlight of an airship and papers in the state have devoted as much as half a column
  in describing the mysterious aeroplane which has appeared with a bright headlight showing its way through the
  celestial regions.</p>
