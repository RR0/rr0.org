<p class="abstract">Residents of Cookshire Had a Good View of Flying Mystery.</p>
<p>GREEN AND RED LIGHTS COULD BE SEEN DISTINCTLY &ndash; CARRIED</p>
<h2>A FLAG AND FLAGPOLE.</h2>
<p>Cookshire, August 23. &ndash; (Special). &ndash; The mysterious airship[,] which has been seen in so many different
  places during the past week, paid a visit to this place, last night, and for an hour and a half was the centre of
  attraction.</p>
<p>About nine o'clock two lights, one green and the other red, were seen in the air and appeared to be traveling at an
  awful speed towards the East. These lights remained at the same distance apart and appeared to be fixed to some firm
  object.</p>
<p>Through the telescope a fairly good view could be secured of the flying mystery. A dark object could be seen seated
  between the two lights. At one end there was a long pole with a flag at the end of it. The airship, or whatever it
  was, seemed to be oblong in shape and was going at high speed. At times it would suddenly start downward, and then
  start up again.</p>
<p>The entire population turned out to see this wonderful sight, but could not fathom the mystery or form any opinion as
  to who the operator of this flying machine was. For aught they knew, it might be the invading Germans, "undesirables&rdquo;
  coming into Canada, [French aviator Louis] Bleriot, [Hubert] Latham [another French aviation innovator] or some
  Eastern Townships boy who is making trial trips in the night with his newly invented ship so that it may be perfected
  before it is shown to the astonished world.</p>
<h2>WAS ALSO SEEN AT BEEBE.</h2>
<p>Mr. C. E. Whitcher, of Sherbrooke, was in Beebe yesterday and states that he saw two lights quite plainly about ten
  o'clock. He could not see any form to which the lights were attached, but the latter looked to be as large as auto
  lights. A number of others watched the strange lights in the heavens.</p>
