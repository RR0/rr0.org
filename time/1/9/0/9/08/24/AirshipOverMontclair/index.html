<p class="abstract">Residents There Puzzled by a Mysterious Machine in Flight.</p>
<p><em>Special to The New York Times.</em></p>
<p>MONTCLAIR, N.J., Aug. 23. &ndash; Residents of the north end of this town last evening again saw a mysterious
  aeroplane passing over that section of Montclair. The machine was seen before several days ago. The aeroplane flew
  high, and as it passed over Upper Montclair it emitted a great puff of smoke that observers thought indicated an
  explosion. The flying machine, however, was not halted in its course, though it came closer to the earth.</p>
<p>A number of people thought the aeroplane was that constructed by Alfred P. Morgan and Harold H. Dodd, young men of
  this town. They denied, however, that they have been making secret flights. Their airship, which they have at 15
  Appleton Place, is not quite ready to fly. The motor arrived only to-day, and until this has been thoroughly tested no
  flights will be attempted.</p>
<p>The mysterious airship which was seen passing over the town last evening disappeared to the northward, and is
  believed to have come down in some isolated section of the country where some inventor has his headquarters.</p>
