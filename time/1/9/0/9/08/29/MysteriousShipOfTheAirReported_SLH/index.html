  </p>
    <p>Lee Fox, proprietor of a hotel in Pioche, was out on his front porch several days ago watching the coming day
      come and the climbing sun climb, when he saw something besides the coming day and the climbing sun. He thought it
      a <q>bird at first</q>, says the Pioche Record, in describing the occurence. As its actions were strange, he saw
      it was not a bird but could not imagine what else the thing could be. He called several citizens of the town and
      they watched the approaching what-ever-it-was. When it sailed past they saw, much to their amazement, that the
      thing was an airship. <q>They saw the canvas rudder and ballast swing plainly</q>, asserts the Pioche paper.</p>
    <p>Whow ! The percentages of salt in the waters of Salt Lake will not permit even the heaviest drinking old
      inhabitant of Salt Lake seeing sea serpents but there is hope. An airship making a cross country run is headed
      towards Salt Lake ! Get out your field glasses and empty a large number of the other kind and then watch for the
      canvas rudder and ballast swing. The airship did not stop at Pioche for fuel or water or to let its occupants
      stretch their cramped limbs, according to the newspaper account, but sailed ahead withcut hesitating. The reporter
      of the Pioche paper was thus robbed of an opportunity of interviewing the travelers. He did not even learn their
      names or what mission they are performing. They may be representatives of a hostile foreign government planning
      war upon the United States. From their elevated positions they can map out a plan of attack on the interior,
      learning the best routes to be taken across the mountainous country. They may be ? but maybe they are not. They
      may be a select party of multi-millionnaire on a vacation.</p>
    <p>No Wonder Pioche is on tip-toe with wonder. <q>It appeared to be traveling in a northeasterly direction and and
      very likely the daily papers will inform us concerning it in a few days</q>, says the Pioche Record in conclusion.
      Hurrah !</p>
    <p>Salt Lakers should not be surprised if they see a dusty airship tied to a pole in front of a Main street drug
      store some morning while the chauffeur or whatever he is called, is inside buying 20 cents worth or carbonic acid
      gas to refill the bag. The early risers of Pioche are unable to tell how many passengers the airship carries.
      There may be a lone traveler or a bunch of them. The thought of one solitary man making his way through the
      western air is hard to entertain. Undoubtedly there are several persons pushing the nose of their machine through
      the fleecy clouds hanging over Nevada's and Utah's peaks.</p>
    <p>Nervous Salt Lakers, while locking the kitchen door and fastening the windows before retiring at nights should
      examine their chimney tops and weather vanes. The airshipists may arrive in Salt Lake at night. Moroni and his
      trumpet are in danger ! </p>
