  Sherbrooke and Eastern Townships residents are not the only people who have been mystified by the peculiar antics of
  what is known in astronomy as the "Planet Mars."</p>
<p>A Hamilton dispatch says:</p>
<p>"Hamilton, Ont., August 30. &ndash; It's a slow day when Hamilton is without a mystery. This time it is not a
  baffling crime, but a problem of the air, an aviation mystery that so far has defied solution.</p>
<p>"Several nights in succession a bright red light has been seen scurrying across the eastern sky at a high altitude,
  suddenly obscuring itself from view and as suddenly re-appearing in an entirely new location.</p>
<p>"Those who first noticed it supposed it to be some planet. That is the explanation the astronomers advance; even now
  they say it is Mars, very brilliant and much nearer the earth than it will be for the next fifteen years. In three
  weeks, say the astronomers, Mars will be more bright and plainly visible, solving the &lsquo;airship mystery.'</p>
<p>"Those who have watched the strange light in the east, however, night after night, refuse to accept this explanation.
  They say that the planet Mars was never known to man&oelig;uvre around the skies like this mysterious red lamp,
  dipping down towards the earth, suddenly ascending, and then drifting north and south towards the mountain and lake.
  They are convinced that it is a monster bird of the air to which some successful inventor is giving a rigid test
  before springing it as a surprise on the public.
