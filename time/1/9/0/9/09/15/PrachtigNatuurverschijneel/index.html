<p> The river police observed monday night at around 4 o'clock on the river de Waal near Tiel in northern direction a
  beautiful natural phenomenon. The dark sky was suddenly brightly illumined, a big fireball appeared not shortly
  thereafter, that blew apart at having reached a height of approximately 40 degrees, after which the sparks rained down
  as a column of fire. The phenomenon lasted long enough for it to be observed well.</p>
