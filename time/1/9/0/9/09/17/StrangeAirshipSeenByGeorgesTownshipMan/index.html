<p class="abstract">Tells Smithfield Folks of Sight Visible Above His Thompson Trestle Home on Tuesday Night. </p>
<p>SMITHFIELD, Sept. 17. &ndash; (Special.) A. J. Thompson of Thompson's trestle, near here, brought word to Smithfield
  yesterday of an airship that hovered over his place between 10 and 11 o'clock Tuesday night [September 14]. When
  Thompson first saw the strange sight in the air he took it to be one of the heavenly bodies that had wandered close to
  the earth. [Huh?] It appeared as a brilliant light, oblong in shape.</p>
<p>Upon closer observation Thompson says he could distinguish the stars and sky beyond it. It was moving in a zigzag
  course. The general direction, however, was southwest.</p>
<p>Two men who were crossing Thompson's trestle at the time saw the reflection of the strange air craft in the waters of
  George's creek. They said the reflection gave the strange ship an entirely different appearance than when looking
  directly at it in the sky.</p>
<p>The strange object was still visible at five-o'clock in the morning, Mrs. S. A. Brownfield, Thompson's daughter, who
  keeps house for him, having seen it at that hour when she got up to attend her household duties. It was traveling very
  slow, tacking back and forth as a vessel that had lost its bearings.</p>
