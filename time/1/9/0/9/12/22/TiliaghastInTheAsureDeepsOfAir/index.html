<p>To the Editor of the Sun?<em>Sir:</em> Let the scoffer rail as he may, somebody, whether Tillinghast of Worcester or
  another, was in the air last summer, and that to good purpose. </p>
<p>Several members of my family were in camp on the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee, N. H., on the line between Meredith
  and Centre Harbor. One evening in latter August, shortly after dark, four of us saw two lights approaching apart,
  going at express train speed and more. Passing camp they disappeared over toward the Ossipee Mountains. That is was
  some form of air craft only its great speed allowed any doubt. Even this doubt was dispelled the next day when two
  nearby vacationists, Dr. Frank Chapman of Groveton, N. H., and Dr. Walter Westwood of Beachmont, Mass., declared that
  not only did they see the lights proceed toward the Ossipees, but also saw the same mysterious phenomenon return about
  three quarters of an hour later and disappear again over Meredith. </p>
<p>Certainly some man directed machine was abroad that night. Was it Mr. Tillinghast ?</p>
