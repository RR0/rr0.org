    </tr></table><p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE SUN?<em>Sir:</em> About 9 o'clock in the evening of December 12 my attention
    was called to a strange light in the sky by my son, who was looking out the window. Going to the door I saw an area
    of light that appeared to be about ten or twelve feet in circumference and well up above the western horizon. It was
    in the wrong direction to be a reflection from the illumination of the city, and was not at all in the nature of a
    flashlight thrown from a distance. It gave the impression of illuminating faintly some nebulous object by which it
    was sustained in midair, and it was quite stationary. I immediately thought of an airship, but as I had never heard
    that such a craft could be held stationary between heaven and earth I dismissed the idea from my mind. The
    impression that I got, however, was distinctly, if vaguely, of an airship doing an impossible stunt. While we were
    watching, the light veered swiftly to the eastward and quickly disappeared. </p>
    <p>Since then I have read of the alleged performances of Mr. Tillinghast of Worcester, and it seems now as if he
      must have been in the neighborhood of Rye on the evening of December 12. </p>
