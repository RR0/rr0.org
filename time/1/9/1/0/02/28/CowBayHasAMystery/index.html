<p>If it does not disappear before the summer, visitors to Cow Bay may have the opportunity of witnessing one of the
  most talked of objects in the settlement. Cow Bay has a mysterious dog, and residents of the place are at a loss to
  find out as much about it as they would like to know. Consequently, there is much conjecture regarding the mysterious
  animal.</p>
<p>The dog has no tail, otherwise it appears to be no different from other dogs. It is black and about the size of a
  rather small Newfoundland dog. It has been seen on the Cow Bay road on different occasions lately, but its appearance
  is much less mysterious than its disappearance.</p>
<hr>
<p>The other night, as several persons were leaving the house of James Bowes, accompanied by the dog belonging to the
  house, the mysterious dog appeared. The Bowes dog sprang at the mysterious dog, and it promptly faded away after the
  Bowes dog had apparently jumped through it.</p>
<p>This is only one of many manners in which the phantom dog has revealed itself to persons in the settlement. Thomas
  Conrad, James Bowes, Arthur Bowes, Cornelius Stevenson and others have seen the dog on several occasions and each has
  seen it under different circumstances.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are some at Cow Bay who connect the mysterious animal with that commonly supposed to frequent the Battery Hill
  near Fort Clarence. This locality has a reputation for the uncanny, and there are dozens of Eastern Passage and Cow
  Bay people who would rather cross the Sahara than traverse this road after dark. White phantom horses, dogs which
  disappear when struck at by the driver of a team, and balls of fire rolling down the hill, are some of the
  manifestations which quite a number of residents firmly affirm they have seen there. There have been workmen at the
  Woodside Sugar Refinery who have remained at the refinery all night rather than walk home in the darkness after their
  work was performed. </p>
<hr>
<p>Ghost stories, told around the cheerful wood fires which are a part of country life, are becoming almost fashionable
  in Cow Bay, and the local incidents of the last fortnight lend a peculiar interest to them.</p>
