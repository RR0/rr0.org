<p class="abstract">She Creates Fresh Delusion In the Minds Of All Around Her &ndash; They Imagine They Hear Launddry
  Machinery and See Lights Such as She Lived Among In City</p>
<p>Charlottetown, P.E.I., May 10. - Margaret Cheverie, of New Zealand, P.E.I., whose strange manifestations of
  psychological phenomena created much wonder and excitement upon the people of that neighborhood some time ago, has
  broken out in a fresh spot, so to speak. It will be remembered that the girl some months ago caused such excitement by
  her strange actions that many of the people in that section of the country imagined that she was possessed by the
  devil.</p>
<p>Her powers of causing delusion upon the sense of hearing were so great that people could not sleep on account of the
  noises which they imagined they heard. These "noises" could be heard for miles away, and there was no cessation
  of them until the girl was taken away from her home and placed in the Hospital for the Insane at Charlottetown.</p>
<p>Here she remained for several weeks, during which time there was not a symptom of anything out of the ordinary about
  the girl, and the little village where she lived lapsed back again to the old-time quietude.</p>
<h2>Had Her Taken Home</h2>
<p>As she did not develop any signs of actual insanity while in the Insane Hospital, it was thought best to put her to
  work in the laundry where under the eye of the Medical Superintendent a good opportunity would be afforded to study
  the case.</p>
<p>She appeared to like the work and the novelty of the situation at first, but at the last grew restless and longed to
  return home. Her people learning of this, and knowing that she was no longer going into hypnotic sleeps or in any way
  exhibiting any of her former strange symptoms, came to town and had her removed from the hospital to her home in the
  eastern part of the Province.</p>
<p>Nothing further regarding her was heard until a few days ago, when it was learned that she has become subject again
  to the strange hypnotic sleeps, taking them twice a week. While in this state she is so completely under the hypnotic
  spell that she cannot be awakened, although the people in the house have rolled her on the floor, shaken her
  vigorously, and used other means to arouse her. In this condition she will answer correctly questions of various
  character dealing with the past and present &ndash; questions of which she could have had no previous knowledge
  &ndash; although she can do nothing in the way of foretelling the future.</p>
<p>The parish priest, Rev. Dr. Walker, has now, however, forbidden anybody to subject her to tests of mind-reading.</p>
<h2>Sounds Like the Laundry</h2>
<p>But the strangest thing is the new nature of the delusions. The neighbors say that the noises they hear coming from
  the house while the girl is in hypnotic state resemble the running of machinery &ndash; sounds which take the place of
  those formerly heard &ndash; being new to the ears of the country-people. They also say that they see lights around
  and over the house, both these demonstrations indicating that the girl was reproducing the sounds she had heard while
  at work in the laundry of the hospital, and that the lights are reproductions of those which the hospital was
  illuminated.</p>
<p>These are sounds which take the place of those resembling railway trains, rappings, etc., with which she was familiar
  at home. Only when she is in the sleep are the noises to be heard, and just at what time she will be taken with the
  sleep cannot be definitely told.</p>
<p>The neighbors, having become used to the sounds, are not showing the same excited state of mind as upon the first
  occasions but, nevertheless, the case is causing considerable interest among psychologists who have heard of her
  wonderful operations.</p>
<p>Those who have been interested in the girl's mysterious behavior are living in expectation of something more
  wonderful to recount.</p>
