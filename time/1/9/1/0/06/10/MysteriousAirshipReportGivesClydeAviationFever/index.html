<p class="abstract"> Stories Told by Mr. and Mrs. Max Hess and Editor Lead Many Residents to Believe Reticent Local
  Inventor Is to Bring Fame to Village.</p>
<p>SPECIAL TO THE POST-STANDARD.</p>
<p>CLYDE, June 9. &ndash; Clyde has the airship fever and has it bad. A mysterious machine, reported by Max Hess, a
  reputable resident of the village, to have glided overhead a few nights ago and an inventive genius named Charles Ames
  are responsible. But the first semblance of the affliction is traceable to the former. Mr. Ames' responsibility rests
  in his attitude, which has served to greatly aggravate the atmospheric ailment of the section.
