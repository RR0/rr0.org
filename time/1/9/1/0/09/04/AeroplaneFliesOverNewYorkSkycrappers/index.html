<p>NEW YORK, Sept. 3. - Thousands of people in the vicinity of Madison Square park were amazed by a mysterious
  aeroplane which came from the direction of Long Island and hovered over the city for at least forty-five minutes. The
  strange aerial visitor was about twenty feet wide, patterned after the familiar Wright or Curtiss type, and carried a
  red and green light on the port and starboard wings. It circled about the Flatiron Building, soared high above the
  Metropolitan Life Insurance building tower and finally swooped down within 800 feet of Madison Square park. Then
  slowly it disappeared toward Long Island Sound.</p>
