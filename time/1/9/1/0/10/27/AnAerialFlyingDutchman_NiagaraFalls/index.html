<p>United Press Special Wire</p>
<p>An aerial Flying Dutchman is making across Canada. That explains some of the reports that confused those who were
  searching for the missing balloon America, and raises the question whether some inventor of extraordinary genius isn't
  trying a secret trial trip before he startles the world with the story of his accomplishments.</p>
<p>The mysterious airship, carrying red and green lights, passed over Fort William and was seen by two trains some
  distance apart. It was still going westward.</p>
<p>Early this morning the airship was seen going over Saskatchewan from east to west, and it again carried red and green
  lights.</p>
<p>To cap the climax, Mrs. Grenfall, wife of the noted deep-sea missionary, writes that an airship was seen over St.
  Anthony's in far northern Labrador, a week ago.</p>
<p>The reports are confirmed from other places and appear absolutely reliable.</p>
