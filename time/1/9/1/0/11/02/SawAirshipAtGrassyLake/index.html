<p>Grassy Lake, Nov. 1 -- Peter Theriot who is doing homestead duties near Badwater Lake, came into town yesterday and
  claims that he was very much frightened by an object in the heavens, just at daybreak Thursday morning, while looking
  for his horses on the prairie. This is supposed to be the airship seen by others about the same time.</p>
