<p>People in this vicinity were startled last evening by the sudden appearance in the sky of what appeared to be a ball
  of fire about the size of a full moon, says a Durango, Colo., dispatch. </p>
<p>For several hours the phenomenon lasted. At first it seemed to be traveling toward the earth and gradually grew
  larger until it developed to a size half again as large as a full moon. Finally it began to grow smaller, and in time
  disappeared.</p>
<p>Ranchers and other residents of this district are unable to explain the mysterious light in the sky.</p>
