<p><strong>Suppose some one</strong> should discover a new mechanical principle--something as fundamental as James
  Watt’s discovery of the expansive power of steam—by the use of which it became possible to build a motor that would
  give ten horse power for every pound of the engine’s weight, a motor so simple that the veriest novice in mechanics
  could construct it and so elemental that it could not possibly get out of repair. Then suppose that this motor could
  be run forward or backward at will, that it could be used as either an engine or a pump, that it cost almost nothing
  to build as compared with any other known form of engine, that it utilized a larger percentage of the available power
  than any existing machine, and, finally, that it would operate with gas, steam, compressed air or water, any one of
  them, as its driving power.</p>
<p>It does not take a mechanical expert to imagine the limitless possibilities of such an engine. It takes very little
  effort to conjure up a picture of a new world of industry and transportation made possible by the invention of such a
  device. “Revolutionary” seems a mild term to apply to it. That, however, is the word the inventor uses in describing
  it—Nikola Tesla, the scientist whose electrical discoveries underlie all modern electrical power development, whose
  experiments and deductions made the wireless telegraph possible, and who now, in the mechanical field, has achieved a
  triumph even more far reaching than anything he accomplished in electricity. </p>
<p>There is something of the romantic in this discovery of the famous explorer of the hidden realms of knowledge. The
  pursuit of an ideal is always romantic, and it was in the pursuit of an ideal which he has been seeking twenty years
  that Dr. Tesla made his great discovery. That ideal is the power to fly—to fly with certainty and absolute safety—not
  merely to go up in an aeroplane and take chances on weather conditions, “holes in the air,” tornadoes, lightning and
  the thousand other perils the aviator of today faces, but to fly with the speed and certainty of a cannon ball, with
  power to overcome any of nature’s aerial forces, to start when one pleases, go whither one pleases and alight where
  one pleases. That has been the aim of Dr. Tesla’s life for nearly a quarter of a century. He believes that with the
  discovery of the principle of his new motor he has solved this problem and that incidentally he has laid the
  foundations for the most startling new achievements in other mechanical lines. </p>
<p>There was a time when men of science were skeptical—a time when they ridiculed the announcement of revolutionary
  discoveries. Those were the days when Nikola Tesla, the young scientist from the Balkans, was laughed at when he urged
  his theories on the engineering world. Times have changed since then, and the “practical” engineer is not so
  incredulous about “scientific” discoveries. The change came about when young Tesla showed the way by which the power
  of Niagara Falls could be utilized. The right to divert a portion of the waters of Niagara had been granted; then
  arose the question of how best to utilize the tremendous power thus made available—how to transmit it to the points
  where it could be commercially utilized. An international commission sat in London and listened to theories and
  practical plans for months. </p>
<p>Up to that time the only means of utilizing electric power was the direct current motor, and direct current dynamos
  big enough to be of practical utility for such a gigantic power development were not feasible.</p>
<p>Then came the announcement of young Tesla’s discovery of the principle of the alternating current motor. Practical
  tests showed that it could be built—that it would work.</p>
<p>That discovery, at that opportune time, decided the commission. Electricity was determined upon as the means for the
  transmission of Niagara’s power to industry and commerce. Today a million horse power is developed on the brink of the
  great cataract, turning the wheels of Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and the intervening cities and villages operating
  close at hand the great new electro-chemical industries that the existence of this immense source of power has made
  possible, while all around the world a thousand waterfalls are working in the service of mankind, sending the power of
  their “white coal” into remote and almost inaccessible corners of the globe, all because of Nikola Tesla’s first great
  epoch making discovery. </p>
<p>Today the engineering world listens respectfully when Dr. Tesla speaks. The first announcement of the discovery of
  his new mechanical principle was made in a technical periodical in mid-September, 1911. Immediately it became the
  principal topic of discussions wherever engineers met.</p>
<p>“It is the greatest invention in a century,” wrote one of the foremost American engineers, a man whose name stands
  close to the top of the list of those who have achieved scientific fame and greatness. </p>
<p>“No invention of such importance in the automobile trade has yet been made,” declared the editor of one of the
  leading engineering publications. Experts in other engineering lines pointed out other applications of the new
  principle and letters asking for further information poured in on Dr. Tesla from the four quarters of the globe. </p>
<p>“Oh, I've had too much publicity,” he said, when I telephoned to him to ask for an interview in order to explain his
  new discovery to the non-technical public. It took a good deal of persuasion before he reluctantly fixed an hour when
  he would see me, and a good bit more after that before he talked at all freely. When he did speak, however, he opened
  up vistas of possible applications of the new engine that staggered the imagination of the interviewer. </p>
<p>Looking out over the city from the windows of his office, on the twentieth floor of the Metropolitan Tower, his face
  lit up as he told of his life dream and its approaching realization, and the listener’s fancy could almost see the air
  full of strange flying craft, while huge steamships propelled at unheard of speeds ploughed the waters of the North
  River, automobiles climbed the very face of the Palisades, locomotives of incredible power whisked wheeled palaces
  many miles a minute and all the discomforts of summer heat vanished as marvelous refrigerating plants reduced the
  temperature of the whole city to a comfortable maximum—for these were only a few of the suggestions of the limitless
  possibilities of the latest Tesla discovery. </p>
<p>“Just what is your new invention?” I asked. </p>
<p>“I have accomplished what mechanical engineers have been dreaming about ever since the invention of steam power,”
  replied Dr. Tesla. “That is the perfect rotary engine. It happens that I have also produced an engine which will give
  at least twenty-five times as much power to a pound of weight as the lightest weight engine of any kind that has yet
  been produced. </p>
<p>“In doing this I have made use of two properties which have always been known to be possessed by all fluids, but
  which have not heretofore been utilized. These properties are adhesion and viscosity. </p>
<p>“Put a drop of water on a metal plate. The drop will roll off, but a certain amount of the water will remain on the
  plate until it evaporates or is removed by some absorptive means. The metal does not absorb any of the water, but the
  water adheres to it. </p>
<p>“The drop of water may change its shape, but until its particles are separated by some external power it remains
  intact. This tendency of all fluids to resist molecular separation is viscosity. It is especially noticeable in the
  heavier oils.</p>
<p>“It is these properties of adhesion and viscosity that cause the “skin friction” that impedes a ship in its progress
  through the water or an aeroplane in going through the air. All fluids have these qualities—and you must keep in mind
  that air is a fluid, all gases are fluids, steam is fluid. Every known means of transmitting or developing mechanical
  power is through a fluid medium. </p>
<p>“Now, suppose we make this metal plate that I have spoken of circular in shape and mount it at its centre on a shaft
  so that it can be revolved. Apply power to rotate the shaft and what happens? Why, whatever fluid the disk happens to
  be revolving in is agitated and dragged along in the direction of rotation, because the fluid tends to adhere to the
  disk and the viscosity causes the motion given to the adhering particles of the fluid to be transmitted to the whole
  mass. Here, I can show you better than tell you.”</p>
<p>Dr. Tesla led the way into an adjoining room. On a desk was a small electric motor and mounted on the shaft were
  half a dozen flat disks, separated by perhaps a sixteenth of an inch from one another, each disk being less than that
  in thickness. He turned a switch and the motor began to buzz. A wave of cool air was immediately felt. </p>
<p>“There we have a disk, or rather a series of disks, revolving in a fluid—the air,” said the inventor. “You need no
  proof to tell you that the air is being agitated and propelled violently. If you will hold your hand over the centre
  of these disks—you see the centres have been cut away—you will feel the suction as air is drawn in to be expelled from
  the peripheries of the disks. </p>
<p>“Now, suppose these revolving disks were enclosed in an air tight case, so constructed that the air could enter only
  at one point and be expelled only at another—what would we have?"</p>
<p>“You'd have an air pump,” I suggested. </p>
<p>“Exactly--an air pump or blower,” said Dr. Tesla. </p>
<p>“There is one now in operation delivering ten thousand cubic feet of air a minute. “Now, come over here.”</p>
<p>He stepped across the hall and into another room, where three or four draughtsmen were at work and various
  mechanical and electrical contrivances were scattered about. At one side of the room was what appeared to be a zinc or
  aluminum tank, divided into two sections, one above the other, while a pipe that ran along the wall above the upper
  division of the tank was connected with a little aluminum case about the size and shape of a small alarm clock. A tiny
  electric motor was attached to a shaft that protruded from one side of the aluminum case. The lower division of the
  tank was filled with water.</p>
<p>“Inside of this aluminum case are several disks mounted on a shaft and immersed in a fluid, water,” said Dr. Tesla.
  “From this lower tank the water has free access to the case enclosing the disks. This pipe leads from the periphery of
  the case. I turn the current on, the motor turns the disks and as I open this valve in the pipe the water flows.”</p>
<p>He turned the valve and the water certainly did flow. Instantly a stream that would have filled a barrel in a very
  few minutes began to run out of the pipe into the upper part of the tank and thence into the lower tank. </p>
<p>“This is only a toy,” said Dr. Tesla. “There are only half a dozen disks— ‘runners,’ I call them—each less than three
  inches in diameter, inside of that case. They are just like the disks you saw on the first motor—no vanes, blades or
  attachments of any kind. Just perfectly smooth, flat disks revolving in their own planes and pumping water because of
  the viscosity and adhesion of the fluid. One such pump now in operation, with eight disks, eighteen inches in
  diameter, pumps four thousand gallons a minute to a height of 360 feet.” </p>
<p>We went back into the big, well lighted office. I was beginning to grasp the new Tesla principle. </p>
<p>“Suppose now we reversed the operation,” continued the inventor. “You have seen the disks acting as a pump. Suppose
  we had water, or air under pressure, or steam under pressure, or gas under pressure, and let it run into the case in
  which the disks are contained—what would happen?" </p>
<p>“The disks would revolve and any machinery attached to the shaft would be operated—you would convert the pump into an
  engine,” I suggested. </p>
<p>“That is exactly what would happen—what does happen,” replied Dr. Tesla. “It is an engine that does all that
  engineers have ever dreamed of an engine doing, and more. Down at the Waterside power station of the New York Edison
  Company, through their courtesy, I have had a number of such engines in operation. In one of them the disks are only
  nine inches in diameter and the whole working part is two inches thick. With steam as the propulsive fluid it develops
  110-horse power, and could do twice as much.” </p>
<p>“You have got what Professor Langley was trying to evolve for his flying machine—an engine that will give a horse
  power for a pound of weight,” I suggested. </p>
<h2>Ten Horse Power to the Pound.</h2>
<p>“I have got more than that,” replied Dr. Tesla. “I have an engine that will give ten horse power to the pound of
  weight. That is twenty-five times as powerful as the lightest weight engine in use today. The lightest gas engine used
  on aeroplanes weighs two and one-half pounds to the horse power. </p>
<p>With two and one-half pounds of weight I can develop twenty-five horse power.” “That means the solution of the
  problem of flying,” I suggested. </p>
<p>“Yes, and many more,” was the reply. “The applications of this principle, both for imparting power to fluids, as in
  pumps, and for deriving power from fluids, as in turbine, are boundless. It costs almost nothing to make, there is
  nothing about it to get out of order, it is reversible—simply have two ports for the gas or steam, to enter by, one on
  each side, and let it into one side or other. There are no blades or vanes to get out of order—the steam turbine is a
  delicate thing.”</p>
<p>I remembered the bushels of broken blades that were gathered out of the turbine casings of the first turbine
  equipped steamship to cross the ocean, and realized the importance of this phase of the new engine. </p>
<p>“Then, too,” Dr. Tesla went on, “there are no delicate adjustments to be made. The distance between the disks is not
  a matter of microscopic accuracy and there is no necessity for minute clearances between the disks and the case. All
  one needs is some disks mounted on a shaft, spaced a little distance apart and cased so that a fluid can enter at one
  point and go out at another. If the fluid enters at the centre and goes out at the periphery it is a pump. If it
  enters at the periphery and goes out at the center it is a motor.</p>
<p>“Coupling these engines in series, one can do away with gearing in machinery. Factories can be equipped without
  shafting. The motor is especially adapted to automobiles, for it will run on gas explosions as well as on steam. The
  gas or steam can be let into a dozen ports all around the rim of the case if desired. It is possible to run it as a
  gas engine with a continuous flow of gas, gasoline and air being mixed and the continuous combustion causing expansion
  and pressure to operate the motor. The expansive power of steam, as well as its propulsive power, can be utilized as
  in a turbine or a reciprocating engine. By permitting the propelling fluid to move along the lines of least resistance
  a considerably larger proportion of the available power is utilized.</p>
<p>“As an air compressor it is highly efficient. There is a large engine of this type now in practical operation as an
  air compressor and giving remarkable service. Refrigeration on a scale hitherto never attempted will be practical,
  through the use of this engine in compressing air, and the manufacture of liquid air commercially is now entirely
  feasible. </p>
<p>“With a thousand horse power engine, weighing only one hundred pounds, imagine the possibilities in automobiles,
  locomotives and steamships. In the space now occupied by the engines of the Lusitania twenty-five times her 80,000
  horse power could be developed, were it possible to provide boiler capacity sufficient to furnish the necessary
  steam.”</p>
<p>“And it makes the aeroplane practical,” I suggested.</p>
<p>“Not the aeroplane, the flying machine,” responded Dr. Tesla. “Now you have struck the point in which I am most
  deeply interested—the object toward which I have been devoting my energies for more than twenty years—the dream of my
  life. It was in seeking the means of making the perfect flying machine that I developed this engine. </p>
<p>“Twenty years ago I believed that I would be the first man to fly; that I was on the track of accomplishing what no
  one else was anywhere near reaching. I was working entirely in electricity then and did not realize that the gasoline
  engine was approaching a perfection that was going to make the aeroplane feasible. There is nothing new about the
  aeroplane but its engine, you know.</p>
<p>“What I was working on twenty years ago was the wireless transmission of electric power. My idea was a flying
  machine propelled by an electric motor, with power supplied from stations on the earth. I have not accomplished this
  as yet, but am confident that I will in time. </p>
<p>“When I found that I had been anticipated as to the flying machine, by men working in a different field, I began to
  study the problem from other angles, to regard it as a mechanical rather than an electrical problem. I felt certain
  there must be some means of obtaining power that was better than any now in use. And by vigorous use of my gray matter
  for a number of years, I grasped the possibilities of the principle of the viscosity and adhesion of fluids and
  conceived the mechanism of my engine. Now that I have it, my next step will be the perfect flying machine.” </p>
<p>“An aeroplane driven by your engine?” I asked. </p>
<p>“Not at all,” said Dr. Tesla. “The aeroplane is fatally defective. It is merely a toy—a sporting play-thing. It can
  never become commercially practical. It has fatal defects. One is the fact that when it encounters a downward current
  of air it is helpless. The “hole in the air” of which aviators speak is simply a downward current, and unless the
  aeroplane is high enough above the earth to move laterally but can do nothing but fall. </p>
<p>“There is no way of detecting these downward currents, no way of avoiding them, and therefore the aeroplane must
  always be subject to chance and its operator to the risk of fatal accident. Sportsmen will always take these chances,
  but as a business proposition the risk is too great.</p>
<p>“The flying machine of the future—my flying machine—will be heavier than air, but it will not be an aeroplane. It
  will have no wings. It will be substantial, solid, stable. You cannot have a stable airplane. The gyroscope can never
  be successfully applied to the airplane, for it would give a stability that would result in the machine being torn to
  pieces by the wind, just as the unprotected aeroplane on the ground is torn to pieces by a high wind.</p>
<p>“My flying machine will have neither wings nor propellers. You might see it on the ground and you would never guess
  that it was a flying machine. Yet it will be able to move at will through the air in any direction with perfect
  safety, higher speeds than have yet been reached, regardless of weather and oblivious of “holes in the air” or
  downward currents. It will ascend in such currents if desired. It can remain absolutely stationary in the air, even in
  a wind, for great length of time. Its lifting power will not depend upon any such delicate devices as the bird has to
  employ, but upon positive mechanical action.” </p>
<p>“You will get stability through gyroscopes?” I asked. </p>
<p>“Through gyroscopic action of my engine, assisted by some devices I am not yet prepared to talk about,” he
  replied. </p>
<p>“Powerful air currents that may be deflected at will, if produced by engines and compressors sufficiently light and
  powerful, might lift a heavy body off the ground and propel it through the air,” I ventured, wondering if I had
  grasped the inventor’s secret. </p>
<p>Dr. Tesla smiled an inscrutable smile.</p>
<p>“All I have to say on that point is that my airship will have neither gas bag, wings nor propellers,” he said. “It
  is the child of my dreams, the product of years of intense and painful toil and research. I am not going to talk about
  it any further. But whatever my airship may be, here at least is an engine that will do things that no other engine
  ever has done, and that is something tangible.”</p>
