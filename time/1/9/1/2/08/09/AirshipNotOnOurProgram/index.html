<p class="abstract">Passed Athwart Our Sky Without Giving a Sign.</p>
<p>An airship which was not on the program[,] or at least was not on our program, passed athwart our sky Wednesday night
  [August 7]. It was seen about 7 o'clock to the south southwest and it seemed to be moving westward. It was observed by
  a number of people who by no possibility were "seeing things." To the naked eye it was not much more than a speck in
  the sky although some insisted that they could distinguish its planes.</p>
<p>Several persons on West Prairie avenue viewed it through telescopes and field glasses and these persons say it was
  easily distinguishable as an airship. It is believed to have been the airship now making flights at Taylorville.</p>
