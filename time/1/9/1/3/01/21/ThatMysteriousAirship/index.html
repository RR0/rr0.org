<p>Sir, -- The statement in a recent issue of the Otago Daily Times that an airship passed over Dunedin one evening
  lately, will call to mind the fever of excitement that was stirred up a few years ago [1909] by the alleged appearance
  of a mysterious aerial visitor in the vicinity of Kelso and Tapanui, and being resident in Southland at the time, the
  details are still fresh in my memory. At the outset I might state that both Kelso and Tapanui are in the prohibition
  district of Clutha, so that there can be no possibility of the residents in that locality being guilty of "seeing
  things." The statement that an airship had been seen near Kelso duly reached Dunedin, and the Otago Daily Times
  promptly dispatched a reporter to the up-country township to get particulars first hand. A number of school children,
  who alleged they saw the airship in broad daylight, were duly interviewed, and were induced to make rough sketches of
  the mysterious visitors, and these duly made their appearance in print, together with columns of interviews and
  statements of residents of the locality. One old lady stated that she was awakened suddenly one night by a "loud
  whirring noise" which seemed to come from the sky, whilst another said that these mysterious noises at night
  caused the horses in an adjacent paddock to gallop about madly, and going out to see what was the matter, saw a dark
  object in the sky, carrying a light at either end, and traveling at a tremendous speed towards the mountains. When yet
  another Kelsoite rushed into the township with the statement that he had found an empty petrol tin and a spanner, it
  was taken as proof positive that the aircraft was no myth but a matter of substance, and the many readers of the daily
  press were regaled with the statement that the airship was the invention of some engineer who was experimenting in
  aerial navigation, and certainly much in advance of anything then known in the aviation world. The aircraft then
  appears to have made a general tour of Southland, for at Waikaka (near Gore) some dredge hands declared that it passed
  so close one night that they could hear the voices of the occupants speaking a "strange foreign language." At
  Invercargill a policeman in a state of excitement told one of the local papers that he distinctly saw the lights of
  the airship passing to the westward of the town. He was positive because he took a lamp post and the aerial visitor in
  a line, closed one eye, and with the other saw the stranger disappear into the night. The ship was then alleged to
  have been seen on several occasions in the vicinity of the Longwood range, one gentleman, who said he saw it from his
  house one afternoon, sending what he purported to be a full description of the aircraft to one of the Invercargill
  papers. At Colac Bay the local storekeeper also rushed into print with a statement that the ship passed quite low over
  the township one night and made out to sea, and some blue lights being seen out in Foveaux Straits a few minutes
  afterwards, the storekeeper gave it out through the press that these lights were signals from a foreign warship which
  was acting in concert with the airship. Some time afterwards the aerial visitor was supposed to have been seen near
  the Nuggets light house, going in the direction of the sea. The knowing ones then declared that the airship landed on
  the deck of a foreign cruiser far out at sea, "which showed that some of the Continental nations were far ahead of us
  in the science of aviation." It is quite evident from the foregoing that the Southerners have powerful
  imaginations, and although prohibition has a good grip on that end of the country, they can see things in the air that
  must turn our sober-going West Coasters green with envy. &ndash; I am, etc.,</p>
