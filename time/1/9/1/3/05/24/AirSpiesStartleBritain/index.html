<p class="abstract">Mysterious Nocturnal Flying Craft Seen in Yorkshire.</p>
<p>London, Feb. 24. &ndash; England has been greatly troubled since it was established officially some time ago that a
  Zeppelin airship had flown over Sheerness during the night. To add to the perplexity and wonderment over the nocturnal
  visit, the news comes that another mysterious airship was seen at Shelby, in Yorkshire, late Sunday night [May 18],
  reconnoitering for nearly an hour.</p>
<p>The airship showed port and starboard lights and flashed her searchlight over the countryside. Many persons
  distinctly heard the whirr of the propellers.</p>
