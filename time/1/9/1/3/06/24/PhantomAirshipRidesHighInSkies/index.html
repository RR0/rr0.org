<p>A phantom airship startled persons near the highway bridge Monday evening [June 23] about 5:30, a floating mirage
  high in the air that showed the dim outline of a Zeppelin and maintained it for about twelve minutes. Although high in
  the air the object very closely resembled a dirigible and persons all along the drive could be seen gazing at the
  peculiar phenomena [sic].</p>
<p>It was first seen rising rapidly from the sky line behind the G. &amp; M. dock. As it rose in the air it rapidly took
  on the form of an airship and moved rapidly across the sky. When it had reached about zenith it passed from sight
  behind clouds. The time which elapsed during the period it was in sight was about 12 minutes.

<p>The peculiar formation cannot be explained unless it was a gas pocket, formed by some locomotive or steamer which
  expanded as it rose and took on the form of an airship. If this is the case the atmospheric conditions must have been
  just right to keep the phantom from disintegrating. Its form was perfect and even after gazing at it for minutes one
  could hardly keep from believing that a great craft was passing high above the city.</p>
