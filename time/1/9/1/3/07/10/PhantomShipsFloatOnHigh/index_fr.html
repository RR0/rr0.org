<p class="abstract">Des appareils aériens supposés sont vu dans ces parties</p>
<p class="abstract2">On pense qu'un gros est passé au-dessus des cités jumelles.</p>
<p>Plusieurs hommes d'affaire proéminents de la ville déclarent avoir vu un grand ballon s'installer au sol près de la
  rivière Saint Joseph cette semaine. Les signalements diffèrent, certains disant que c'était dimanche après-midi alors
  que d'autres déclarent que c'était lundi. Le docteur F. R. Belknap, Fred Rowe et Wm. Williams font partie de ceux qui
  ont vu l'appareil monstreux. Careful investigation in the outlying districts fails to locate any one who saw the craft
  and for this reason it is believed that the balloon was a mirage caused by a gas ring, similar to the one seen near
  the river a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>The balloon was seen at a distance and was indistinct but it looked as if it was a large silver colored craft with a
  hanging basket. So low was it that it looked as if the basket was dragging in the tree tops.</p>
<p>People who were on the beach at St. Joseph yesterday also report that what looked like an airship could be seen far
  out in the lake [Lake Michigan] hovering over the water. Many were questioned and all stoutly maintained that a large
  airship was out in the lake during the afternoon.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly these strange aerial craft were mirages and it is explained that, due to the fact that many people have
  been watching the skies for the past few days looking for the air boats which passed over here, they mistook cloud
  formations or gas rings for air craft, the unusually nervous state of mind helping to bear out the impression.</p>
