<p class="abstract">Burke County's Mysterious Light Still Baffles Investigators.</p>
<p>(Special to The Observer.)</p>
<p> Linville Falls, Sept.23.--The mysterious light that is seen just above the horizon almost every night from
  Rattlesnake Knob, near Cold Spring, on the Morganton road, about seven miles from here, is still baffling all
  investigators. All theories as to its origin or nature have either been exploded or fall through from lack of evidence
  to support them.</p>
<p>With punctual regularity the light rises in a southeasterly direction from the point of observation just over the
  lower slope of Brown Mountain, first about 7:30 p.m., again about 20 or 30 minutes later and again at 10 o-clock. It
  looks much like a toy fire balloon, a distinct ball, with no "atmosphere" about it, and as nearly as the average
  observer can measure it, about the size of the toy balloon.</p>
<p>It is much smaller than the full moon, much larger than any star and fiery red. It rises in the far distance from
  beyond Brown Mountain, which is about six miles from Rattlesnake Knob, and after going up a short distance, wavers and
  goes out in less than one minute. The observer has to watch the sky closely at the right time, or he will miss it. It
  does not always appear in exactly the same place, but varies what must amount in the distance to several miles. The
  light is visible at all seasons, so Mr. Anderson Loven, an old and reliable resident, testifies. During the Winter it
  appears far off to the south of the usual Summer position, and is not visible from Rattlensake [sic] Knob, but is seen
  from a point farther down the turnpike, around the point or ridge that hides it from the Summer point of
  observation.</p>
<p> Many have scoffed at this "spooky" thing, and those members of the Morganton Fishing Club who first saw it more than
  two years ago were laughed at and accused of "seeing things at night" as a result of a common human frailty. But as
  more and more persons have seen it, various attempts have been made to explain the mystery.</p>
<p> That it is no mere reflection of some other light has been disproved. Some have declared that it was some practical
  joker sending up a light to mystify people, but it would hardly be kept up for several years, nor would it appear
  miles apart within a few minutes. There seems to be no doubt that the light rises from some point in the wide,level
  country between Brown Mountain and the South Mountains, a distance of about 12 miles, though it is possible that it
  rises a still greater distance.</p>
