<p>Ogdensburg [New York], Sept. 17. - Several residents along the Canadian border, eight miles west of the city, report
  the second appearance of a mysterious aviator at night. They report seeing a light in the heavens and plainly hearing
  a buzzing sound such as would be made by the exhaust of an aeroplane.</p>
<p>Two fishermen in Butternut bay, near Brockville, are positive they saw an airship moving in a southeasterly direction
  Sunday morning [September 13]. It was quite light at the time. The birdman appears to begin his flight on the American
  shore, but his identity and what may be the object of his visits to Canadian territory is the puzzle that the Canadian
  officials are trying to solve.</p>
<p>Pickets on duty at the Soulanges canal are reported to have recently fired upon an aeroplane. The birdman has been
  seen repeatedly by the canal guards.</p>
