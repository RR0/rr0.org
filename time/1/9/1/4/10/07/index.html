<p class="abstract">Swung West Over Local Station.</p>
<p class="abstract2">Other Air Craft in this Section.</p>
<p>An airship of apparently high power and traveling at a high rate of speed was sighted in this section at an early
  hour last Friday morning [October 2], according to the statements of several creditable witnesses. The machine was
  noticed by members of the train crew of east bound passenger train 3 due here shortly after midnight. It followed them
  from Dekalb Junction to this village and disappeared in a westerly direction. Perry Nichols, third track operator at
  the local station, saw the machine, and heard the roar of its motor. Several motorists out at that time also tell of
  seeing and hearing the airship. It is believed that the aeroplane was one purchased by the Canadian government to send
  to England with its contingent of troops and that it was being driven to the concentration camp at Valcartier, Quebec,
  under its own power. </p>
<p>The airship was first sighted by a rear brakeman on the passenger train shortly after it left Dekalb. He saw the two
  lights of the flyer as they rose and fell in the wake of the coaches. The train stopped at Canton and Eben to unload
  milk cans and at each point the machine hovered in the sky above until the train started, when it fell in behind
  again. The brakeman called attention of the other members of the train crew to it and all plainly saw the moving
  lights. When Potsdam was reached they told Nichols, and after the departure of the train he watched the machine which
  swung to the westward and disappeared in the direction of Ogdensburg and the St. Lawrence river. The noise of the
  motor's exhaust was plainly audible. She was flying at a height of several hundred feet.</p>
<p>Those who saw the machine have a theory that she was heading for the border along the St. Lawrence river and followed
  the train, thinking that its terminus was Ogdensburg. It is known that since the outbreak of the European war, the
  Canadian government has been purchasing large numbers of motor trucks and aeroplanes in this country for use against
  the Germans and that considerable difficulty has been experienced in getting them over the border. These adjuncts of
  modern warfare are contraband of war and in pursuance of its policy of strict neutrality, the American government
  cannot allow them to pass its customs. There seems to be little doubt but [sic] that several airship's [sic] have been
  flown into Canada under their own power recently and that some have passed over Northern New York. </p>
<p>Confirmation of the airship stories comes from various localities. Friday night of last week, Abe Jerue, a farmer
  residing five miles east of Ogdensburg, claimed that an aviator was flying about in that vicinity and Saturday night
  H. J. Randles, residing at No. 110 Jay street, Ogdensburg, was confident he heard the buzz of the aeroplane's motor
  near the St. Lawrence river and believes the birdman flew over the city.</p>
<p>Carthage saw what the residents believed to be a big biplane flying north a few days ago. Carthage saw it at night
  fall and Chateaugay noted it the following morning. When first seen the air ship was at a point almost directly over
  the residence of William Johnston, where it made a circle and thence proceeded in a southeastward direction. After a
  short flight the craft again came to a point over the village and then went in a northeasterly direction, as if it
  were heading for Canada. Pratt Hill, who was one of the spectators who witnessed the evolutions of the mysterious
  craft, says that it was apparently up about 300 feet from the ground and that the whirring of the engine could be very
  distinctly heard.</p>
<p>Another big airship was unloaded on Isle La Motte one Sunday recently. The machine came by express knocked down and
  five men appeared to assemble her. The machine was of the hydroplane type and she rose from Lake Champlain the
  following morning. Her first course was south to North Island City and then circling about she steered for Quebec. The
  plane carried two men and was under about 100 horse power. The work of building was done on the shore [of] Loren
  Wedgeworth's farm. The plane was shipped from Malden, Mass.</p>
