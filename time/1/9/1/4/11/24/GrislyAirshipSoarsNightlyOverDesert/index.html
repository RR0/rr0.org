<p>SAN BERNARDINO, Nov. 24. - Coming out of the desert like a phantom, a mysterious airship is nightly hurtling through
  space, terrifying the few inhabitants and puzzling the telegraph operators along the railway lines.</p>
<p>Twice these night men at the stations have heard the rhythmic hunt [hum?] of the ghost-like aircraft, and midnight
  vigils are now being kept in the hope that the strange visitor might be sighted.</p>
<p>From Helen, Hesperia and Victorville come reports that the mysterious craft, flying low, but still unseen, has passed
  over those points.</p>
<p>So the residents of the desert border land are becoming alarmed, for they know not what to fear.</p>
<p>Out from the great gray desert comes the strange midnight aircraft, back to the desert it flies. But whether it comes
  and whither it goes - that is the query on every lip along the airship's trail.</p>
