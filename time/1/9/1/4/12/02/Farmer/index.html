<p>Jo. LaFave, who works for J. B. Twaddle & Co., and who resides near the paper mill, saw what appeared to be a
  dirigible balloon or airship Sunday afternoon [November 29] off in a northwesterly direction. It came from the north
  and shot downward over the plains as though to make a landing where the ground was favorable. Other Malone people
  heard the noise of a motor at about the same time. So many reports of airships coming from all directions indicate
  that they are doing some kind of business between here and Canada. We are inclined to the belief, however, that they
  are in the British instead of German service. They are so elusive that they may be smugglers of gems or other precious
  wares &ndash; who knows? Mr. LaFave says he could not tell whether there was more than one person aboard the airship
  which he saw. Has anybody looked into whether this method has been adopted for bringing in Chinamen? A resident of
  Edward street saw a dirigible balloon in the bright moonlight Monday night. It passed over the village going
  southwesterly at about midnight. It was probably the same balloon seen Sunday afternoon. Why somebody does not run
  across some of these air craft when they are on the earth is a deep mystery.</p>
