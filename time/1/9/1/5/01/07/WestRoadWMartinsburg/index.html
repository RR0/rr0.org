<p>[excerpt]</p>
<p>Another airship was seen and heard Saturday [January 2] by several West Martinsburg people. We all know how stormy it
  was that day, and it seems strange that the aeronauts prefer traveling in cold weather. This is the ninth airship
  which has been known to pass through this section of country since September.</p>
