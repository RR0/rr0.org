<p>(extract)</p>
<p>The mysterious airship has been seen again, this time over South Portland, and the direction which it took when it
  left this vicinity substantiates the story relative to the craft which appeared Feb. 21 in the Portland Press. It will
  be remembered it was reported that a couple of young men had built a machine that would run as well in cold weather as
  warm and were experimenting with it in this section, having their hangar in a secret place up the Mountain division of
  the Maine Central Railroad. When the airship appeared over South Portland a respectable citizen who happened to be out
  of doors was attracted by the noise of the motors and it was so near to earth that he could hear two men talking. They
  appeared to be trying to get their bearings as they sailed about and flashed their searchlight, and finally when they
  had crossed the Fore river, they turned the machine and went off in the direction of the mountains at a great rate of
  speed.</p>
