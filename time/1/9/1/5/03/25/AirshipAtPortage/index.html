<p class="abstract">Strange Visitor Flies Over the City at Night Time. </p>
<p>Portage la Prairie, Man. , March 24. - An airship of some description was seen over Portage last night, according to
  reports of several citizens, whose veracity cannot be questioned. The airship was seen at several places, and several
  times during the evening. The first time was about 9.30 and the last about 11.30. The buzzing from the engine was
  quite plainly discernible and two lights were carried, one at the front of the machine and one at the rear. The
  machine was first seen north of the city and it was last seen heading south. This was at 11.30 last night. </p>
<p>Even reports come from the country districts today, that moving lights were seen last night, and George Guay, a real
  estate agent of the city, says that he watched the lights for some time, and was positive it was some kind of an
  airship.</p>
