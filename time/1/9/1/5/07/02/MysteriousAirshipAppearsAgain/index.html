<p class="abstract">Alighted In Ventura</p>
<p>Flights of a mysterious airship over Ventura county have begun again. Last week C. S. White and J. W. Shillington
  thought that they saw an airship pass over about 9:30 p.m. going north.</p>
<p>Twice residents of Oxnard believed that they saw an airship a month ago. It is worthy of note that the reports of the
  aircraft come with moonlight nights. There are several theories as to the night flyer, but the most plausible are that
  he is a member of the army aviation corps from San Diego, or some aviator practicing in secret. Moonlight nights would
  be suitable for secret practice as the air is quiet and best adapted to flying.</p>
