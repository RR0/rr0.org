<span class="note">The Code of Hammurabi is a Babylonian legal text composed during 1755–1750 BC. It is the longest, best-organized, and best-preserved legal text from the ancient Near East. It is written in the Old Babylonian dialect of Akkadian, purportedly by Hammurabi, sixth king of the First Dynasty of Babylon. The primary copy of the text is inscribed on a basalt stele 2.25 m (7 ft 4+1⁄2 in) tall.</span>

  <h2>Prologue</h2>
  <p>When Anu the Sublime, King of the Anunaki, and Bel, the lord of Heaven and earth, who decreed the fate of the land,
    assigned to Marduk, the over-ruling son of Ea, God of righteousness, dominion over earthly man, and made him great
    among the Igigi, they called Babylon by his illustrious name, made it great on earth, and founded an everlasting
    kingdom in it, whose foundations are laid so solidly as those of heaven and earth; then Anu and Bel called by name
    me, Hammurabi, the exalted prince, who feared God, to bring about the rule of righteousness in the land, to destroy
    the wicked and the evildoers; so that the strong should not harm the weak; so that I should rule over the
    black-headed people like Shamash, and enlighten the land, to further the well-being of mankind.</p>
  <p>Hammurabi, the prince, called of Bel am I, making riches and increase, enriching Nippur and Dur-ilu beyond compare,
    sublime patron of E-kur; who reestablished Eridu and purified the worship of E-apsu; who conquered the four quarters
    of the world, made great the name of Babylon, rejoiced the heart of Marduk, his lord who daily pays his devotions in
    Saggil; the royal scion whom Sin made; who enriched Ur; the humble, the reverent, who brings wealth to
    Gish-shir-gal; the white king, heard of Shamash, the mighty, who again laid the foundations of Sippara; who clothed
    the gravestones of Malkat with green; who made E-babbar great, which is like the heavens, the warrior who guarded
    Larsa and renewed E-babbar, with Shamash as his helper; the lord who granted new life to Uruk, who brought plenteous
    water to its inhabitants, raised the head of E-anna, and perfected the beauty of Anu and Nana; shield of the land,
    who reunited the scattered inhabitants of Isin; who richly endowed E-gal-mach; the protecting king of the city,
    brother of the god Zamama; who firmly founded the farms of Kish, crowned E-me-te-ursag with glory, redoubled the
    great holy treasures of Nana, managed the temple of Harsagkalama; the grave of the enemy, whose help brought about
    the victory; who increased the power of Cuthah; made all glorious in E-shidlam, the black steer, who gored the
    enemy; beloved of the god Nebo, who rejoiced the inhabitants of Borsippa, the Sublime; who is indefatigable for
    E-zida; the divine king of the city; the White, Wise; who broadened the fields of Dilbat, who heaped up the harvests
    for Urash; the Mighty, the lord to whom come scepter and crown, with which he clothes himself; the Elect of Ma-ma;

    Anunit; the pure prince, whose prayer is accepted by Adad; who satisfied the heart of Adad, the warrior, in Karkar,
    who restored the vessels for worship in E-ud-gal-gal; the king who granted life to the city of Adab; the guide of
    E-mach; the princely king of the city, the irresistible warrior, who granted life to the inhabitants of
    Mashkanshabri, and brought abundance to the temple of Shidlam; the White, Potent, who penetrated the secret cave of
    the bandits, saved the inhabitants of Malka from misfortune, and fixed their home fast in wealth; who established
    pure sacrificial gifts for Ea and Dam-gal-nun-na, who made his kingdom everlastingly great; the princely king of the
    city, who subjected the districts on the Ud-kib-nun-na Canal to the sway of Dagon, his Creator; who spared the
    inhabitants of Mera and Tutul; the sublime prince, who makes the face of Ninni shine; who presents holy meals to the
    divinity of Nin-a-zu, who cared for its inhabitants in their need, provided a portion for them in Babylon in peace;
    the shepherd of the oppressed and of the slaves; whose deeds find favor before Anunit, who provided for Anunit in
    the temple of Dumash in the suburb of Agade; who recognizes the right, who rules by law; who gave back to the city
    of Ashur its protecting god; who let the name of Ishtar of Nineveh remain in E-mish-mish; the Sublime, who humbles
    himself before the great gods; successor of Sumula-il; the mighty son of Sin-muballit; the royal scion of Eternity;
    the mighty monarch, the sun of Babylon, whose rays shed light over the land of Sumer and Akkad; the king, obeyed by
    the four quarters of the world; Beloved of Ninni, am I.</p>

  <h2>The epilogue</h2>
  <p>Laws of justice which Hammurabi, the wise king, established. A righteous law, and pious statute did he teach the
    land. Hammurabi, the protecting king am I. I have not withdrawn myself from the men, whom Bel gave to me, the rule
    over whom Marduk gave to me, I was not negligent, but I made them a peaceful abiding-place. I expounded all great
    difficulties, I made the light shine upon them. With the mighty weapons which Zamama and Ishtar entrusted to me,
    with the keen vision with which Ea endowed me, with the wisdom that Marduk gave me, I have uprooted the enemy above
    and below (in north and south), subdued the earth, brought prosperity to the land, guaranteed security to the
    inhabitants in their homes; a disturber was not permitted. The great gods have called me, I am the salvation-bearing
    shepherd, whose staff is straight, the good shadow that is spread over my city; on my breast I cherish the
    inhabitants of the land of Sumer and Akkad; in my shelter I have let them repose in peace; in my deep wisdom have I
    enclosed them. That the strong might not injure the weak, in order to protect the widows and orphans, I have in
    Babylon the city where Anu and Bel raise high their head, in E-Sagil, the Temple, whose foundations stand firm as
    heaven and earth, in order to bespeak justice in the land, to settle all disputes, and heal all injuries, set up
    these my precious words, written upon my memorial stone, before the image of me, as king of righteousness.</p>
  <p>The king who ruleth among the kings of the cities am I. My words are well considered; there is no wisdom like unto
    mine. By the command of Shamash, the great judge of heaven and earth, let righteousness go forth in the land: by the
    order of Marduk, my lord, let no destruction befall my monument. In E-Sagil, which I love, let my name be ever
    repeated; let the oppressed, who has a case at law, come and stand before this my image as king of righteousness;
    let him read the inscription, and understand my precious words: the inscription will explain his case to him; he
    will find out what is just, and his heart will be glad, so that he will say:</p>
  <p>“Hammurabi is a ruler, who is as a father to his subjects, who holds the words of Marduk in reverence, who has
    achieved conquest for Marduk over the north and south, who rejoices the heart of Marduk, his lord, who has bestowed
    benefits for ever and ever on his subjects, and has established order in the land.”</p>
  <p>When he reads the record, let him pray with full heart to Marduk, my lord, and Zarpanit, my lady; and then shall
    the protecting deities and the gods, who frequent E-Sagil, graciously grant the desires daily presented before
    Marduk, my lord, and Zarpanit, my lady.</p>
  <p>In future time, through all coming generations, let the king, who may be in the land, observe the words of
    righteousness which I have written on my monument; let him not alter the law of the land which I have given, the
    edicts which I have enacted; my monument let him not mar. If such a ruler have wisdom, and be able to keep his land
    in order, he shall observe the words which I have written in this inscription; the rule, statute, and law of the
    land which I have given; the decisions which I have made will this inscription show him; let him rule his subjects
    accordingly, speak justice to them, give right decisions, root out the miscreants and criminals from this land, and
    grant prosperity to his subjects.</p>
  <p>Hammurabi, the king of righteousness, on whom Shamash has conferred right (or law) am I. My words are well
    considered; my deeds are not equaled; to bring low those that were high; to humble the proud, to expel insolence. If
    a succeeding ruler considers my words, which I have written in this my inscription, if he does not annul my law, nor
    corrupt my words, nor change my monument, then may Shamash lengthen that king’s reign, as he has that of me, the
    king of righteousness, that he may reign in righteousness over his subjects. If this ruler do not esteem my words,
    which I have written in my inscription, if he despises my curses, and fear not the curse of God, if he destroys the
    law which I have given, corrupt my words, change my monument, efface my name, write his name there, or on account of
    the curses commission another so to do, that man, whether king or ruler, patesi, or commoner, no matter what he is,
    may the great God (Anu), the Father of the gods, who has ordered my rule, withdraw from him the glory of royalty,
    break his scepter, curse his destiny. May Bel, the lord, who fixeth destiny, whose command can not be altered, who
    has made my kingdom great, order a rebellion which his hand can not control; may he let the wind of the overthrow of
    his habitation blow, may he ordain the years of his rule in groaning, years of scarcity, years of famine, darkness
    without light, death with seeing eyes be fated to him; may he (Bel) order with his potent mouth the destruction of
    his city, the dispersion of his subjects, the cutting off of his rule, the removal of his name and memory from the
    land. May Belit, the great Mother, whose command is potent in E-Kur (the Babylonian Olympus), the Mistress, who
    harkens graciously to my petitions, in the seat of judgment and decision (where Bel fixes destiny), turn his affairs
    evil before Bel, and put the devastation of his land, the destruction of his subjects, the pouring out of his life
    like water into the mouth of King Bel. May Ea, the great ruler, whose fated decrees come to pass, the thinker of the
    gods, the omniscient, who maketh long the days of my life, withdraw understanding and wisdom from him, lead him to
    forgetfulness, shut up his rivers at their sources, and not allow corn or sustenance for man to grow in his land.
    May Shamash, the great Judge of heaven and earth, who supporteth all means of livelihood, Lord of life-courage,
    shatter his dominion, annul his law, destroy his way, make vain the march of his troops, send him in his visions
    forecasts of the uprooting of the foundations of his throne and of the destruction of his land. May the condemnation
    of Shamash overtake him forthwith; may he be deprived of water above among the living, and his spirit below in the
    earth. May Sin (the Moon-god), the Lord of Heaven, the divine father, whose crescent gives light among the gods,
    take away the crown and regal throne from him; may he put upon him heavy guilt, great decay, that nothing may be
    lower than he. May he destine him as fated, days, months and years of dominion filled with sighing and tears,
    increase of the burden of dominion, a life that is like unto death. May Adad, the lord of fruitfulness, ruler of
    heaven and earth, my helper, withhold from him rain from heaven, and the flood of water from the springs, destroying
    his land by famine and want; may he rage mightily over his city, and make his land into flood-hills (heaps of ruined
    cities). May Zamama, the great warrior, the firstborn son of E-Kur, who goeth at my right hand, shatter his weapons
    on the field of battle, turn day into night for him, and let his foe triumph over him. May Ishtar, the goddess of
    fighting and war, who unfetters my weapons, my gracious protecting spirit, who loveth my dominion, curse his kingdom
    in her angry heart; in her great wrath, change his grace into evil, and shatter his weapons on the place of fighting
    and war. May she create disorder and sedition for him, strike down his warriors, that the earth may drink their
    blood, and throw down the piles of corpses of his warriors on the field; may she not grant him a life of mercy,
    deliver him into the hands of his enemies, and imprison him in the land of his enemies. May Nergal, the might among
    the gods, whose contest is irresistible, who grants me victory, in his great might burn up his subjects like a
    slender reedstalk, cut off his limbs with his mighty weapons, and shatter him like an earthen image. May Nin-tu, the
    sublime mistress of the lands, the fruitful mother, deny him a son, vouchsafe him no name, give him no successor
    among men. May Nin-karak, the daughter of Anu, who adjudges grace to me, cause to come upon his members in E-kur
    high fever, severe wounds, that can not be healed, whose nature the physician does not understand, which he can not
    treat with dressing, which, like the bite of death, can not be removed, until they have sapped away his life.</p>
  <p>May he lament the loss of his life-power, and may the great gods of heaven and earth, the Anunaki, altogether
    inflict a curse and evil upon the confines of the temple, the walls of this E-barra (the Sun temple of Sippara),
    upon his dominion, his land, his warriors, his subjects, and his troops. May Bel curse him with the potent curses of
    his mouth that can not be altered, and may they come upon him forthwith.</p></section>
