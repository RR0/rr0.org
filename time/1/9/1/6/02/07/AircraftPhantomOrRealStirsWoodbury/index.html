<p class="abstract">Night Sky Prowler Discerned Scientifically by George Budd </p>
<p>Special to The Inquirer.</p>
<p>WOODBURY, N. J., Feb. 6.&#8212;Like a Zeppelin-threatened city, Woodbury has become a sleepless town, at least for
  the more timid of the residents, who fear that an aeroplane, phantom or real, which a score of persons claim to have
  seen the past two nights, is bent on raiding a town unprotected by aircraft guns. Aeroplane is a plain name for the
  aerial machine, according to those who have seen it, for they declare that it appears to be some foreign war
  contrivance, never seen before on this side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>No, it is not mere guess-work or an optical delusion, according to George Budd, for he says he has scientifically
  investigated with night glasses and compasses, and has been able to discern an aeroplane moving over the "white star
  line," and Woodbury has faith in George's scientific observations. Then, again, he lives on the East Side, and has a
  clear field for watching the skies at night. On Friday night he watched for half an hour, and then with due scientific
  precision found that the supposed aeroplane occuplied a dozen different locations.</p>
<p>If the aeroplane is a real, sure enough Fokker or aerial war machine, it must be one of those which, it has been
  asserted, have been seen over the plants of the duPont Powder Company at Carney's Point, N. J., and other places,
  Woodbury residents say. The aeroplane declared to have been seen here appears at nine o'clock at night, instead of
  midnight, so Woodbury claims to be three hours ahead of Carney's Point in the matter of aeroplanes. </p>
