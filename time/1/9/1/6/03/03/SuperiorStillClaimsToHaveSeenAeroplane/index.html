<p>SUPERIOR, Wis., March 3. - Employees at the Great Northern ore docks and at the Carnegie coal dock on Thursday
  continued to insist that they had really seen an aeroplane and many Superior residents are unwilling to believe that
  toy balloons explain the mysterious object seen soaring over the city. They called attention to the fact that the
  machine disappeared in the west. According to official records of the weather department, this would have been
  impossible had the object been a toy balloon, as the wind was from that direction and blowing a stiff gale, too.</p>
