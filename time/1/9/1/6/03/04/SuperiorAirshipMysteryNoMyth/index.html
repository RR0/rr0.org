<p>(BY ASSOCIATED PRESS.)</p>
<p>Superior, Wis., March 4. - F. A. Porter, a farmer residing near Hines, reported to the sheriff that last night a
  large aeroplane landed in a field adjoining his home. When he went out to investigate, one of the three men in the
  machine met him and asked him to keep away, he says. According to Porter, the aeroplane rested in his field half an
  hour, while aviators made repairs. It then sailed away in the direction of Superior.</p>
