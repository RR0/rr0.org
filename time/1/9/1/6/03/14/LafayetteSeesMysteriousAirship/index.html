<p>The streets of Lafayette were thronged Sunday evening [March 12] with people trying to locate a mysterious airship
  which has been seen several times flying above the city. The airship carries a light which to the onlookers appeared
  of a reddish yellow hue. The light can be seen to move and hundreds of people watched the course of the airship as it
  sailed across the city high in the air. So far as is known, the machine has not been seen near Logansport. There is no
  clue as to who the aviator may be.</p>
