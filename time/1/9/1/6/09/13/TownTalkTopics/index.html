<p>[excerpt]</p>
<p>Clayton has another airship mystery to discuss. The story, which is vouched for by dozens of residents, is that two
  brilliantly lighted airships maneuvered over the river back of Calumet Island on Monday night [September 11] and that
  they would rise in the air about 300 to 400 feet and then drop. Where they came from or where they went and the reason
  for their activity are questions which the Clayton people are anxious to have answered.</p>
