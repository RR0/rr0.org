<p>BOSTON, April 13. &ndash; A Massachusetts guardsman on sentry duty near Portsmouth, N.H., at 3 o'clock this morning
  fired two shots at an aeroplane which came from the direction of the sea, flying high, according to a dispatch to the
  Boston American.</p>
<p>The aeroplane, according to the report, held to a course northward in the general direction of Dover.</p>
<p>The aviator paid not attention as far as the sentry could discern, but drove his machine right along. He seemed to be
  following the course of the Piscataqua river, which empties into the sea here from the north.</p>
<p>On the possibility that the aeroplane had come from the Portsmouth navy yard news of the aerial intruder was
  immediately telephoned to the yard. Reply was received that no government war machine was flying from the navy
  yard.</p>
