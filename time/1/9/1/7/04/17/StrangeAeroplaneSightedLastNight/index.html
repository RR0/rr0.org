<p class="abstract">Was Seen Circling Around Boston and Maine Railroad Bridge</p>
<p>(By United Press)</p>
<p>Boston, April 17. &ndash; A mysterious aeroplane was sighted over the Boston &amp; Maine railroad crossing the
  Piscataqua river by Massachusetts national guardsmen shortly before midnight last night.</p>
<p>Captain W. L. Howard, commandant of the Portsmouth navy yard[,] sent a telephone message to Captain William H. Rush,
  commandant of the Charleston navy yard, today and the latter issued the following statement on the report:</p>
<p>"Commanding officer of the Sixth Massachusetts national guard detailed to watch the Boston &amp; Maine railroad
  bridge over the Piscataqua river reports that the sentry on watch at 11:20 p.m., last night, distinctly saw an
  aeroplane coming, to which he called the attention of the other sentries on the bridge[,] and four of them watched the
  aeroplane for five minutes, circling to the northward of the bridge. It made no attempt to come over the bridge, but
  the four are positive that they saw the aeroplane in the manner mentioned.</p>
<p>"The commandant thinks that there is something in this aeroplane business and thinks it must have a base in the
  mountains to the northward of Portsmouth. The sheriff of Rochester, N.H., has sworn in a squad of men and they are
  circling the mountains in the district. The commandant has taken it up with press associations and asked their
  co-operation in getting information."</p>
