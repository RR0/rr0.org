<p>PORTSMOUTH, N.H., April 20. - Naval authorities renewed the search Thursday [April 19] for a mysterious aeroplane
  whose night prowling over New Hampshire has been reported recently by citizens and soldiers, in view of reports that
  another flight over this city was made last night. Telephone messages stating that an aviator had flown over York
  Beach, Me., and Hampton, reached the navy yard shortly after calls were received.</p>
