<p>Air raider?</p>
<p>Amateur birdman?</p>
<p>Aviation corps flyer?</p>
<p>Roving star?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>THESE questions are being asked by the residents of villages and rural communities in Trempealeau county who are
  mystified by the appearance of what at least half a score of people declare is an airplane; where the flyer came from,
  who drives it, and whether it is a government or private "plane" is not known &ndash; in fact all that is known
  of the flyer is that it has been seen by several people.</p>
<section>
  <h2>Carries Big Light</h2>
  <p>The strange machine appears only late at night. It flies high above the earth, carrying several small lights and a
    strong searchlight throwing a long white ray far ahead in its path through the night ether. It is said to travel
    slowly. All this on the authority of villagers who stoutly insist upon the accuracy of their own eyes.</p>
  <p>At least one person in the village of Arcadia believes the vision is a roving star, although this view is flouted
    by many persons. Others think that it is some sort of an airplane &ndash; or possibly a dirigible balloon. Others
    declare that they have seen nothing strange in the sky and these discount the story. Attorney E. E. Barlow of
    Arcadia told the Tribune and Leader-Press over the long distance phone this morning that he thought the flyer
    originated in imaginative minds.</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Iduna Has Seen It</h2>
  <p>But the fact remains that seven or eight people &ndash; about half the population of Iduna, a village four miles
    west of Ettrick in Trempealeau county, declare they plainly saw the outline of a strange flying machine, high in the
    air, and traveling at a comparatively slow rate of speed towards Winona [Minnesota].</p>
  <p>Those who witnessed the strange sight in the sky at Iduna are sure that the light could not have been a star. They
    declare they saw the outline of a long white object, throwing a long path of light ahead of it.</p>
  <p>John Hovre, well known store keeper at Iduna, is firm in his belief that what he and other Iduna residents saw was
    an airplane.</p>
  <p>Mr. Hovre and several other residents of his village discovered the lights in the sky last Wednesday night [January
    9]. Mr. Hovre called the attention of the villagers to the sight.</p>
  <p>"I watched the machine for between twelve and fifteen minutes," he told the Tribune and Leader-Press.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Was High in Air</h2>
  <p>"It appeared white even through the dark sky," declared the Iduna man, "and I should judge it to be about
    thirty feet long. I may be mistaken in this, for the machine was high in the air. It was traveling slowly, however.
    It was going towards Winona. I could see no figures in the machine, it was so high in the air. I saw several lights
    attached to it, and one large light, evidently a headlight, which cast a long white ray far ahead of it. Other
    people here in Iduna agree with me that what we saw could not have been anything but a flying machine."</p>

  <h2>Why Plane in Wilderness</h2>
  <p>Trempealeau people cannot account for a flying machine appearing at night over the rough, wooded country of
    Trempealeau county. They believe that if it is an air flyer, it came from a great distance off.
