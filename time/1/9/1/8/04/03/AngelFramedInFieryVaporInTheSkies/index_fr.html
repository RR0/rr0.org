<p> Scores of Windsor Ont. residents, says a press despatch, beheld an angel, surrounded by firy (sic) vapor, suspended
  in the city last Saturday night. At Detroit, on the same evening, the angel was seen, brooding over the earth. In both
  cities the beholders indignantly deny they were fooled by northern lights. They cannot be shaken in the claim that
  they saw an angel.</p>
<p> French soldiers, since the war began, have repeatedly seen Joan of Arc and St. Michael--so they vow--sweeping across
  the night skies above the camps. And they believe it means victory.</p>
<p>The Ojibway "Thunder Eagle" is on the rampage again at Fort William, Ont. The eagle makes his rounds only when
  wondrous world crises are pending. He was seen soaring over Thunder Bay, Ont. at midnight on March 7. Most observers
  took him for a many colored light that blazed across the skies, and which was visible from New York to Canada that
  night. Only the initated (sic) recognized him as the portent-proclaiming eagle, back on the job of fortelling a mighty
  crisis of some sort.</p>
<p>Sticking to the proved facts and no dabbling in superstition, it is an odd coincidence that many of our country's
  great events (as well as big happenings in other parts of the world) have been preceded by strange signs in the
  heavens. To cite just one or such queer cases:</p>
<p>Thousands of New Yorkers stared in amaze (sic) at the western horizon one night early in 1898. Pulsating angrily
  against a dead black sky hung something that looked like a firy (sic) red sword whose point seemed to drip blood. The
  flaring apparition was not a comet or a meteor. For many minutes it swung above the horizon dazzlingly visible. Later
  some people declared the "sword" was merely an eccentric reflection of a great fire cast on the clouds. Others tried
  to explain it as northern lights. There were a dozen explanations, all of them different. The superstitious believed
  it was a mystic portent of the Spanish War, which was about to wake our peace-loving Nation to conflict after
  thirty-three years of calm. War followed almost at once. War--and victory.</p>
<p>Late in <time>1872</time> the night was made brilliant more than once by a whizzing mass of fireballs, which might
  have been supposed to be ordinary meteors if they had not been far brighter and infinitely more numerous than a meteor
  flight. Superstition felt itself justified, in the panic which soon afterward swept the whole country, spreading
  financial ruin and suicide and chaos.</p>
<p>En <time>1861</time> une comète sinistre, claire à travers (sic) les cieux et
  remplissant la nuit avec une unearthly radiance, ushered in the first year of our Civil War. The next year--when
  things looked darkest for our country--a similar comet blazed nightly. And, almost at once, the Nation's fortunes took
  a turn for the better, preparing for the victory that was to follow.</p>
<p>A flaming comet known for years to astronomers as "the great comet," was causing no end of fear and conjecture when
  our Mexican War broke out; another war, by the way, which led to victory. </p>

    peak every 33
    years, as the orbit of the Earth intersects a more densely populated region of the stream of cometary debris which
    is responsible for the shower.

<p>Les cieux de novembre, en <time>1799</time>, furent aglare avec ce qui est encore mentionné comme <q>la pluie de
  feu</q>. Whether this dizzyingly bright swirl of aerial flames was merely a wholesale flight of meteors or whether it
  had other cause, our brief war with France was won a few months later. George Washington, by the way, died less than a
  month after this rain of fire. And many insisted the celestial pyrotechnics were a portent of his death. </p>
<p>En 1770 un corps lumineux fircely (sic) sprang into view in the night skies. It was described as "having a head which
  appeared about four times the diameter of the moon." It may have been a comet (one was recorded that year, but our
  superstitious ancestors looked on it as a portent. And presently the supposed "portent" was justified. For in a few
  weeks came the first bloodshed of the dawning Revolution at the Boston massacre of December, 1770--a massacre that the
  actual preliminary bout of the conflict which was to bring us freedom and victory!</p>
<p>Tecumseh, le sachem indien mystique, chercha à combiner toutes les tribus de son peuple à l'ouest contre les
  Etats-Unis dans la guerre de <time>1812</time>. Lorsque le conseil des sous-chefs hésita, il leur promis un
  <q>signe</q>. Et il tint parole. A ce jour personne ne sait comment il a pu prédire la chose qui devait se produire.
  Mais c'est un fait historique. Il dit aux chefs qu'il allait voyager jusqu'à un endroit à plus de 100 miles de
  distance du village où ils étaient en conseil. A une date donnée, dit-il, il poserait son pied et toute maison dans le
  village s'effondrerait. À la date précise qu'il avait nommée, et alors qu'il était loin, un puissant tremblement de
  terre secoua tout le village en morceaux et dévasta le pays environnant. Ce phénomène aussi fut supposé être de
  mauvaise augure. S'il l'était, ce fut en faveur de l'Oncle Sam's, pas de Tecumseh. Car les Etats-Unis gagnèrent la
  guerre et Tecumseh fut tué.</p>
<p>So much for our own land, tho (sic) many another so-called sign is on the record in American history and
  tradition.</p>
<p>Every one recalls the story of King Constantine, founder of Constantinople, who changed the story of the world and of
  Christianity because of a sign he saw in the midnight sky. He was fighting a horde of heathen, most of whom were the
  Germans and of other Central Powers of today. When these heathen were pre-sing his tired army most perilously
  Constantine looked up into the sky one night and beheld there a firy (sic) cross. His army gazed at it in dismay, tho
  (sic) various modern astronomers have found various explanations for the miracle. At the same time, so he declared,
  Constantine heard a voice whispering, "In hoc signo vinces!" (Through this sign you shall conquer!*) He adopted the
  cross as his standard and it led him to victory.</p>
<p>On the night before another world-changing event--the murder of Julius Ceasar (sic)--Rome was rent by an earthquake,
  weird flashed of light blazed athwart the sky and a huge lion strode across the portice of the Capitol. (There was
  nothing ghostly, perhaps, about the lion. During the earthquake his cage in the Coliseum menagerie might well have
  fallen apart and let him escape.)</p>
<p>All history is starred with similar instances of heavenly portents, &amp;c--portents followed by some epoch-making
  event. Any one who takes stock in these things may beel relieved to know that, in our country, such signs have
  generally preceded a stroke of grand good luck to American arms.</p>
