<p class="abstract">Belgian Returns from Congo with a Story of Tracking Down a Brontosaurus.</p>
<p>Copyright, 1919, by The New York Times Company. Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES</p>
<p>LONDON, Dec. 12.--Details of the alleged discovery of a survivor of the prehistoric Brontosaurus are given in a
  delayed Reuter message from Bulawayo by the Belgian prospector and big game hunter, M. Gapelle, who has returned there
  from the interior of the Congo States. He followed up strange footprints for twelve miles and at length, he says,
  sighted a beast of the rhinoceros order with large scales reaching far down its body. </p>
<p>The animal, he says, has a very thick kangaroo-like tail, a horn on its snout and a hump on its back, Gapelle fired
  some shots at the beast which then threw up its head and disappeared into the swamp. It was pointed out that the
  American Smithonian expedition was in search of the monster referred to above when the members of the party met with a
  railway accident inwhich several persons were killed.</p>
<p>Discussing the Smithsonian expedition yesterday Dr. G. F. Harmer, director of the zoological section of the British
  Museum of Natural History, while keeping an open mind said:</p>
<p>"I should doubt strongly the survival of any of the race of Dinosaurs, the enormous creatures belong to so remote an
  age. In the forest and swamp of untrodden portions of Africa there are probably remarkable specimens of unknown
  beasts, but the likelyhood is they are mammals of a much later type. The discovery in modern times of remains of
  extinct animals has all been of creatures comparatively recently extinct. It was only at the beginning of the last
  century that the great auk became extinct, and the dodo, which was living on Mauritius, was not of so greatly remote a
  period as the Dinosaur or Brontosaurus. The remains of the mammoths were in a similar category, namely, mammals of a
  recent period."</p>
