<p>(From the Central News Port Elizabeth correspondent)</p>
<p>The head of the local museum here has received information from a M. Lepage, who is in charge of railway construction
  in the Belgian Congo, of an exciting adventure last month. While Lepage was hunting one day in October he came upon an
  extraordinary monster, which charged at him. Lepage fired but was forced to flee, with the monster in chase. The
  animal before long gave up the chase and Lepage was able to examine it through binoculars. The animal, he says, was
  about 24 ft. in length with a long pointed snout adorned with tusks like horns and a short horn above the nostrils.
  The front feet were like those of a horse and the hind hoofs were cloven. There was a scaly hump on the monster's
  shoulders.</p>
<p>The animal later charged through the native village of Fungurume, destroying the huts and killing some native
  dwellers. A hunt was at once organized but the Government has forbidden the molestation of the animal, on the grounds
  that it is probably a relic of antiquity. There is a wild trackless region in the neighbourhood which contains many
  swamps and marshes, where, says the head of the museum, it is possible that a few primeval monsters may survive."
