<p>Une procession de damnés.</p>
<p>Par damnés, je veux dire exclus.</p>
<p>Nous aurons une procession de données que la <a href="/science/index.html">Science</a> a exclu.</p>
<p>Des battalions de maudits, dirigées par les données blafardes que j'ai exhumées, marcheront. Vous les lirez — ou
  elles marcheront. Certaines d'entre elles livides, certaines flamboyantes et d'autres pourries.</p>
<p>Certains sont des corps, squelettes, momies, se convulsant, chancelants, animées par des compagnons qui les ont
  damnés vivants. Des géants marcheront à côté, though sound asleep. Des choses qui sont des théorèmes et des choses qui
  sont des farces : elles passeront à côté comme Euclide bras dessus-bras dessous dans un esprit d'anarchie. Ici et là
  papilloneront de petites courtisanes. Nombre d'entre eux sont des clowns. Mais beaucoup sont de la plus haute
  respectabilité. Certains sont des assassins. There are pale stenches and gaunt superstitions and mere shadows and
  lively malices: whims and amiabilities. The naïve and the pedantic and the bizarre and the grotesque and the sincere
  and the insincere, the profound and the puerile.</p>
<p>A stab and a laugh and the patiently folded hands of hopeless propriety.

</p>
<p>The ultra-respectable, but the condemned, anyway.

</p>
<p>The aggregate appearance is of dignity and dissoluteness: the aggregate voice is a defiant prayer: but the spirit of
  the whole is processional.

</p>
<p>The power that has said to all these things that they are damned, is Dogmatic Science.

</p>
<p>But they'll march.

</p>
<p>The little harlots will caper, and freaks will distract attention, and the clowns will break the rhythm of the whole
  with their buffooneries — but the solidity of the procession as a whole: the impressiveness of things that pass and
  pass and pass, and keep on and keep on and keep on coming.</p>
<p>The irresistibleness of things that neither threaten nor jeer nor defy, but arrange themselves in mass-formations
  that pass and pass and keep on passing.

<p>Donc, par damnés, je veux dire rejetés. </p>
<p>Mais par rejetés je veux dire qui seront un jour ceux qui excluent.

</p>
<p>Or everything that is, won't be.

</p>
<p>And everything that isn't, will be —</p>
<p>But, of course, will be that which won't be —</p>
<p>It is our expression that the flux between that which isn't and that which won't be, or the state that is commonly
  and absurdly called "existence," is a rhythm of heavens and hells: that the damned won't stay damned; that salvation
  only precedes perdition. The inference is that some day our accursed tatterdemalions will be sleek angels. Then the
  sub-inference is that some later day, back they'll go whence they came.


</p>
<hr width="5%"/>
<p>Notre expression est que rien ne peut tenter d'être, sauf à tenter d'exclure quelque chose d'autre : que ce qui est
  habituellement appelé un "être" est un état forgé de manière plus ou moins définie, proportionnellement à l'apparence
  de différences claires entre ce qui est inclus et ce qui est exclus.
</p>
<p>Mais notre expression est qu'il n'existe pas de différences claires : que toutes les choses sont comme une souris et
  un insecte au coeur d'un fromage. Une souris et un insecte : aucun autre couple de choses ne semblerait plus
  improbable. Ils sont là une semaine, ou ils restent là un mois : tous deux ne sont alors que des transmutations du
  fromage. Je pense que nous sommes tous des insectes et des souris, et que nous ne sommes que des expressions
  différentes d'un fromage qui inclut tout.
</p>
<p>Ou que ce rouge n'est pas foncièrement différent du jaune : il n'est qu'un autre degré de ce que le jaune est d'une
  vibration quelconque : que le rouge et le jaune sont continus, ou qu'ils se rejoignent dans l'orange.
</p>
<p>Donc alors que, si, sur la base de la qualité jaune et la qualité rouge, la Science devait essayer de classer tous
  les phénomènes, y compris toutes les choses rouges comme véritables, et exclure toutes les choses jaunes comme fausses
  et irréelles, la démarcation serait fausse et arbitraire, parce que des choses colorées orange, constituant la
  continuité, seraient des deux côtés de la démarcation proposée.

</p>
<p>En avançant, nous seront impressionnés par ceci :

</p>
<p>Il n'y a pas de fondement à classer, inclure et exclure, plus raisonnable que n'a jamais été inventé celui d'une
  qualité rouge et d'une qualité jaune.

</p>
<p>La Science a, sur la base de divers fondements, inclut une multitude de données. Si elle ne l'avait pas fait, il n'y
  aurait pas de quoi avoit l'air d'être. La Science a, sur la base de divers fondements, exclut une multitude de
  données. Alors, si la qualité rouge est continue avec la qualité jaune : si tout fondement pour admettre est continu
  avec tout fondement pour exclure, la Science doit avoir exclu des choses qui sont continues avec ce qui est accepté.
  Dans les qualités de rouge et de jaune, qui se rejoignent dans la qualité d'orange, nous caractérisons tous les tests,
  tous les standards, tous les moyens de former une opinion —</p>
<p>Or that any positive opinion upon any subject is illusion built upon the fallacy that there are positive differences
  to judge by —</p>
<p>That the quest of all intellection has been for something — a fact, a basis, a generalization, law, formula, a major
  premise that is positive: that the best that has ever been done has been to say that some things are self-evident —
  whereas, by evidence we mean the support of something else —</p>
<p>That this is the quest; but that it has never been attained; but that Science has acted, ruled, pronounced, and
  condemned as if it had been attained.

</p>
<p>What is a house?

</p>
<p>It is not possible to say what anything is, as positively distinguished from anything else, if there are no positive
  differences.

</p>
<p>A barn is a house, if one lives in it. If residence constitutes houseness, because style of architecture does not,
  then a bird's nest is a house: and human occupancy is not the standard to judge by, because we speak of dogs' houses;
  nor material, because we speak of snow houses of Eskimos — or a shell is a house to a hermit crab — or was to the
  mollusk that made it — or things seemingly so positively different as the White House at Washington and a shell on the
  sea-shore are seen to be continuous.
</p>
<p>So no one has ever been able to say what electricity is, for instance. It isn't anything, as positively distinguished
  from heat or magnetism or life. Metaphysicians and theologians and biologists have tried to define life. They have
  failed, because, in a positive sense, there is nothing to define: there is no phenomenon of life that is not, to some
  degree, manifest in chemism, magnetism, astronomic motions.

</p>
<p>White coral islands in a dark blue sea.

</p>
<p>Their seeming of distinctness: the seeming of individuality, or of positive difference one from another — but all are
  only projections from the same sea bottom. The difference between sea and land is not positive. In all water there is
  some earth: in all earth there is some water.

</p>
<p>So then that all seeming things are not things at all, if all are inter-continuous, any more than is the leg of a
  table a thing in itself, if it is only a projection from something else: that not one of us is a real person, if,
  physically, we're continuous with environment; if, psychically, there is nothing to us but expression of relation to
  environment.

</p>
<p>Our general expression has two aspects:

</p>
<p>Conventional monism, or that all "things" that seem to have identity of their own are only islands that are
  projections from something underlying, and have no real outlines of their own.

</p>
<p>But that all "things," though only projections, are projections that are striving to break away from the underlying
  that denies them identity of their own.

</p>
<p>I conceive of one inter-continuous nexus, in which and of which, all seeming things are only different expressions,
  but in which all things are localizations of one attempt to break away and become real things, or to establish entity
  or positive difference or final demarcation or unmodified independence — or personality or soul, as it is called in
  human phenomena—</p>
<p>That anything that tries to establish itself as a real, or positive, or absolute system, government, organization,
  self, soul, entity, individuality, can so attempt only by drawing a line about itself, or about the inclusions that
  constitute itself, and damning or excluding, or breaking away from, all other "things":

</p>
<p>That, if it does not so act, it can not seem to be;

</p>
<p>That, if it does so act, it falsely and arbitrarily and futilely and disastrously acts, just as would one who draws a
  circle in the sea, including a few waves, saying that the other waves, with which the included are continuous, are
  positively different, and stakes his life upon maintaining that the admitted and the damned are positively different.

</p>
<p>Our expression is that our whole existence is animation of the local by an ideal that is realizable only in the
  universal:

</p>
<p>That, if all exclusions are false, because always are included and excluded continuous: that if all seeming of
  existence perceptible to us is the product of exclusion, there is nothing that is perceptible to us that really is:
  that only the universal can really be.</p>
<p>Our especial interest is in modern science as a manifestation of this one ideal or purpose or process:

</p>
<p>That it has falsely excluded, because there are no positive standards to judge by: that it has excluded things that,
  by its own pseudostandards, have as much right to come in as have the chosen.

</p>
<hr width="5%"/>
<p>Our general expression:

</p>
<p>That the state that is commonly and absurdly called "existence," is a flow, or a current, or an attempt, from
  negativeness to positiveness, and is intermediate to both.

</p>
<p>By positiveness we mean:

</p>
<p>Harmony, equilibrium, order, regularity, stability, consistency, unity, realness, system, government, organization,
  liberty, independence, soul, self, personality, entity, individuality, truth, beauty, justice, perfection,
  definiteness —</p>
<p>That all that is called development, progress, or evolution is movement toward, or attempt toward, this state for
  which, or for aspects of which, there are so many names, all of which are summed up in the one word "positiveness."

</p>
<p>At first this summing up may not be very readily acceptable. At first it may seem that all these words are not
  synonyms: that "harmony" may mean "order," but that by "independence," for instance, we do not mean "truth," or that
  by "stability" we do not mean "beauty," or "system," or "justice."

</p>
<p>I conceive of one inter-continuous nexus, which expresses itself in astronomic phenomena, and chemic, biologic,
  psychic, sociologic: that it is everywhere striving to localize positiveness: that to this attempt in various fields
  of phenomena — which are only quasi-different — we give different names. We speak of the "system" of the planets, and
  not of their "government": but in considering a store, for instance, and its management, we see that the words are
  interchangeable. It used to be customary to speak of chemic equilibrium, but not of social equilibrium: that false
  demarcation has been broken down. We shall see that by all these words we mean the same state. As every-day
  conveniences, or in terms of common illusions, of course, they are not synonyms. To a child an earth worm is not an
  animal. It is to a biologist.

</p>
<p>By "beauty," I mean that which seems complete.

</p>
<p>Obversely, that the incomplete, or the mutilated, is the ugly.

</p>
<p>Venus de Milo.

</p>
<p>To a child she is ugly.</p>
<p>When a mind adjusts to thinking of her as a completeness, even though, by physiologic standards, incomplete, she is
  beautiful.

</p>
<p>A hand thought of only as a hand, may seem beautiful.

</p>
<p>Found on a battlefield — obviously a part — not beautiful.

</p>
<p>But everything in our experience is only a part of something else that in turn is only a part of still something else
  — or that there is nothing beautiful in our experience: only appearances that are intermediate to beauty and ugliness
  — that only universality is complete: that only the complete is the beautiful: that every attempt to achieve beauty is
  an attempt to give the local the attribute of the universal.</p>
<p>By stability, we mean the immovable and the unaffected. But all seeming things are only reactions to something else.
  Stability, too, then, can be only the universal, or that besides which there is nothing else. Though some things seem
  to have — or have — higher approximations to stability than have others, there are, in our experience, only various
  degrees of intermediateness to stability and instability. Every man, then, who works for stability under its various
  names of "permanency," "survival," "duration," is striving to localize in something the state that is realizable only
  in the universal.</p>
<p>By independence, entity, and individuality, I can mean only that besides which there is nothing else, if given only
  two things, they must be continuous and mutually affective, if everything is only a reaction to something else, and
  any two things would be destructive of each other's independence, entity, or individuality.

</p>
<p>All attempted organizations and systems and consistencies, some approximating far higher than others, but all only
  intermediate to Order and Disorder, fail eventually because of their relations with outside forces. All are attempted
  completenesses. If to all local phenomena there are always outside forces, these attempts, too, are realizable only in
  the state of completeness, or that to which there are no outside forces.

</p>
<p>Or that all these words are synonyms, all meaning the state that we call the positive state —</p>
<p>That our whole "existence" is a striving for the positive state.

</p>
<p>The amazing paradox of it all:

</p>
<p>That all things are trying to become the universal by excluding other things.

</p>
<p>That there is only this one process, and that it does animate all expressions, in all fields of phenomena, of that
  which we think of as one inter-continuous nexus:

</p>
<p>The religious and their idea or ideal of the soul. They mean distinct, stable entity, or a state that is independent,
  and not mere flux of vibrations or complex of reactions to environment, continuous with environment, merging away with
  an infinitude of other interdependent complexes.

</p>
<p>But the only thing that would not merge away into something else would be that besides which there is nothing else.

</p>
<p>That Truth is only another name for the positive state, or that the quest for Truth, is the attempt to achieve
  positiveness:

</p>
<p>Scientists who have thought that they were seeking Truth, but who were trying to find out astronomic, or chemic, or
  biologic truths. But Truth is that besides which there is nothing: nothing to modify it, nothing to question it,
  nothing to form an exception: the all-inclusive, the complete —</p>
<p>By Truth I mean the Universal.

</p>
<p>So chemists have sought the true, or the real, and have always failed in their endeavors, because of the outside
  relations of chemical phenomena: have failed in the sense that never has a chemical law, without exceptions, been
  discovered: because chemistry is continuous with astronomy, physics, biology — For instance, if the sun should greatly
  change its distance from this earth, and if human life could survive, the familiar chemic formulas would no longer
  work out: a new science of chemistry would have to be learned —</p>
<p>Or that all attempts to find Truth in the special are attempts to find the universal in the local.

</p>
<p>And artists and their striving for positiveness, under the name of "harmony" — but their pigments that are oxydizing,
  or are responding to a deranging environment — or the strings of musical instruments that are differently and
  disturbingly adjusting to outside chemic and thermal and gravitational forces — again and again this oneness of all
  ideals, and that it is the attempt to be, or to achieve, locally, that which is realizable only universally. In our
  experience there is only intermediateness to harmony and discord. Harmony is that besides which there are no outside
  forces.

</p>
<p>And nations that have fought with only one motive: for individuality, or entity, or to be real, final nations, not
  subordinate to, or parts of, other nations. And that nothing but intermediateness has ever been attained, and that
  history is record of failures of this one attempt, because there always have been outside forces, or other nations
  contending for the same goal.

</p>
<p>As to physical things, chemic, mineralogic, astronomic, it is not customary to say that they act to achieve Truth or
  Entity, but it is understood that all motions are toward Equilibrium: that there is no motion except toward
  Equilibrium, of course always away from some other approximation to Equilibrium.

</p>
<p>All biologic phenomena act to adjust: there are no biologic actions other than adjustments.

</p>
<p>Adjustment is another name for Equilibrium. Equilibrium is the Universal, or that which has nothing external to
  derange it.

</p>
<p>But that all that we call "being" is motion: and that all motion is the expression, not of equilibrium, but of
  equilibrating, or of equilibrium unattained: that life-motions are expressions of equilibrium unattained: that all
  thought relates to the unattained: that to have what is called being in our quasi-state, is not to be in the positive
  sense, or is to be intermediate to Equilibrium and Inequilibrium.
</p>
<p>So then:

</p>
<p>That all phenomena in our intermediate state, or quasi-state, represent this one attempt to organize, stabilize,
  harmonize, individualize — or to positivize, or to become real:

</p>
<p>That only to have seeming is to express failure or intermediateness to final failure and final success;

</p>
<p>That every attempt — that is observable — is defeated by Continuity, or by outside forces — or by the excluded that
  are continuous with the included:

</p>
<p>That our whole "existence" is an attempt by the relative to be the absolute, or by the local to be the universal.

</p>
<p>In this book, my interest is in this attempt as manifested in modern science:

</p>
<p>That it has attempted to be real, true, final, complete, absolute:

</p>
<p>That, if the seeming of being, here, in our quasi-state, is the product of exclusion that is always false and
  arbitrary, if always are included and excluded continuous, the whole seeming system, or entity, of modern science is
  only quasi-system, or quasi-entity, wrought by the same false and arbitrary process as that by which the still less
  positive system that preceded it, or the theological system, wrought the illusion of its being.

</p>
<p>In this book, I assemble some of the data that I think are of the falsely and arbitrarily excluded.
</p>
<p>The data of the damned.

</p>
<p>I have gone into the outer darkness of scientific and philosophical transactions and proceedings, ultra-respectable,
  but covered with the dust of disregard. I have descended into journalism. I have come back with the quasi-souls of
  lost data.

</p>
<p>They will march.

</p>
<hr width="5%"/>
<p>As to the logic of our expressions to come —</p>
<p>That there is only quasi-logic in our mode of seeming:

</p>
<p>That nothing ever has been proved —</p>
<p>Because there is nothing to prove.

</p>
<p>When I say that there is nothing to prove, I mean that to those who accept Continuity, or the merging away of all
  phenomena into other phenomena, without positive demarcations one from another, there is, in a positive sense, no one
  thing. There is nothing to prove.

</p>
<p>For instance nothing can be proved to be an animal — because animalness and vegetableness are not positively
  different. There are some expressions of life that are as much vegetable as animal, or that represent the merging of
  animalness and vegetableness. There is then no positive test, standard, criterion, means of forming an opinion. As
  distinct from vegetables, animals do not exist. There is nothing to prove. Nothing could be proved to be good, for
  instance. There is nothing in our "existence" that is good, in a positive sense, or as really outlined from evil. If
  to forgive be good in times of peace, it is evil in wartime. There is nothing to prove: good in our experience is
  continuous with, or is only another aspect of evil.

</p>
<p>As to what I am trying to do now — I accept only. If I can't see universally, I only localize.</p>
<p>So, of course then, that nothing ever has been proved:

</p>
<p>That theological pronouncements are as much open to doubt as ever they were, but that, by a hypnotizing process, they
  became dominant over the majority of minds in their era;

</p>
<p>That, in a succeeding era, the laws, dogmas, formulas, principles, of materialistic science never were proved,
  because they are only localizations simulating the universal; but that the leading minds of their era of dominance
  were hypnotized into more or less firmly believing them.

</p>
<p>Newton's three laws, and that they are attempts to achieve positiveness, or to defy and break Continuity, and are as
  unreal as are all other attempts to localize the universal:</p>
<p>That, if every observable body is continuous, mediately or immediately, with all other bodies, it can not be
  influenced only by its own inertia, so that there is no way of knowing what the phenomena of inertia may be; that, if
  all things are reacting to an infinitude of forces, there is no way of knowing what the effects of only one impressed
  force would be; that if every reaction is continuous with its action, it can not be conceived of as a whole, and that
  there is no way of conceiving what it might be equal and opposite to —</p>
<p>Or that Newton's three laws are three articles of faith;

</p>
<p>Or that demons and angels and inertias and reactions are all mythological characters;

</p>
<p>But that, in their eras of dominance, they were almost as firmly believed in as if they had been proved.

</p>
<p>Enormities and preposterousnesses will march.

</p>
<p>They will be "proved" as well as Moses or Darwin or Lyell ever "proved" anything.


</p>
<hr width="5%"/>
<p>We substitute acceptance for belief.

</p>
<p>Cells of an embryo take on different appearances in different eras.

</p>
<p>The more firmly established, the more difficult to change.

</p>
<p>That social organism is embryonic.

</p>
<p>That firmly to believe is to impede development.

</p>
<p>That only temporarily to accept is to facilitate.

</p>
<hr width="5%"/>
<p>But:

</p>
<p>Except that we substitute acceptance for belief, our methods will be the conventional methods; the means by which
  every belief has been formulated and supported: or our methods will be the methods of theologians and savages and
  scientists and children. Because, if all phenomena are continuous, there can be no positively different methods. By
  the inconclusive means and methods of cardinals and fortune tellers and evolutionists and peasants, methods which must
  be inconclusive, if they relate always to the local, and if there is nothing local to conclude, we shall write this
  book.

</p>
<p>If it function as an expression of its era, it will prevail.

</p>

<p>All sciences begin with attempts to define.

</p>
<p>Nothing ever has been defined.

</p>
<p>Because there is nothing to define.</p>
<p>Darwin wrote "The Origin of Species" <span class="source"> Darwin, Charles: <em>On the Origin of Species by Natural Selection, </em>Londres, 1859</span>.
</p>
<p>He was never able to tell what he meant by a "species"

  <span class="note">It is not possible to define Darwin did not provide a definition of species in his famous book, as he realized each
naturalist was prone to use species and variety according to their own prejudices. In a letter to
Leonard Jenyns, on October 17, 1846, Darwin wrote: "Andrew Smith once declared he would get
some hundreds of specimens of larks &amp; sparrows from all parts of Great Britain &amp; see whether
with finest measurements he c<sup>d</sup> detect any proportional variations in beaks or limbs &amp;c. This point
interests me from having lately been skimming over the absurdly opposite conclusions of Glöger
&amp; Brehm; the one making half-a-dozen species out of every common bird &amp; the other turning so
many reputed species into one." As another example of such prejudices, the dog and wolf can
produce fertile offspring, yet they are still identified as different species; thus, if the production of
fertile offspring were used as a test to indicate membership within a species, would it not then be
indicated that dogs (Canis familiaris), wolves (Canis lupus, Canis rufus), jackals (Canis aureus),
foxes (Vulpes fulva), coyotes (Canis latrans), and dingoes (Canis dingo) are but different varieties,
races, or sub-species, of one very diverse species? John Hunter suggested this long ago for dogs,
wolves, foxes, and jackals. In one of his notebooks, Darwin wrote: "Definition of Species: one
that remains &lt;&lt;at large&gt;&gt; with constant characters, together with other &lt;animals&gt; beings of very
near structure. — Hence species may be very good ones &amp; differ scarcely in any external
character: — For instance two wrens forced to haunt two islands one with one kind of herbage &amp;
one with other, might change organization of stomach &amp; hence remain distinct." Charles Darwin.

<p>Nothing has ever been finally found out.

</p>
<p>Because there is nothing final to find out.

</p>
<p>It's like looking for a needle that no one ever lost in a haystack that never was —</p>
<p>But that all scientific attempts really to find out something, whereas really there is nothing to find out, are
  attempts, themselves, really to be something.

</p>
<p>A seeker of Truth. He will never find it. But the dimmest of possibilities — he may himself become Truth.

</p>
<p>Or that science is more than an inquiry:

</p>
<p>That it is a pseudo-construction, or a quasi-organization: that it is an attempt to break away and locally establish
  harmony, stability, equilibrium, consistency, entity —</p>
<p>Dimmest of possibilities — that it may succeed.


</p>
<p>That ours is a pseudo-existence, and that all appearances in it partake of its essential fictitiousness —</p>
<p>But that some appearances approximate far more highly to the positive state than do others.

</p>
<p>We conceive of all "things" as occupying gradations, or steps in series between positiveness and negativeness, or
  realness and unrealness: that some seeming things are more nearly consistent, just, beautiful, unified, individual,
  harmonious, stable — than others.

</p>
<p>We are not realists. We are not idealists. We are intermediatists — that nothing is real, but that nothing is unreal:
  that all phenomena are approximations one way or the other between realness and unrealness.</p>
<p>So then:

</p>
<p>That our whole quasi-existence is an intermediate stage between positiveness and negativeness or realness and
  unrealness.

</p>
<p>Like purgatory, I think.

</p>
<p>But in our summing up, which was very sketchily done, we omitted to make clear that Realness is an aspect of the
  positive state.

</p>
<p>By Realness, I mean that which does not merge away into something else, and that which is not partly something else:
  that which is not a reaction to, or an imitation of, something else. By a real hero, we mean one who is not partly a
  coward, or whose actions and motives do not merge away into cowardice. But, if in Continuity, all things do merge, by
  Realness, I mean the Universal, besides which there is nothing with which to merge.

</p>
<p>That, though the local might be universalized, it is not conceivable that the universal can be localized: but that
  high approximations there may be, and that these approximate successes may be translated out of Intermediateness into
  Realness — quite as, in a relative sense, the industrial world recruits itself by translating out of unrealness, or
  out of the seemingly less real imaginings of inventors, machines which seem, when set up in</p>
<p>factories, to have more of Realness than they had when only imagined.

</p>
<p>That all progress, if all progress is toward stability, organization, harmony, consistency, or positiveness, is the
  attempt to become real.

</p>
<p>So, then, in general metaphysical terms, our expression is that, like a purgatory, all that is commonly called
  "existence," which we call Intermediateness, is quasi-existence, neither real nor unreal, but expression of attempt to
  become real, or to generate for or recruit a real existence.

</p>
<p>Our acceptance is that Science, though usually thought of so specifically, or in its own local terms, usually
  supposed to be a prying into old bones, bugs, unsavory messes, is an expression of this one spirit animating all
  Intermediateness: that, if Science could absolutely exclude all data but its own present data, or that which is
  assimilable with the present quasi-organization, it would be a real system, with positively definite outlines — it
  would be real.

</p>
<p>Its seeming approximation to consistency, stability, system — positiveness or realness — is sustained by damning the
  irreconcilable or the unassimilable —</p>
<p>All would be well.
</p>
<p>All would be heavenly —</p>
<p>If the damned would only stay damned.</p>
