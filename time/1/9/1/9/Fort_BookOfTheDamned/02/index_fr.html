<p>A l'automne <time>1883</time>, et durant des années après, occurred brilliant-colored sunsets, such as had never been
  seen before, within the memory of all observers. Also there were blue moons.</p>
<p>Je pense that one is likely to smile incredulously at the notion of blue moons. Nevertheless they were as common as
  were green suns in <time>1883</time>.</p>

<p>I suppose, in Alaska and in the South Sea Islands, all the medicine men were similarly upon trial.

</p>
<p>Something had to be thought of.

</p>
<p>Upon the 28th of August, 1883, the volcano of Krakatoa, of the Straits of Sunda, had blown up <span class="note">The principal eruptions occurred between August 26 and 28, with the most powerful
explosions being measured upon the 27th; and, by the morning of the 28th, the steamship <em>Batavia</em> reported that the northern part of Krakatau had disappeared.</span>
  <span class="source">Tom Simkin and Richard S. Fiske. <em>Krakatau 1883: The Volcanic Eruption and Its Effects.</em> Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution
Press, 1983; 44, 215. </span>.</p>
<p>Terrific.

</p>
<p>We're told that the sound was heard 2,000 miles, and that 36,380 persons were killed. Seems just a little
  unscientific, or impositive, to me: marvel to me we're not told 2,163 miles and 36,387 persons. The volume of smoke
  that went up must have been visible to other planets ― or, tormented with our crawlings and scurryings, the earth
  complained to Mars; swore a vast black oath at us <span class="source">Sounds attributed to the eruptions of Krakatau were noticed at Rodriguez Island (4653 km.
away), at Daly Waters, South Australia (3252 km. away), and at Diego Garcia (3374 km. away);
all being more than 2,000 miles away. The number of fatalities would exceed the "36,380" deaths
of non-Europeans reported from five residencies of the Dutch East Indies; there were another 37
Europeans reported as fatalities; thus, there were at least 36,417 deaths reported by the Dutch
government. Ibid, 146, 218-9, 370, 374.</span>.</p>
<p>In all text-books that mention this occurrence — no exception so far so I have read ― it is said that the
  extraordinary atmospheric effects of 1883 were first noticed in the last of August or the first of September.</p>
<p>That makes a difficulty for us.

</p>
<p>It is said that these phenomena were caused by particles of volcanic dust that were cast high in the air by Krakatoa.

</p>
<p>This is the explanation that was agreed upon in 1883 ―

</p>
<p>But for seven years the atmospheric phenomena continued ―

</p>
<p>Except that, in the seven, there was a lapse of several years ― and where was the volcanic dust all that time ? <span
    class="note">It is now, as it was in 1888, considered
that the atmospheric effects produced by Krakatau's
eruptions persisted until 1886, when "things had returned to their
normal condition." Ibid, 397-418. Although Krakatau may have been
responsible for some of the most spectacular of the
atmospheric effects, its predominant contribution may not have been
exclusive, before its May and
August eruptions in 1883 and after 1886. The eruption of Etna in May of
1886 produced
afterglows through that summer. And, the eruptions of Bandaisan in
Japan, and of Ritter Island in
the Bismarck Archipelago, in 1888, and the eruption of Bogoslov in the
Aleutians, in 1890, may
have been responsible for atmospheric effects following the lapse
identified by Fort. H.H. Lamb.

</p>
<p>You'd think that such a question as that would make trouble?

</p>
<p>Then you haven't studied hypnosis. You have never tried to demonstrate to a hypnotic that a table is not a
  hippopotamus. According to our general acceptance, it would be impossible to demonstrate such a thing. Point out a
  hundred reasons for saying that a hippopotamus is not a table: you'll end up agreeing that neither is a table a table
  ― it only seems to be a table. Well, that's what the hippopotamus seems to be. So how can you prove that something is
  not something else, when neither is something else some other thing? There's nothing to prove.

</p>
<p>This is one of the profundities that we advertised in advance.

</p>
<p>You can oppose an absurdity only with some other absurdity. But Science is established preposterousness. We divide
  all intellection: the obviously preposterous and the established.

</p>
<p>But Krakatoa: that's the explanation that the scientists gave. I don't know what whopper the medicine men told.

</p>
<p>We see, from the start, the very strong inclination of science to deny, as much as it can, external relations of this
  earth.

</p>
<p>This book is an assemblage of data of external relations of this earth. We take the position that our data have been
  damned, upon no consideration for individual merits or demerits, but in conformity with a general attempt to hold out
  for isolation of this earth. This is attempted positiveness. We take the position that science can no more succeed
  than, in a similar endeavor, could the Chinese, or than could the United States. So then, with only
  pseudo-consideration of the phenomena of 1883, or as an expression of positivism in its aspect of isolation, or
  unrelatedness, scientists have perpetrated such an enormity as suspension of volcanic dust seven years in the air ―
  disregarding the lapse of several years ― rather than to admit the arrival of dust from somewhere beyond this earth.
  Not that scientists themselves have ever achieved positiveness, in its aspect of unitedness, among themselves ―
  because Nordenskiold, before 1883, wrote a great deal upon his theory of cosmic dust, and Prof. Cleveland Abbe
  contended against the Krakatoan explanation ― but that this is the orthodoxy of the main body of scientists <span
      class="note">Nordenskiöld provides information upon
six instances of dust that he collected from snow
and ice, which he attributed to extra-terrestrial origin: (1) in
December of 1871, snow from a
heavy snowfall at Stocklholm yielded a black powder with grains of
magnetic iron; (2) in March
of 1872, snow melted by his brother, Karl Nordenskiöld, at Evois,
Finland, yielded a residue of
black powder with metallic iron; (3) on August 8, and September 2, of
1872, a layer of snow at
Spitzbergen yielded a black residue with black grains, magnetic
particles, iron, cobalt, and nickel;
(4) hail melted after a storm in Stockholm in the autumn of 1873
yielded black metallic particles
and cobalt, which Nordenskiöld did not believe resulted from hail
striking neighbouring roofs; (5)
in July of 1870, inland ice from Greenland yielded a dust containing
grains of metallic iron, with
cobalt, and a "main mass" which was "drenched through with an
ill-smelling organic substance";
although Nordenskiöld identified this Greenland dust as "Kryokonite," a
crystalline, double-refracting silicate, this claim was later disputed
by Alfred Lacroix, who claimed the material was
terrestrial dust of granitic origin; et, (6) le 13 août 1878,  the <em>Vega</em> collected snow contenant des cristaux jaunes sur certaines banquises dans la Mer de Kara, sur le côté nord de la Russie, qui fut par la suite analysée comme contenant du carbonate de chaux, bien que les cristaux jaunes ne se dissolvent dans l'eau qu'une fois chauffés.</span>

<p>My own chief reason for indignation here:

</p>
<p>That this preposterous explanation interferes with some of my own enormities.

</p>
<p>It would cost me too much explaining, if I should have to admit that this earth's atmosphere has such sustaining
  power.

</p>
<p>Later, we shall have data of things that have gone up in the air and that have stayed up ― somewhere ― weeks ― months
  ― but not by the sustaining power of the earth's atmosphere. For instance, the turtle of Vicksburg. It seems to me
  that it would be ridiculous to think of a good-sized turtle hanging, for three or four months, upheld only by the air,
  over the town of Vicksburg. When it comes to the horse and the barn ― I think that they'll be classics some day, but I
  can never accept that a horse and a barn could float several months in this earth's atmosphere <span class="source">"Remarkable hail." <em>Monthly Weather Review,</em> 22 (May 1894): 215. <em>Monthly Weather

<p>The orthodox explanation:

</p>
<p>See the <em>Report of the Krakatoa Committee of the Royal Society</em>. It comes out absolutely for the orthodox
  explanation ― absolutely and beautifully, also expensively. There are 492 pages in the "Report," and 40 plates, some
  of them marvellously colored <span class="source">George James Symons, ed. <em>The Eruption of Krakatoa, and Subsequent Phenomena.</em> London: Trübner &amp; Co., 1888. There are actually 494 pages and 43 plates in this "Report."</span>.
  It was issued after an investigation that took five years. You couldn't think of anything done more efficiently,
  artistically, authoritatively. The mathematical parts are especially impressive: distribution of the dust of Krakatoa;
  velocity of translation and rates of subsidence; altitudes and persistences ―</p>

<p>Hailstones, for instance. One reads in the newspapers of hailstones the size of hens' eggs. One smiles. Nevertheless
  I will engage to list one hundred instances, from the <em>Monthly Weather Review,</em> of hailstones the size of hens'
  eggs. There is an account in <em>Nature,</em> Nov. 1, 1894, of hailstones that weighed almost two pounds each <span

<p>I fear me, I fear me: this is one of the profoundly damned. I blurt out something that should, perhaps, be withheld
  for several hundred pages ― but that damned thing was the size of an elephant <span class="source">George Buist. "Hailstorms in India, from June 1850 to May 1851." <em>Annual Report of the

<p>About one hundred years ago, if anyone was so credulous as to think that stones had ever fallen from the sky, he was
  reasoned with:

</p>
<p>In the first place there are no stones in the sky:

</p>
<p>Therefore no stones can fall from the sky.

</p>
<p>Or nothing more reasonable or scientific or logical than that could be said upon any subject. The only trouble is the
  universal trouble: that the major premise is not real, or is intermediate somewhere between realness and unrealness.

</p>
<p>In 1772, a committee, of whom Lavoisier was a member, was appointed by the French Academy, to investigate a report
  that a stone had fallen from the sky at Luce, France. Of all attempts at positiveness, in its aspect of isolation, I
  don't know of anything that has been fought harder for than the notion of this earth's unrelatedness. Lavoisier
  analyzed the stone of Luce. The exclusionists' explanation at that time was that stones do not fall from the sky: that
  luminous objects may seem to fall, and that hot stones may be picked up where a luminous object seemingly had landed ―
  only lightning striking a stone, heating, even melting it <span class="source">Lazarus Fletcher. <em>An Introduction to the Study of Meteorites.</em> 11th ed. London: British
Museum Trustees, 1914, 19-20. Antoine Lavoisier. "Rapport sur une pierre qu'on prétend ètre
tombée du cil pendant un orage." 6 vols. <em>Oeuvres de Lavoisier.</em> Paris: Imprimerie Impériale,
1868, v. 4, 40-5.</span>.</p>
<p>The stone of Luce showed signs of fusion.

</p>
<p>Lavoisier's analysis "absolutely proved" that this stone had not fallen: that it had been struck by lightning.

</p>
<p>So, authoritatively, falling stones were damned. The stock means of exclusion remained the explanation of lightning
  that was seen to strike something ― that had been upon the ground in the first place.

</p>
<p>But positiveness and the fate of every positive statement. It is not customary to think of damned stones raising an
  outcry against a sentence of exclusion, but, subjectively, aerolites did ― or data of them bombarded the walls raised
  against them ―

</p>
<p><em>Monthly Review,</em> 1796-426 <span class="source">"Remarks concerning stones said to have fallen from the clouds...." <em>Monthly Review,</em> 21
(December 1796): 425-7. Correct quote: "...will probably seem, to most persons, to be as little
worthy...."</span> :<a href="#N_16_"></a></p>
<p>"The phenomenon which is the subject of the remarks before us will seem to most persons as little worthy of credit as
  any that could be offered. The falling of large stones from the sky, without any assignable cause of their previous
  ascent, seems to partake so much of the marvellous as almost entirely to exclude the operation of known and natural
  agents. Yet a body of evidence is here brought to prove that such events have actually taken place, and we ought not
  to withhold from it a proper degree of attention."

</p>
<p>The writer abandons the first, or absolute, exclusion, and modifies it with the explanation that the day before a
  reported fall of stones in Tuscany, June 16, 1794, there had been an eruption of Vesuvius ―

</p>
<p>Or that stones do fall from the sky, but that they are stones that have been raised to the sky from some other part
  of the earth's surface by whirlwinds or by volcanic action.

</p>
<p>It's more than one hundred and twenty years later. I know of no aerolite that has ever been acceptably traced to
  terrestial origin <span class="source"><em>Sic,</em> terrestrial. Some tektites are now believed to be terrestrial material, which was ejected
into outer space from the earth as a result of a major meteorite impact and which later re-entered
the earth's atmosphere as tektites.</span>.</p>
<p>Falling stones had to be undamned ― though still with a reservation that held out for exclusion of outside forces.

</p>
<p>One may have the knowledge of a Lavoisier, and still not be able to analyze, not be able even to see, except
  conformably with the hypnoses, or the conventional reactions against hypnoses, of one's era.

</p>
<p>We believe no more.

</p>
<p>We accept.

</p>
<p>Little by little the whirlwind and volcano explanations had to be abandoned, but so powerful was this
  exclusion-hypnosis, sentence of damnation, or this attempt at positiveness, that far into our own times some
  scientists, notably Prof. Lawrence Smith and Sir Robert Ball, continued to hold out against all external origins,
  asserting that nothing could fall to this earth, unless it had been cast up or whirled up from some other part of the
  earth's surface <span class="note">Ball believed that meteorites were the product of volcanoes discharged into outer space, and
in seeking to identify their origins, he eliminated by deduction the sun, moon, and other (major
and minor planets), except for earth's distant past. "This theory, that the meteorites have originated
