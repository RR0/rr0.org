<p>Ainsi donc, it is our expression that Science relates to real knowledge no more than does the growth of a plant, or
  the organization of a department store, or the development of a nation: that all are assimilative, or organizing, or
  systematizing processes that represent different attempts to attain the positive state ? the state commonly called
  heaven, I suppose I mean. </p>
<p>There can be no real science where there are indeterminate variables, but every variable is, in finer terms,
  indeterminate, or irregular, if only to have the appearance of being in Intermediateness is to express regularity
  unattained. The invariable, or the real and stable, would be nothing at all in Intermediateness ? rather as, but in
  relative terms, an undistorted interpretation of external sounds in the mind of a dreamer could not continue to exist
  in a dreaming mind, because that touch of relative realness would be of awakening and not of dreaming. Science is the
  attempt to awaken to realness, wherein it is attempt to find regularity and uniformity. Or the regular and uniform
  would be that which has nothing external to disturb it. By the universal we mean the real. Or the notion is that the
  underlying super-attempt, as expressed in Science, is indifferent to the subject-matter of Science: that the attempt
  to regularize is the vital spirit. Bugs and stars and chemical messes: that they are only quasi-real, and that of them
  there is nothing real to know; but that systemization of pseudo-data is approximation to realness or final awakening ?

</p>
<p>Or a dreaming mind ? and its centaurs and canary birds that turn into giraffes ? there could be no real biology upon
  such subjects, but attempt, in a dreaming mind, to systematize such appearances would be movement toward awakening ?
  if better mental co-ordination is all that we mean by the state of being awake ? relatively awake.

</p>
<p>So it is, that having attempted to systematize, by ignoring externality to the greatest possible degree, the notion
  of things dropping in upon this earth, from externality, is as unsettling and as unwelcome to Science as ? tin horns
  blowing in upon a musician's relatively symmetric composition ? flies alighting upon a painter's attempted harmony,
  and tracking colors one into another ? suffragist getting up and making a political speech at a prayer meeting.

</p>
<p>If all things are of a oneness, which is a state intermediate to unrealness and realness, and if nothing has
  succeeded in breaking away and establishing entity for itself, and could not continue to "exist" in intermediateness,
  if it should succeed, any more than could the born still at the same time be the uterine, I of course know of no
  positive difference between Science and Christian Science ? and the attitude of both toward the unwelcome is the same
  ? "it does not exist."

</p>
<p>A Lord Kelvin and a Mrs. Eddy, and something not to their liking ? it does not exist.

</p>
<p>Of course not, we Intermediates say: but, also, that, in Intermediateness, neither is there absolute non-existence.

</p>
<p>Or a Christian Scientist and a toothache ? neither exists in the final sense: also neither is absolutely
  non-existent, and, according to our therapeutics, the one that more highly approximates to realness will win.

</p>
<p>A secret of power ?

</p>
<p>I think it's another profundity.

</p>
<p>Do you want power over something?

</p>
<p>Be more nearly real than it.

</p>
<p>Nous commencerons avec les substances jaunes qui sont tombées sur cette terre : nous verrons si nos données à leur
  sujet ont une approximation de réalité plus élevée que ne l'ont les dogmes de ceux qui contestent leur existence ?
  c'est-à-dire, comme produits d'un endroit extérieur à cette terre.

</p>
<p>In mere impressionism we take our stand. We have no positive tests nor standards. Realism in art: realism in science
  ? they pass away. In 1859, the thing to do was to accept Darwinism; now many biologists are revolting and trying to
  conceive of something else. The thing to do was to accept it in its day, but Darwinism of course was never proved:

</p>
<p>The fittest survive.

</p>
<p>What is meant by the fittest?

</p>
<p>Not the strongest; not the cleverest ?

</p>
<p>Weakness and stupidity everywhere survive.

</p>
<p>There is no way of determining fitness except in that a thing does survive.

</p>
<p>"Fitness," then, is only another name for "survival."</p>
<p>Darwinism:

</p>
<p>That survivors survive.

</p>
<p>Although Darwinism, then, seems positively baseless, or absolutely irrational, its massing of supposed data, and its
  attempted coherence approximate more highly to Organization and Consistency than did the inchoate speculations that
  preceded it.

</p>
<p>Or that Columbus never proved that the earth is round.

</p>
<p>Shadow of the earth on the moon?

</p>
<p>No one has ever seen it in its entirety. The earth's shadow is much larger than the moon. If the periphery of the
  shadow is curved ? but the convex moon ? a straight-edged object will cast a curved shadow upon a surface that is
  convex.

</p>
<p>All the other so-called proofs may be taken up in the same way. It was impossible for Columbus to prove that the
  earth is round. It was not required: only that with a higher seeming of positiveness than that of his opponents, he
  should attempt. The thing to do, in 1492, was nevertheless to accept that beyond Europe, to the west, were other
  lands.

</p>
<p>I offer for acceptance, as something concordant with the spirit of this first quarter of the 20th century, the
  expression that beyond this earth are ? other lands ? from which come things as, from America, float things to Europe.

</p>
<p>Quant aux substances jaunes qui sont tombées sur cette terre, l'entreprise d'exclure des origines extra-terrestres
  est le dogme que toutes les <a href="../../../../../../pluies/index.html">pluies</a> jaunes et neiges jaunes sont
  colorées de pollen des pins de cette terre. Le <em>Symons' Meteorological Magazine</em> est particulièrement prude à
  cet égard et considère comme très incorrectes toutes autres explications avancées <span class="source">Par exemple, voir : J.W. Moore: "Pollen showers", <em>Meteorological magazine</em>, 14 (juillet 1879),
p. 96.</span>.</p>
<p>Néanmoins, la <em>Monthly Weather Review</em> de <span class="mois">mai</span> 1877 rapporte une <a
    href="../../../../../../pluies/index.html">pluie</a> jaune-dorée du <time>27</time> <span
    class="mois">février</span> 1877, à Peckloh (Allemagne), où 4 types d'organismes, pas de pollen, constituaient la
  matière colorante. Il y avait des choses notées comme étant des flèches, des grains de café, des cornes et des disques
  <span class="source">"The somewhat rare phenomenon....", <em>Monthly weather review</em>, mai 1877, 11.</span>.</p>
<p>Il s'agissait peut-être des symboles. Il s'agissait peut-être de hiéroglyphes objectifs ?

</p>
<p>Mere passing fancy ? let it go ?

</p>
<p>In the <em>Annales de Chimie</em>, 85-288, there is a list of rains said to have contained sulphur <span
    class="source">Marcel de Serres. "Sur la chute des pierres, or sur les aérolithes." <em>Annales de chimie</em>, s.1, 85(
1813): 262-308 at 288. For an English translation of this article: Marcel de Serres. "Observations
on the fall of stones from the clouds, or aerolites." <em>Philosophical magazine</em>, s.1, 44 (1814): 217-224, 253-260.</span>.
  I have thirty or forty other notes. I'll not use one of them. I'll admit that every one of them is upon a fall of
  pollen. I said, to begin with, that our methods would be the methods of theologians and scientists, and they always
  begin with an appearance of liberality. I grant thirty or forty points to start with. I'm as liberal as any of them ?
  or that my liberality won't cost me anything ? the enormousness of the data that we shall have.</p>
<p>Or just to look over a typical instance of this dogma, and the way it works out:

</p>
<p>Dans le <em>American Journal of Science</em>, 1-42-196, on nous parle d'une substance jaune qui tomba par pelletées
  sur un navire, par une nuit <q>sans vent</q> en <span class="mois">juin</span>, à Pictou Harbour, Nouvelle Ecosse.
  L'auteur analysa la substance, et trouva qu'elle <q>émanait de l'azote et de l'ammoniac et une odeur animale</q><span
      class="source"> "Yellow showers of pollen", <em>American journal of science</em>, s.1, 42 (1842): 195-197. Pour l'article auquel il est fait référence dans cette citation : "Lycopodium", <em>American journal of science</em>, s.1, 39 (1840),
p. 399.</span>.</p>
<p>Now, one of our Intermediatist principles, to start with, is that so far from positive, in the aspect of
  Homogeneousness, are all substances, that, at least in what is called an elementary sense, anything can be found
  anywhere. Mahogany logs on the coast of Greenland; bugs of a valley on top of Mt. Blanc; atheists at a prayer meeting;
  ice in India <span class="source">The bug on Mont Blanc was a <em>Plusia gamma.</em> Albert Müller. "On the dispersal of non-migrating insects by atmospheric agencies." <em>Transactions of the Royal Entomological Society of
London,</em> 1871, 175-186, at 184. For the mahogany logs in Greenland: William Scoresby, Jr. <em>An
Account of the Arctic Regions</em>. Edinburgh: A. Constable &amp; Co., 1820. 2 vols., v. 1, 6-8. And:
John Barrow. <em>A Chronological History of Voyages into the Arctic Regions.</em> London: John Murray,
1818, 334.</span>. For instance, chemical analysis can reveal that almost any dead man was poisoned with arsenic, we'll
  say, because there is no stomach without some iron, lead, tin, gold, arsenic in it and of it ? which, of course, in a
  broader sense, doesn't matter much, because a certain number of persons must, as a restraining influence, be executed
  for murder every year; and, if detectives aren't able really to detect anything, illusion of their success is all that
  is necessary, and it is very honorable to give up one's life for society as a whole.</p>
<p>The chemist who analyzed the substance of Pictou sent a sample to the Editor of the <em>Journal.</em> The Editor of
  course found pollen in it.

</p>
<p>My own acceptance is that there'd have to be some pollen in it: that nothing could very well fall through the air, in
  June, near the pine forests of Nova Scotia, and escape all floating spores of pollen. But the Editor does not say that
  this substance "contained" pollen. He disregards "nitrogen and ammonia, and an animal odor," and says that the
  substance was pollen. For the sake of our thirty or forty tokens of liberality, or pseudo-liberality, if we can't be
  really liberal, we grant that the chemist of the first examination probably wouldn't know an animal odor if he were
  janitor of a menagerie. As we go along, however, there can be no such sweeping ignoring of this phenomenon:

</p>
<p>The fall of animal-matter from the sky.</p>
<p>I'd suggest, to start with, that we'd put ourselves in the place of deep-sea fishes:

</p>
<p>How would they account for the fall of animal-matter from above?

</p>
<p>They wouldn't try ?

</p>
<p>Or it's easy enough to think of most of us as deep-sea fishes of a kind.

</p>
<p>Que, <time>14</time> <span class="mois">février</span> 1870, tomba, à Gênes (Italie), selon le directeur Boccardod
  de l'Institut Technique de Gênes, et le professeur Castellani, une substance jaune. Mais le microscope révéla de
  nombreux globules de bleu cobalt, également des corpuscles d'une couleur perlière qui ressemblaient à de l'amidon.

  :</p>
<p>M. Bouis dit d'une substance, rougeâtre variante au jaunâtre, qui tomba énormément et successivement, les 30 avril,
  1er et 2 mai, en France et Espagne, qu'elle carbonisa et dégagea une odeur de matière animale brûlée ? que ce n'était
  pas du pollen ? que dans l'alcool elle laissait un résidu de matière résineuse.

</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of tons of this matter must have fallen.

</p>
<p>"Odor of charred animal matter."

</p>
<p>Or an aerial battle that occurred in inter-planetary space several hundred years ago ? effect of time in making
  diverse remains uniform in appearance ?

</p>
<p>It's all very absurd because, even though we are told of a prodigious quantity of animal matter that fell from the
  sky ? three days ? France and Spain ? we're not ready yet: that's all. M. Bouis says that this substance was not
  pollen; the vastness of the fall makes acceptable that it was not pollen; still, the resinous residue does suggest
  pollen of pine trees. We shall hear a great deal of a substance with a resinous residue that has fallen from the sky:
  finally we shall divorce it from all suggestion of pollen.

<p>Loud noises were heard in the sky.

</p>
<p>Stones fell from the sky.

</p>
<p>According to Chladni, these concomitants occurred, and to me they seem ? rather brutal? ? or not associable with

<p>Black rains and black snows ? rains as black as a deluge of ink ? jet-black snowflakes. </p>
<p>Such a rain as that which fell in Ireland, May 14, 1849, described in the <em>Annals of Scientific Discovery,</em>
  1850, and the <em>Annual Register,</em> 1849 <span class="source">"Black rain in Ireland." <em>Annual of Scientific Discovery,</em> 1850, 348. "April 14. Curious

Society." <em>Dublin Freeman's Journal</em>, May 1, 1849, p.3 c.2-3.</span>. It fell upon a district of 400 square
  miles, and was the color of ink, and of a fetid odor and very disagreeable taste.</p>

    class="source">"Shower of black rain." <em>American Meteorological Journal,</em> 4 (September 1887): 193.</span>.
</p>
<p>A black rain fell in Ireland, Oct. 8 and 9, 1907. (<em>Symons' Met. Mag.,</em> 43-2) <span class="source">"Black rain in Ireland, October 8th-9th, 1907." Symons' <em>Meteorological Magazine,</em> 43, 2-4.</span>.
  It left a "most peculiar and disagreeable smell in the air."</p>
<p>The orthodox explanation of this rain occurs in <em>Nature,</em> March 2, 1908 ? cloud of soot that had come from
  South Wales, crossing the Irish Channel and all of Ireland <span class="source">"Notes." <em>Nature,</em> 77 (March 12, 1908): 442-6, at 445.</span>.
</p>
<p>So the black rain of Ireland, of March, 1898: ascribed in <em>Symons' Met. Mag.,</em> 33-40, to clouds of soot from
  the manufacturing towns of North England and South Scotland <span class="source">John Ringwood. "Black rain." Symons' <em>Meteorological magazine</em>, 33, 40-41. The date of this
rain was March 30, 1898.</span>.</p>
<p>Our Intermediatist principle of pseudo-logic, or our principle of Continuity is, of course, that nothing is unique,
  or individual: that all phenomena merge away into all other phenomena: that, for instance ? suppose there should be
  vast super-oceanic, or inter-planetary vessels that come near this earth and discharge volumes of smoke at times.
  We're only supposing such a thing as that now, because, conventionally, we are beginning modestly and tentatively. But
  if it were so, there would necessarily be some phenomenon upon this earth, with which that phenomenon would merge.
  Extra-mundane smoke and smoke from cities merge, or both would manifest in black precipitations in rain.

</p>
<p>In Continuity, it is impossible to distinguish phenomena at their merging-points, so we look for them at their
  extremes. Impossible to distinguish between animal and vegetable in some infusoria ? but hippopotamus and violet. For
  all practical purposes they're distinguishable enough. No one but a Barnum or a Bailey would send one a bunch of
  hippopotami as a token of regard.

</p>
<p>So away from the great manufacturing centers:</p>
<p>Black rain in Switzerland, Jan. 20, 1911. Switzerland is so remote, and so ill at ease is the conventional
  explanation here, that <em>Nature,</em> 85-451, says of this rain that in certain conditions of weather, snow may take
  on an appearance of blackness that is quite deceptive <span class="source">"Notes." <em>Nature</em>, 85 (February 2, 1911): 448-453, at 451. Fort marked "X" next to the first
line, which probably was due to the date of January 20 being identified as the date of the snow fall
rather than the date when the London <em>Morning Post</em> reported its occurrence of a recent black rain
in the Lower Emmen Valley.</span>.</p>
<p>May be so. Or at night, if dark enough, snow may look black. This is simply denying that a black rain fell in
  Switzerland, Jan. 20, 1911.

</p>
<p>Extreme remoteness from the great manufacturing centers:

</p>
<p><em>La Nature,</em> 1888, 2-406 <span class="source">"Une pluie d'encre", <em>Nature</em> (Paris), 1888 v.2 (24 novembre), p. 406.</span>
  :<a href="#N_18_"></a></p>
<p>That Aug. 14, 1888, there fell at the Cape of Good Hope, a rain so black as to be described as a "shower of ink."

</p>
<p>Continuity dogs us. Continuity rules us and pulls us back. We seemed to have a little hope that by the method of
  extremes we could get away from things that merge indistinguishably into other things. We find that every departure
  from one merger is entrance upon another. At the Cape of Good Hope, vast volumes of smoke from great manufacturing
  centers, as an explanation, can not very acceptably merge with the explanation of extra-mundane origin ? but smoke
  from a terrestial volcano can, and that is the suggestion that is made in <em>La Nature <span class="source">Sic, <em>terrestrial</em> volcano.</span>.</em>
</p>
<p>There is, in human intellection, no real standard to judge by, but our acceptance, for the present, is that the more
  nearly positive will prevail. By the more nearly positive we mean the more nearly Organized. Everything merges away
  into everything else, but proportionately to its complexity, if unified, a thing seems strong, real, and distinct: so,
  in aesthetics, it is recognized that diversity in unity is higher beauty, or approximation to Beauty, than is simpler
  unity; so the logicians feel that agreement of diverse data constitute greater convincingness, or strength, than that
  of mere parallel instances: so to Herbert Spencer the more highly differentiated and integrated is the more fully
  evolved. Our opponents hold out for mundane origin of all black rains. Our method will be the presenting of diverse
  phenomena in agreement with the notion of some other origin. We take up not only black rains but black rains and their
  accompanying phenomena.

</p>
<p>A correspondent to <em>Knowledge,</em> 5-190, writes of a black rain that fell in the Clyde Valley, March 1, 1884: of
  another black rain that fell two days later <span
      class="source">Lewis P. Muirhead. "Meteoric dust." <em>Knowledge,</em> 5 (March 21, 1884): 190.</span>. According
  to the correspondent, a black rain had fallen in the Clyde Valley, March 20, 1828: then again March 22, 1828.
  According to <em>Nature,</em> 9-43, a black rain fell at Marls- ford, England, Sept. 4, 1873; more than twenty-four
  hours later another black rain fell in the same small town <span class="source">E. Highton. "Black rains and dew ponds." <em>Nature,</em> 9 (November 20, 1873): 43.</span>.
</p>
<p>The black rains of Slains:

</p>
<p>According to Rev. James Rust (<em>Scottish Showers</em>) <span class="source">James Rust. <em>The Scottish Black Rain Showers and Pumicestone Shoals of the Year 1862
and 1863.</em> Edinburgh: William Blackwood and Sons, 1864. "The Scottish showers and shoals"
appears on the page ahead of the title page.</span> :<a href="#N_22_"></a></p>
<p>A black rain at Slains, Jan. 14, 1862 ? another at Carluke, 140 miles from Slains, May 1, 1862 ? at Slains, May 20,
  1862 ? Slains, Oct. 28, 1863.

</p>
<p>But after two of these showers, vast quantities of a substance described sometimes as "pumice stone," but sometimes
  as "slag," were washed upon the sea coast near Slains. A chemist's opinion is given that this substance was slag: that
  it was not a volcanic product: slag from smelting works. We now have, for black rains, a concomitant that is
  irreconcilable with origin from factory chimneys. Whatever it may have been the quantity of this substance was so
  enormous that, in Mr. Rust's opinion, to have produced so much of it would have required the united output of all the
  smelting works in the world. If slag it were, we accept that an artificial product has, in enormous quantities, fallen
  from the sky. If you don't think that such occurrences are damned by Science, read <em>Scottish Showers</em> and see
  how impossible it was for the author to have this matter taken up by the scientific world.

</p>
<p>The first and second rains corresponded, in time, with ordinary ebullitions of Vesuvius.

</p>
<p>The third and fourth, according to Mr. Rust, corresponded with no known volcanic activities upon this earth <span
    class="note">Rust writes: "I have heard nothing respecting that state of Vesuvius corresponding to the
most recent of the Showers of Black Rain, ? namely, that one which fell on 28th October, 1863."
Although Vesuvius had been active until December 31, 1861, it was apparently not in eruption
again until February of 1864; and, Etna, which was not active since May of 1853, became active
from July 7 to 25, 1863, and again in August of 1864. The attempt to correlate the black rains
with the eruptions of these volcanoes would appear spurious. However, Fort does not mention
Rust's speculation upon a relation with the brilliant meteors seen in January of 1862, including: "a
large fiery ball" over Slains on January 14, at 9 p.m., (the date of the first black rain, which
occurred from about 9:30 a.m. to 10 a.m.). Ibid, 43, 47.</span> <span class="source">Tom Simkin et al. <em>Volcanoes of the

(30 mars 1872): 267.</span> <span class="note">The copy of Rust's book, which belonged to the U.S. Weather Bureau had
the following inscription on its back page: "Forty `showers' at least have been observed and
published in various periodicals, as they fell. J.R." A similar inscription was written upon the copy
in the New York Public Library: "Since these showers there have been more than 40 additional
showers of Black Rain attested and publicly notified in various Periodicals. JR."</span> :<a href="#N_24_"></a></p>
<p>That between October, 1863, and January, 1866, four more black rains fell at Slains, Scotland.

</p>
<p>The writer of this supplementary account tells us, with a better, or more unscrupulous, orthodoxy than Mr. Rust's,
  that of the eight black rains, five coincided with eruptions of Vesuvius and three with eruptions of Etna.

</p>
<p>The fate of all explanation is to close one door only to have another fly wide open. I should say that my own notions
  upon this subject will be considered irrational, but at least my gregariousness is satisfied in associating here with
  the preposterous ? or this writer, and those who think in his rut, have to say that they can think of four discharges
  from one far-distant volcano, passing over a great part of Europe, precipitating nowhere else, discharging precisely
  over one small northern parish ?

</p>
<p>But also of three other discharges, from another far-distant volcano, showing the same precise preference, if not
  marksmanship, for one small parish in Scotland.

</p>
<p>Nor would orthodoxy be any better off in thinking of exploding meteorites and their debris: preciseness and
  recurrence would be just as difficult to explain.

</p>
<p>My own notion is of an island near an oceanic trade-route: it might receive debris from passing vessels seven times
  in four years.

<p>Red rains.

</p>
<p>Orthodoxy:

</p>
<p>Sand blown by the sirocco, from the Sahara to Europe.

</p>
<p>Especially in the earthquake regions of Europe, there have been many falls of red substance, usually, but not always,
  precipitated in rain. Upon many occasions, these substances have been "absolutely identified" as sand from the Sahara.
  When I first took this matter up, I came across assurance after assurance, so positive to this effect, that, had I not
  been an Intermediatist, I'd have looked no further. Samples collected from a rain at Genoa ? samples of sand forwarded
  from the Sahara ? "absolute agreement" some writers said: same color, same particles of quartz, even the same shells
  of diatoms mixed in. Then the chemical analyses: not a disagreement worth mentioning.

</p>
<p>Our intermediatist means of expression will be that, with proper exclusions, after the scientific or theological
  method, anything can be identified with anything else, if all things are only different expressions of an underlying
  oneness.

</p>
<p>To many minds there's a rest and there's satisfaction in that expression "absolutely identified." Absoluteness, or
  the illusion of it ? the universal quest. If chemists have identified substances that have fallen in Europe as sand
  from African deserts, swept up in African whirlwinds, that's assuasive to all the irritations that occur to those
  cloistered minds that must repose in the concept of a snug, isolated, little world, free from contact with cosmic
  wickednesses, safe from stellar guile, undisturbed by inter-planetary prowlings and invasions. The only trouble is
  that a chemist's analysis, which seems so final and authoritative to some minds, is no more nearly absolute than is
  identification by a child or description by an imbecile ?

</p>
<p>I take some of that back: I accept that the approximation is higher ?

</p>
<p>But that it's based upon delusion, because there is no definiteness, no homogeneity, no stability, only different
  stages somewhere between them and indefiniteness, heterogeneity, and instability. There are no chemical elements. It
  seems acceptable that Ramsay and others have settled that. The chemical elements are only another disappointment in
  the quest of the positive, as the definite, the homogeneous, and the stable. If there were real elements, there could
  be a real science of chemistry <span class="note">Fort's rejection of any "real science of chemistry" based upon the work of "Ramsay and
others" is not far-fetched, considering the knowledge of its basis in Fort's time. In one aspect,
Rayleigh and Ramsay's discovery of the element argon and the "noble gases," which are
chemically inert, led Mendeleyev to state: "If we admit that the molecule of argon contains but
one atom, there is no room for it in the periodic system; because, even if we suppose that its
density is much below 20 (although this is very unlikely to be the case, and the contrary could
rather be surmised), and that the atomic weight of argon should fall between the atomic weights of
chlorine and potassium, the new body ought to be placed in the eighth group of the third series;
but the existence of an eighth group in this series could hardly be admitted." When Bertholet
claimed to have succeeded in producing a chemical reaction between argon and benzene,
Mendeleyev claimed it as support for his "supposition that argon is a polymerised variety of
nitrogen whose molecule contains N<sub>3</sub>, while ordinary nitrogen contain N<sub>2</sub>. ("Professor Mendeléeff
on argon." <em>Nature,</em> 51 (April 4, 1895): 543. Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev. <em>The Principles of
Chemistry. </em>New York: P.F. Collier and Son, 1901, "Appendix III. Argon, a new constituent of
the atmosphere," 491-9, at 498.) In another aspect, Ramsay posed the question of whether
"elements" were final products. "The substances are classified as elements solely because no
attempts to convert one into another have up till now been successful... and it has been often held
that it is not impossible that all elements may consist of a primal substance ? `protyle,' as it has
been called ? in different states of condensation." ("What is an element?" William Ramsay. <em>Essays Biographical and Chemical.</em> London: Archibald Constable &amp; Co., 1909, 147-160, at 149.)
In 1907 and 1908, Ramsay and Cameron attempted the atomic disintegration, or transmutation, of
various elements with the radiation from radioactive substances. Ramsay believed that he had
converted neon and argon from water and lithium from copper; but, with methods less likely to
involve contamination, "it is generally accepted to-day that the evidence is against the
transformations announced by Ramsay." E.N. Da C. Andrade. <em>The Structure of the Atom.</em> London: G. Bell and Sons, 1924, 57. Ramsay viewed chemistry as evolving: "This new chemistry
is just at its commencement. It dates from 1896, when Becquerel showed that compounds or
uranium evolved some sort of radiation which would impress a photographic plate. It is still too
early to formulate any definite statement relating to its connection with the irregularity in the
numerical sequence of the atomic weights; yet it may be permissable to speculate, aided by recent
discoveries." "Periodic arrangement of elements." William Ramsay. Op.Cit., 161-178, at 175.
Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom, which consisted of a single electron in orbit around a nucleus
composed of a single proton, was valid for hydrogen but not for any other element nor any
isotopes of hydrogen. Though Ramsay's experiments are now viewed as erroneous in their
outcome, Rutherford won a Nobel prize for transmuting nitrogen into oxygen; and, not until
Chadwick discovered the "neutron," for which he won a Nobel prize, did physicists and chemists
emerge from decades of delusion and reconcile the disparity between the atomic numbers and the
atomic weights in the elements. Even in giving his Nobel lecture, in 1935, Chadwick cautioned:
"It seems at present useless to discuss whether the neutron and proton are elementary particles or
not; it may be that they are two different states of the fundamental heavy particle."</span> <span class="source">Niels H. de V.

<p>Upon Nov. 12 and 13, 1902, occurred the greatest fall of matter in the history of Australia <span class="source">F. Chapman and H.J. Grayson. "On red rain with special reference to its occurrence in
Victoria. With a note on Melbourne dust." <em>Victorian Naturalist,</em> 20 (June 1903): 17-32. Also, the
fall began on November 11.</span>. Upon the 14th of November, it "rained mud," in Tasmania. It was of course attributed
  to Australian whirlwinds, but, according to the <em>Monthly Weather Review,</em> 32-365, there was a haze all the way
  to the Philippines, also as far as Hong Kong <span class="source">Andrew Noble. "Dust in the atmosphere during 1902-3." <em>Monthly Weather Review,</em> 32
(August 1904): 364-365.</span>. It may be that this phenomenon had no especial relation with the even more tremendous
  fall of matter that occurred in Europe, February, 1903.</p>
<p>For several days, the south of England was a dumping ground ? from somewhere.

</p>
<p>If you'd like to have a chemist's opinion, even though it's only a chemist's opinion, see the report of the meeting
  of the Chemical Society of London, April 2, 1903 <span class="source">Edwy Godwin Clayton. "Discoloured rain." <em>Proceedings of the (Royal) Chemical Society of
London,</em> 19, (no. 264): 101-103.</span>. Mr. E.G. Clayton read a paper upon some of the substance that had fallen
  from the sky, collected by him. The Sahara explanation applies mostly to falls that occur in southern Europe. Farther
  away, the conventionalists are a little uneasy: for instance, the editor of the <em>Monthly Weather Review,</em>
  29-121, says of a red rain that fell near the coast of Newfoundland, early in 1890: "It would be very remarkable if
  this was Sahara dust" <span class="source">"Dust storms and red rain." <em>Monthly Weather Review,</em> 29 (March 1901): 120-121.</span>.
  Mr. Clayton said that the matter examined by him was "merely wind-borne dust from the roads and lanes of Wessex." This
  opinion is typical of all scientific opinion ? or theological opinion ? or feminine opinion ? all very well except for
  what it disregards. The most charitable thing I can think of ? because I think it gives us a broader tone to relieve
  our malices with occasional charities ? is that Mr. Clayton had not heard of the astonishing extent of this fall ? had
  covered the Canary Islands, on the 19th, for instance. I think, myself, that in 1903, we passed through the remains of
  a powdered world ? left over from an ancient inter-planetary dispute, brooding in space like a red resentment ever
  since. Or, like every other opinion, the notion of dust from Wessex turns into a provincial thing when we look it
  over.</p>
<p>To think is to conceive incompletely, because all thought relates only to the local. We metaphysicians, of course,
  like to have the notion that we think of the unthinkable.

</p>
<p>As to opinions, or pronouncements, I should say, because they always have such an authoritative air, of other
  chemists, there is an analysis in <em>Nature,</em> 68-54, giving water and organic matter at 9.08 per cent <span
      class="source">T.E. Thorpe. "Red rain and the dust storm of February 22." <em>Nature,</em> 68 (May 21, 1903): 53-4.</span>.
  It's that carrying out of fractions that's so convincing. The substance is identified as sand from the Sahara.</p>
<p>The vastness of this fall. In <em>Nature,</em> 68-65, we are told that it had occurred in Ireland, too <span
    class="source">"Notes." <em>Nature,</em> 68 (May 21, 1903): 64-8, at 65.</span>. The Sahara, of course ? because,
  prior to Feb. 19, there had been dust storms in the Sahara ? disregarding that in that great region there's always, in
  some part of it, a dust storm. However, just at present, it does look reasonable that dust had come from Africa, via
  the Canaries.</p>
<p>The great difficulty that authoritativeness has to contend with is some other authoritativeness. When an
  infallibility clashes with a pontification ?

</p>
<p>They explain.

<p>Another analysis ? 36 per cent organic matter.</p>
<p>Such disagreements don't look very well, so, in <em>Nature,</em> 68-109, one of the differing chemists explains <span

  muddy rain, and the other was of sediment of rain?</p>
<p>We're quite ready to accept excuses from the most high, though I do wonder whether we're quite so damned as we were,
  if we find ourselves in a gracious and tolerant mood toward the powers that condemn ? but the tax that now comes upon
  our good manners and unwillingness to be too severe ?

<p>Another chemist. He says it was 23.49 per cent water and organic matter.

</p>
<p>He "identifies" this matter as sand from an African desert ? but after deducting organic matter ?

</p>
<p>But you and I could be "identified" as sand from an African desert, after deducting all there is to us except sand ?

</p>
<p>Why we can not accept that this fall was of sand from the Sahara, omitting the obvious objection that in most parts
  the Sahara is not red at all, but is usually described as "dazzling white" ?

</p>
<p>The enormousness of it: that a whirlwind might have carried it, but that, in that case it would be no supposititious,

the fall, though on a much smaller scale, occurred between the 25th and 27th," in England. One
curious area where dust was reported to fall came from the <em>S.S. Nubia,</em> between Spain and Africa
in the Mediterranean, on February 21; yet, Spain, Italy, and the south of France were scarcely
affected by the fall of dust. The vessel was the <em>R.M.S. Tagus.</em></span><em> </em>:<a href="#N_40_"></a></p>

  10,000,000 tons of matter had fallen. It had fallen in Switzerland, (<em>Symons' Met. Mag.,</em> March, 1903) <span

<p>The Wessex explanation ?

</p>
<p>Or that every explanation is a Wessex explanation: by that I mean an attempt to interpret the enormous in terms of
  the minute ? but that nothing can be finally explained, because by Truth we mean the Universal; and that even if we
  could think as wide as Universality, that would not be requital to the cosmic quest ? which is not for Truth, but for
  the local that is true ? not to universalize the local, but to localize the universal ? or to give to a cosmic cloud
  absolute interpretation in terms of the little dusty roads and lanes of Wessex. I can not conceive that this can be
  done: I think of high approximation.

</p>
<p>Our Intermediatist concept is that, because of the continuity of all "things," which are not separate, positive, or
  real things, all pseudo-things partake of the underlying, or are only different expressions, degrees, or aspects of
  the underlying: so then that a sample from somewhere in anything must correspond with a sample from somewhere in
  anything else.

</p>
<p>That, by due care in selection, and disregard for everything else, or the scientific and theological method, the
  substance that fell, February, 1903, could be identified with anything, or with some part or aspect of anything that
  could be conceived of ?

<p>Or there could be real science if there were really anything to be scientific about.

</p>
<p>Or the science of chemistry is like a science of sociology, prejudiced in advance, because only to see is to see with
  a prejudice, setting out to "prove" that all inhabitants of New York came from Africa.

</p>
<p>Very easy matter. Samples from one part of town. Disregard for all the rest.

</p>
<p>There is no science but Wessex-science.

</p>
<p>According to our acceptance, there should be no other, but that approximation should be higher: that metaphysics is
  super-evil: that the scientific spirit is of the cosmic quest.</p>
<p>Our notion is that, in a real existence, such a quasi-system of fables as the science of chemistry could not deceive
  for a moment: but that in an "existence" endeavoring to become real, it represents that endeavor, and will continue to
  impose its pseudo-positiveness until it be driven out by a higher approximation to realness;

</p>
<p>That the science of chemistry is as impositive as fortune-telling ?

</p>
<p>Or no ?

</p>
<p>That, though it represents a higher approximation to realness than does alchemy, for instance, and so drove out
  alchemy, it is still somewhere between myth and positiveness.

</p>
<p>The attempt at realness, or to state a real and unmodified fact here, is the statement:

</p>
<p>All red rains are colored sands from the Sahara desert.

</p>
<p>My own impositivist acceptances are:

</p>
<p>That some red rains are colored by sands from the Sahara desert;

</p>
<p>Some by sands from other terrestrial sources;

</p>
<p>Some by sands from other worlds, or from their deserts ? also from aerial regions too indefinite or amorphous to be
  thought of as "worlds" or planets ?

</p>
<p>That no supposititious whirlwind can account for the hundreds of millions of tons of matter that fell upon Australia,
  Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean and Europe in 1902 and 1903 ? that a whirlwind that could do that would not be
  supposititious.

</p>
<p>But now we shall cast off some of our wessicality by accepting that there have been falls of red substance other than
  sand.

</p>
<p>We regard every science as an expression of the attempt to be real. But to be real is to localize the universal ? or
  to make some one thing as wide as all things ? successful accomplishment of which I cannot conceive of. The prime
  resistance to this endeavor is the refusal of the rest of the universe to be damned, excluded, disregarded, to receive
  Christian Science treatment, by something else so attempting. Although all phenomena are striving for the Absolute ?
  or have surrendered to and have incorporated themselves in higher attempts, simply to be phenomenal, or to have
  seeming in Intermediateness is to express relations.

</p>
<p>A river.

</p>
<p>It is water expressing the gravitational relation of different levels.

</p>
<p>The water of the river.

</p>
<p>Expression of chemic relations of hydrogen and oxygen ? which are not final.

</p>
<p>A city.</p>
<p>Manifestation of commercial and social relations.

</p>
<p>How could a mountain be without base in a greater body?

</p>
<p>Storekeeper live without customers?

</p>
<p>The prime resistance to the positivist attempt by Science is its relations with other phenomena, or that it only
  expresses those relations in the first place. Or that a Science can have seeming, or survive in Intermediateness, as
  something pure, isolated, positively different, no more than could a river or a city or a mountain or a store.

</p>
<p>This Intermediateness-wide attempt by parts to be wholes ? which cannot be realized in our quasi-state, if we accept
  that in it the co-existence of two or more wholes or universals is impossible ? high approximation to which, however,
  may be thinkable ?

</p>
<p>Scientists and their dream of "pure science."

</p>
<p>Artists and their dream of "art for art's sake."

</p>
<p>It is our notion that if they could almost realize, that would be almost realness: that they would instantly be
  translated into real existence. Such thinkers are good positivists, but they are evil in an economic and sociologic
  sense, if, in that sense, nothing has justification for being, unless it serve, or function for, or express the
  relations of, some higher aggregate. So Science functions for and serves society at large, and would, from society at
  large, receive no support, unless it did so divert itself or dissipate and prostitute itself. It seems that by
  prostitution I mean usefulness.

</p>
<p>There have been red rains that, in the middle ages, were called "rains of blood." Such rains terrified many persons,
  and were so unsettling to large populations, that Science, in its sociologic relations, has sought, by Mrs. Eddy's
  method, to remove an evil ?

</p>
<p>That "rains of blood" do not exist;

</p>
<p>That rains so called are only of water colored by sand from the Sahara desert.

</p>
<p>My own acceptance is that such assurances, whether fictitious or not, whether the Sahara is a "dazzling white" desert
  or not, have wrought such good effects, in a sociologic sense, even though prostitutional in the positivist sense,
  they were well justified;

</p>
<p>But that we've gone on: that this is the twentieth century; that most of us have grown up so that such soporifics of
  the past are no longer necessary:

</p>
<p>That if gushes of blood should fall from the sky upon New York City, business would go on as usual.

</p>
<p>We began with rains that we accepted ourselves were, most likely, only of sand. In my own still immature
  hereticalness ? and by heresy, or progress, I mean, very largely, a return, though with many modifications, to the
  superstitions of the past, I think I feel considerable aloofness to the idea of rains of blood. Just at present, it is
  my conservative, or timid purpose, to express only that there have been red rains that very strongly suggest blood or
  finely divided animal matter ?

</p>
<p>Debris from inter-planetary disasters.

</p>
<p>Aerial battles.

</p>
<p>Food-supplies from cargoes of super-vessels, wrecked in inter-planetary traffic.

</p>
<p>There was a red rain in the Mediterranean region, March 6, 1888. Twelve days later, it fell again. Whatever this

<p>That, Nov. 2, 1819 ? week before the black rain and earthquake of Canada ? there fell, at Blankenberge, Holland, a
  red rain. As to sand, two chemists of Bruges concentrated 144 ounces of the rain to 4 ounces ? "no precipitate fell."
  But the color was so marked that had there been sand, it would have been deposited, if the substance had been diluted
  instead of concentrated. Experiments were made, and various reagents did cast precipitates, but other than sand. The
  chemists concluded that the rain-water contained muriate of cobalt ? which is not very enlightening: that could be
  said of many substances carried in vessels upon the Atlantic Ocean. Whatever it may have been, in the <em>Annales de

<p>That, according to Prof. Schwedoff, there fell, in Russia, June 14, 1880, red hailstones, also blue hailstones, also

<p>A correspondent writes that he had been told by a resident of a small town in Venezuela, that there, April 17, 1886,
  had fallen hailstones, some red, some blue, some whitish: informant said to have been one unlikely to have heard of
  the Russian phenomenon; described as an "honest, plain countryman."

<p><em>Nature,</em> July 5, 1877, quotes a Roman correspondent to the London <em>Times</em> who sent a translation from
  an Italian newspaper: that a red rain had fallen in Italy, June 23, 1877, containing "microscopically small particles
  of sand" <span
      class="source">"Notes." <em>Nature,</em> 16 (July 5, 1877): 196-8, at 197-8. "Italy." London <em>Times,</em> June 26, 1877,
p.5 c.5.</span> <span class="note">No such quotes are found here; however, in <em>Nature</em>: "The sand fell in small perfectly
spherical masses of about 1-25,000th of an inch in diameter, at a <em>maximum.</em>" Also: "...I have
washed the sky over with them, and have afterwards sluiced the paper with water from a sponge;
yet there they remain. If sand they be, that material appears to have a most unusually tenacious
affinity for the paper."</span>.</p>
<p>Or, according to our acceptance, any other story would have been an evil thing, in the sociologic sense, in Italy, in
  1877. But the English correspondent, from a land where terrifying red rains are uncommon, does not feel this
  necessity. He writes: "I am by no means satisfied that the rain was of sand and water." His observations are that
  drops of this rain left stains "such as sandy water could not leave." He notes that when the water evaporated, no sand
  was left behind.

<p>We now have a datum with a factor that has been foreshadowed; which will recur and recur and recur throughout this
  book. It is a factor that makes for speculation so revolutionary that it will have to be re-enforced many times before
  we can take it into full acceptance.
