<p>They sound like the accursed, but they're not: they're now of the chosen ― that is, when they occur in metallic or
  stony masses that Science has recognized as meteorites. We find that resistance is to substances not so mixed in or
  incorporated.</p>
<p>Of accursed data, it seems to me that punk is pretty damnable. In the <em>Report of the British Association,</em>
  1878-376, there is mention of a light chocolate-brown substance that has fallen with meteorites <span class="source">Glaisher et al. "Report on observations of luminous meteors during the year 1877-78." <em>Annual
Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,</em> 1878, 258-377, at 377.</span>. No particulars
  given; not another mention anywhere else that I can find. In this English publication, the word "punk" is not used;
  the substance is called "amadou." I suppose, if the datum has anywhere been admitted to French publications, the word
  "amadou" has been avoided, and "punk" used.</p>
<p>Or oneness of allness: scientific works and social registers: a Goldstein who can't get in as Goldstein, gets in as
  Jackson.

</p>
<p>The fall of sulphur from the sky has been especially repulsive to the modern orthodoxy ― largely because of its
  associations with the superstitions or principles of the preceding orthodoxy ― stories of devils: sulphurous
  exhalations. Several writers have said that they have had this feeling. So the scientific reactionists, who have
  rabidly fought the preceding, because it was the preceding: and the scientific prudes, who, in sheer exclusionism,
  have held lean hands over pale eyes, denying falls of sulphur. I have many notes upon the sulphurous odor of
  meteorites, and many notes upon phosphorescence of things that come from externality. Some day I shall look over old
  stories of demons that have appeared sulphurously upon this earth, with the idea of expressing that we have often had
  undesirable visitors from other worlds; or that an indication of external derivation is sulphurousness. I expect some
  day to rationalize demonology, but just at present we are scarcely far enough advanced to go so far back.

</p>
<p>For a circumstantial account of a mass of burning sulphur, about the size of a man's fist, that fell at Pultusk,
  Poland, Jan. 30, 1868, upon a road, where it was stamped out by a crowd of villagers, see <em>Rept. Brit. Assoc.,</em>
  1874-272 <span class="source">Glaisher et al. "Report on observations of luminous meteors during the year 1873-1874." <em>Annual Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,</em> 1874, 272. The fall of
this substance took place at Proschwitz, not at Pultusk; and, "on examination at Breslau some
remains of the substance proved to be pure sulphur."</span>.</p>
<p>The power of the exclusionists lies in that in their stand are combined both modern and archaic systematists <span
    class="source"><em>Sic</em>, is combined<em>.</em></span>. Falls of sandstone and limestone are repulsive to both
  theologians and scientists. Sandstone and limestone suggest other worlds upon which occur processes like geological
  processes; but limestone, as a fossiliferous substance, is of course especially of the unchosen.</p>
<p>In <em>Science,</em> March 9, 1888, we read of a block of limestone, said to have fallen near Middleburgh, Florida
  <span class="source">George F. Kunz. "A pseudo-meteorite." <em>Science,</em> n.s., 11 (March 9, 1888): 119.</span>. It
  was exhibited at the Sub-tropical Exposition, at Jacksonville. The writer, in <em>Science,</em> denies that it fell
  from the sky. His reasoning is:</p>
<p>There is no limestone in the sky;

</p>
<p>Therefore this limestone did not fall from the sky.

</p>
<p>Better reasoning I cannot conceive of ― because we see that a final major premise ― universal ― true ― would include
  all things: that, then, would leave nothing to reason about ― so then that all reasoning must be based upon
  "something" not universal, or only a phantom intermediate to the two finalities of nothingness and allness, or
  negativeness and positiveness.

</p>
<p><em>La Nature</em> 1890-2-127 <span class="source">"La pluie de pierres de Pel-et-Der." <em>Nature</em> (Paris), 1891 v. 2 (July 25): 127. The fall occurred
on June 6, 1891, (not in 1890).</span> :<a href="#N_5_"></a></p>
<p>Fall, at Pel-et-Der (L'Aube) France, June 6, 1890, of limestone pebbles. Identified with limestone at Chateau Landon
  ― or up and down in a whirlwind. But they fell with hail ― which, in June, could not very well be identified with ice
  from Chateau-Landon. Coincidence, perhaps.

</p>
<p>Upon page 70, <em>Science Gossip,</em> 1887, the Editor says, of a stone that was reported to have fallen at Little
  Lever, England, that a sample had been sent to him <span class="source">"The meteorite at Little Lever," and, "The `meteorite' at Little Lever." Hardwicke's <em>Science
Gossip,</em> 23 (1887): 70.</span>. It was sandstone. Therefore it had not fallen, but had been on the ground in the
  first place. But, upon page 140, <em>Science Gossip,</em> 1887, is an account of "a large, smooth, waterworn, gritty
  sandstone pebble" that had been found in the wood of a full-grown beech tree <span class="note">Fort marked a line under "140" and wrote "70" in the margin, to indicate an error. Samuel
Stowarth. "Stones in wood." Hardwicke's <em>Science Gossip,</em> 23 (1887): 142. Correct quote:
"...waterworn, fine gritty...."</span>. Looks to me as if it had fallen red-hot, and had penetrated the tree with high
  velocity. But I have never heard of anything falling red-hot from a whirlwind―</p>
<p>The wood around this sandstone pebble was black, as if charred.

</p>
<p>Dr. Farrington, for instance, in his books, does not even mention sandstone. However, the British Association, though
  reluctant, is less exclusive: <em>Report</em> of 1860, p. 107: substance about the size of a duck's egg, that fell at
  Raphoe, Ireland, June 9, 1860 ― date questioned <span class="source">R.P. Greg. "A catalogue of meteorites and fireballs." <em>Annual Report of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science,</em> 1860, 48-120, at 107.</span>. It is not definitely said that this substance was
  sandstone, but that it "resembled" friable sandstone.</p>
<p>Falls of salt have occurred often. They have been avoided by scientific writers, because of the dictum that only
  water and not substances held in solution, can be raised by evaporation. However, falls of salty water have received
  attention from Dalton and others, and have been attributed to whirlwinds from the sea <span class="source">John Dalton. "On the saline impregnation of the rain which fell during the late storm,
December 5th, 1822." <em>Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society Memoirs,</em> s. 2, 4 (1824):
324-31, 363-72. For attribution to a whirlwind as the source: J. Webb. "Salt hailstones." Symons' <em>Meteorological Magazine,</em> 24, 105.</span>.
  This is reasonably contested ― quasi-reasonably ― as to places not far from the sea―</p>
<p>But the fall of salt that occurred high in the mountains of Switzerland ―

</p>
<p>We could have predicted that that datum could be found somewhere. Let anything be explained in local terms of the
  coast of England ― but also has it occurred high in the mountains of Switzerland.

</p>
<p>Large crystals of salt fell ― in a hailstorm ― Aug. 20, 1870, in Switzerland. The orthodox explanation is a crime:
  whoever made it should have had his finger-prints taken. We are told (<em>An. Rec. Sci.,</em> 1872) that these objects
  of salt "came over the Mediterranean from some part of Africa" <span class="source">"Salt and pyrites in hail-stones." <em>Annual Record of Science and Industry,</em> 1871, 36-7. Correct
quote: "...brought over the Mediterranean Sea from some part of Africa...."</span>.</p>
<p>Or the hypnosis of the conventional ― provided it be glib. One reads such an assertion, and provided it be suave and
  brief and conventional, one seldom questions ― or thinks "very strange" and then forgets. One has an impression from
  geography lessons: Mediterranean not more than three inches wide, on the map; Switzerland only a few more inches away.
  These sizable masses of salt are described in the <em>Amer. Jour. Sci.</em>, 3-3-239, as "essentially imperfect cubic
  crystals of common salt" <span class="source">"Hailstones of salt and sulphide of iron." <em>American Journal of Science,</em> s.3, 3 (1872): 239.
Correct quote: "...essentially of common salt, mainly in imperfect crystals."</span>. As to occurrence with hail ― that
  can in one, or ten, or twenty instances be called a coincidence.</p>
<p>Another datum: extraordinary year 1883:

</p>
<p>London <em>Times,</em> Dec. 25, 1883 <span class="source">Henry O. Dwight. (Letter). London <em>Times,</em> December 25, 1883, p.9 c.6.</span>
  :<a href="#N_12_"></a></p>
<p>Translation from a Turkish newspaper; a substance that fell at Scutari, Dec. 2, 1883; described as an unknown
  substance, in particles ― or flakes? ― like snow. "It was found to be saltish to the taste, and to dissolve readily in
  water."

</p>
<p>Miscellaneous:

</p>
<p>"Black capillary matter" that fell, Nov. 16, 1857, at Charleston, S. C., (<em>Amer. Jour. Sci.,</em> 2-31-459) <span
    class="source">"Catalogue of the Meteoric Collection of Charles Upham Shepard...." <em>American Journal of
Science,</em> s.2, 31 (1861): 456-9.</span>.</p>
<p>Fall of small, friable, vesicular masses, from the size of a pea to size of a walnut, at Lobau, Jan. 18, 1835 (<em>Rept.
  Brit. Assoc.,</em> 1860-85) <span class="source">R.P. Greg. "A catalogue of meteorites and fireballs." <em>Annual Report of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science,</em> 1860, 48-120, at 75.</span> <span class="note">The fall occurred at Löbau.</span>.
</p>
<p>Objects that fell at Peshawur, India, June, 1893, during a storm: substance that looked like crystallized nitre, and
  that tasted like sugar (<em>Nature,</em> July 13, 1893) <span class="source">Kanhaiyalal. "Peculiar hailstones." <em>Nature,</em> 48 (July 13, 1893): 248. The fall occurred at
Peshawar, India, not at Peshawur.</span>.</p>
<p>I suppose sometimes deep-sea fishes have their noses bumped by cinders. If their regions be subjacent to Cunard or
  White Star routes, they're especially likely to be bumped. I conceive of no inquiry: they're deep-sea fishes.

</p>
<p>Or the slag of Slains. That it was a furnace-product. The Rev. James Rust seemed to feel bumped. He tried in vain to
  arouse inquiry.

</p>
<p>As to a report, from Chicago, April 9, 1879, that slag had fallen from the sky, Prof. E.S. Bastian (<em>Amer. Jour.
  Sci.,</em> 3-18-78) says that the slag had been on the ground in the first place <span class="source">E.S. Bastian. "The supposed meteorite of Chicago." <em>American Journal of Science,</em> s.3, 18
(1879): 78. Correct quote: "...has shown that they possess none of the characters of true
meteorites."</span>. It was furnace-slag. "A chemical examination of the specimens has shown they possess none of the
  characteristics of true meteorites."</p>
<p>Over and over and over again, the universal delusion; hope and despair of attempted positivism; that there can be
  real criteria, or distinct characteristics of anything. If anybody can define ― not merely suppose, like Prof.
  Bastian, that he can define ― the true characteristics of anything, or so localize trueness anywhere, he makes the
  discovery for which the cosmos is laboring. He will be instantly translated, like Elijah into the Positive Absolute.
  My own notion is that, in a moment of super-concentration, Elijah became so nearly a real prophet that he was
  translated to heaven, or to the Positive Absolute, with such velocity that he left an incandescent train behind him.
  As we go along, we shall find the "true test of meteoric material," which in the past has been taken as an absolute,
  dissolving into almost utmost nebulosity. Prof. Bastian explains mechanically, or in terms of the usual reflexes to
  all reports of unwelcome substances: that near where the slag had been found, telegraph wires had been struck by
  lightning; that particles of melted wire had been seen to fall near the slag ― which had been on the ground in the
  first place. But, according to the N. Y. <em>Times,</em> April 14, 1879, about two bushels of this substance had
  fallen <span class="source">"Chicago's celestial visitor." <em>New York Times,</em> April 14, 1879, p. 3 c. 4.</span>.
</p>
<p>Something that was said to have fallen at Darmstadt, June 7, 1846; listed by Greg (<em>Rept. Brit. Assoc.,</em>
  1867-416) as "only a slag" <span class="source">Glaisher et al. "Report on observations of luminous meteors, 1866-67." <em>Annual Report of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science,</em> 1867, 288-430, at 416.</span>.</p>
<p><em>Philosophical Magazine,</em> 4-10-381 <span class="source">Roderick Impey Murchison. "On a supposed aërolite or meteorite found in the trunk of an old
willow tree in the Battersea Fields." <em>Philosophical Magazine,</em> s. 4, 10 (1855): 381-387, at 384-5.</span> :<a
    href="#N_19_"></a></p>
<p>That, in 1855, a large stone was found far in the interior of a tree, in Battersea Fields.</p>
<p>Sometimes cannon balls are found embedded in trees. Doesn't seem to be anything to discuss; doesn't seem discussable
  that any one would cut a hole in a tree and hide a cannon ball, which one could take to bed, and hide under one's
  pillow, just as easily. So with the stone of Battersea Fields. What is there to say, except that it fell with high
  velocity and embedded in the tree? Nevertheless, there was a great deal of discussion ―

</p>
<p>Because, at the foot of the tree, as if broken off the stone, fragments of slag were found.

</p>
<p>I have nine other instances.

</p>
<p>Slag and cinders and ashes, and you won't believe, and neither will I, that they came from the furnaces of vast
  aerial super-constructions. We'll see what looks acceptable.

</p>
<p>As to ashes, the difficulties are great, because we'd expect many falls of terrestrially derived ashes ― volcanoes
  and forest fires.

</p>
<p>In some of our acceptances, I have felt a little radical ―

</p>
<p>I suppose that one of our main motives is to show that there is, in quasi-existence, nothing but the preposterous ―
  or something intermediate to absolute preposterousness and final reasonableness ― that the new is the obviously
  preposterous; that it becomes the established and disguisedly preposterous; that it is displaced, after a while, and
  is again seen to be the preposterous. Or that all progress is from the outrageous to the academic or sanctified, and
  back to the outrageous ― modified, however, by a trend of higher and higher approximation to the impreposterous.
  Sometimes I feel a little more uninspired than at other times, but I think we're pretty well accustomed now to the
  oneness of allness; or that the methods of science in maintaining its system are as outrageous as the attempts of the
  damned to break in. In the <em>Annual Record of Science,</em> 1875-241, Prof. Daubrée is quoted: that ashes that had
  fallen in the Azores had come from the Chicago fire ―

  <span class="source">"Falling of atmospheric dust in Norway, March 29 and 30, 1875." <em>Annual Record of Science
and Industry,</em> 1875, 241-2. For the original article, which mentions this as an example: Daubrée.
"Chute de poussière observée sur une partie de la Suède et de la Norvége, dans la nuit du 29 au
30 mars 1875." <em>Comptes Rendus,</em> 80 (1875): 994-5.</span></p>
<p>Or the damned and the saved, and there's little to choose between them; and angels are beings that have not obviously
  barbed tails to them ― or never have such bad manners as to stroke an angel below the waist-line.

</p>
<p>However this especial outrage was challenged: the Editor of the <em>Record</em> returns to it, in the issue of 1876:
  considers it "in the highest degree improper to say that the ashes of Chicago were landed in the Azores."

</p>
<p><em>Bull. Soc. Astro. de France,</em> 22-245 <span class="source">"Pluie de cendres." <em>Bulletin de la Société Astronomique de France,</em> 22 (1908): 244-5. The
fall occurred at Annonay, France, not  at Annoy.</span> :<a href="#N_21_"></a></p>
<p>Account of a white substance, like ashes, that fell at Annoy, France, March 27, 1908: simply called a curious
  phenomenon; no attempt to trace to a terrestrial source.

</p>
<p>Flake formations, which may signify passage through a region of pressure, are common; but spherical formations ― as
  if of things that have rolled and rolled along planar regions somewhere ― are commoner:

</p>
<p><em>Nature,</em> Jan. 10, 1884, quotes a Kimberly newspaper <span class="source">"The remarkable sunsets." <em>Nature,</em> 29 (January 10, 1884): 250-2, at 252. The shower
occurred at Glen Grey, about twelve miles from Queenstown; and, "while it lasted, we are told,
the surrounding atmosphere remained unchanged and clear, as it had been before."</span> :<a href="#N_22_"></a></p>
<p>That, toward the close of November, 1883, a thick shower of ashy matter fell at Queenstown, South Africa. The matter
  was in marble-sized balls, which were soft and pulpy, but which, upon drying, crumbled at touch. The shower was
  confined to one narrow streak of land. It would be only ordinarily preposterous to attribute this substance to
  Krakatoa ―

</p>
<p>But, with the fall, loud noises were heard ―

</p>
<p>But I'll omit many notes upon ashes: if ashes should sift down upon deep-sea fishes, that is not to say that they
  came from steamships.

</p>
<p>Data of falls of cinders have been especially damned by Mr. Symons, the meteorologist, some of whose investigations
  we'll investigate later ― nevertheless ―

</p>
<p>Notice of a fall, in Victoria, Australia, April 14, 1875 (<em>Rept. Brit. Assoc.,</em> 1875-242) ― at least we are
  told, in the reluctant way, that someone "thought" he saw matter fall near him at night, and the next day found
  something that looked like cinders <span class="source">Glaisher et al. "Report on observations of luminous meteors during the year 1874-75." <em>Annual Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,</em> 1875, 199-257, at 243-4.</span>.
</p>
<p>In the <em>Proc. of the London Roy. Soc.,</em> 19-122, there is an account of cinders that fell on the deck of a
  lightship, Jan. 9, 1873 <span class="source">Robin Allen. "Account of a meteor that fell on the `Seven Stones' lightship, in a letter from
the Secretary to the Corporation of the Trinity House, addressed to the President." <em>Proceedings of
the Royal Society of London,</em> 21 (1873): 122.</span> <span class="note">The fall occurred on November 13, 1872, and not
on January 9, 1873. After a shock, balls of fire were observed falling into the water, and the deck
of the ship was covered with cinders.</span>. In the <em>Amer. Jour. Sci.,</em> 2-24-449, there is a notice that the
  Editor had received a specimen of cinders said to have fallen ― in showery weather ― upon a farm, near Ottowa,
  Illinois, Jan. 17, 1857 <span class="source">"Supposed meteorite." <em>American Journal of Science,</em> s.2, 24 (1857): 449. The fall occurred
on June 17, 1857, at Ottawa, Illinois, not in January, nor at Ottowa.</span>.</p>
<p>But after all, ambiguous things they are, cinders or ashes or slag or clinkers, the high priest of the accursed that
  must speak aloud for us is ― coal that has fallen from the sky.

</p>
<p>Or coke:

</p>
<p>The person who thought he saw something like cinders, also thought he saw something like coke, we are told.

    href="#N_26_"></a></p>
<p>Something that "looked exactly like coke" that fell ― during a thunder storm ― in the Orne, France, April 24, 1887.

</p>
<p>Or charcoal:

</p>
<p>Dr. Angus Smith, in the <em>Lit. and Phil. Soc. of Manchester Memoirs,</em> 2-9-146, says that, about 1827 ― like a
  great deal in Lyell's <em>Principles</em> and Darwin's <em>Origin,</em> this account is from hearsay ― something fell
  from the sky, near Allport, England <span class="source">Robert Angus Smith. "Description of a meteorite which fell at Allport in Derbyshire." <em>Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society Memoirs,</em> s.2, 9 (1851): 146-8. Correct quote:
"The appearance is that of a piece of common wood charcoal...."</span>. It fell luminously, with a loud report, and
  scattered in a field. A fragment that was seen by Dr. Smith, is described by him as having "the appearance of a piece
  of common wood charcoal." Nevertheless, the reassured feeling of the faithful, upon reading this, is burdened with
  data of differences: the substance was so uncommonly heavy that it seemed as if it had iron in it; also there was "a
  sprinkling of sulphur." This material is said, by Prof. Baden-Powell, to be "totally unlike that of any other
  meteorite." Greg, in his catalogue (<em>Rept. Brit. Assoc.,</em> 1860-73) calls it "a more than doubtful substance" ―
  but again, against reassurance, this is not doubt of authenticity. Greg says that it is like compact charcoal, with
  particles of sulphur and iron pyrites embedded <span class="source">R.P. Greg. "A catalogue of meteorites and fireballs." <em>Annual Report of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science,</em> 1860, 48-120, at 72-3.</span>.</p>
<p>Reassurance rises again:

</p>
<p>Prof. Baden-Powell says: "It contains also charcoal, which might perhaps be acquired from matter among which it
  fell."

</p>
<p>This is a common reflex with the exclusionists: that substances not "truly meteoritic" did not fall from the sky, but
  were picked up by "truly meteoritic" things, of course only on their surfaces, by impact with this earth.

</p>
<p>Rhythm of reassurances and their declines:

</p>
<p>According to Dr. Smith, this substance was not merely coated with charcoal; his analysis gives 43.59 per cent carbon.

</p>
<p>Our acceptance that coal has fallen from the sky will be via data of resinous substances and bituminous substances,
  which merge so that they can not be told apart.

</p>
<p>Resinous substance said to have fallen at Kaba, Hungary, April 15, 1887 (<em>Rept. Brit. Assoc.,</em> 1860-94) <span

<p>Fall, July 28, 1885, at Luchon, during a storm, of a brownish substance; very friable, carbonaceous matter; when
  burned it gave out a resinous odor (<em>Comptes Rendus,</em> 103-837) <span class="source">Stanislas Meunier. "Substance singulière recueillie à la suite d'un météore rapporté à la
foudre." <em>Comptes Rendus,</em> 103 (1886): 837-40.</span>.</p>
<p>Substance that fell Feb. 17, 18, 19, 1841, at Genoa, Italy, said to have been resinous; said by Arago
  (<em>Oeuvres,</em> 12-469) to have been bituminous matter and sand <span
      class="note">Dominique François Jean Arago. <em>Oeuvres complètes de François Arago.</em> Paris, 1857, v.12,
469-70. Arago does not indicate this material as being resinous nor as being of sand; however, he
does give an analysis of it as a mixture of talc, quartz, carbonate of lime, serpentine, bituminous
matter, and organic matter containing seeds from different plants. </span>.</p>
<p>Fall ― during a thunderstorm ― July, 1681, near Cape Cod, upon the deck of an English vessel, the <em>Albemarle,</em>
  of "burning, bituminous matter" (<em>Edin. New Phil. Jour.,</em> 26-86); a fall at Christiana, Norway, June 13, 1822,
  of bituminous matter, listed by Greg as doubtful; fall of bituminous matter, in Germany, March 8, 1798, listed by
  Greg. Lockyer, (<em>The Meteoric Hypothesis,</em> p. 24) says that the substance that fell at the Cape of Good Hope,
  Oct. 13, 1838 ― about five cubic feet of it: substance so soft that it was cuttable with a knife ― "after being
  experimented upon, it left a residue, which gave out a very bituminous smell" <span class="source">Dominique François Jean Arago. "On thunder and lightning," <em>Edinburgh New Philosophical
Journal,</em> 26 (1839): 81-144, 275-91, at 86. Arago relates part of the story from Robert Boyle,
who provides details from the account by Increase Mather. The <em>Albemarl,</em> on July 24, about 100
leagues off Cape Cod, suffered considerably from the thunderstorm: "The lightning burnt the
main-top-sail, split the main-cap in pieces, rent the mast all along. There was in special one
dreadful clap of thunder, the report bigger than of a great gun, at which all the ship's company
were amazed; then did there fall something from the clouds upon the stern of the boat, which
broke into many small parts, split one of the pumps, the other pump much hurt also. It was a
bituminous matter, smelling much like fired gunpowder. It continued burning in the stern of the
boat; they did with sticks dissipate it, and poured much water on it, and yet they were not able by
all they could do to extinguish it, until such time as all the matter was consumed." It was
discovered in the night, when stars were again visible, that the ship's compasses had changed their
polarity. Three of the magnetic needles had reversed their direction pointing south instead of
north, while a fourth pointed west instead of north. Increase Mather. <em>Remarkable Providences.</em> London: Reeves and Turner, 1890, 64-5. Robert Boyle. Thomas Birch, ed. <em>The Works of the

<p>And this inclusion of Lockyer's ― so far as findable in all books that I have read ― is, in books, about as close as

the Alais and Cold Bokkeveld meteorites are good examples: the former has a bituminous smell; it
yields sulphates of magnesium, calcium, sodium and potassium, if steeped in water." Lazarus

<p>That the substance that fell at the Cape of Good Hope "resembled a piece of anthracite coal more than anything else."

</p>
<p>It's a mistake, I think: the resemblance is to bituminous coal ― but it is from the periodicals that we must get our
  data. To the writers of books upon meteorites, it would be as wicked ― by which we mean departure from the characters
  of an established species ― quasi-established, of course ― to say that coal has fallen from the sky, as would be, to
  something in a barnyard, a temptation that it climb a tree and catch a bird. Domestic things in a barnyard: and how
  wild things from forests outside seem to them. Ou l'<a href="/science/para/homeo">homéopathe</a> ― but we shall shovel
  data of coal.

</p>
<p>And, if over and over, we shall learn of masses of soft coal that have fallen upon this earth, if in no instance has
  it been asserted that the masses did not fall, but were upon the ground in the first place; if we have many instances,
  this time we turn down good and hard the mechanical reflex that these masses were carried from one place to another in
  whirlwinds, because we find it too difficult to accept that whirlwinds could so select, or so specialize in a peculiar
  substance. Among writers of books, the only one I know of who makes more than brief mention is Sir Robert Ball <span
      class="source">For Ball's description of the carbonaceous Orgueil meteorite: Robert Ball. <em>The Story of the
Heavens</em>. Rev. ed. New York: Cassell and Co., 1905, 398-9.</span>. He represents a still more antique orthodoxy, or
  is an exclusionist of the old type, still holding out against even meteorites. He cites several falls of carbonaceous
  matter, but with disregards that make for reasonableness that earthy matter may have been caught up by whirlwinds and
  flung down somewhere else. If he had given a full list, he would be called upon to explain the special affinity of
  whirlwinds for a special kind of coal. He does not give a full list. We shall have all that's findable, and we shall
  see that against this disease we're writing, l'<a href="/science/para/homeo">homéopathe</a>'s prescription availeth
  not. Another exclusionist was Prof. Lawrence Smith. His psycho-tropism was to respond to all reports of carbonaceous
  matter falling from the sky, by saying that this damned matter had been deposited upon things of the chosen by impact
  with this earth. Most of our data antedate him, or were contemporaneous with him, or were as accessible to him as to
  us. In his attempted positivism it is simply ― and beautifully ― disregarded that, according to Bethelot, Berzelius,
  Cloez, Wohler and others these masses are not merely coated with carbonaceous matter, but are carbonaceous throughout,
  or are permeated throughout. How any one could so resolutely and dogmatically and beautifully and blindly hold out,
  would puzzle us were it not for our acceptance that only to think is to exclude and include; and to exclude some
  things that have as much right to come in as have the included ― that to have an opinion upon any subject is to be a
  Lawrence Smith ― because there is no definite subject <span class="source">"On the carbonaceous matter in meteorites." <em>American Journal of Science,</em> s.2, 47 (1869):

<p>Dr. Walter Flight (<em>Eclectic Magazine</em>, 89-71) says, of the substance that fell near Alais, France, March 15,
  1806, that it "emits a faint bituminous substance" when heated, according to the observations of Berzelius and a
  commission appointed by the French Academy <span
      class="source">Walter Flight. "Meteorites and the origin of life," <em>Eclectic Magazine,</em> 89, 711-8, at 715.
Correct quote: "...emits a faint bituminous odor," and, "The stones have the appearance of an
earthy variety of coal." The fall at Alais was investigated by Thénard and the commission in 1806,
and it was again analyzed by Berzelius in 1834. The Cold Bokkeveld meteorite, which fell at the
Cape of Good Hope, on October 13, 1838, was analyzed by Harris in 1859, who reported "more
than 0.25 per cent. of an organic substance soluble in alcohol," not 25 per cent. Cranbourne,
(County Mornington, Victoria), is near Melbourne, Australia; and, the meteorite was found in
1854. The analysis by Tschermak of the Goalpara meteorite found "0.85 per cent of a
hydrocarbon," not 8 per cent. No quote of "organic" appears regarding the Hessle meteorite which
fell on January 1, 1869, not in 1860; however, the "combustible ingredient" appeared to be
composed of the hydrocarbon C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</span>. This time we have not the reluctances
  expressed in such words as "like" and "resembling." We are told that this substance is "an earthy kind of coal."</p>

<p>And the things that sometimes deep-sea fishes are bumped by.

</p>
<p>Reluctances and the disguises or covered retreats of such words as "like" and "resemble" ― or that conditions of
  Intermediateness forbid abrupt transitions ― but that the spirit animating all Intermediateness is to achieve abrupt
  transitions ― because, if anything could finally break away from its origin and environment, that would be a real
  thing ― something not merging away indistinguishably with the surrounding. So all attempt to be original; all attempt
  to invent something that is more than mere extension or modification of the preceding, is positivism ― or that if one
  could conceive of a device to catch flies, positively different from, or unrelated to, all other devices ― up he'd
  shoot to heaven, or the Positive Absolute ― leaving behind such an incandescent train that in one age it would be said
  that he had gone aloft in a fiery chariot, and in another age that he had been struck by lightning ―

</p>
<p>I'm collecting notes upon persons supposed to have been struck by lightning. I think that high approximation to
  positivism has often been achieved ― instantaneous translation ― residue of negativeness left behind, looking much
  like effects of a stroke of lightning. Some day I shall tell the story of the <em>Marie Celeste</em> ― "properly," as
  the <em>Scientific American Supplement</em> would say ― mysterious disappearance of a sea captain, his family, and the
  crew ―

  <span class="source">"The Kentucky shower of flesh." <em>Scientific American Supplement,</em> 2 (July 1, 1876): 426. The
quoted word was "proper."</span></p>
<p>Of positivists, by the route of Abrupt Transition, I think that Manet was notable ― but that his approximation was
  held down by his intense relativity to the public ― or that it is quite as impositive to flout and insult and defy as
  it is to crawl and placate. Of course, Manet began with continuity with Courbet and others, and then, between him and
  Monet there were mutual influences ― but the spirit of abrupt difference is the spirit of positivism, and Manet's
  stand was against the dictum that all lights and shades must merge away suavely into one another and prepare for one
  another <span class="note">In French painting, édouard Manet was considered a precurser to the Impressionists, Claude
Monet was the leader of the Impressionists, and Gustave Courbet was the leader of the Realists.</span>. So a biologist
  like De Vries represents positivism, or the breaking of Continuity, by trying to conceive of evolution by mutation ―
  against the dogma of indistinguishable gradations by "minute variations" <span class="note">Hugo De Vries developed the "mutation theory" of evolution and was responsible for
resurrecting the genetic researches of G. Mendel.</span>. A Copernicus conceives of helio-centricity. Continuity is
  against him. He is not permitted to break abruptly with the past. He is permitted to publish his work, but only as "an
  interesting hypothesis" <span class="note">The emphasis of the hypothetical nature of <em>De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium</em> was made
anonymously in its preface by Andreas Osiander. Copernicus retained the ancient system of
planetary spheres and the circular orbits of the planets. Also, there was little more than a reduction
in the number of calculations to be performed for a lesser number of epicycles and deferents, an
improved lunar theory, and more accurate astronomical constants to recommend the Copernican
system; or, as stated by Koyré: "...it is a fact, that Ptolemy's astronomy is relatively satisfactory,
whilst that of Copernicus is hardly much better in practice for calculating the positions of planets,
when one takes into account the very large margin of error inherent in the star catalogues then
available."</span> <span class="source">Alexandre Koyré. R.E.W. Maddison, trans. <em>The Astronomical Revolution.</em> Ithaca, New
York: Cornell University Press, 1973; 23, 34-8, 81.</span>.</p>
<p>Continuity ― and that all that we call evolution or progress is attempt to break away from it ―

</p>
<p>That our whole solar system was at one time attempt by planets to break away from a parental nexus and set up
  individualities, and, failing, move in quasi-regular orbits that are expressions of relations with the sun and with
  one another, all having surrendered, being now quasi-incorporated in a higher approximation to system;

</p>
<p>Intermediateness in its mineralogic aspect of positivism ― or Iron that strove to break away from Sulphur and Oxygen,
  and be real, homogeneous Iron ― failing, inasmuch as elemental iron exists only in text-book chemistry;

</p>
<p>Intermediateness in its biologic aspect of positivism ― or the wild, fantastic, grotesque, monstrous things it
  conceived of, sometimes in a frenzy of effort to break away abruptly from all preceding types ― but failing, in the
  giraffe-effort, for instance, or only caricaturing an antelope ―

</p>
<p>All things break one relation only by the establishing of some other relation ―

</p>
<p>All things cut an umbilical cord only to clutch a breast.

</p>
<p>So the fight of the exclusionists to maintain the traditional ― or to prevent abrupt transition from the
  quasi-established ― fighting so that here, more than a century after meteorites were included, no other notable
  inclusion has been made, except that of cosmic dust, data of which Nordenskiold made more nearly real than data in
  opposition.

</p>
<p>So Proctor, for instance, fought and expressed his feeling of the preposterous, against Sir William H. Thomson's
  notions of arrival upon this earth of organisms on meteorites ―

</p>
<p>"I can only regard it as a jest" (<em>Knowledge,</em> 1-302) <span class="source">"Fossils in meteorites." <em>Knowledge,</em> 1 (February 3, 1882): 302. Lord Kelvin, (though, at the
time, still Sir William H. Thomson), stated in an Inaugural Address: "The hypothesis that life
originated on this earth through moss-grown fragments from the ruins of another world may seem
wild and visionary; all I maintain is that it is not unscientific." "The British Association meeting at
Edinburgh." <em>Nature,</em> 4 (August 3, 1871): 261-78, at 269-70. "Address of Sir William Thomson,
Knt., LL.D., F.R.S., President." <em>Annual Report of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science,</em> 1871, lxxxiv-cv, at civ-cv.</span>.</p>
<p>Or that there is nothing but jest ― or something intermediate to jest and tragedy;

</p>
<p>That ours is not an existence but an utterance;

</p>
<p>That Momus is imagining us for the amusement of the gods, often with such success that some of us seem almost alive ―
  like characters in something a novelist is writing; which often to considerable degree take their affairs away from
  the novelist ―

</p>
<p>That Momus is imagining us and our arts and sciences and religions, and is narrating or picturing us as a satire upon
  the gods' real existence.

</p>
<p>Because ― with many of our data of coal that has fallen from the sky as accessible then as they are now, and with the
  scientific pronouncement that coal is fossil, how, in a real existence, by which we mean a consistent existence, or a
  state in which there is real intelligence, or a form of thinking that does not indistinguishably merge away with
  imbecility, could there have been such a row as that which was raised about forty years ago over Dr. Hahn's
  announcement that he had found fossils in meteorites?

</p>
<p>Accessible to anybody at that time:

</p>
<p><em>Philosophical Magazine,</em> 4-17-425 <span class="source">E. Atkinson. "Chemical notices from foreign journals." <em>Philosophical Magazine,</em> s.4, 17
(June 1859): 422-30, at 425. Correct quote: "The substance had most analogy with the fossil
waxes, as ozokerite...."</span> :<a href="#N_51_"></a></p>
<p>That the substance that fell at Kaba, Hungary, April 15, 1857, contained organic matter "analogous to fossil waxes."

</p>
<p>Or limestone:

</p>
<p>Of the block of limestone which was reported to have fallen at Middleburgh, Florida, it is said (<em>Science,</em>
  11-118) that, though something had been seen to fall in "an old cultivated field," the witnesses who ran to it picked
  up something that "had been upon the ground in the first place" <span class="source">George F. Kunz. "A pseudo-meteorite." <em>Science,</em> n.s., 11 (March 9, 1888): 119. The second
quotation is Fort's usual paraphrase and not from this article.</span>. The writer who tells us this, with the usual
  exclusion-imagination, known as stupidity, but unjustly, because there is no real stupidity, thinks he can think of a
  good-sized stone that had for many years been in a cultivated field, but that had never been seen before ― had never
  interfered with plowing, for instance. He is earnest and unjarred when he writes that this stone weighs 200 pounds. My
  own notion, founded upon my own experience in seeing, is that a block of stone weighing 500 pounds might be in one's
  parlor twenty years, virtually unseen ― but not in an old cultivated field, where it interfered with plowing ― not
  anywhere ― if it interfered.</p>
<p>Dr. Hahn said that he had found fossils in meteorites. There is a description of the corals, sponges, shells, and
  crinoids, all of them microscopic, which he photographed, in <em>Popular Science,</em> 20-83 <span class="source">Francis Bingham. "The discovery of organic remains in meteoric stones." <em>Popular Science,</em> 20 (November 1881): 83-7.</span>.
</p>
<p>Dr. Hahn was a well-known scientist. He was better known after that.

</p>
<p>Anybody may theorize upon other worlds and conditions upon them that are similar to our own conditions: if his
  notions be presented undisguisedly as fiction, or only as an "interesting hypothesis," he'll stir up no prude rages.

</p>
<p>But Dr. Hahn said definitely that he had found fossils in specified meteorites: also he published photographs of
  them. His book is in the New York Public Library. In the reproductions every feature of some of the little shells is
  plainly marked. If they're not shells, neither are things under an oyster-counter. The striations are very plain: one
  sees even the hinges where bivalves are joined <span class="source">Otto Hahn. <em>Die Meteorite (Chondrite) und Ihre Organismen.</em> Tubingen: H. Laupp, 1880.
The book was accessible in the Science Reading Room, Room 121, of the New York Public
Library, under the catalog marking OSX+. The meteorites specified by Hahn include the
Knyahinya, Siena, Parnallée, Moung County, Cabarras, Tabor, and Borkut.</span>.</p>
<p>Prof. Lawrence Smith (<em>Knowledge,</em> 1-258) <span
    class="source">"No organic matter in meteors." <em>Knowledge,</em> 1 (January 20, 1882): 257-8. The quote

imagination has run wild with him."</span> :<a href="#N_55_"></a></p>
