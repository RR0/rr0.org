<p>MY own pseudo-conclusion:</p>
<p>That we've been damned by giants sound asleep, or by great scientific principles and abstractions that cannot realize
  themselves; that little harlots have visited their caprices upon us; that clowns, with buckets of water from which
  they pretend to cast thousands of good-sized fishes have anathematized us for laughing disrespectfully, because, as
  with all clowns, underlying buffoonery is the desire to be taken seriously; that pale ignorances, presiding over
  microscopes by which they cannot distinguish flesh from nostoc or fishes' spawn or frogs' spawn, have visited upon us
  their wan solemnities. We've been damned by corpses and skeletons and mummies, which twitch and totter with
  pseudo-life derived from conveniences.

</p>
<p>Or there is only hypnosis. The accursed are those who admit they're the accursed.

</p>
<p>If we be more nearly real we are reasons arraigned before a jury of dream-phantasms.

</p>
<p>Of all meteorites in museums, very few were seen to fall. It is considered sufficient grounds for admission if
  specimens can't be accounted for in any way other than that they fell from the sky&mdash;as if in the haze of
  uncertainty that surrounds all things, or that is the essence of everything, or in merging away of everything into
  something else, there could be anything that could be accounted for in only one way. The scientist and the theologian
  reason that if something can be accounted for in only one way, it is accounted for in that way &mdash; or logic would
  be logical, if the conditions that it imposes, but, of course, does not insist upon, could anywhere be found in
  quasi-existence. In our acceptance, logic, science, art, religion are, in our "existence," premonitions of a coming
  awakening, like dawning awareness of surroundings in the mind of a dreamer.

</p>
<p>Any old chunk of metal that measures up to the standard of "true meteoritic material" is admitted by the museums. It
  may seem incredible that modern curators still have this delusion, but we suspect that the date on one's morning
  newspaper hasn't much to [121/122] do with one's modernity all day long. In reading Fletcher's catalogue, for
  instance, we learn that some of the best-known meteorites were "found in draining a field" &mdash; "found in making a
  road" &mdash; "turned up by the plow" occurs a dozen times.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Someone fishing in Lake
  Okechobee, brought up an object in his fishing net. No meteorite had ever been seen to fall near it. The U.S. National
  Museum accepts it.

</p>
<p>If we accepted only one of the data of "untrue meteoritic material" &mdash; one instance of "carbonaceous" matter
  &mdash; if it be too difficult to utter the word "coal" &mdash; we see that in this inclusion-exclusion, as in every
  other means of forming an opinion, false inclusion and false exclusion have been practiced by curators of museums.

</p>
<p>There is something of ultra-pathos &mdash; of cosmic sadness &mdash; in this universal search for a standard, and in
  belief that one has been revealed by either inspiration or analysis, then the dogged clinging to a poor sham of a
  thing long after its insufficiency has been shown &mdash; or renewed hope and search for the special that can be true,
  or for something local that could also be universal. It's as if "true meteoritic material" were a "rock of ages" to
  some scientific men. They cling. But clingers cannot hold out welcoming arms.

</p>
<p>The only seemingly conclusive utterance, or seemingly substantial thing to cling to, is a product of dishonesty,
  ignorance, or fatigue. All sciences go back and back, until they're worn out with the process, or until mechanical
  reaction occurs: then they move forward &mdash; as it were. Then they become dogmatic, and take for bases, positions
  that were only points of exhaustion. So chemistry divided and sub-divided down to atoms; then, in the essential
  insecurity of all quasi-constructions, it built up a system, which, to anyone so obsessed by his own hypnoses that he
  is exempt to the chemist's hypnoses, is perceptibly enough an intellectual anemia built upon infinitesimal debilities.

</p>
<p>In <em>Science,</em> 31-298, E. D. Hovey, of the American Museum of Natural History, asserts or confesses, that often
  have objects of material such as fossiliferous limestone and slag been sent to him.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
  He says that these things have been accompanied by assurances that they have been seen to fall on lawns, on roads, in
  front of houses.

</p>
<p>They are all excluded. They are not of true meteoritic material. They were on the ground in the first place. It is
  only by coincidence that lightning has struck, or that a real meteorite, which was unfindable, has struck near objects
  of slag and limestone. [122/123]

</p>
<p>Mr. Hovey says that the list might be extended indefinitely. That's a tantalizing suggestion of some very interesting
  stuff &mdash;

</p>
<p>He says:

</p>
<p>"But it is not worth while."

</p>
<p>I'd like to know what strange, damned, excommunicated things have been sent to museums by persons who have felt
  convinced that they had seen what they may have seen, strongly enough to risk ridicule, to make up bundles, go to
  express offices, and write letters. I accept that over the door of every museum, into which such things enter, is
  written:

</p>
<p>"Abandon Hope."

</p>
<p>If a Mr. Symons mentions one instance of coal, or of slag or cinders, said to have fallen from the sky, we are not
  &mdash; except by association with the "carbonaceous" meteorites &mdash; strong in our impression that coal sometimes
  falls to this earth from coal-burning super-constructions, up somewhere &mdash;

</p>
<p>In <em>Comptes Rendus,</em> 91-197, M. Daubrée tells the same story.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Our
  acceptance, then, is that other curators could tell this same story. Then the phantomosity of our impression
  substantiates proportionately to its multiplicity. M. Daubrée says that often have strange damned things been sent to
  the French museums, accompanied by assurances that they had been seen to fall from the sky. Especially to our
  interest, he mentions coal and slag.

</p>
<p>Excluded.

</p>
<p>Buried un-named and undated in Science's potter's field.

</p>
<p>I do not say that the data of the damned should have the same rights as the data of the saved. That would be justice.
  That would be of the Positive Absolute, and, though the ideal of, a violation of, the very essence of quasi-existence,
  wherein only to have the appearance of being is to express a preponderance of force one way or another &mdash; or
  inequilibrium, or inconsistency, or injustice.

</p>
<p>Our acceptance is that the passing away of exclusionism is a phenomenon of the twentieth century: that gods of the
  twentieth century will sustain our notions be they ever so unwashed and frowsy. But, in our own expressions, we are
  limited, by the oneness of quasiness, to the very same methods by which orthodoxy established and maintains its now
  sleek, suave preposterousness. At any rate, though we are inspired by an especial subtle essence &mdash; or
  imponderable, I think &mdash; that pervades the twentieth century, we have not the superstition that we are offering
  anything as a positive fact. Rather often we have not the delusion that we're any less [123/124] superstitious and
  credulous than any logician, savage, curator, or rustic.

</p>
<p>An orthodox demonstration, in terms of which we shall have some heresies, is that if things found in coal could have
  got there only by falling there &mdash; they fell there.

</p>
<p>So, in the <em>Manchester Lit. and Phil. Soc. Mems.,</em> 2-9-306, it is argued that certain roundish stones that
  have been found in coal are "fossil aerolites": that they had fallen from the sky, ages ago, when the coal was soft,
  because the coal had closed around them, showing no sign of entrance.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>

</p>
<p><em>Proc. Soc. of Antiq. of Scotland,</em> 1-1-121:<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That, in a lump of coal, from a mine in Scotland, an iron instrument had been found &mdash;

</p>
<p>"The interest attaching to this singular relic arises from the fact of its having been found in the heart of a piece
  of coal, seven feet under the surface."

</p>
<p>If we accept that this object of iron was of workmanship beyond the means and skill of the primitive men who may have
  lived in Scotland when coal was forming there &mdash;

</p>
<p>"The instrument was considered to be modern."

</p>
<p>That our expression has more of realness, or higher approximation to realness, than has the attempt to explain that
  is made in the <em>Proceedings:</em>

</p>
<p>That in modern times someone may have bored for coal, and that his drill may have broken off in the coal it had
  penetrated.

</p>
<p>Why he should have abandoned such easily accessible coal, I don't know. The important point is that there was no sign
  of boring: that this instrument was in a lump of coal that had closed around it so that its presence was no suspected,
  until the lump of coal was broken.

</p>
<p>No mention can I find of this damned thing in ny other publication. Of course there is an alternative here: the thing
  may not have fallen from the sky: if in coal-forming times, in Scotland, there were indigenous to this earth, no men
  capable of making such an iron instrument, it may have been left behind by visitors from other worlds.

</p>
<p>In an extraordinary approximation to fairness and justice, which is permitted to us, because we are quite desirous to
  make acceptable that nothing can be proved as we are to sustain our own expressions, we note:

</p>
<p>That in <em>Notes and Queries,</em> 11-1-408, there is an account of [124/125] an ancient copper seal, about the size
  of a penny, found in chalk, at a depth of from five to six feet, near Bredenstone, England.<a
    href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> The design upon it is said to be of a monk kneeling before a virgin and child: a
  legend upon the margin is said to be: "S. Jordanis Monachi Spaldingie."

</p>
<p>I don't know about that. It looks very desirable &mdash; undesirable to us.

</p>
<p>There's a wretch of an ultra-frowsy thing in the <em>Scientific American,</em> 7-298, which we condemn ourselves, if
  somewhere, because of the oneness of allness, the damned must also be the damning.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>
  It's a newspaper story: that on June 5, 1852, a powerful blast, in Dorchester, Massachusetts, cast out from a bed of
  solid rock a bell-shaped vessel of an unknown metal: floral designs inlaid with silver; "art of some cunning workman."
  The opinion of the Editor of the <em>Scientific American</em> is that the thing had been made by Tubal Cain, who was
  the first inhabitant of Dorchester. Though I fear that this is a little arbitrary, I am not disposed to fly rabidly at
  every scientific opinion.

</p>
<p><em>Nature,</em> 35-36:<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>A block of metal found in coal, in Austria, 1885. It is now in the Salsburg museum.

</p>
<p>This time we have another expression. Usually our intermediatist attack upon provincial positivism is: Science, in
  its attempted positivism takes something such as "true meteoritic material" as a standard of judgment; but
  carbonaceous matter, except for its relative infrequency, is just as veritable a standard of judgment; carbonaceous
  matters merges away into such a variety of organic substances, that all standards are reduced to indistinguishability:
  if then, there is no real standard against us, there is no real resistance to our own acceptances. Now our
  intermediatism is: Science takes "true meteoritic material" as a standard of admission; but now we have an instance
  that quite as truly makes "true meteoritic material" a standard of exclusion; or, then, a thing that denies itself is
  no real resistance to our own acceptances &mdash; this depending upon whether we have a datum of something of "true
  meteoritic material" that orthodoxy can never accept fell from the sky.

</p>
<p>We're a little involved here. Our own acceptance is upon a carved, geometric thing that, if found in a very old
  deposit, antedates human life, except, perhaps, very primitive human life, as an indigenous product of this earth: but
  we're quite as much interested in the dilemma it made for the faithful. [125/126]

</p>
<p>It is of "true meteoritic material." In <em>L'Astronomie,</em> 7-114, it is said that, though so geometric, its
  phenomena so characteristic of meteorites exclude the idea that it was the work of man.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>As to the deposit &mdash; Tertiary coal.

</p>
<p>Composition &mdash; iron carbon, and a small quantity of nickel.

</p>
<p>It has a pitted surface that is supposed by the faithful to be characteristic of meteorites.

</p>
<p>For a full account of this subject, see <em>Comptes Rendus,</em> 103-702.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> The
  scientists who examined it could reach no agreement. They bifurcated: then a compromise was suggested; but the
  compromise is a product of disregard:

</p>
<p>That it was of true meteoritic material, and had not been shaped by man;

</p>
<p>That it was not of true meteoritic material, but telluric iron that had been shaped by man;

</p>
<p>That it was true meteoritic material that had fallen from the sky, but had been shaped by man, after its fall.

</p>
<p>The data, one or more of which must be disregarded by each of these three explanations, are: "true meteoritic
  material" and surface markings of meteorites; geometric form; presence in an ancient deposit; material as hard as
  steel; absence upon this earth, in Tertiary times, of men who could work in material as hard as steel. It is said
  that, though of "true meteoritic material," this object is virtually a steel object.

</p>
<p>St. Augustine, with his orthodoxy, was never in &mdash; well, very much worse &mdash; difficulties than are the
  faithful here. By due disregard of a datum or so, our own acceptance that it was a steel object that had fallen from
  the sky to this earth, in Tertiary times, is not forced upon one. We offer ours as the only synthetic expression. For
  instance, in <em>Science Gossip,</em> 1887-58, it is described as a meteorite: in this account there is nothing
  alarming to the pious, because, though everything else is told, its geometric form is not mentioned.<a
    href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>It's a cube. There is a deep incision all around it. Of its faces, two that are opposite are rounded.

</p>
<p>Though I accept that our own expression can only rather approximate to Truth, by the wideness of its inclusions, and
  because it seems, of four attempts, to represent the only complete synthesis, and can be nullified or greatly modified
  by data that we, too, have somewhere disregarded, the only means of nullification that I can think of would be
  demonstration that this object is a mass of iron pyrites, which sometimes form geometrically. But the analysis
  [126/127] mentions not a trace of sulphur. Of course our weakness, or impositiveness, lies in that, by any one to whom
  it would be agreeable to find sulphur in this thing, sulphur would be found in it &mdash; by our intermediatism there
  is some sulphur in everything, or sulphur is only a localization or emphasis of something that, unemphasized, is in
  all things.

</p>
<p>So there have, or haven't, been found upon this earth things that fell from the sky, or that were left behind by
  extra-mundane visitors to this earth &mdash;

</p>
<p>A yarn in the London <em>Times,</em> June 22, 1844: that some workmen, quarrying rock, close to the Tweed, about a
  quarter of a mile below Rutherford Mills, discovered a gold thread embedded in the stone, at a depth of eight feet:
  that a piece of the gold thread had been sent to the office of the Kelso <em>Chronicle</em>.<a
    href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>Pretty little thing; not at all frowsy; rather damnable.

</p>
<p>London <em>Times,</em> Dec. 24, 1851:<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That Hiram De Witt, of Springfield, Massachusetts, returning from California, had brought with him a piece of
  auriferous quartz about the size of a man's fist. It was accidentally dropped &mdash; split open &mdash; nail in it.
  There was a cut-iron nail, size of a six-penny nail, slightly corroded. "It was entirely straight and had a perfect
  head."

</p>
<p>Or &mdash; California &mdash; ages ago, when auriferous quartz was forming &mdash; super-carpenter, a million miles
  or so up in the air &mdash; drops a nail.

</p>
<p>To one not an intermediatist, it would seem incredible that this datum, not only of the damned, but of the lowest of
  the damned, or of the journalistic caste of the accursed, could merge away with something else damned only by
  disregard, and backed by what is called "highest scientific authority" &mdash;

</p>
<p>Communication by Sir David Brewster (<em>Rept. Brit. Assoc.,</em> 1845-51):<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That a nail had been found in a block of stone from Kingoodie Quarry, North Britain. The block in which the nail was
  found was nine inches thick, but as to what part of the quarry it had come from, there is no evidence &mdash; except
  that it could not have been from the surface. The quarry had been worked about twenty years. It consisted of alternate
  layers of hard stone and a substance called "till." The point of the nail, quite eaten with rust, projected into some
  "till," upon the surface of the block of stone. The rest of the [127/128] nail lay upon the surface of the stone to
  within an inch of the head &mdash; that inch of it was embedded in the stone.

</p>
<p>Although its caste is high, this is a thing profoundly of the damned&mdash;sort of a Brahmin as regarded by a
  Baptist. Its case was stated fairly; Brewster related all circumstances available to him&mdash;but there was no
  discussion at the meeting of the British Association: no explanation was offered &mdash;

</p>
<p>Nevertheless the thing can be nullified &mdash;

</p>
<p>But the nullification that we find is as much against orthodoxy, in one respect as it is against our own expression
  that inclusion in quartz or sandstone indicates antiquity &mdash; or there would have to be a revision of prevailing
  dogmas upon quartz and sandstone and age indicated by them, if the opposing data should be accepted. Of course it may
  be contended by both the orthodox and us heretics that the opposition is only a yarn from a newspaper. By an odd
  combination, we find our two lost souls that have tried to emerge, chucked back to perdition by one blow:

</p>
<p><em>Popular Science News,</em> 1884-41:<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That, according to the Carson <em>Appeal,</em> there had been found in a mine, quartz crystals that could have had
  only fifteen years in which to form: that, where a mill had been built, sandstone had been found, when the mill was
  torn down, that had hardened in twelve years: that in this sandstone was a piece of wood with "a rusty nail" in it.

</p>
<p><em>Annals of Scientific Discovery,</em> 1853-71:<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That, at the meeting of the British Association, 1853, Sir David Brewster had announced that he had to bring before
  the meeting an object "of so incredible a nature that nothing short of the strongest evidence was necessary to render
  the statement at all probable."

</p>
<p>A crystal lens had been found in the treasure-house at Ninevah.

</p>
<p>In many of the temples and treasure houses of old civilizations upon this earth have been preserved things that have
  fallen from the sky &mdash; or meteorites.

</p>
<p>Again we have a Brahmin. This thing is buried alive in the heart of propriety: it is in the British Museum.

</p>
<p>Carpenter, in <em>The Microscope and Its Revelations,</em> gives two drawings of it.<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>
  Carpenter argues that it is impossible to accept that optical lenses had ever been made by the ancients. Never
  occurred to him &mdash; some one a million miles or so up in the air &mdash; looking through his telescope
  &mdash; lens drops out. [128/129]

</p>
<p>This does not appeal to Carpenter: he says that this object must have been an ornament.

</p>
<p>According to Brewster, it was not an ornament, but "a true optical lens."

</p>
<p>In that case, in ruins of an old civilization upon this earth, has been found an accursed thing that was, acceptably,
  not a product of any old civilization indigenous to this earth.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> [129]
