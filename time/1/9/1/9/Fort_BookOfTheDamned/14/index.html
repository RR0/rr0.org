<p>WE see conventionally. It is not only that we think and act and speak and dress alike, because of our surrender to
  social attempt at Entity, in which we are only super-cellular. We see what it is "proper" that we should see. It is
  orthodox enough to say that a horse is not a horse, to an infant
  &mdash; any more than is an orange an orange to the unsophisticated. It's interesting to walk along a street sometimes
  and look at things and wonder what they'd look like, if we hadn't been taught to see horses and trees and houses as
  horses and trees and houses. I think that to super-sight they are local stresses merging indistinguishably into one
  another, in an all-inclusive nexus.

</p>
<p>I think that it would be credible enough to say that many times have Monstrator and Elvera and Azuria crossed
  telescopic fields of vision, and were not even seen &mdash; because it wouldn't be proper to see them; it wouldn't be
  respectable, and it wouldn't be respectful: it would be insulting to old bones to see them: it would bring on evil
  influences from the relics of St. Isaac to see them.

</p>
<p>But our data:

</p>
<p>Of vast worlds that are orbitless, or that are navigable, or that are adrift in inter-planetary tides and currents:
  the data that we shall have of their approach, in modern times, within five or six miles of this earth &mdash;

</p>
<p>But then their visits, or approaches, to other planets, or to other of the few regularized bodies that have
  surrendered to the attempted Entity of this solar system as a whole &mdash;

</p>
<p>The question that we can't very well evade:

</p>
<p>Have these other worlds, or super-constructions, ever been seen by astronomers?

</p>
<p>I think there would not be much approximation to realness in taking refuge in the notion of astronomers who stare and
  squint and see only that which it is respectable and respectful to see. It is all very well to say that astronomers
  are hypnotics, and that an astronomer looking at the moon is hypnotized by the moon, but our acceptance is that the
  bodies of this present expression often [184/185] visit the moon, or cross it, or are held in temporary suspension
  near it &mdash; then some of them must often have been within the diameter of an astronomer's hypnosis.

</p>
<p>Our general expression:

</p>
<p>That, upon the oceans of this earth, there are regularized vessels, but also that there are tramp vessels:

</p>
<p>That, upon the super-ocean, there are regularized planets, but also that there are tramp worlds:

</p>
<p>That astronomers are like mercantile purists who would deny commercial vagabondage.

</p>
<p>Our acceptance is that vast celestial vagabonds have been excluded by astronomers, primarily because their
  irresponsibilities are an affront to the pure and the precise, or to attempted positivism; and secondarily because
  they have not been seen so very often. The planets steadily reflect the light of the sun: upon this uniformity a
  system that we call Primary Astronomy has been built up; but now the subject-matter of Advanced Astronomy is data of
  celestial phenomena that are sometimes light and sometimes dark, varying like some of the satellites of Jupiter, but
  with a wider range. However, light or dark, they have been seen and reported so often that the only important reason
  for their exclusion is &mdash; that they don't fit in.

</p>
<p>With dark bodies that are probably external to our own solar system, I have, in the provincialism that no one can
  escape, not much concern. Dark bodies afloat in outer space would have been damned a few years ago, but now they're
  sanctioned by Prof. Barnard &mdash; and, if he says they're all right, you may think of them without the fear of doing
  something wrong or ridiculous &mdash; the close kinship we note so often between the evil and the absurd &mdash; I
  suppose by the ridiculous I mean the froth of evil. The dark companion of Algol, for instance. Though that's a clear
  case of celestial miscegenation, the purists, or positivists, admit that's so. In the <em>Proceedings of the National
    Academy of Sciences,</em> 1915-394, Prof. Barnard writes of an object &mdash; he calls it an "object" &mdash; in
  Cephus.<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> His idea is that there are dark, opaque bodies outside this solar system.
  But in the <em>Astrophysical Journal,</em> 1916-1, he modifies into regarding them as "dark nebulà."<a
      href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> That's not so interesting.

</p>
<p>We accept that Venus, for instance, has often been visited by other worlds, or by super-constructions, from which
  come cinders and coke and coal; that sometimes these things have reflected light and have been seen from this earth
  &mdash; by professional astronomers. [185/186] It will be noted that throughout this chapter our data are accursed
  Brahmins &mdash; as, by hypnosis and inertia, we keep on and keep on saying, just as a good many of the scientists of
  the 19th century kept on and kept on admitting the power of the system that preceded them &mdash; or Continuity would
  be smashed. There's a big chance here for us to be instantaneously translated to the Positive Absolute &mdash; oh,
  well &mdash;
</p>
<p>What I emphasize here is that our damned data are observations by astronomers of the highest standing, excommunicated
  by astronomers of similar standing &mdash; but backed up by the dominant spirit of their era &mdash; to which all
  minds had to equilibrate or be negligible, unheard, submerged. It would seem sometimes, in this book, as if our
  revolts were against the dogmatisms and pontifications of single scientists of eminence. This is only a convenience,
  because it seems necessary to personify. If we look over <em>Philosophical Transactions,</em> or the publications of
  the Royal Astronomical Society, for instance, we see that Herschel, for instance, was as powerless as any boy
  star-gazer, to enforce acceptance of any observation of his that did not harmonize with the system that was growing up
  as independently of him and all other astronomers, as a phase in the development of an embryo compels all cells to
  take on appearances concordantly with the design and the predetermined progress and schedule of the whole.

</p>
<p>Visitors to Venus:

</p>
<p>Evans, "Ways of the Planets," p. 140:<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That, in 1645, a body large enough to look like a satellite was seen near Venus. Four times in the first half of the
  18th century, a similar observation was reported. The last report occurred in 1767.

</p>
<p>A large body has been seen &mdash; seven times, according to <em>Science Gossip,</em> 1886-178 &mdash; near Venus.<a
    href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> At least one astronomer, Houzeau, accepted these observations and named the &mdash;
  world, planet, super-construction &mdash; "Neith." His views are mentioned "in passing, but without endorsement," in
  the <em>Trans. N. Y. Acad.,</em> 5-249.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>Houzeau or some one writing for the magazine-section of a Sunday newspaper &mdash; outer darkness for both alike. A
  new satellite in this solar system might be a little disturbing &mdash; though the formulas of La Place, which were
  considered final in his day, have survived the admittance of five or six hundred bodies not included in those formulas
  &mdash; a satellite to Venus might be a little disturbing, but would be explained &mdash; but a large body approaching
  a planet &mdash; staying a [186/187] while &mdash; going away &mdash; coming back some other time &mdash; anchoring,
  as it were &mdash;

</p>
<p>Azuria is pretty bad, but Azuria is no worse than Neith.

</p>
<p><em>Astrophysical Journal,</em> 1-127:<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>A light-reflecting body, or a bright spot near Mars: seen Nov. 25, 1894, by Prof. Pickering and others, at the Lowell
  Observatory, above an unilluminated part of Mars &mdash; self-luminous, it would seem &mdash; thought to have been a
  cloud &mdash; but estimated to have been about twenty miles away from the planet.

</p>
<p>Luminous spot seen moving across the disk of Mercury, in 1799, by Harding and Schroeter. (<em>Monthly Notices of the
  R. A. S.,</em> 38-338.)<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>In the first <em>Bulletin</em> issued by the Lowell Observatory, in 1903, Prof. Lowell describes a body that was seen
  on the terminator of Mars, May 20, 1903.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> On May 27, it was "suspected." If still
  there, it had moved, we are told, about 300 miles &mdash; "probably a dust cloud."

</p>
<p>Very conspicuous and brilliant spots seen on the disk of Mars, Oct. and Nov., 1911. (<em>Popular Astronomy,</em> Vol.
  19, No. 10.)<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>So one of them accepted six or seven observations that were in agreement, except that they could not be regularized,
  upon a world &mdash; planet &mdash; satellite &mdash; and he gave it a name. He named it "Neith."

</p>
<p>Monstrator and Elvera and Azuria and Super-Romanimus &mdash;

</p>
<p>Or heresy and orthodoxy and the oneness of all quasiness, and our ways and means and methods are the very same. Or,
  if we name things that may not be, we are not of lonely guilt in the nomenclature of absences &mdash;

</p>
<p>But now Leverrier and "Vulcan."

</p>
<p>Leverrier again.

</p>
<p>Or to demonstrate the collapsibility of froth, stick a pin in the largest bubble of it. Astronomy and inflation: and
  by inflation we mean expansion of the attenuated. Or that the science of Astronomy is a phantom-film distended with
  myth-stuff &mdash; but always our acceptance that it approximates higher to substantiality than did the system that
  preceded it.

</p>
<p>So Leverrier and the "planet Vulcan."

</p>
<p>And we repeat, and it will do us small good to repeat. If you be of the masses that the astronomers have hypnotized
  &mdash; being themselves hypnotized, or they could not hypnotize others &mdash; or that the hypnotist's control is not
  the masterful power that it is popularly [187/188] supposed to be, but only transference of state from one hypnotic to
  another &mdash;

</p>
<p>If you be of the masses that the astronomers have hypnotized, you will not be able even to remember. Ten pages from
  here, and Leverrier and the "planet Vulcan" will have fallen from your mind, like beans from a magnet, or like data of
  cold meteorites from the mind of a Thomson.

</p>
<p>Leverrier and the "planet Vulcan."

</p>
<p>And much the good it will do us to repeat.

</p>
<p>But at least temporarily we shall have an impression of a historic fiasco, such as, in our acceptance, could occur
  only in a quasi-existence.

</p>
<p>In 1859, Dr. Lescarbault, an amateur astronomer, of Org�res, France, announced that, upon March 26, of that year, he
  had seen a body of planetary size cross the sun. We are in a subject that is now as unholy to the present system as
  ever were its own subjects to the system that preceded it, or as ever were slanders against miracles to the preceding
  system. Nevertheless few text-books go so far as quite to disregard the tragedy. The method of the systematists is
  slightingly to give a few instances of the unholy, and dispose of the few. If it were desirable to them to deny that
  there are mountains upon this earth, they would record a few observations upon some slight eminences near Orange,
  N.J., but say that commuters, though estimable persons in several ways, are likely to have their observations mixed.
  The text-books casually mention a few of the "supposed" observations upon "Vulcan," and then pass on.

</p>
<p>Dr. Lescarbault wrote to Leverrier, who hastened to Org�res &mdash;

</p>
<p>Because this announcement assimilated with his own calculations upon a planet between Mercury and the sun &mdash;

</p>
<p>Because this solar system itself has never attained positiveness in the aspect of Regularity: there are to Mercury,
  as there are to Neptune, phenomena irreconcilable with the formulas, or motions that betray influence by something
  else.

</p>
<p>We are told that Leverrier "satisfied himself as to the substantial accuracy of the reported observation." The story
  of this investigation is told in <em>Monthly Notices,</em> 20-98.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> It seems too bad
  to threaten the na�ve little thing with our rude sophistications, but it is amusingly of the ingenuousness of the age
  from which present dogmas have survived. Lescarbault wrote to Leverrier. Leverrier hastened to Org�res. But he was
  careful not to tell Lescarbault [188/189] who he was. Went right in, and "subjected Dr. Lescarbault to a very severe
  cross-examination" &mdash; just the way you or I may feel at liberty to go into anybody's home and be severe with
  people &mdash;
  "pressing him hard step by step" &mdash; just as any one might go into some one else's house and press him hard,
  though unknown to the hard-pressed one. Not until he was satisfied, did Leverrier reveal his identity. I suppose Dr.
  Lescarbault expressed astonishment. I think there's something utopian about this: it's so unlike the stand-offishness
  of New York life.

</p>
<p>Leverrier gave the name "Vulcan" to the object that Dr. Lescarbault had reported.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>By the same means by which he is, even to this day, supposed &mdash; by the faithful &mdash; to have discovered
  Neptune, he had already announced the probable existence of an Intra-Mercurial body, or group of bodies. He had five
  observations besides Lescarbault's upon something that had been seen to cross the sun. In accordance with the
  mathematical hypnoses of his era, he studied these six transits. Out of them he computed elements giving "Vulcan" a
  period of about 20 days, or a formula for heliocentric longitude at any time.<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>But he placed the time of best observation away up in 1877.

</p>
<p>But even so, or considering that he still had probably a good many years to live, it may strike one that he was a
  little rash &mdash; that is if one has not gone very deep into the study of hypnoses &mdash; that, having "discovered"
  Neptune by a method which, in our acceptance, had no more to recommend it than had once equally well-thought-of
  methods of witch-finding, he should not have taken such chances: that if he was right as to Neptune, but he should be
  wrong as to "Vulcan," his average would be away below that of most fortune-tellers, who could scarcely hope to do
  business upon a fifty per cent. basis &mdash; all that the reasoning of a tyro in hypnoses.

</p>
<p>The date:

</p>
<p>March 22, 1877.

</p>
<p>The scientific world was up on its hind legs nosing the sky. The thing had been done so authoritatively. Never a pope
  had said a thing with more of the seeming of finality. If six observations correlated, what more could be asked? The
  Editor of <em>Nature,</em> a week before the predicted event, though cautious, said that it is difficult to explain
  how six observers, unknown to one another, could have data that could be formulated, if they were not related
  phenomena.<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>In a way, at this point occurs the crisis of our whole book. [189/190]

</p>
<p>Formulas are against us.

</p>
<p>But can astronomic formulas, backed up by observations in agreement, taken many years apart, calculated by a
  Leverrier, be as meaningless, in a positive sense, as all other quasi-things that we have encountered so far?

</p>
<p>The preparations they made, before March 22, 1877. In England, the Astronomer Royal made it the expectation of his
  life: notified observers at Madras, Melbourne, Sydney, and New Zealand, and arranged with observers in Chile and the
  United States.<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a> M. Struve had prepared for observations in Siberia and Japan
  &mdash;

</p>
<p>March 22, 1877 &mdash;

</p>
<p>Not absolutely, hypocritically, I think it's pathetic, myself. If any one should doubt the sincerity of Leverrier, in
  this matter, we note, whether it has meaning or not, that a few months later he died.

</p>
<p>I think we'll take up Monstrator, though there's so much to this subject that we'll have to come back.

</p>
<p>According to the <em>Annual Register,</em> 9-120, upon the 9th of August, 1762, M. de Rostan, of Basle, France, was
  taking altitudes of the sun, at Lausanne.<a href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a> He saw a vast, spindle-shaped body,
  about three of the sun's digits in breadth and nine in length, advancing slowly across the disk of the sun, or "with
  no more than half the velocity with which ordinary solar spots move." It did not disappear until the 7th of September,
  when it reached the sun's limb. Because of the spindle-like form, I incline to think of a super-Zeppelin, but another
  observation, which seems to indicate that it was a world, is that, though it was opaque, and "eclipsed the sun," it
  had around it a kind of nebulosity
  &mdash; or atmosphere? A penumbra would ordinarily be a datum of a sun spot, but there are observations that indicate
  that this object was at a considerable distance from the sun:

</p>
<p>It is recorded that another observer, at Paris, watching the sun, at this time, had not seen this object;

</p>
<p>But that M. Croste, at Sole, about forty-five German leagues northward of Lausanne, had seen it, describing the same
  spindle-form, but disagreeing a little as to breadth. Then comes the important point: that he and M. de Rostan did not
  see it upon the same part of the sun. This, then, is parallax, and compounded with invisibility at Paris, is great
  parallax &mdash; or that, in the course of a month, in the summer of 1762, a large, opaque, spindle-shaped body
  traversed the disk of the sun, but at a great distance from the sun. The writer in the <em>Register</em> says: "In a
  word, we know of nothing to have recourse to, in the heavens, by which to explain this phenome- [190/191] non." I
  suppose he was not a hopeless addict to explaining. Extraordinary &mdash; we fear he must have been a man of loose
  habits in some other respects.

</p>
<p>As to us &mdash;

</p>
<p>Monstrator.

</p>
<p>In the <em>Monthly Notices of the R. A. S.,</em> Feb., 1877, Leverrier, who never lost faith, up to the last day,
  gives the six observations upon an unknown body of planetary size, that he had formulated.<a
      href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>Fritsch, Oct. 10, 1802; Stark, Oct. 9, 1819; De Cuppis, Oct. 30, 1839; Sidebotham, Nov. 12, 1849; Lescarbault, March
  26, 1859; Lummis, March 20, 1862.

</p>
<p>If we weren't so accustomed to Science in its essential aspect of Disregard, we'd be mystified and impressed, like
  the Editor of <em>Nature,</em> with the formulation of these data: agreement of so many instances would seem
  incredible as a coincidence: but our acceptance is that, with just enough disregard, astronomers and fortune-tellers
  can formulate anything &mdash; or we'd engage, ourselves, to formulate periodicities in the crowds in Broadway &mdash;
  say that every Wednesday morning, a tall man, with one leg and a black eye, carrying a rubber plant, passes the Singer
  Building, at quarter past ten o'clock. Of course it couldn't really be done, unless such a man did have such a
  periodicity, but if some Wednesday mornings it should be a small child lugging a barrel, or a fat negress with a
  week's wash, by ordinary disregard that would be a prediction good enough for the kind of quasi-existence we're in.

</p>
<p>So whether we accuse, or whether we think that the word "accuse" over-dignifies an attitude toward a
  quasi-astronomer, or mere figment in a super-dream, our acceptance is that Leverrier never did formulate observations
  &mdash;

</p>
<p>That he picked out observations that could be formulated &mdash;

</p>
<p>That of this type are all formulas &mdash;

</p>
<p>That if Leverrier had not been himself helplessly hypnotized, or if he had had in him more than a tincture of
  realness, never could he have been beguiled by such a quasi-process: but that he was hypnotized, and so extended, or
  transferred, his condition to others, that upon March 22, 1877, he had this earth bristling with telescopes, with the
  rigid and almost inanimate forms of astronomers behind them &mdash;

</p>
<p>And not a blessed thing of any unusuality was seen upon that day or succeeding days. [191/192]

</p>
<p>But that the science of Astronomy suffered the slightest in prestige?

</p>
<p>It couldn't. The spirit of 1877 was behind it. If, in an embryo, some cells should not live up to the phenomena of
  their era, the others will sustain the scheduled appearances. Not until an embryo enters the mammalian stage are cells
  of the reptilian stage false cells.

</p>
<p>It is our acceptance that there were many equally authentic reports upon large planetary bodies that had been seen
  near the sun; that, of many, Leverrier picked out six; not then deciding that all the other observations related to
  still other large, planetary bodies, but arbitrarily, or hypnotically, disregarding &mdash; or heroically disregarding
  &mdash; every one of them &mdash; that to formulate at all he had to exclude falsely. The d�nouement killed him, I
  think. I'm not at all inclined to place him with the Grays and Hitchcocks and Symonses. I'm not, because, though it
  was rather unsportsmanlike to put the date so far ahead, he did give a date, and he did stick to it with such a high
  approximation
  &mdash;

</p>
<p>I think Leverrier was translated to the Positive Absolute.

</p>
<p>The disregarded:

</p>
<p>Observation, of June 26, 1819, by Gruithinson &mdash; but that was of two bodies that crossed the sun together
  &mdash;<a href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a>

</p>
<p><em>Nature,</em> 14-469:<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a>

</p>
<p> That, according to the astronomer, J. R. Hind, Benjamin Scott, City Chamberlain of London, and Mr. Wray, had, in
  1847, seen a body similar to "Vulcan" cross the sun.

</p>
<p>Similar observation by Hind and Lowe, March 12, 1849. (<em>L'Année Scientifique,</em> 1876-9.)<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>

</p>
<p><em>Nature,</em> 14-505:<a href="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>Body of apparent size of Mercury, seen, Jan. 29, 1860, by F. A. R. Russell and four other observers, crossing the
  sun.

</p>
<p>De Vico's observation of July 12, 1837. ("Observatory," 2-424.)<a href="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a>

</p>
<p><em>L'Année Scientifique,</em> 1865-16:<a href="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That another amateur astronomer, M. Coumbray, of Constantinople, had written to Leverrier, that, upon the 8th of
  March, 1865, he had seen a black point, sharply outlined, traverse the disk of the sun. It detached itself from a
  group of sun spots near the limb of the sun, and took 48 minutes to reach the other limb. Figuring upon the diagram
  from M. Coumbray, a central passage would have taken a little more than an hour. This observation was disregarded by
  Leverrier, because his formula required about four times that [192/193] velocity. The point here is that these other
  observations are as authentic as those that Leverrier included; that, then, upon data as good as the data of "Vulcan,"
  there must be other "Vulcans" &mdash; the heroic and defiant disregard, then, of trying to formulate one, omitting the
  others, which, by orthodox doctrine, must have influenced it greatly, if all were in the relatively narrow space
  between Mercury and the sun.

</p>
<p>Observation upon another such body, of April 4, 1876, by M. Weber, of Berlin. As to this observation, Leverrier was
  informed by Wolf, in August, 1876 (<em>L'Année Scientifique,</em> 1876-7).<a href="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a> It made
  no difference, so far as can be known, to this notable positivist.

</p>
<p>Two other observations noted by Hind and Denning &mdash; London <em>Times,</em> Nov. 3, 1871, and March 26, 1873.<a

  An observation by Schmidt, Oct. 11, 1847, is said to be doubtful: but, upon page 192, it is said that this doubt had
  arisen because of a mistaken translation, and two other observations by Schmidt are given: Oct. 14, 1849, and Feb. 18,
  1850 &mdash; also an observation by Lofft, Jan. 6, 1818. Observation by Steinheibel, at Vienna, April 27, 1820 (<em>Monthly
    Notices,</em> 1862).<a href="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>Haase had collected reports of twenty observations like Lescarbault's. The list was published in 1872, by Wolf.<a
    href="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a> Also there are other instances like Gruithinsen's:

</p>
<p><em>Amer. Jour. Sci.,</em> 2-28-446:<a href="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>Report by Pastorff that he had seen twice in 1836, and once in 1837, two round spots of unequal size moving across
  the sun, changing position relatively to each other, and taking a different course, if not orbit, each time: that, in
  1834, he had seen similar bodies pass six times across the disk of the sun, looking very much like Mercury in his
  transits.

</p>
<p>March 22, 1876 &mdash;

</p>
<p>But to point out Leverrier's poverty-stricken average &mdash; or discovering planets upon a fifty per cent. basis
  &mdash; would be to point out the low percentage of realness in the quasi-myth-stuff of which the whole system is
  composed. We do not accuse the text-books of omitting this fiasco, but we do note that theirs is the conventional
  adaptation here of all beguilers who are in difficulties &mdash;

</p>
<p>The diverting of attention.

</p>
<p>It wouldn't be possible in a real existence, with real mentality, to [193/194] deal with, but I suppose it's good
  enough for the quasi-intellects that stupefy themselves with text-books. The trick here is to gloss over Leverrier's
  mistake, and blame Lescarbault &mdash; he was only an amateur &mdash; had delusions. The reader's attention is led
  against Lescarbault by a report from M. Lias, director of the Brazilian Coast Survey, who, at the time of
  Lescarbault's "supposed" observation had been watching the sun in Brazil, and, instead of seeing even ordinary sun
  spots, had noted that the region of the "supposed transit" was of "uniform intensity."<a href="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>But the meaninglessness of all utterances in quasi-existence &mdash;

</p>
<p>"Uniform intensity" turns our way as much as against us &mdash; or some day some brain will conceive a way of beating
  Newton's third law &mdash; if every reaction, or resistance, is, or can be, interpretable as stimulus instead of
  resistance &mdash; if this could be done in mechanics, there's a way open here for someone to own the world &mdash;
  specifically in this matter, "uniform intensity" means that Lescarbault saw no ordinary sun spot, just as much as it
  means that no spot at all was seen upon the sun. Continuing the interpretation of a resistance as an assistance, which
  can always be done with mental forces &mdash; making us wonder what applications could be made of steam and electric
  forces &mdash; we point out that invisibility in Brazil means parallax quite as truly as it means absence, and,
  inasmuch as "Vulcan" was supposed to be distant from the sun, we interpret denial as corroboration &mdash; method of
  course of every scientist, politician, theologian, high-school debater.

</p>
<p>So the text-books, with no especial cleverness, because no especial cleverness is needed, lead the reader into
  contempt for the amateur of Org�res, and forgetfulness of Leverrier &mdash; and some other subject is taken up.

</p>
<p>But our own acceptance:

</p>
<p>That these data are as good as ever they were;

</p>
<p>That, if some one of eminence should predict an earthquake, and if there should be no earthquake at the predicted
  time, that would discredit the prophet, but data of past earthquakes would remain as good as ever they had been. It is
  easy enough to smile at the illusion of a single amateur &mdash;

</p>
<p>The mass-formation:

</p>
<p>Fritsch, Stark, De Cuppis, Sidebotham, Lescarbault, Lummis, Gruithinson, De Vico, Scott, Wray, Russell, Hind, Lowe,
  Coumbray, Weber, Standacher, Lichtenberg, Dangos, Hoffman, Schmidt, Lofft, Steinheibel, Pastorff &mdash;<a
      href="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a> [194/195]

</p>
<p>These are only the observations conventionally listed relatively to an Intra-Mercurial planet. They are formidable
  enough to prevent our being diverted, as if it were all the dream of a lonely amateur &mdash; but they're a mere
  advance-guard. From now on other data of large celestial bodies, some dark and some reflecting light, will pass and
  pass and keep on passing &mdash;

</p>
<p>So that some of us will remember a thing or two, after the procession's over &mdash; possibly.

</p>
<p>Taking up only one of the listed observations &mdash;

</p>
<p>Or our impression of the discrediting of Leverrier has nothing to do with the acceptability of these data:

</p>
<p>In the London <em>Times,</em> Jan. 10, 1860, is Benjamin Scott's account of his observation:<a href="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That, in the summer of 1847, he had seen a body that had seemed to be the size of Venus, crossing the sun. He says
  that, hardly believing the evidence of his sense of sight, he had looked for someone, whose hopes or ambitions would
  not make him so subject to illusion. He had told his little son, aged five years, to look through the telescope. The
  child had exclaimed that he had seen "a little balloon" crossing the sun. Scott says that he had not had sufficient
  self-reliance to make public announcement of his remarkable observation at the time, but that, in the evening of the
  same day, he had told Dr. Dick, F. R. A. S., who had cited other instances. In the <em>Times</em>, Jan. 12, 1860, is
  published a letter from Richard Abbott, F. R. A. S.: that he remembered Mr. Scott's letter to him upon this
  observation, at the time of the occurrence.<a href="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>I suppose that, at the beginning of this chapter, one had the notion that, by hard scratching through musty old
  records we might rake up vague, more than doubtful data, distortable into what's called evidence of unrecognized
  worlds or constructions of planetary size &mdash;

</p>
<p>But the high authenticity and the support and the modernity of these of the accursed that we are now considering
  &mdash;

</p>
<p>And our acceptance that ours is quasi-existence, in which above all other things, hopes, ambitions, emotions,
  motivations, stands Attempt to Positivize: that we are here considering an attempt to systematize that is sheer
  fanaticism in its disregard of the unsystematizable &mdash; that it represented the highest good in the 19th century
  &mdash; that it is mono-mania, but heroic mono-mania that was quasi-divine in the 19th century &mdash;

</p>
<p>But that this isn't the 19th century.

</p>
<p>As a duly sponsored Brahmin &mdash; in the regard of Baptists &mdash; the [195/196] objects of July 29, 1878, stand
  out and proclaim themselves so that nothing but disregard of the intensity of mono-mania can account for their
  reception by the system:
</p>
<p>Or the total eclipse of July 29, 1878, and the reports by Prof. Watson, from Rawlins, Wyoming, and by Prof. Swift,
  from Denver, Colorado: that they had seen two shining objects at a considerable distance from the sun.

</p>
<p>It's quite in accord with our general expression: not that there is an Intra-Mercurial planet, but that there are
  different bodies, many vast things; near this earth sometimes, near the sun sometimes; orbitless worlds, which,
  because of scarcely any data of collisions, we think of as under navigable control &mdash; or dirigible
  super-constructions.

</p>
<p>Prof. Watson and Prof. Swift published their observations.

</p>
<p>Then the disregard that we can not think of in terms of ordinary, sane exclusions.

</p>
<p>The text-book systematists begin by telling us that the trouble with these observations is that they disagree widely:
  there is considerable respectfulness, especially for Prof. Swift, but we are told that by coincidence these two
  astronomers, hundreds of miles apart, were illuded: their observations were so different &mdash;

</p>
<p>Prof. Swift (<em>Nature,</em> Sept. 19, 1878):<a href="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That his own observation was "a close approximation to that given by Prof. Watson."

</p>
<p>In the <em>Observatory,</em> 2-161, Swift says that his observations and Watson's were "confirmatory each of the
  other."<a href="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>The faithful try again:

</p>
<p>That Watson and Swift mistook stars for other bodies.

</p>
<p>In the <em>Observatory,</em> 2-193, Prof. Watson says that he had previously committed to memory all stars near the
  sun, down to the seventh magnitude &mdash;<a href="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>And he's damned anyway.

</p>
<p>How such exclusions work out is shown by Lockyer (<em>Nature,</em> Aug. 20, 1878).<a
    href="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a> He says: "There is little doubt that an Intra-Mercurial planet has been discovered
  by Prof. Watson."

</p>
<p>That was before excommunication was pronounced.

</p>
<p>He says:

</p>
<p>"If it will fit one of Leverrier's orbits" &mdash;

</p>
<p>It didn't fit.<a href="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>In <em>Nature,</em> 21-301, Prof. Swift says:<a href="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a> [196/197]

</p>
<p>"I have never made a more valid observation, nor one more free from doubt."

</p>
<p>He's damned anyway.

</p>
<p>We shall have some data that will not live up to most rigorous requirements, but, if any one would like to read how
  carefully and minutely these two sets of observations were made, see Prof. Swift's detailed description in the <em>Am.
    Jour. Sci.,</em> 116-313; and the technicalities of Prof. Watson's observations in <em>Monthly Notices,</em> 38-525.<a
      href="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>Our own acceptance upon dirigible worlds, which is assuredly enough, more nearly real than attempted concepts of
  large planets relatively near this earth, moving in orbits, but visible only occasionally; which more nearly
  approximates to reasonableness than does wholesale slaughter of Swift and Watson and Fritsch and Stark and De Cuppis
  &mdash; but our own acceptance is so painful to so many minds that, in another of the charitable moments that we have
  now and then for the sake of contrast, we offer relief:

</p>
<p>The things seen high in the sky by Swift and Watson &mdash;

</p>
<p>Well, only two months before &mdash; the horse and the barn &mdash;<a href="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>We go on with more observations by astronomers, recognizing that it is the very thing that has given them life,
  sustained them, held them together, that has crushed all but the quasi-gleam of independent life out of them. Were
  they not systematized, they could not be at all, except sporadically and without sustenance. They are systematized:
  they must not vary from the conditions of the system: they must break away for themselves.

</p>
<p>The two great commandments:

</p>
<p>Thou shalt not break Continuity;

</p>
<p>Thou shalt try.

</p>
<p>We go on with these disregarded data, some of which, many of which, are of the highest degree of acceptability. It is
  the System that pulls back its variations, as this earth is pulling back the Matterhorn. It is the System that
  nourishes and rewards, and also freezes out life with the chill of disregard. We do note that, before excommunication
  is pronounced, orthodox journals do liberally enough record unassimilable observations.

</p>
<p>All things merge away into everything else.

</p>
<p>That is Continuity.

</p>
<p>So the System merges away and evades us when we try to focus against it.

</p>
<p>We have complained a great deal. At least we are not so dull [197/198] as to have the delusion that we know just
  exactly what it is that we are complaining about. We speak seemingly definitely enough of "the System," but we're
  building upon observations by members of that very system. Or what we are doing&mdash;gathering up the loose heresies
  of the orthodox. Of course "the System" fringes and ravels away, having no real outline. A Swift will antagonize "the
  System," and a Lockyer will call him back; but, then, a Lockyer will vary with a "meteoric hypothesis," and a Swift
  will, in turn, represent "the System."<a href="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a> This state is to us typical of all
  intermediatist phenomena; or that not conceivably is anything really anything, if its parts are likely to be their own
  opposites at any time. We speak of astronomers &mdash; as if there were real astronomers &mdash; but who have lost
  their identity in a System &mdash; as if it were a real System &mdash; but behind the System is plainly a rapport, or
  loss of identity in the Spirit of an Era.

</p>
<p>Bodies that have looked like dark bodies, and lights that may have been sunlight reflected from interplanetary
  &mdash; objects, masses, constructions &mdash;

</p>
<p>Lights that have been seen upon &mdash; or near? &mdash; the moon:

</p>
<p>In <em>Philosophical Transactions,</em> 82-27, is Herschel's report upon many luminous points, which he saw upon
  &mdash; or near? &mdash; the moon, during an eclipse.<a href="#N_42_"><sup>(42)</sup></a> Why should they be luminous,
  whereas the moon itself was dark, would get us into a lot of trouble &mdash; except that later we shall, or we
  sha'n't, accept that many times have luminous objects been seen close to this earth &mdash; at night.

</p>
<p>But numerousness is a new factor, or new disturbance, to our explorations &mdash;

</p>
<p>A new aspect of inter-planetary inhabitancy or occupancy &mdash;

</p>
<p>Worlds in hordes &mdash; or beings &mdash; winged beings perhaps &mdash; wouldn't astonish me if we should end up by
  discovering angels &mdash; or beings in machines &mdash; argosies of celestial voyagers &mdash;

</p>
<p>In 1783 and 1787, Herschel reported more lights on or near the moon, which he supposed were volcanic.<a
    href="#N_43_"><sup>(43)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>The word of a Herschel has had no more weight, in divergences from the orthodox, than has had the word of a
  Lescarbault. These observations are of the disregarded.

</p>
<p>Bright spots seen in the moon, Nov., 1821 (<em>Proc. London Roy. Soc.,</em> 2-167).<a
    href="#N_44_"><sup>(44)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>For four other instances, see Loomis ("Treatise on Astronomy," p. 174).<a href="#N_45_"><sup>(45)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>A moving light is reported in <em>Phil. Trans.,</em> 84-429.<a href="#N_46_"><sup>(46)</sup></a> To the writer,
  [198/199] it looked like a star passing over the moon &mdash; "which, on the next moment's consideration I knew to be
  impossible." "It was a fixed, steady light upon the dark part of the moon." I suppose "fixed" applies to luster.

</p>
<p>In the <em>Report of the Brit. Assoc.,</em> 1847-18, there is an observation by Rankin, upon luminous points seen on
  the shaded part of the moon, during an eclipse.<a href="#N_47_"><sup>(47)</sup></a> They seemed to this observer like
  reflections of stars. That's not very reasonable: however, we have, in the <em>Annual Register,</em> 1821-687, a light
  not referable to star &mdash; because it moved with the moon: was seen three nights in succession; reported by Capt.
  Kater.<a href="#N_48_"><sup>(48)</sup></a> See <em>Quar. Jour. Roy. Inst.,</em> 12-133.<a
      href="#N_49_"><sup>(49)</sup></a>

</p>
<p><em>Phil. Trans.,</em> 112-237:<a href="#N_50_"><sup>(50)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>Report from the Cape Town Observatory: a whitish spot on the dark part of the moon's limb. Three smaller lights were
  seen.

</p>
<p>The call for positiveness, in its aspects of singleness, or homogeneity, or oneness, or completeness. In data now
  coming, I feel it myself. A Leverrier studies more than twenty observations. The inclination is irresistible to think
  they all relate to one phenomenon. It is an expression of cosmic inclination. Most of the observations are so
  irreconcilable with any acceptance other than the orbitless, dirigible worlds that he shuts his eyes to more than
  two-thirds of them; he picks out six that can give him the illusion of completeness, or of all relating to one planet.

</p>
<p>Or let it be that we have data of many dark bodies &mdash; still do we incline almost irresistibly to think of one of
  them as the dark-body-in-chief. Dark bodies, floating, or navigating, in inter-planetary space &mdash; and I conceive
  of one that's the Prince of Dark Bodies:

</p>
<p>Melanicus.

</p>
<p>Vast dark thing with wings of a super-bat, or jet-black super-construction; most likely one of the spores of the Evil
  one.

</p>
<p>The extraordinary year, 1883:

</p>
<p>London <em>Times,</em> Dec. 17, 1883:<a href="#N_51_"><sup>(51)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>Extract from a letter by Hicks Pashaw: that, in Egypt, Sept. 24, 1883, he had seen on the sun, through glasses, "an
  immense black spot on the lower part of the sun."

</p>
<p>Sun spot, may be.

</p>
<p>One night an astronomer was looking up at the sky, when something obscured a star, for three and a half seconds. A
  meteor had been seen nearby, but its train had been only momentarily visible. Dr. Wolf was the astronomer
  (<em>Nature,</em> 86-528).<a href="#N_52_"><sup>(52)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>The next datum is one of the most sensational we have, except [199/200] that there is very little to it. A dark
  object that was seen by Prof. Heis, for eleven degrees of arc, moving slowly across the Milky Way (Greg's Catalogue,
  <em>Rept. Brit. Assoc.,</em> 1867- 426).<a href="#N_53_"><sup>(53)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>One of our quasi-reasons for accepting that orbitless worlds are dirigible is the almost complete absence of data of
  collisions: of course, though in defiance of gravitation, they may, without direction like human direction, adjust to
  one another in the way of vortex rings of smoke &mdash; a very human-like way, that is. But in <em>Knowledge,</em>
  Feb., 1894, are two photographs of Brooks' comet that are shown as evidence of its seeming collision with a dark
  object, Oct., 1893.<a href="#N_54_"><sup>(54)</sup></a> Our own wording is that it "struck against something": Prof.
  Barnard's is that it had "entered some dense medium, which shattered it." For all I know it had knocked against merely
  a field of ice.

</p>
<p>Melanicus.

</p>
<p>That upon the wings of a super-bat, he broods over this earth and over other worlds, perhaps deriving something from
  them: hovers on wings, or wing-like appendages, or planes that are hundreds of miles from tip to tip &mdash; a
  super-evil things that is exploiting us. By Evil I mean that which makes us useful.

</p>
<p>He obscures a star. He shoves a comet. I think he's a vast, black, brooding vampire.

</p>
<p><em>Science,</em> July 31, 1896:<a href="#N_55_"><sup>(55)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That, according to a newspaper account, Mr. W. R. Brooks, director of the Smith Observatory, had seen a dark round
  object pass rather slowly across the moon, in a horizontal direction. In Mr. Brooks' opinion it was a dark meteor. In
  <em>Science,</em> Sept. 14, 1896, a correspondent writes that, in his opinion, it may have been a bird.<a
      href="#N_56_"><sup>(56)</sup></a> We shall have no trouble with the meteor and bird mergers, if we have
  observations of long duration and estimates of size up to hundreds of miles. As to the body that was seen by Brooks,
  there is a note from the Dutch astronomer, Muller, in the <em>Scientific American,</em> 75-251, that, upon April 4,
  1892, he had seen a similar phenomenon.<a href="#N_57_"><sup>(57)</sup></a> In <em>Science Gossip,</em> 3-135, are
  more details of the Brooks object
  &mdash; apparent diameter about one-thirtieth of the moon's &mdash; moon's disk crossed in three or four seconds.<a
      href="#N_58_"><sup>(58)</sup></a> The writer, in <em>Science Gossip,</em> says that, on June 27, 1896, at one
  o'clock in the morning, he was looking at the moon with a 2-inch achromatic, power 44, when a long black object sailed
  past, from west to east, the transit occupying 3 or 4 seconds. He believed this object to be a bird &mdash; there was,
  however, no fluttering motion observable in it. [200/201]

</p>
<p>In the <em>Astronomische Nachrichten,</em> No. 3477, Dr. Martin Brendel, of Griefswald, Pomerania, writes that
  Postmaster Ziegler and other observers had seen a body about 6 feet in diameter crossing the sun's disk.<a
      href="#N_59_"><sup>(59)</sup></a> The duration here indicates something far from the earth, and also far from the
  sun. This thing was seen a quarter of an hour before it reached the sun. Time in crossing the sun was about an hour.
  After leaving the sun it was visible an hour.

</p>
<p>I think he's a vast, black vampire that sometimes broods over this earth and other bodies.

</p>
<p>Communication from Dr. F. B. Harris (<em>Popular Astronomy,</em> 20-398):<a href="#N_60_"><sup>(60)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That, upon the evening of January 27, 1912, Dr. Harris saw, upon the moon, "an intensely black object." He estimated
  it to be 250 miles long and 50 miles wide. "The object resembled a crow poised, as near as anything." Clouds then cut
  off observation.

</p>
<p>Dr. Harris writes:

</p>
<p>"I cannot but think that a very interesting and curious phenomenon happened." [201]
