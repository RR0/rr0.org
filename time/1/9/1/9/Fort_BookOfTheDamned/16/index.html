<p>ANGELS.</p>
<p>Hordes upon hordes of them.</p>
<p>Beings massed like the clouds of souls, or the commingling whiffs of spirituality, or the exhalations of souls that
  Doré pictured so often.</p>
<p>It may be that the Milky Way is a composition of stiff, frozen, finally-static, absolute angels. We shall have data
  of little Milky Ways, moving swiftly; or data of hosts of angels, not absolute, or still dynamic. I suspect, myself,
  that the fixed stars are really fixed, and that minute motions said to have been detected in them are illusions. I
  think that the fixed stars are absolutes. Their twinkling is only the interpretation by an intermediatist state of
  them. I think that soon after Leverrier died, a new fixed star was discovered &mdash; that, if Dr. Gray had stuck to
  his story of the thousands of fishes from one pail of water, had written upon it, lectured upon it, taken to street
  corners, to convince the world that, whether conceivable or not, his explanation was the only true explanation: had
  thought of nothing but this last thing at night and first thing in the morning &mdash; his obituary &mdash; another
  "nova" reported in <em>Monthly Notices.</em>

</p>
<p>I think that Milky Ways, of an inferior, or dynamic, order, have often been seen by astronomers. Of course it may be
  that the phenomena that we shall now consider are not angels at all. We are simply feeling around, trying to find out
  what we can accept. Some of our data indicate hosts of rotund and complacent tourists in inter-planetary space &mdash;
  but then data of long, lean, hungry ones. I think that there are, out in inter-planetary space Super Tamerlanes, at
  the head of hosts of celestial ravagers &mdash; which have come here and pounced upon civilizations of the past,
  cleaning them up all but their bones, or temples and monuments &mdash; for which later historians have invented
  exclusionist histories. But if something now has a legal right to us, and can enforce its proprietorship, they've been
  warned off. It's the way of all exploitation. I should say that we're now under cultivation: that we're conscious of
  it, [206/207] but have the impertinence to attribute it all to our own nobler and higher instincts.

</p>
<p>Against these notions is the same sense of finality that opposes all advance. It's why we rate acceptance as a better
  adaptation than belief. Opposing us is the strong belief that, as to inter-planetary phenomena, virtually everything
  has been found out. Sense of finality and illusion of homogeneity. But that what is called advancing knowledge is
  violation of the sense of blankness.
</p>
<p>A drop of water. Once upon a time water was considered so homogeneous that it was thought of as an element. The
  microscope &mdash; and not only that the suppositiously elementary was seen to be of infinite diversity, but that in
  its protoplasmic life there were new orders of beings.

</p>
<p>Or the year 1491 &mdash; and a European looking westward over the ocean &mdash; his feeling that that suave western
  droop was unbreakable; that gods or regularity would not permit that smooth horizon to be disturbed by coasts or
  spotted with islands. The unpleasantness of even contemplating such a state &mdash; wide, smooth west, so clean
  against the sky &mdash; spotted with islands
  &mdash; geographic leprosy.

</p>
<p>But coasts and islands and Indians and bison, in the seemingly vacant west: lakes, mountains, rivers &mdash;

</p>
<p>One looks up at the sky: the relative homogeneity of the relatively unexplored: one thinks of only a few kinds of
  phenomena. But the acceptance is forced upon me that there are modes and modes and modes of inter-planetary existence:
  things as different from planets and comets and meteors as Indians are from bison and prairie dogs: a super-geography
  &mdash; or celestiography &mdash; of vast stagnant regions, but also of Super-Niagaras and Ultra-Mississippis: and a
  super-sociology &mdash;
  voyagers and tourists and ravagers: the hunted and the hunting: the super-mercantile, the super-piratic, the
  super-evangelical.

</p>
<p>Sense of homogeneity, or our positivist illusion of the unknown &mdash; and the fate of all positivism.

</p>
<p>Astronomy and the academic.

</p>
<p>Ethics and the abstract.

</p>
<p>The universal attempt to formulate or to regularize &mdash; an attempt that can be made only by disregarding or
  denying.

</p>
<p>Or all things disregard or deny that which will eventually invade and destroy them &mdash;

</p>
<p>Until comes the day when some one thing shall say, and enforce upon Infinitude: [207/208]

</p>
<p>"Thus far shalt thou go: here is absolute demarcation."

</p>
<p>The final utterance:

</p>
<p>"There is only I."

</p>
<p>In the <em>Monthly Notices of the R. A. S.,</em> 11-48, there is a letter from the Rev. W. Read:<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That, upon the 4th of September, 1851, at 9.30 a. m., he had seen a host of self-luminous bodies, passing the field
  of his telescope, some slowly and some rapidly. They appeared to occupy a zone several degrees in breadth. The
  direction of most of them was due east to west, but some moved from north to south. The numbers were tremendous. They
  were observed for six hours.

</p>
<p>Editor's note:

</p>
<p>"May not these appearances be attributed to an abnormal state of the optic nerves of the observer?"

</p>
<p>In <em>Monthly Notices,</em> 12-38, Mr. Read answers that he had been a diligent observer, with instruments of a
  superior order, for about 28 years &mdash; "but I have never witnessed such an appearance before." As to illusion he
  says that two other members of his family had seen the objects.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>The Editor withdraws his suggestion.

</p>
<p>We know what to expect. Almost absolutely &mdash; in an existence that is essentially Hibernian &mdash; we can
  predict the past &mdash; that is, look over something of this kind, written in 1851, and know what to expect from the
  Exclusionists later. If Mr. Read saw a migration of dissatisfied angels, numbering millions, they must merge away, at
  least subjectively, with commonplace terrestrial phenomena &mdash; of course disregarding Mr. Read's probable
  familiarity, of 28 years' duration, with the commonplaces of terrestrial phenomena.

</p>
<p><em>Monthly Notices,</em> 12-183:<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>Letter from Rev. W. R. Dawes:

</p>
<p>That he had seen similar objects &mdash; and in the month of September&mdash;that they were nothing but seeds
  floating in the air.

</p>
<p>In the <em>Report of the British Association,</em> 1852-235, there is a communication from Mr. Read to Prof.
  Baden-Powell:<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That the objects that had been seen by him and by Mr. Dawes were not similar. He denies that he had seen seeds
  floating in the air. There had been little wind, and that had come from the sea, where seeds would not be likely to
  have origin. The objects that he had seen were round and sharply defined, and with none of the feathery appearance of
  thistle down. He then quotes from a letter from C. B. Chalmers, F. R. A. S., who had seen a similar stream, [208/209]
  a procession, or migration, except that some of the bodies were more elongated &mdash; or lean and hungry &mdash; than
  globular.

</p>
<p>He might have argued for sixty-five years. He'd have impressed nobody &mdash; of importance. The super-motif, or
  dominant, of his era, was Exclusionism, and the notion of seeds in the air assimilates &mdash; with due disregards
  &mdash; with that dominant.

</p>
<p>Or pageantries here upon our earth, and things looking down upon us&mdash;and the Crusades were only dust clouds, and
  glints of the sun on shining armor were only particles of mica in dust clouds. I think it was a Crusade that Read saw
  &mdash; but that it was right, relatively to the year 1851, to say that it was only seeds in the wind, whether the
  wind blew from the sea or not. I think of things that were luminous with religious zeal, mixed up, like everything
  else in Intermediateness, with black marauders and from gray to brown beings of little personal ambitions. There may
  have been a Richard cœur de Lion, on his way to right wrongs in Jupiter. It was right, relatively to 1851, to say
  that he was a seed of a cabbage.

</p>
<p>Prof. Coffin, U.S.N., (<em>Jour. Frank. Inst.,</em> 88-151):<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That, during the eclipse of August, 1869, he had noted the passage, across his telescope, or several bright flakes
  resembling thistle-blows, floating in the sunlight. But the telescope was so focused that, if these things were
  distinct, they must have been so far away from this earth that the difficulties of orthodoxy remain as great, one way
  or another, no matter what we think they were
  &mdash;

</p>
<p>They were "well defined," says Prof. Coffin.

</p>
<p>Henry Waldner (<em>Nature,</em> 5-304):<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That, April 27, 1863, he had seen great numbers of small, shining bodies passing from west to east. He had notified
  Dr. Wolf, of the Observatory of Zurich, who "had convinced himself of this strange phenomenon." Dr. Wolf had told him
  that similar bodies had been seen by Sig. Capocci, of the Capodimonte Observatory, at Naples, May 11, 1845.

</p>
<p>The shapes were of great diversity &mdash; or different aspects of similar shapes?

</p>
<p>Appendages were seen upon them.

</p>
<p>We are told some were star-shaped, with transparent appendages.

</p>
<p>I think, myself, it was a Mohammed and his Hegira. May have been only his harem. Astonishing sensation: afloat in
  space with ten million wives around one. Anyway, it would seem that we [209/210] have considerable advantage here,
  inasmuch as seeds are not in season in April &mdash; but pulling back to earth, the bedraggling by those sincere but
  dull ones of some time ago. We have the same stupidity &mdash; necessary, functioning stupidity &mdash; of attribution
  of something that was so rare that an astronomer notes only one instance between 1845 and 1863, to an everyday
  occurrence &mdash;

</p>
<p>Or Mr. Waldner's assimilative opinion that he had seen only ice crystals.

</p>
<p>Whether they were not very exclusive veils of a super-harem, or planes of a very light material, we have an
  impression of star-shaped things with transparent appendages that have been seen in the sky.

</p>
<p>Hosts of small bodies &mdash; black, this time &mdash; that were seen by the astronomers Herrick, Buys-Ballot, and De
  Cuppis, (<em>L'Année Scientifique,</em> 1860-25); vast numbers of bodies that were seen by M. Lamey, to cross the moon
  (<em>L'Année Scientifique,</em> 1874-62); another instance of dark ones; prodigious number of dark, spherical bodies
  reported by Messier, June 17, 1777 (Arago's <em>Oeuvres,</em> 9-38); considerable number of luminous bodies which
  appeared to move out from the sun, in diverse directions; seen at Havana, during eclipse of the sun, May 15, 1836, by
  Prof. Auber (Poey); M. Poey cites a similar instance, of Aug. 3, 1886; M. Lotard's opinion that they were birds (<em>L'Astronomie,</em>
  1886-391); large number of small bodies crossing disk of the sun, some swiftly, some slowly; most of them globular,
  but some seemingly triangular, and some were of more complicated structure; seen by M. Trouvelet, who, whether seeds,
  insects, birds, or other commonplace things, had never seen anything resembling these forms (<em>L'Année
    Scientifique,</em> 1885-8); report from the Rio de Janeiro Observatory, of vast numbers of bodies crossing the sun,
  some of them luminous and some of them dark, from some time in December, 1875, until Jan. 22, 1876 (<em>La
    Nature,</em> 1876-384).<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>Of course, at a distance, any form is likely to look round or roundish: but we point out that we have notes upon the
  seeming of more complex forms. In <em>L'Astronomie,</em> 1886-70, is recorded M. Briguiere's observation, at
  Marseilles, April 15 and April 25, 1883, upon the crossing of the sun by bodies that were irregular in form. Some of
  them moved as if in alignment.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>Letter from Sir Robert Inglis to Col. Sabine (<em>Rept. Brit. Assoc.,</em> 1849-17):<a
    href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That, at 3 p. m., Aug. 8, 1849, at Gais, Switzerland, Inglis had [210/211] seen thousands and thousands of brilliant
  white objects, like snowflakes in a cloudless sky. Though this display lasted about twenty-five minutes, not one of
  these seeming snowflakes was seen to fall. Inglis says that his servant "fancied" that he had seen something like
  wings on these &mdash; whatever they were. Upon page 18, of the <em>Report,</em> Sir John Herschel says that, in 1845
  or 1846, his attention had been attracted by objects of considerable size, in the air, seemingly not far away. He had
  looked at them through a telescope. He says that they were masses of hay, not less than a yard or two in diameter.
  Still there are some circumstances that interest me. He says that, though no less than a whirlwind could have
  sustained these masses, the air about him was calm. "No doubt wind prevailed at the spot, but there was no roaring
  noise." None of these masses fell within his observation or knowledge. To walk a few fields away and find out more
  would seem not much to expect from a man of science, but it is one of our superstitions, that such a seeming trifle is
  just what &mdash; by the Spirit of an Era, we'll call it &mdash; one is not permitted to do. If those things were not
  masses of hay, and if Herschel had walked a little and found out, and had reported that he had seen strange objects in
  the air &mdash; that report, in 1846, would have been as misplaced as the appearance of a tail upon an embryo still in
  its gastrula era. I have noticed this inhibition in my own case many times. Looking back &mdash; why didn't I do this
  or that little thing that would have cost me little and have meant so much? Didn't belong to that era of my own
  development.

</p>
<p><em>Nature,</em> 22-64:<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That, at Kattenau, Germany, about half an hour before sunrise, March 22, 1880, "an enormous number of luminous bodies
  rose from the horizon, and passed in a horizontal direction from east to west." They are described as having appeared
  in a zone or belt. "They shone with a remarkably brilliant light."

</p>
<p>So they've thrown lassos over our data to bring them back to earth. But they're lassos that cannot tighten. We can't
  pull out of them: we may step out of them, or lift them off. Some of us used to have an impression of Science sitting
  in calm, just judgment: some of us now feel that a good many of our data have been lynched. If a Crusade, perhaps from
  Mars to Jupiter, occur in autumn
  &mdash; "seeds." If a Crusade or outpouring of celestial vandals is seen from this earth in the spring &mdash;
  "ice crystals." If we have [211/212] record of a race of aerial beings, perhaps with no substantial habitat, seen by
  some one in India &mdash; "locusts."

</p>
<p>This will be disregarded:

</p>
<p>If locusts fly high, they freeze and fall in thousands.

</p>
<p><em>Nature,</em> 47-581:<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>Locusts that were seen in the mountains of India, at a height of 12,750 feet &mdash; "in swarms and dying by
  thousands."

</p>
<p>But no matter whether they fly high or fly low, no one ever wonders what's in the air when locusts are passing
  overhead, because of the falling of stragglers. I have especially looked this matter up
  &mdash; no mystery when locusts are flying overhead &mdash; constant falling of stragglers.

</p>
<p><em>Monthly Notices,</em> 30-135:<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>"An unusual phenomenon was noticed by Lieut. Herschel, Oct. 17 and 18, 1870, while observing the Sun at Bangalore,
  India."

</p>
<p>Lieut. Herschel had noticed dark shadows crossing the sun &mdash; but away from the sun there were luminous, moving
  images. For two days bodies passed in a continuous stream, varying in size and velocity.

</p>
<p>The Lieutenant tries to explain, as we shall see, but he says:

</p>
<p>"As it was, the continuous flight for two whole days, in such numbers, in the upper regions of the air, of beasts
  that left no stragglers, is a wonder of natural history, if not of astronomy."

</p>
<p>He tried different focusing &mdash; he saw wings &mdash; perhaps he saw planes. He says that he saw upon the objects
  either wings or phantom-like appendages.

</p>
<p>Then he saw something that was so bizarre that, in the fullness of his nineteenth-centuriness, he writes:

</p>
<p>"There was no longer any doubt; they were locusts, or flies of some sort."

</p>
<p>One of them had paused.

</p>
<p>It had hovered.

</p>
<p>Then it had whisked off.

</p>
<p>The Editor says that at that time "countless locusts had descended upon certain parts of India."

</p>
<p>We now have an instance that is extraordinary in several respects &mdash; super-voyagers or super-ravagers; angels,
  ragamuffins, crusaders, emigrants, aeronauts, or aerial elephants, or bison or dinosaurs &mdash; except that I think
  the thing had planes or wings &mdash; one of them has been photographed. It may be that in the history of [212/213]
  photography no more extraordinary picture than this has ever been taken.
</p>
<p><em>L'Astronomie,</em> 1885-347:<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That, at the Observatory of Zacatecas, Mexico, Aug. 12, 1883, about 2,500 meters above sea level, were seen a large
  number of small luminous bodies, entering upon the disk of the sun. M. Bonilla telegraphed to the Observatories of the
  City of Mexico and of Puebla. Word came back that the bodies were not visible there. Because of this parallax, M.
  Bonilla placed the bodies "relatively near the earth." But when we find out what he called "relatively near the earth"
  &mdash; birds or bugs or hosts of a Super-Tamerlane or army of a celestial Richard cœur de Lion &mdash; our heresies
  rejoice anyway. His estimate is "less distance than the moon."

</p>
<p>One of them was photographed. See <em>L'Astronomie,</em> 1885-349. The photograph shows a long body surrounded by
  indefinite structures, or by the haze of wings or planes in motion.

</p>
<p><em>L'Astronomie,</em> 1887-66:<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>Signor Ricco, of the Observatory of Palermo, writes that, Nov. 30, 1880, at 8.30 o'clock in the morning, he was
  watching the sun, when he saw, slowly traversing its disk, bodies in two long, parallel lines, and a shorter, parallel
  line. The bodies looked winged to him. But so large were they that he had to think of large birds. He thought of
  cranes.

</p>
<p>He consulted ornithologists, and learned that the configuration of parallel lines agrees with the flight-formation of
  cranes. This was in 1880: anybody now living in New York City, for instance, would tell him that also it is a familiar
  formation of aeroplanes. But, because of data of focus and subtended angles, these beings or objects must have been
  high.

</p>
<p>Sig. Ricco argues that condors have been known to fly 3 or 4 miles high, and that heights reached by other birds have
  been estimated at 2 or 3 miles. He says that cranes have been known to fly so high that they have been lost to view.

</p>
<p>Our own acceptance, in conventional terms, is that there is not a bird on this earth that would not freeze to death
  at a height of more than four miles: that if condors fly three or four miles high, they are birds that are especially
  adapted to such altitudes.

</p>
<p>Sig. Ricco's estimate is that these objects or beings or cranes must have been at least five and a half miles high.
