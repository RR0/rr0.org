<p>WE shall have an outcry of silences. If a single instance of anything be disregarded by a System -- our own attitude
  is that a single instance is a powerless thing. Of course our own method of agreement of many instances is not a real
  method. In Continuity, all things must have resemblances with all other things. Anything has any quasi-identity you
  please. Some time ago conscription was assimilated with either autocracy or democracy with equal facility. Note the
  need for a dominant to correlate to. Scarcely anybody said simply that we must have conscription: but that we must
  have conscription, which correlates with democracy, which was taken as a base, or something basically desirable. Of
  course between autocracy and democracy nothing but false demarcation can be drawn. So I can conceive of no subject
  upon which there should be such poverty as a single instance, if anything one pleases can be whipped into line.
  However, we shall try to be more nearly real than the Darwinites who advance concealing coloration as Darwinism, and
  then drag in proclaiming luminosity, too, as Darwinism. I think the Darwinites had better come in with us as to the
  deep-sea fishes &mdash; and be sorry later, I suppose. It will be amazing or negligible to read all the instances now
  to come of things that have been seen in the sky, and to think that all have been disregarded. My own opinion is that
  it is not possible, or very easy, to disregard them, now that they have been brought together &mdash; but that, if
  prior to about this time we had attempted such as assemblage, the Old Dominant would have withered our typewriter
  &mdash;
  as it is the letter "e" has gone back on us, and the "s" is temperamental.

<p>"Most extraordinary and singular phenomenon," North Wales, Aug. 26, 1894; a disk from which projected an
  orange-colored body that looked like "an elongated flatfish," reported by Admiral Ommanney (<em>Nature,</em> 50-524);
  disk from which projected a hook-like form, India, about 1838; diagram of it given, disk about size of the moon, but
  brighter than the moon, visible about twenty minutes; by G. Pettit, in Prof. Baden-Powell's Catalogue (<em>Rept.
    Brit.</em> [274/275] <em>Assoc.,</em> 1849); very brilliant hook-like form, seen in the sky at Poland, Trumbull Co.,
  Ohio, during the stream of meteors, of 1833; visible more than an hour: also, large luminous body, almost stationary
  "for a time," shaped like a square table, Niagara Falls, Nov. 13, 1833 (<em>Amer. Jour. Sci.,</em> 1-25-391);
  something described as a bright white cloud, at night, Nov. 3, 1886, at Hamar, Norway; from it were emitted rays of
  light; drifted across the sky; "retained throughout its original form" (<em>Nature,</em> Dec. 16, 1886-158); thing
  with an oval nucleus, and streamers with dark bands and lines very suggestive of structure; New Zealand, May 4, 1888 (<em>Nature,</em>
  42-402); luminous object, size of full moon, visible an hour and a half, Chili, Nov. 5, 1883 (<em>Comptes Rendus,</em>
  103-682); bright object near sun, Dec. 21, 1882 (<em>Knowledge,</em> 3-13); light that looked like a great flame, far
  out at sea, off Ryook Phyoo, Dec. 2, 1845 (<em>London Roy. Soc. Proc.,</em> 5-627); something like a gigantic trumpet,
  suspended, vertical, oscillating gently, visible five or six minutes, length estimated at 425 feet, at Oaxaca, Mexico,
  July 6, 1874 (<em>Sci. Am. Supp.,</em> 6-2365); two luminous bodies, seemingly united, visible five or six minutes,
  January 3, 1898 (<em>La Nature,</em> 1898-1-127); thing with a tail, crossing moon, transit half a minute, Sept. 26,
  1870 (London <em>Times,</em> Sept. 30, 1870); object four or five times size of the moon, moving slowly across sky,
  Nov. 1, 1885, near Adrianople (<em>L'Astronomie,</em> 1886-309); large body, colored red, moving slowly, visible 15
  minutes, reported by Coggia, Marseilles, Aug. 1, 1871 (<em>Chemical News,</em> 24-193); details of this observation,
  and similar observation by Guillemin, and other instances by de Fonville (<em>Comptes Rendus,</em> 73-297, 755); thing
  that was large and that was stationary twice in seven minutes, Oxford, Nov. 19, 1847, listed by Lowe (<em>Rec.
    Sci.,</em> 1-136); grayish object that looked to be about three and a half feet long, rapidly approaching the earth
  at Saarbruck, April 1, 1826; sound like thunder; object expanding like a sheet (<em>Amer. Jour. Sci.,</em> 1-26-133;
  <em>Quar. Jour. Roy. Inst.,</em> 24-488); report by an astronomer, N.S. Drayton, upon an object duration of which
  seemed to him extraordinary, duration three-quarters of a minute, Jersey City, July 6, 1882 (<em>Scientific
    American,</em> 47-53); object like a comet, but with proper motion of 10 degrees an hour; visible one hour; reported
  by Purine and Glancy from the Cordoba Observatory, Argentine, March 14, 1916 (<em>Scientific American,</em> 115-493);
  something like a signal light, reported by Glaisher, Oct. 4, 1844; bright as Jupiter, "sending out quick flickering
  waves of light" (<em>Year Book of Facts,</em> 1845-278).<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> [275/276]

</p>
<p>I think that with the object known as Eddie's "comet," passes away the last of our susceptibility to the common
  fallacy of personifying. It is one of the most deep-rooted of the positivist illusions &mdash;
  that people are persons. We have been guilty too often of spleens and spites and ridicules against astronomers, as if
  they were persons, or final unities, individuals, completenesses, or selves &mdash;
  instead of indeterminate parts. But, so long as we remain in quasi-existence, we can cast out illusion only with some
  other illusion, though the other illusion may approximate higher to reality. So we personify no more &mdash; but we
  super-personify. We now take into full acceptance our expression that Development is an Autocracy of Successive
  Dominants &mdash; which are not final &mdash;
  but which approximate higher to individuality or self-ness, than do the human tropisms that irresponsibly correlate to
  them.

</p>
<p>Eddie reported a celestial object, from the Observatory at Grahamstown, South Africa. It was in 1890. The New
  Dominant was only heir presumptive then, or heir apparent but not obvious. The thing that Eddie reported might as well
  have been reported by a night watchman, who had looked up through an unplaced sewer pipe.

</p>
<p>It did not correlate.

</p>
<p>The thing was not admitted to <em>Monthly Notices.</em> I think myself that if the Editor had attempted to let it in
  &mdash; earthquake &mdash; or a mysterious fire in his publishing house.

</p>
<p>The Dominants are jealous gods.

</p>
<p>In <em>Nature,</em> presumably a vassal of the new god, though of course also plausibly rendering homage to the old,
  is reported a comet-like body, of Oct. 27, 1890, observed at Grahamstown, by Eddie. It may have looked comet-like, but
  it moved 100 degrees while visible, or one hundred degrees in three-quarters of an hour. See <em>Nature,</em> 43-89,
  90.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>In <em>Nature,</em> 44-519, Prof. Copeland describes a similar appearance that he had seen, Sept. 10, 1891.<a
    href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Dreyer says (<em>Nature,</em> 44-541), that he had seen this object at the Armagh
  Observatory.<a href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> He likens it to the object that was reported by Eddie. It was seen by
  Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, Sept. 11, 1891, in Nova Scotia.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>But the Old Dominant was a jealous god.

</p>
<p>So there were different observations upon something that was seen in November, 1883. These observations were
  Philistines in 1883. In the <em>Amer. Met. Jour.,</em> 1-110, a correspondent reports having seen an object like a
  comet, with two tails, one up and one [276/277] down, Nov. 10 or 12, 1883.<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> Very
  likely this phenomenon should be placed in our expression upon torpedo-shaped bodies that have been seen in the sky
  &mdash; our data upon dirigibles, or super-Zeppelins &mdash; but our attempted classifications are far from rigorous
  &mdash; or are mere gropes. In the <em>Scientific American,</em> 50-40, a correspondent writes from Humacao, Porto
  Rico, that, Nov. 21, 1883, he and several other &mdash; persons &mdash; or persons, as it were &mdash; had seen a
  majestic appearance, like a comet.<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a> Visible three successive nights: disappeared
  then. The Editor says that he can offer no explanation. If accepted, this thing must have been close to the earth. If
  it had been a comet, it would have been seen widely, and the news would have been telegraphed over the world, says the
  Editor. Upon page 97 of this volume of <em>Scientific American,</em> a correspondent writes that, at Sulphur Springs,
  Ohio, he had seen "a wonder in the sky," at about the same date.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> It was
  torpedo-shaped, or something with a nucleus, at each end of which was a tail. Again the Editor says that he can offer
  no explanation: that the object was not a comet. He associates it with the atmospheric events general in 1883. But it
  will be our expression that, in England and Holland, a similar object was seen in November, 1882.

</p>
<p>In the <em>Scientific American,</em> 40-294, is published a letter from Henry Harrison, of Jersey City, copied from
  the <em>N.Y. Tribune:</em> that upon the evening of April 13, 1879, Mr. Harrison was searching for Brorsen's comet,
  when he saw an object that was moving so rapidly that it could not have been a comet.<a
      href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> He called a friend to look, and his observation was confirmed. At two o'clock in
  the morning this object was still visible. In the <em>Scientific American Supplement,</em> 7-2885, Mr. Harrison
  disclaims sensationalism, which he seems to think unworthy, and gives technical details: he says that the object was
  seen by Mr. J. Spencer Devoe, of Manhattenville.<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a> [277]

  stopped in the constellation of Capricorn before changing the direction of its movement. W. De Fonvielle. "Sur
  quelques apparitions analogues à celles du bolide de Marseille." <em>Comptes Rendus,</em> 73 (1871): 513-4. The
  records of observations of meteors cited by De Fonvielle include: one of 45 seconds duration, on September 4, 1848, by
  Lowe, at Nottingham; one of 150 seconds duration, on February 5, 1850, by W.H. Weekes, (as "Welkes"); one of more than
  60 seconds duration, on the night of August 10-11, 1849, by Lowe, (as "Laude"), at Nottingham; and, one of 450 seconds
  duration, on July 9, 1686, by Kirch, at Leipzig. The meteor observed by Lowe on September 4, 1848, left a "streak of
  blue light," and this trail was indicated to have "lasted 3/4 min. before it finally vanished." None of the meteors
  observed by Lowe, at Nottingham, and by W.R. Birt, at Bethnal Green, London, during the meteor shower of August 10-11,
  1849, were said to persist for a minute; however, both observers noted that second meteors appeared to follow the same
  path as the first meteor observed as long as two minutes or as little as a few seconds later; for example, Birt
  reports: "<em>b</em> No. 5. Within a very short interval, I should say less than a minute, another meteor, of
  precisely the same size and exhibiting precisely the same characters in every respect, not one excepted, appeared just
  beyond the point of disappearance of <em>b</em> No. 4. Its path appeared to be a prolongation of that of <em>b</em>
  No. 4, and it disappeared in exactly the same manner...." Baden Powell. "A catalogue of observations of luminous
  meteors." <em>Annual Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,</em> 1849; 1-53, at 14, 25-9,
  48-53. At Sandwich, Kent, on February 5, 1850, Weekes observed a meteor, which was stationary in the sky west of Orion
  and which grew from a speck of light to a "red-hot iron ball" with about a third of the moon's diameter; the meteor
  appeared "stationary at first, for 1 min. 45 secs., till explosion, after which main body slowly moved horizontally
  for 45 secs."; though the path of the "main body" was parallel to the horizon to the east, a shower of fiery red
  fragments "descended perpendicularly to the earth"; and, this "brillliant shower of variegated fire" remained visible
  "fully 3 minutes after the primary body had disappeared." Baden Powell. "On observations of luminous meteors." <em>Annual
    Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,</em> 1851; 1-52, at 2-3, 38. Halley writes, of
  Gottfreid Kirch's observation, thus: "And though the Observer says of it, <em>immotus perstitit per semi-quadrantem
    hor�;</em> 'tis not to be understood that it kept its Place like a Fixt Star, all the time of its Appearance; but
  that it had no very remarkable progressive motion." Edmund Halley. "An account of several extraordinary meteors or
  lights in the sky." <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London,</em> 29 (October-December 1714;

  météore signalé r�cemment par M. Coggia." <em>Comptes Rendus,</em> 73 (1871): 755-6. Guillemin provides no duration
  nor the date of an object seen over Paris in 1853; and, he claims "a globe of fire" was observed over Kilkenny,
  Ireland, for an hour, on December 26, 1737. However, the date of this observation was December 5, 1737, (not December
  26); on this date, a red-coloured auroral display was observed across much of Europe, from Italy to Scotland; and, it
  is described thus: "This same Ph�nomenon was of great Extent in the Northern Parts of Europe; and at Kilkenny in
  Ireland, was seen somewhat like a Globe of Fire suspended in the Air for near space of an Hour; which then bursting,
  spread Flames around on every Side." Thomas Stack. "An account of a book intitled, <em>Observationes de Aere &amp;
