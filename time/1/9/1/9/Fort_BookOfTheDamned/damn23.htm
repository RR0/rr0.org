<p>TEXT-BOOKS tell us that the Dhurmsalla meteorites were picked up "soon," or "within half an hour." Given a little
  time the conventionalists may argue that these stones were hot when they fell, but that their great interior coldness
  had overcome the molten state of their surfaces.

</p>
<p>According to the Deputy Commissioner of Dhurmsalla, these stones had been picked up "immediately" by passing coolies.

</p>
<p>These stones were so cold that they benumbed the fingers. But they had fallen with a great light. It was described as
  "a flame of fire described as about two feet in depth and nine feet in length." Acceptably this light was not the
  light of molten matter.

</p>
<p>In this chapter we are very intermediatistic &mdash; and unsatisfactory. To the intermediatist there is but one
  answer to all questions:

</p>
<p>Sometimes and sometimes not.

</p>
<p>Another form of this intermediatist "solution" of all problems is:

</p>
<p>Yes and no.

</p>
<p>Everything that is, also isn't.

</p>
<p>A positive attempts to formulate: so does the intermediatist, but with less rigorousness: he accepts but also denies:
  he may seem to accept in one respect and deny in some other respect, but no real line can be drawn between any two
  aspects of anything. The intermediatist accepts that which seems to correlate with something that he has accepted as a
  dominant. The positivist correlates with a belief.

</p>
<p>In the Dhurmsalla meteorites we have support for our expression that things entering this earth's atmosphere
  sometimes shine with a light that is not the light of incandescence &mdash; or so we account, or offer an expression
  upon, "thunderstones," or carved stones that have fallen luminously to this earth, in streaks that have looked like
  strokes of lightning &mdash; but we accept, also, that some things that have entered this earth's atmosphere,
  disintegrate with the intensity of flame and molten matter &mdash; but some things, we accept, enter this earth's
  atmosphere and collapse non-luminously, quite like deep-sea fishes brought to the surface of the ocean. Whatever
  [268/269] agreement we have is an indication that somewhere aloft there is a medium denser than this earth's
  atmosphere. I suppose our stronghold is in that such is not popular belief &mdash;

</p>
<p>Or the rhythm of all phenomena:

</p>
<p>Air dense at sea level upon this earth &mdash; less and less dense as one ascends &mdash; then denser and denser. A
  good many bothersome questions arise &mdash;

</p>
<p>Our attitude:

</p>
<p>Here are the data:

</p>
<p>Luminous rains sometime fall (<em>Nature,</em> March 9, 1882; <em>Nature,</em> 25-437).<a href="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
  This is light that is not the light of incandescence, but no one can say that these occasional, or rare, rains come
  from this earth's externality. We simply note cold light of falling bodies. For luminous rain, snow, and dust, see
  Hartwig, "Aerial World," p. 319.<a href="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> As to luminous clouds, we have more nearly definite
  observations and opinions: they mark transition between the Old Dominant and the New Dominant. We have already noted
  the transition in Prof. Schwedoff's theory of external origin of some hailstones &mdash; and the implications that, to
  a former generation, seemed so preposterous &mdash;
  "droll" was the word &mdash; that there are in inter-planetary regions volumes of water &mdash; whether they have
  fishes and frogs in them or not. Now our acceptance is that clouds sometimes come from external regions, having had
  origin from super-geographical lakes and oceans that we shall not attempt to chart, just at present &mdash; only
  suggesting to enterprising aviators &mdash; and we note that we put it all up to them, and show no inclination to go
  Columbussing on our own account &mdash; that they take bathing suits, or, rather, deep-sea diving-suits along. So then
  that some clouds come from inter-planetary oceans &mdash; of the Super-Sargasso Sea &mdash; if we still accept the
  Super-Sargasso Sea
  &mdash; and shine, upon entering this earth's atmosphere. In <em>Himmel und Erde,</em> Feb., 1889 &mdash; a phenomenon
  of transition of thirty years ago &mdash; Herr O. Jesse, in his observations upon luminous night-clouds, notes the
  great height of them, and drolly or sensibly suggests that some of them may have come from regions external to this
  earth.<a href="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a> I suppose he means only from other planets. But it's a very droll and
  sensible idea either way.

</p>
<p>In general I am accounting for a great deal of this earth's isolation: that it is relatively isolated by
  circumstances that are similar to the circumstances that make for relative isolation of the bottom of the ocean
  &mdash; except that there is a clumsiness of analogy now. To call ourselves deep-sea fishes has been convenient, but,
  in a quasi- [269/270] existence, there is no convenience that will not sooner or later turn awkward &mdash; so, if
  there be denser regions aloft, these regions should now be regarded as analogues of far-submerged oceanic regions, and
  things coming to this earth would be like things rising to an attenuated medium &mdash; and exploding &mdash;
  sometimes incandescently, sometimes with cold light &mdash; sometimes non-luminously, like deep-sea fishes brought to
  the surface &mdash; altogether conditions of inhospitality. I have a suspicion that, in their own depths, deep-sea
  fishes are not luminous. If they are, Darwinism is mere jesuitism, in attempting to correlate them.<a
      href="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> Such advertising would so attract attention that all advantages would be more than
  offset. Darwinism is largely a doctrine of concealment: here we have brazen proclamation &mdash; if accepted. Fishes
  in the Mammoth Cave need no light to see by. We might have an expression that deep-sea fishes turn luminous upon
  entering a less dense medium &mdash; but models in the American Museum of Natural History: specialized organs of
  luminosity upon these models.<a href="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> Of course we do remember that awfully convincing
  "dodo," and some of our sophistications we trace to him &mdash; at any rate disruption is regarded as a phenomenon of
  coming from a dense to a less dense medium.

</p>
<p>An account by M. Acharius, in the <em>Transactions of the Swedish Academy of Sciences,</em> 1808-215, translated for
  the <em>North American Review,</em> 3-319:<a href="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That M. Acharius, having heard of "an extraordinary and probably hitherto unseen phenomenon," reported from near the
  town of Skeninge, Sweden, investigated:

</p>
<p>That, upon the 16th of May, 1808, at about 4 p.m., the sun suddenly turned dull brick-red. At the same time there
  appeared, upon the western horizon, a great number of round bodies, dark brown, and seemingly the size of a hat crown.
  They passed overhead and disappeared in the eastern horizon. Tremendous procession. It lasted two hours. Occasionally
  one fell to the ground. When the place of a fall was examined, there was found a film, which soon dried and vanished.
  Often, when approaching the sun, these bodies seemed to link together, or were then seen to be linked together, in
  groups not exceeding eight, and, under the sun, they were seen to have tails three or four fathoms long. Away from the
  sun the tails were invisible. Whatever their substance may have been, it is described as gelatinous &mdash; "soapy and
  jellied."

</p>
<p>I place this datum here for several reasons. It would have been a good climax to our expression upon hordes of small
  bodies that, in [270/271] our acceptance, were not seeds, nor birds, nor ice-crystals: but the tendency would have
  been to jump to the homogeneous conclusion that all our data in that expression related to this one kind of phenomena,
  whereas we conceive of infinite heterogeneity of the external: of crusaders and rabbles and emigrants and tourists and
  dragons and things like gelatinous hat crowns. Or that all things, here, upon this earth, that flock together, are not
  necessarily sheep, Presbyterians, gangsters, or porpoises. The datum is important to us, here, as indication of
  disruption in this earth's atmosphere &mdash; dangers in entering this earth's atmosphere.
</p>
<p>I think, myself, that thousands of objects have been seen to fall from aloft, and have exploded luminously, and have
  been called "ball lightning."

</p>
<p>"As to what ball lightning is we have not yet begun to make intelligent guesses." (<em>Monthly Weather Review,</em>
  34-17.)<a href="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>In general, it seems to me that when we encounter the opposition "ball lightning" we should pay little attention, but
  confine ourselves to guesses that are at least intelligent, that stand phantom-like in our way. We note here that in
  some of our acceptances upon intelligence we should more clearly have pointed out that they were upon the intelligent
  as opposed to the instinctive. In the <em>Monthly Weather Review,</em> 33-409, there is an account of "ball lightning"
  that struck a tree.<a href="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> It made a dent such as a falling object would make. Some other
  time I shall collect instances of "ball lightning," to express that they are instances of objects that have fallen
  from the sky, luminously, exploded terrifically. So bewildered is the old orthodoxy by these phenomena that many
  scientists have either denied "ball lightning" or have considered it very doubtful. I refer to Dr. Sestier's list of
  one hundred and fifty instances, which he considered authentic.<a href="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>In accord with our disaccord is an instance related in the <em>Monthly Weather Review,</em> March, 1887
  &mdash; something that fell luminously from the sky, accompanied by something that was not so affected, or that was
  dark:<a href="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That, according to Capt. C. D. Swart, of the Dutch bark, <em>J. P. A.,</em> upon March 19, 1887, N. 37 39', W. 57
  00', he encountered a severe storm. He saw two objects in the air above the ship. One was luminous, and might be
  explained in several ways, but the other was dark. One or both fell into the sea, with a roar and the casting up of
  billows. It is our acceptance that these things had [271/272] entered this earth's atmosphere, having first crashed
  through a field of ice &mdash;
  "immediately afterward lumps of ice fell."

</p>
<p>One of the most astonishing of the phenomena of "ball lightning" is a phenomenon of many meteorites: violence of
  explosion out of all proportion to size and velocity. We accept that the icy meteorites of Dhurmsalla could have
  fallen with no great velocity, but the sound from them was tremendous. The soft substance that fell at the Cape of
  Good Hope was carbonaceous, but was unburned, or had fallen with velocity insufficient to ignite it. The tremendous
  report that it made was heard over an area more than seventy miles in diameter.<a href="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>That some hailstones have been formed in a dense medium, and violently disintegrate in this earth's relatively thin
  atmosphere:

</p>
<p><em>Nature,</em> 88-350:<a href="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>Large hailstones noted at the University of Missouri, Nov. 11, 1911: they exploded with sounds like pistols shots.
  The writer says that he had noticed a similar phenomenon, eighteen years before, at Lexington, Kentucky. Hailstones
  that seemed to have been formed in a denser medium: when melted under water they gave out bubbles larger than their
  central air spaces. (<em>Monthly Weather Review,</em> 33-445.)<a href="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>Our acceptance is that many objects have fallen from the sky, but that many of them have disintegrated violently.
  This acceptance will co�rdinate with data still to come, but, also, we make it easy for ourselves in expressions upon
  super-constructions, if we're asked why, from thinkable wrecks of them, girders, plates, or parts recognizably of
  manufactured metal have not fallen from the sky. However, as to composition, we have not this refuge, so it is our
  expression that there have been reported instances of the fall of manufactured metal from the sky.

</p>
<p>The meteorite of Rutherford, North Carolina, is of artificial material: mass of pig iron. It is said to be
  fraudulent. (<em>Amer. Jour. Sci.,</em> 2-34-298.)<a href="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>The object that was said to have fallen at Marblehead, Mass., in 1858, is described in the <em>Amer. Jour. Sci.,</em>
  2-25-135, as a "furnace product, formed in smelting copper ores, or iron ores containing copper."<a
      href="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a> It is said to be fraudulent.

</p>
<p>According to Ehrenburg, the substance reported by Capt. Callam to have fallen upon his vessel, near Java, "offered
  complete resemblance to the residue resulting from combustion of a steel wire in a flask of oxygen." (Zurcher,
  "Meteors," p. 239.)<a href="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a> <em>Nature,</em> Nov. 21, [272/273] 1878, publishes a notice
  that, according to the Yuma <em>Sentinel,</em> a meteorite that "resembles steel" had been found in the Mohave Desert.<a
      href="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> In <em>Nature,</em> Feb. 15, 1894, we read that one of the meteorites brought to
  the United States by Peary, from Greenland, is of tempered steel.<a href="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a> The opinion is
  that meteoric iron had fallen in water or snow, quickly cooling and hardening. This does not apply to composition.
  Nov. 5, 1908, <em>Nature</em> publishes a notice of a paper by Prof. Berwerth, of Vienna, upon "the close connection
  between meteoric iron and steel-works' steel."<a href="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a>

</p>
<p>At the meeting of Nov. 24, 1906, of the Essex Field Club, was exhibited a piece of metal said to have fallen from the
  sky, Oct. 9, 1906, at Braintree. According to the <em>Essex Naturalist,</em> Dr. Fletcher, of the British Museum, had
  declared this metal to be smelted iron &mdash; "so that the mystery of the reported `fall' remained unexplained."<a

<p>"The rare phenomena of luminous rain, hail, or snow, also belong to the domain of electricity. In 1761 the famous

  thunder, which emitted sparks as it fell, so that the ground seemed covered with glowing waves.

</p>
<p>"Luminous snow was seen by Forskall on April 22, 1759, at Upsala, and the same phenomenon occurred on Loch Aire, in
  Argyleshire, in March 1823; and on January 25, 1822, near Freiberg, in Saxony, when it was witnessed in two different
  places.

</p>
<p>"Luminous dust has likewise been observed. During the eruption of Vesuvius in 1794, the extremely fine dust which
  fell upon the town of Naples emitted a weak but clearly discernable phosphoric gleam. An English gentleman who was at
  the time in a boat near Torre del Greco, remarked that his hat and those of the sailors, as well as those parts of the
  sail on which the dust had collected, emitted a similar faint glimmering of light."

  vision and luminous organs.
