<p class="abstract">Mr. <span class="people" title="Charles Fort">Fort</span>'s Record of Strange Happenings</p>
<p>In our view of the universe we accept the conclusions of science as unreservedly as our medieval ancestors accepted
  the pronouncements of the Church. True, we would not burn a man for denying the law of gravitation or insisting the
  earth is flat, but we would certainly set him down as crazy; and this is apt to prove quite as effective a
  punishment.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. <span class="people">Fort</span> is not in the least afraid of being adjudged crazy or being subjected to
  any other penalty for challenging the prevalent conception of the "immutable" laws of nature. He assembles large
  masses of outlandish, unreasonable, impossible phenomena that have appeared in different parts of the globe and hurls
  them at the devoted head of dogmatic science. Mr. Fort's phenomena are absolutely damned by every canon of orthodox
  theory; they cannot be explained in the light of any current conception of the universe. They are a strange and motley
  crew, this assemblage of the damned; mysterious bodies observed in the sky by sailors at sea, unrecognized footprints
  discovered in the snow by Devonshire peasants, blood and stones unaccountably falling out of the air and recorded in
  sober scientific journals.</p>
<p>Out of his host of damned occurrences the author evolves an iconoclastic metaphysical system. He labels this system
  intermediatism. All phenomena merge imperceptibly into one another. No single fact can be proved, no single fact can
  be defined, no single fact can be separated from its context. All things are part of an unending chain of the universe
  that cannot be broken into component parts. Mr. Fort attacks conventional theories with the keen logic of an Athenian
  sophist. Take, for example, the following reductio ad absurdum, which he employs in analyzing Darwinism:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fittest survive.</p>
  <p>What is meant by the fittest?</p>
  <p>Not the strongest; not the cleverestâ€”</p>
  <p>Weakness and stupidity everywhere survive.</p>
  <p>There is no way of determining fitness except in that a thing does survive.</p>
  <p>'Fitness,' then, is only another name for 'survival.'</p>
  <p>Darwinism: "That survivors survive.</p></blockquote>
<p>Merely as a record of amazing events "<a href="/time/1/9/1/9/Fort_BookOfTheDamned">The Book of the Damned</a>" makes
  fascinating reading. No imaginative fiction writer could conjure up stranger visions than Mr. Fort creates in his
  collection of mysterious happenings all over the world calculated to confuse any Horatio and his philosophy. In the
  Middle Ages science disposed of disturbing facts by declaring that they did not exist and showing that Aristotle had
  no record of them. Mr. Fort's phenomena cannot be disposed of so easily. Unless his book is smothered by a conspiracy
  of silence it should provoke an extremely lively series of scientific controversies.</p>
