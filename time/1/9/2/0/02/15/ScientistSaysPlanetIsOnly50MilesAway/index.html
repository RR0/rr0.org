  With Other Bodies.</p>

<p class="abstract">Declares That Some Nearby Planet Will Give World New Disease. </p>
<p>
  New York, Feb. 14.â€”Whether wireless disturbances are attempts at interplanetary communication or not, there are
  astronomical bodies within 50 miles of the earth's surface which have attempted for some time to come into
  communication with the earth, and such communication will be established more quickly than scientists realize,
  according to <span class="people">Charles Fort</span>, author of "<a href="/time/1/9/1/9/Fort_BookOfTheDamned">The
  Book of the Damned</a>."</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="people">Fort</span> believes it may be one of a number of non-luminous planets closely adjacent to
  the earth's surface which is attempting to establish contact with us.</p>
<p><q>There is a large mass of data,</q> the scientist declares, <q>which points to the fact that there are planets
  within a few hundred, some perhaps within 50 miles of the earth's surface. Thus, for example, there have been many
  unexplained eclipses which coincided with earthquakes; these incidents lead to the conclusion that some other planet
  is at that time close to the earth, but that, because it is not light-reflecting, it has not yet been observed. There
  are at least 30 eclipses on record which point strongly to the conclusion that a piquet passed between the earth and
  the sun in such close proximity as to cause perturbations within the earth itself.</q></p>
<p>The best substantiated instances of attempts to communicate with the earth, says Mr. <span class="people">Fort</span>,
  are those in which luminous hieroglyphics were seen in the sky by correspondents to the American Meteorological
  Magazine and to the English Mechanic. These hieroglyphics were well formed and persisted for a considerable period of
  time.</p>
<p>Strange dangers lurk in the wake of these swiftly moving planets, according to the calculations of this scientist.
  There is the danger of earthquakes, of large falling masses of collisions and even of new and hitherto unknown
  diseases. Mr. <span class="people">Fort</span> has collated incidents on record of falling vegetable, animal and
  mineral matter, decaying and germinating plants, putrefying fishes and other substances which point to the passage
  close by of other inhabited planets.</p>
<h2>Violent Epidemics</h2>
<p><q>New and virulent epidemics may fall upon the earth from some closely traveling planet,</q> explained Mr. <span
    class="people">Fort</span>. <q>On several occasions swift plagues have visited the earth. We may expect, without
  doubt, that some nearby planet will give the world a new disease. It is a matter of record that putrid falling bodies
  have dropped upon the earth from an undiscoverable place. And these bodies, putrid and bacteria bearing, may be
  disease carriers.</q></p>
<p>Mr. <span class="people">Fort</span> maintains that the <a
    href="/science/discipline/hard/nat/mat/phys/classic/meca">Newtonian theory</a>, although correct as far as it goes,
  it fundamentally wrong in rejecting the theory of repulsion as a complement to the law of gravitation. Astronomers, he
  says, are too lazy to admit the truth of repulsion because they would then be forced to make their calculations and
  formulae all over again. </p>
