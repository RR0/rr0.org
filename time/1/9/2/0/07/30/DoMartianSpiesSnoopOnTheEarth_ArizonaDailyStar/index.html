<p>Spies from another world—celestial emissaries—may walk Earth, planning the destruction of man, the annihilation of
  his civilization and the annexation of his globe!</p>
<p>The ponderous skyships of rival worlds have sailed the air of Earth, and even traversed its seas, says <span
    class="people">Charles Fort</span>, author of the "<a href="/time/1/9/1/9/Fort_BookOfTheDamned">Book of the
  Damned</a>."</p>
<p>What is more probable, then, than that they have sent investigators here to work and watch an plan against the time
  when invasion will take place?</p>
<p><span class="people">Fort</span> presents no argument, has no propaganda and claims no purpose but the confusion of
  <a href="/science">science</a>. In 500 pages he sets forth the alleged facts of alleged phenomena that <a
      href="/science">science</a>, he holds, has never satisfactorily explained.</p>
<p>These are the "damned facts." They are "damned" because they are excluded by <a href="/science">science</a>. <span
    class="people">Fort</span> makes them march in a fools' parade, up and down and all around, and every few pages
  challenges <a href="/science">science</a> to explain.</p>
<p>There have been, says <span class="people">Fort</span>, and offers the dates and accounts of reputable scientific
  journals—</p>
<p>Falls from the sky of stones, frogs, ice, blood, oil, metal, birds, strange plants and unidentified substances.</p>
<p>Huge wheeled chariots or luminous fire, seen by mariners at sea.</p>
<p>Dark bodies—small worlds of magnificent celestial transports—between the sun and the earth and the earth and the moon
  even.</p>
<p>Curious markings made on the surface of the earth and curious markings on stones that have fallen.</p>
<h2>"Pipe dreams?"</h2>
<p><a href="/science">Science</a> has blithely explained the strange "falls" with its axiom—"all that comes down must
  have gone up." It has said that if stones actually fell they must have been carried into the aid by a volcano or
  a cyclone.</p>
<p>Of the mysterious and luminous shapes that sailors report scholars have said are "optical hallucination," which is a
  scholar's way of saying—"pipe dreams." Nevertheless—the reports have been numerous and have been made by trustworthy
  sea captains and their crews.</p>
<p>But on the "dark shapes between the sun" matter. <span class="people">Fort</span> rather "sticks" his opponents. <a
    href="/people/astronomes.html">Astronomers</a> have seen such shapes and pondered and wondered and finally "given it
  up."</p>
<p>So—<span class="people">Fort</span> summarizes—it is easier to believe than it is not to believe, that—</p>
<p>Great worlds have come close to ours.</p>
<p>Leviathans of the ethers, carrying passengers and huge freight cargoes, have sailed within our atmosphere; been
  wrecked occasionally in ice fields of the upper strata and their fuel and the contents of the pantries dumped on
  earth.</p>
<p>By some unexplained means the inhabitants of another <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete">planet</a> have
  contrived to mark ou earth with "cup marks" and strange hieroglyphics on rocks—not for our edification, but for the
  instruction of their spies left here by the great skyships.</p>
<hr>
<p>Regardless of whether <span class="people">Fort</span> can convince us of the truth of his beliefs of the meanings of
  things, the "Book of the Damned" does make one stop to wonder if science really reads the language of Earth happenings
  accurately.</p>
