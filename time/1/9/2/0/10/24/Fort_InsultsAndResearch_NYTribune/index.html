<p>The New York Public Library has branded "<a href="/time/1/9/1/9/Fort_BookOfTheDamned/index.html">The Book of the
  Damned</a>" with big, white letters, "O A Z". All books with this class-mark are catalogued under "Eccentric
  Literature." I have assembled, in this book, hundreds of accounts of astonishing objects and substances that have
  fallen from the sky, or from vast, dirigible constructions that have been seen close to this earth. Even with all its
  heresies, "Popular Astronomy" and other scientific publications have reviewed the book respectfully. It represents
  enormous labor. In my opinion this action by the library is not good for independent research in the United States.
