<p class="note">Excerpt of a longer article on weather statistics, in particular lightning, hail, fireballs, halos and
  northern lights and other remarkable atmospheric phenomena in the skies above the Netherlands for 1917 and 1918,
  remarking that 1917 and especially 1918 saw a huge increase in halo and northern light sightings</p>
<p>The very first lightning strike report of this year, of January 9th, stems from Hollum on the island of Ameland and
  involves two servicemen who were struck on the beach, none of them lethal. In the report it is also remarked that "on
  the moustache of one images were observed". A remark as this one recalls the fantastic sounding stories that appear
  from time to time in the old thunderstorm accounts. It is though, not at all doubtful that really very puzzling traces
  are left behind by lightning, and it is always welcomed, when the observers of the effects of lightning enclose a
  description or sketch and especially if there is a special cause for it, a photo with their report. As it happens now
  and then.</p>
