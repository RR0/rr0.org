<p>UTICA, N.Y., July [illegible]. - A house on a lonely road near here in which Mr. and Mrs. William Ashley and their
  family recently moved is the scene of a mysterious phenomenon. For several weeks stones as large as billiard balls
  have been dropping on the house, apparently out of a clear sky. They fall perpendicularly, as if dropped, not thrown.
  All efforts to explain their source have been vain.</p>
