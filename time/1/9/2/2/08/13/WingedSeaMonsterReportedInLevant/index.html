    <p>After a long absence, the sea monster has appeared once more. According to reports just received from
      Constantinople and Smyrna, the elusive creature is disporting itself in the placid waters of the Mediterranean,
      terrifying fishermen and crews of the feluccas and other small craft which ply along the shores of the Levant.</p>
    <p> The most thrilling story was brought here last week by officers of the Greek Liner Constantinople, who said that
      motor launches armed with one- pounder quick-firing guns were searching the sea of Marmora for a winged marine
      monster which had been circling Dog Island at great speed for three of four days. </p>
    <p>When it rose from the sea and flew over San Stefano toward the city of Stamboul it was reported to have made a
      booming sound like the German triplanes that flew over Paris during the war. How the huge marine monster passed
      through the Dardanelles without causing a big wash along the shore has not yet been discovered.</p>
    <p>Officers on the <em>Constantinople</em> said that the flying sea serpent was first reported off the ancient port
      of Chalcis in the Aegean Sea and so alarmed the sponge divers that an appeal was sent to Athens to send a gunboat
      to search for the monster and destroy it. When the commander of the fort fired a gun in the direction indicated by
      the scared sponge divers the serpent rose to an altitude of 5,000 feet and flew away toward the port of Smyrna,
      Asia Minor, where it was reported next day to have sunk two caciques laden with figs and pistachio nuts.</p>
    <p>Zubdee Effendu, a Turkish rug merchant who arrived from Smyrna on the liner, said that he saw the scaly-winged
      monster quite plainly as he was crossing the bay to his home on one of the islands. When the head rose from the
      surface of the water, he said, all the natives on board flung themselves on the deck and prayed, while the vessel
      rocked wildly and the sea was covered with white foam as if it was being violently agitated underneath.</p>
    <p>The head of the nautical reptile was fully 10 feet across, with two enormous reddish green eyes butting out on
      either bow like a ship's sidelights, while its immense flappers looked as if they weighed a ton each. Its beam
      across the middle of the back, which rose high out of the water, Zubdee Effendi continued, was fifteen feet and
      the length over all was fully fifty feet.</p>
    <p>When the sea serpent turned its head toward the boat the heat on deck became unbearable, said the Turkish rug
      merchant. He felt that his beard was shriveling up. Finally the monster dived, flung its huge tail into the air
      with a swish that nearly sent the small schooner over on its beam ends and then disappeared from view.</p>
    <p>Within a few days the flying sea serpent, Zubdee Effendi said, was reported off the mouth of the Nile at
      Damletta, the port of Candia in Crete, and off the island of Mitilene, where it was stated to have rammed and sunk
      a felucca laden with currants because one of the crew struck the reptile in the eye with a pomegranate. Sponge
      divers and pearl fishers in the Aegean Sea are reported to be taking a rest until the sea serpent has been
      destroyed.</p>
