<p>For many years "mysterious lights" have been seen near Brown Mountain, in the northern part of Burke County, N.C.,
  about 12 miles northwest of Morganton. Some have thought, that these lights were of supernatural origin; others have
  dreamed that they might indicate enormous mineral deposits; and many who have not had such visions have looked upon
  them as a natural wonder that lent interest to all vacation trips to the region.</p>
<p>In October 1913 at the urgent request of Representative E. Y. Webb, of North Carolina, a member of the U.S.
  Geological Survey, D. B. Sterrett, was sent to Brown Mountain to observe these lights and to determine their origin.
  After a few days investigation Mr. Sterrett declared that the lights were nothing but locomotive headlights seen over
  the mountain from the neighboring heights. This explanation was too simple and prosaic to please anyone who was
  looking for some supernatural or unusual cause of the lights, and when they were seen after the reat flood of 1916,
  while no trains were running in the vicinity, even some of those who had accepted Mr. Sterrett's explanation felt
  compelled to abandon it.</p>
<p>As time went on, the interest in the lights became more general, and as one after another local investigator failed
  to discover their origin, the mystery seemed to grow deeper. Finally, Senators Simmons and Overman prevailed upon the
  Geological Survey to make a second and more thorough investigation of these puzzling lights. The present writer, to
  whom the task of making this investigation was assigned, spent 2 weeks near Brown Mountain in March and April 1922 and
  took observations on seven evenings, on four of them until after midnight, from hillsides that afforded favorable
  views of the lights. The results of the work are reported here.</p>
