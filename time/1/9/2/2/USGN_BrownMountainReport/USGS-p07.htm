<p>In the article published in the Charlotte Daily Observer in September 1913, it was stated that the lights were first
  observed from a place near Lovenls Hotel, at Cold Spring, and as late as November 1915, Mr. Scott, in his newspaper
  article cited above, states that "Mr. Loven's is the only place from which has been seen the mysterious light that
  rises over Brown Mountain. " By the spring of 1916, however, the lights were being observed from several places near
  Lenoir. More recently they were seen from Blowing Rock, which is visited by many tourists, who find accornmodations at
  several flourishing hotels. The lights furnish one of the many attractions afforded by this remarkably well situated
  and delightful little town. Among the other localities from which the Brown Mountain lights are said to have been seen
  are the slopes of Gingercake Mountain, about a mile and a half southwest of Cold Spring, and the toll gate on the
  Yonahlossee road, on the south slope of Grandfather Mountain. It is also reported that they have been seen from
  Morganton and from other points in the valley southeast of Brown Mountain.</p>
<p>It is significant that, though many persons have from time to time camped on Brown Mountain and have spent nights
  watching for the lights, yet, so far as the writer has been able to ascertain, <u>no one has actually observed the
    light on Brown Mountain when he himself was on that mountain</u>, but, as in Dr. Corfey's observation, it has been
  seen from Brown Mountain as apparently over Adams Mountain or some hills farther south. Monroe Coffey and Theodore
  Crump, of the U.S. Forest Service, have spent many nights in and about Brown Mountain and have built a fire-control
  station on the summit of the mountain near the cabin of the Brown Mountain club, but at the time of the writer's visit
  neither of them had ever seen the Brown Mountain light.</p>
