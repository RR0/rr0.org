<p>In his letter to Senator Simmons already cited, Colonel Harris writes as follows concerning the light:</p>
<p>"It is a pale white light, as one seen through a ground glass globe, and there is a faint, irregularly shaped halo
  around it. It is confined to a prescribed circle, appearing three or fuur times in quick succession, then disappearing
  for 20 minutes or half an hour, when it repeats within the same circle." Prof. W. G. Perry, of the Georgia School of
  Technology, in a letter dated December l5, 1919, addressed to Dr. C. G. Abbot, of the Smithsonian Institution,
  describes the light as seen from the Cold Spring locality as follows:</p>
<p>"We occupied a position on a high ridge. Across several intervening ridges rose Brown Mountain, some 8 miles away.
  After sunset we began to watch the Brown Mountain direction. Suddenly there blazed in the sky, apparently above the
  mountain, near one end of it, a steadily glowing ball of light. It appeared to be about 10 above the upper line of the
  mountain, blazed with a slightly yellow light, lasted about half a minute, and then abruptly disappeared. It was not
  unlike the "star" from a bursting sky rocket or Roman candle, though brighter * * *.</p>
<p>"We were impressed with the following facts: The region about Brown Mountain and between our location and the
  mountain is a wild, practically uninhabited mountain region--a confusion of mountain peaks, ridges, and valleys.
  Viewing the lights from a fixed position our estimate of their location was most inexact; the varying color (almost a
  white, yellowish, reddish) may have been due to mist in the atmosphere; the view of the lights was a direct one and
  not a reflection; there seemed to be no regularity in their time of appearance; they came suddenly into being, blazed
  steadily, and as suddenly disappeared; they appeared against the sky and not against the side of the mountain.</p>
<p>"Others who have seen this phenomenon make very different reports of their observation; and some who have seen it
  several times report that they have seen it in varying fashion; sometimes the light appears stationary (as was
  uniformly the case when I saw it) ; sometimes it appears to move rapidl--upward, downward, horizontally."</p>
<p>Rev. C. E. Gregory is reported to have noted upon one occasion that the light appeared like a ball of incandescent
  gas, in which a seething motion could be observed.</p>
