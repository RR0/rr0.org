            <p>over the Brown Mountain mass. About<br> 9:30 the party made a circuit from<br> the summit to the hill
              above Parke<br> Cree, in the south-central part of<br> the mountain) returning to the summit<br> shortly
              before midnight. Had any<br> lights arisen over the mountain mass<br> some member of the party would prob-<br>
              ably have seen them) but none<br> appeared.</p>
            <p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
            <p>The writer feels confident that the<br> lights he saw were actually a fair<br> average display of the
              so-called<br> Brown Mountain light. He not only has<br> Mr. Loven's word to sustain this con-<br> clusion,
              but he is certain that the<br> lights he saw agree closely in ap-<br> pearance and behavior with those<br>
              originally described in the Charlotte<br> Daily Observer and by Professor Perry.<br> The lights observed
              have nothing in<br> common with the Andes light or with<br> St. Elmo's fire. There is no geologic<br>
              basis for the idea that the lights<br> seen are natural wonders of any sort,<br> but there are certain
              interesting<br> surface features and atmospheric con-<br> ditions that are effective in pro-<br> ducing
              some of the appearances of the<br> light.</p>
            <p>By reference to the map it will be<br> noted that the Catawba Valley east of<br> Marion is a basinlike
              area--an area<br> nearly surrounded by mountains, of<br> which the Blue Ridge on the north,<br> with its
              fringe of southward-project-<br> ing spurs, is the highest and most<br> rugged part. After sunset cool air<br>
              begins to creep down the tributary<br> valleys into the basin, but the air<br> currents come from
              different sources<br> and are of different temperature and<br> density. The atmospheric conditions<br> in
              the basin are therefore very un-<br> stable, especially in the earlier<br> part of the evening, before any
              well-<br> defined circulatory system becomes<br> established. At any given place in<br> the basin the air
              varies in density</p>

            <p>during the evening and hence in re-<br> fractiveness. The denser the air, the<br> more it refracts light
              or bends waves<br> of light emanating from any source.<br> The humidity of the air affects its<br> density
              and hence its refractive pow-<br> er. Mist, dust, and other fine parti-<br> cles tend to obscure and
              scatter the<br> light refracted and to impart to it<br> the reddish or yellowish tints so<br> frequently
              observed. Thus it is that<br> the light is most active in a clear-<br> ing spell after a rain, as noted by<br>
              many observers. When the mist is very<br> dense, the light is completely<br> obscured.</p>
            <p>Lights that arise from any source<br> in the basin are viewed at low angles.<br> Even those observed from
              altitudes of<br> 3,500 or 4,000 feet, the heights of<br> the stations on Gingercake or on<br> Blowing Rock
              Mountain, had vertical<br> angles of less than 3°. Thus, the re-<br> fractive effect of the atmosphere<br>
              through which the light waves must<br> travel is at a maximum.</p>
            <p>The effect of variations in the<br> density of the atmosphere between the<br> observer and the source of
              light is<br> at one time to increase and at another<br> time to diminish the intensity of the<br> light.
              This fact accounts for the<br> flares on lines 1 and 13. The diminu-<br> tion of a light after such a
              flare is<br> so marked that to the casual observer<br> or to one without a fieldglass the<br> light may
              seem to be completely ex-<br> tinguished. In the telescope, however,<br> it still appears in the same
              relative<br> position, though it is somewhat<br> fainter. Lights that are in view for<br> brief periods,
              such as the headlights<br> of automobiles or locomotives, which<br> show only when they are turned<br>
              toward the observer, produce similar<br> flares; but when they are turned in<br> other directions, they
              become extin-<br> guished so far as the observer at a<br> given station is concerned.</p>
            <p>Probably few if any basins on the<br> Blue Ridge front are so favorably</p>
