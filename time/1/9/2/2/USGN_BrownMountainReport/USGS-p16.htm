            <p>located as to show as well as this<br> one the atmospheric phenomena de-<br> scribed, and the
              opportunities here<br> for the observation of such phenomena<br> are perhaps no less exceptional.<br>
              Loven's Hotel and Blowing Rock, which<br> are resorts that attract fishermen or<br> tourists, are among
              the most favor-<br> able places of observation. The valley<br> is fairly well settled and has a net-<br>
              work of roads, three railroads, and<br> several large towns, so that the<br> possible sources of light are
              very<br> numerous.</p>
            <p>As the basin and its atmospheric<br> conditions antedate the earliest<br> settlement of the region, it is
              pos-<br> sible that even among the first set-<br> tlers some favorably situated light<br> may have
              attracted attention by<br> seeming to flare and then diminish or<br> go out, As the country became
              more<br> thickly settled the number of chances<br> for such observations would increase.<br> Before the
              advent of electric lights,<br> however, it is doubtful whether such<br> observations could have been
              suffi-<br> ciently numerous to cause much com-<br> ment, though some persons may have<br> noted and
              remarked upon them.</p>
            <p>According to local estimates elec-<br> tric lights have been in use in the<br> larger towns of the region
              for about<br> 30 years. Lights from those towns<br> viewed from the locality near Loven's,<br> which for a
              long time was the only<br> locality from which the lights were<br> observed, are, with the exception
              of<br> those from Morganton and Blowing Rock,<br> all seen over Brown Mountain hence<br> the "prescribed
              -circle" mentioned by<br> Colonel Harris.</p>
            <p>The use of powerful electric head-<br> lights on railway locomotives, which<br> began about 1909,
              furnished new<br> sources of strong lights in the val-<br> ley and introduced an element of reg-<br>
              ularity in their appearance, which<br> may account for the "punctual regu-<br> larity" noted in the first
              descrip-<br> tion. After Rev. C. E. Gregory took</p>

            <p>up his summer residence near Loven's<br> Hotel, in 1910, the Brown Mountain<br> light began to acquire
              notoriety.<br> Meanwhile, automobiles were coming<br> into use throughout the country, and<br> many of
              them were equipped with pow-<br> erful headlights. Within the last few<br> years their number has been
              greatly<br> 1ncreased, and this fact is in keep-<br> ing with the general deduction al-<br> ready
              made--that on a favorable eve-<br> ning the lights are seen more fre-<br> quently now than formerly.</p>
            <p>During the flood of 1916, when<br> train service was temporarily dis-<br> continued, the basin east of
              Marion,<br> where the atmospheric conditions are<br> disturbed, was still the scene of the<br>
              intermittent flare of favorably sit-<br> uated lights. Automobiles were then<br> in use in the larger
              towns and on<br> some of the intervening roads, and<br> their headlights were doubtless visi-<br> ble from
              Loven's over Brown Mountain.<br> One need only remember the network of<br> roads in the valley region (see
              top-<br> ographic maps of the Morganton and<br> Hickory quadrangles) to realize the<br> almost infinite
              number of possibil-<br> ities for automobile headlights to be<br> pointed toward Brown Mountain and<br>
              stations of observation beyond. It<br> should be emphasized, too, that auto-<br> mobile headlights and
              locomotive<br> headlights, when seen at distances<br> and under atmospheric conditions such<br> as those
              which prevail in this region,<br> possess no characteristic that clear-<br> ly distinguishes them from
              other<br> lights. On the contrary, as stated by<br> the lady at Blowing Rock, they look<br> "as much alike
              as so many peas in a<br> pod,". though this statement should<br> not be understood to mean that some<br>
              may not be brighter than others.<br> Col. Wade H. Harris, in his letter<br> to Senator Simmons already
              cited,<br> says: "A locomotive headlight is eas-<br> ily and unmistakably distinguished as<br> such, not
              only by the rays it shoots<br> forth, but from its movements * * *.</p>
