            <p>It [the Brown Mountain light] is as<br> distinct in characteristics from a<br> locomotive headlight as a
              candle<br> flame is to a naked arc light." Again,<br> in an article in the Charlotte Ob-<br> server for
              March 27, 1922, the same<br> writer adds that "a headlight has<br> characteristics that distinctly and<br>
              unmistakably identify it as such."<br> <br> The writer's observations, <u>made in<br> company with persons
                long familiar<br> with the light</u>, failed to substantiate<br> these statements. Of the 23 lights<br>
              noted by instrumental observation and<br> recorded on lines 1 to 21, seven<br> proved to originate from
              locomotive<br> headlights, and an eighth (No. 19) is<br> probably of similar origin, though<br> the data
              are insufficient to estab-<br> lish that fact, but none of these<br> seven lights cast a beam or possessed<br>
              any special quality that distin-<br> guished it from the other lights ob-<br> served, and only one of them
              (No. 16)<br> was known at the time of observation<br> to be a locomotive headlight. The<br> other six were
              identified as such<br> only after the lines and angles of<br> the record had been plotted, profiles<br>
              had been drawn, and train schedules<br> had been checked some days after the<br> observations were made. A
              locomotive<br> headlight seen at distances such as<br> those from which the Brown Mountain<br> light is
              observed has no visible mo-<br> tion and emits no "rays. II When its<br> line of direction coincides with
              the<br> line of observation, the light flashes<br> on or, if the air is misty, it flares,<br> much as an
              incandescent electric<br> light flares when it is turned on.<br> When its line of direction leaves the<br>
              line of observation, the light flahses<br> appears just as suddenly as it came.<br> The behavior of
              headlights in the<br> Brown Mountain region in this respect<br> is comparable to that of the lights<br> in
              the lighthouses on the Atlantic<br> Coast. From the seawall at Gloucester,<br> Mass., the writer has
              repeatedly seen<br> the light at Minots Ledge, southeast</p>

            <p>of Boston, nearly 25 miles away in a<br> direct line. This light is identified<br> by a series of flashes
              that may be<br> represented by the numerals 1-4-3.<br> There is no beam and there are no<br> rays. The
              light cannot be seen unless<br> the air is fairly clear. Then it<br> simply flashes once, four times,<br>
              three times, and it has much the same<br> appearance as the Brown Mountain<br> light.</p>
            <p>The supposed motion of the light at<br> times may be due to errors of obser-<br> vation. Reference has
              already been<br> made here to the fact that two ob-<br> servers who were present with the<br> writer at
              station A thought they saw<br> the light move when it was actually<br> motionless as seen in the
              telescope.<br> Some years ago McNeilly Du Bose, an<br> engineer then employed near Morganton,<br> tested
              observations made by himself<br> and others by tying a cord across the<br> fork of a tree in a place where
              "he<br> could see the light across the cord<br> and was surprised to find that the<br> light was
              stationary with respect to<br> the cord. Professor Perry. whose let-<br> ter has been quoted, notes that
              the<br> light was uniformly stationary when<br> he saw it. The eye is easily deceived<br> at night as to
              the stability or mo-<br> tion of an object, and an observer's<br> impressions are to a considerable
              ex-<br> tent affected by his mental and phys-<br> ical condition at the time of obser-<br> vation. It is
              not surprising that<br> under the circumstances different<br> eyewitnesses give quite different<br>
              accounts of the light, especially as<br> the light may appear suddenly against<br> a dark background with
              nothing near-<br> by that can be used as a scale to<br> determine its size or its possible<br> motion.</p>
            <p>There remains the question of the<br> identity of the Brown Mountain light<br> as seen from Blowing Rock.
              Mr. Martin<br> specified two requirements: namely,<br> the light must be seen over Brown<br> Mountain and
              it must have motion. The</p>
