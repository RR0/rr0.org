<p>The writer feels confident that the lights he saw were actually a fair average display of the so-called Brown
  Mountain light. He not only has Mr. Loven's word to sustain this conclusion, but he is certain that the lights he saw
  agree closely in appearance and behavior with those originally described in the Charlotte Daily Observer and by
  Professor Perry. The lights observed have nothing in common with the Andes light or with St. Elmo's fire. There is no
  geologic basis for the idea that the lights seen are natural wonders of any sort, but there are certain interesting
  surface features and atmospheric conditions that are effective in producing some of the appearances of the light.</p>
<p>By reference to the map it will be noted that the Catawba Valley east of Marion is a basinlike area--an area nearly
  surrounded by mountains, of which the Blue Ridge on the north, with its fringe of southward-projecting spurs, is the
  highest and most rugged part. After sunset cool air begins to creep down the tributary valleys into the basin, but the
  air currents come from different sources and are of different temperature and density. The atmospheric conditions in
  the basin are therefore very unstable, especially in the earlier part of the evening, before any well-defined
  circulatory system becomes established. At any given place in the basin the air varies in density during the evening
  and hence in refractiveness. The denser the air, the more it refracts light or bends waves of light emanating from any
  source. The humidity of the air affects its density and hence its refractive power. Mist, dust, and other fine
  particles tend to obscure and scatter the light refracted and to impart to it the reddish or yellowish tints so
  frequently observed. Thus it is that the light is most active in a clearing spell after a rain, as noted by many
  observers. When the mist is very dense, the light is completely obscured.</p>
<p>Lights that arise from any source in the basin are viewed at low angles. Even those observed from altitudes of 3500
  ou 4000 pieds, the heights of the stations on Gingercake or on Blowing Rock Mountain, had vertical angles of less than
  3Â°. Thus, the refractive effect of the atmosphere through which the light waves must travel is at a maximum.</p>
<p>The effect of variations in the density of the atmosphere between the observer and the source of light is at one time
  to increase and at another time to diminish the intensity of the light. This fact accounts for the flares on lines 1
  and 13. The diminution of a light after such a flare is so marked that to the casual observer or to one without a
  fieldglass the light may seem to be completely extinguished. In the telescope, however, it still appears in the same
  relative position, though it is somewhat fainter. Lights that are in view for brief periods, such as the headlights of
  automobiles or locomotives, which show only when they are turned toward the observer, produce similar flares; but when
  they are turned in other directions, they become extinguished so far as the observer at a given station is
  concerned.</p>
<p>Probably few if any basins on the Blue Ridge front are so favorably located as to show as well as this one the
  atmospheric phenomena described, and the opportunities here for the observation of such phenomena are perhaps no less
  exceptional. Loven's Hotel and Blowing Rock, which are resorts that attract fishermen or tourists, are among the most
  favorable places of observation. The valley is fairly well settled and has a network of roads, three railroads, and
  several large towns, so that the possible sources of light are very numerous.</p>
<p>As the basin and its atmospheric conditions antedate the earliest settlement of the region, it is possible that even
  among the first settlers some favorably situated light may have attracted attention by seeming to flare and then
  diminish or go out, As the country became more thickly settled the number of chances for such observations would
  increase. Before the advent of electric lights, however, it is doubtful whether such observations could have been
  sufficiently numerous to cause much comment, though some persons may have noted and remarked upon them.</p>
<p>According to local estimates electric lights have been in use in the larger towns of the region for about 30 years.
  Lights from those towns viewed from the locality near Loven's, which for a long time was the only locality from which
  the lights were observed, are, with the exception of those from Morganton and Blowing Rock, all seen over Brown
  Mountain hence the "prescribed -circle" mentioned by Colonel Harris.</p>
<p>The use of powerful electric headlights on railway locomotives, which began about 1909, furnished new sources of
  strong lights in the valley and introduced an element of regularity in their appearance, which may account for the
  "punctual regularity" noted in the first description. After Rev. C. E. Gregory took up his summer residence near
  Loven's Hotel, in 1910, the Brown Mountain light began to acquire notoriety. Meanwhile, automobiles were coming into
  use throughout the country, and many of them were equipped with powerful headlights. Within the last few years their
  number has been greatly 1ncreased, and this fact is in keeping with the general deduction already made--that on a
  favorable evening the lights are seen more frequently now than formerly.</p>
<p>During the flood of 1916, when train service was temporarily discontinued, the basin east of Marion, where the
  atmospheric conditions are disturbed, was still the scene of the intermittent flare of favorably situated lights.
  Automobiles were then in use in the larger towns and on some of the intervening roads, and their headlights were
  doubtless visible from Loven's over Brown Mountain. One need only remember the network of roads in the valley region
  (see topographic maps of the Morganton and Hickory quadrangles) to realize the almost infinite number of possibilities
  for automobile headlights to be pointed toward Brown Mountain and stations of observation beyond. It should be
  emphasized, too, that automobile headlights and locomotive headlights, when seen at distances and under atmospheric
  conditions such as those which prevail in this region, possess no characteristic that clearly distinguishes them from
  other lights. On the contrary, as stated by the lady at Blowing Rock, they look "as much alike as so many peas in a
  pod,". though this statement should not be understood to mean that some may not be brighter than others. Col. Wade H.
  Harris, in his letter to Senator Simmons already cited, says: "A locomotive headlight is easily and unmistakably
  distinguished as such, not only by the rays it shoots forth, but from its movements It [the Brown Mountain light] is
  as distinct in characteristics from a locomotive headlight as a candle flame is to a naked arc light." Again, in an
  article in the Charlotte Observer for March 27, 1922, the same writer adds that "a headlight has characteristics that
  distinctly and unmistakably identify it as such."
</p>
<p>The writer's observations, made in company with persons long familiar with the light, failed to substantiate these
  statements. Of the 23 lights noted by instrumental observation and recorded on lines 1 to 21, seven proved to
  originate from locomotive headlights, and an eighth (No. 19) is probably of similar origin, though the data are
  insufficient to establish that fact, but none of these seven lights cast a beam or possessed any special quality that
  distinguished it from the other lights observed, and only one of them (No. 16) was known at the time of observation to
  be a locomotive headlight. The other six were identified as such only after the lines and angles of the record had
  been plotted, profiles had been drawn, and train schedules had been checked some days after the observations were
  made. A locomotive headlight seen at distances such as those from which the Brown Mountain light is observed has no
  visible motion and emits no "rays. II When its line of direction coincides with the line of observation, the light
  flashes on or, if the air is misty, it flares, much as an incandescent electric light flares when it is turned on.
  When its line of direction leaves the line of observation, the light flashes appears just as suddenly as it came. The
  behavior of headlights in the Brown Mountain region in this respect is comparable to that of the lights in the
  lighthouses on the Atlantic Coast. From the seawall at Gloucester, Mass., the writer has repeatedly seen the light at
  Minots Ledge, southeast of Boston, nearly 25 miles away in a direct line. This light is identified by a series of
  flashes that may be represented by the numerals 1-4-3. There is no beam and there are no rays. The light cannot be
  seen unless the air is fairly clear. Then it simply flashes once, four times, three times, and it has much the same
  appearance as the Brown Mountain light.</p>
<p>The supposed motion of the light at times may be due to errors of observation. Reference has already been made here
  to the fact that two observers who were present with the writer at station A thought they saw the light move when it
  was actually motionless as seen in the telescope. Some years ago McNeilly Du Bose, an engineer then employed near
  Morganton, tested observations made by himself and others by tying a cord across the fork of a tree in a place where
  "he could see the light across the cord and was surprised to find that the light was stationary with respect to the
  cord. Professor Perry. whose letter has been quoted, notes that the light was uniformly stationary when he saw it. The
  eye is easily deceived at night as to the stability or motion of an object, and an observer's impressions are to a
  considerable extent affected by his mental and physical condition at the time of observation. It is not surprising
  that under the circumstances different eyewitnesses give quite different accounts of the light, especially as the
  light may appear suddenly against a dark background with nothing nearby that can be used as a scale to determine its
  size or its possible motion.</p>
<p>There remains the question of the identity of the Brown Mountain light as seen from Blowing Rock. Mr. Martin
  specified two requirements: namely, the light must be seen over Brown Mountain and it must have motion. The element of
  motion has already been considered.</p>
<p>The arc of view intercepted by Brown Mountain is a little greater than the arc between the lines D and F on the
  accompanying map (fig. 1). Line D is drawn to a road that seems to be a thoroughfare near Brindletown. Line E is drawn
  tangent to the Southern Railway near Thermal City. Just east of this line is a thoroughfare and a short distance
  farther east is the track of the Carolina, Clinchfield & Ohio Railway. Line F is drawn to the same road and railroads
  a few miles farther northwest.</p>
<p>Automobile headlights on any of the numerous roads that point toward Blowing Rock within the area designated and
  south of Catawba River would be visible from Blowing Rock over Brown Mountain.</p>
<p>The writer was told at Blowing Rock that a good time to see the light was from 9:30 p.m. to 10 or a little later. The
  agent of the Southern Railway at Thermal City states that a northbound train on that railway passes that station at
  9:30 p.m., maintaining approximately the same schedule the year round. The agent at Glenwood on the same railway
  reports that a train is due there at 9:53 the year round. Data for the other railroad are not available) but doubtless
  there are some northbound evening freight trains on it. The agreement of the train schedule with the above statement
  about the time to see the lights is certainly more than a coincidence.</p>
<p>It may be questioned whether a locomotive headlight could be seen for a distance so great as that between Blowing
  Rock and Thermal City, which is about 45 miles. The Minots Ledge light, already mentioned, is rated at 75,000
  candlepower by the Bureau of Lighthouses and is visible for distances greater than 25 miles. The writer was told by
  Mr. Chadwick, of the Engineering Department of the Southern Railway, that the headlights in common use on that system
  are incandescent nitrogen lamps rated at 250 watts and 32 volts. Fitted with 16- inch silvered-copper parabolic
  reflectors, these lights yield about 600,000 candlepower. There is therefore no reason to doubt that the headlights
  would be visible at a distance of 45 miles.</p>
<p>The high power of these lights accounts for the brilliancy ascribed to the Brown Mountain light by observers who have
  seen it when the air was exceptionally clear, and it also accounts for the fact that some of the lights seen are
  brighter than others. In summary it may be said that the Brown Mountain lights are clearly not of unusual nature or
  origin. About 47 percent of the lights that the writer was able to study instrumentally were due to automobile
  headlights, 33 percent to locomotive headlights, 10 percent to stationary lights, and 10 percent to brush fires.</p>
