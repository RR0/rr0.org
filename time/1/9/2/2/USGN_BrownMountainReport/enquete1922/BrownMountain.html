<p>On April 5 the writer ascended Brown Mountain with a party organized by F. H. May, of Lenoir. Theodore Crump, of the
  Forest Service, kindly placed at the disposal of the party his station on the summit of the mountain. Rain and fog
  interfered with the observations, but watch was kept from about 8 to 10:30 p.m. and again from 12:15 to 12:45 a.m. No
  lights were seen. On the following day, April 6, several members left the party, but Monroe Coffey, of the Forest
  Service, joined it. That evening there was no rain, but fog prevented any extended view from the summit of the
  mountain. Somewhat below the summit, however, the fog was less dense, and it was possible to have seen any lights that
  might arise over the Brown Mountain mass. About 9:30 the party made a circuit from the summit to the hill above Parke
  Cree, in the south-central part of the mountain) returning to the summit shortly before midnight. Had any lights
  arisen over the mountain mass some member of the party would probably have seen them) but none appeared.
