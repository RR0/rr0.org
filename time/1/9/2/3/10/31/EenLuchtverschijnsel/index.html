<p> A female reader writes to us: "Last friday I woke up in the night and noticed that my window was so lit up as if the
  morning sun shone in it, while it still was 3 o'clock. I looked out of the window and saw in the South-East a star
  sparkling like I have never seen before, in respect to size as well as shine. It was not only much bigger than an
  ordinary star but in it flickered some kind of squarish cross. When I looked again a few moments later, the star had
  moved a distance Westward."

<p> It is the first time, that we hear of an aerial phenomenon in the night of friday; nobody with whom we talked about
  this, noticed anything of a light or a star, but perhaps readers can inform us through their own experiences.
