  the xxxxers of the district, and "balls of fire" reported floating at night over the northern prairies of Nebraska,
  and in various parts of South Dakota, have been explained by Freeman Ward, state geologist and professor at the

    lights. The story is told of an Indian brave, who, terrorized by an approaching ball of fire, became crazed and
    thereafter roamed the prairies a screaming maniac. Indians among whom the legend is current believe that these
    mysterious lights are shadows of departed red men, whose wrathful spirits come back in this flaming form to wreak
    vengeance upon the "paleface" and to spread terror over their once "happy hunting ground."</p>
