<p>In the night of wednesday to thursday, near Diepenveen at the city of Deventer, at the Platvoet, a strange phenomenon
  has been observed. Various persons saw around a quarter past twelve, in the direction Northwest West slightly above
  the horizon, a big fireball, alternately coloured reddish and yellow, as the setting sun, and also of the same size.
  Sometimes it appeared as if flames were ejected out of the ball. The phenomenon lasted approximately a quarter of an
  hour. Shortly before a great quantity of rain had fallen and a heavy haze hung over the neighbourhood. What they saw
  there had some similarity with the seeing of a sunset during a fog, but the nightly phenomenon was more beautiful,
  because it was so dark at the same time.</p>
