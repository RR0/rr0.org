<p>A large airplane with engines roaring wide open attracted much attention this morning as it cut all kinds of capers
  at a low altitude over Davenport. Tho [sic] the plane did not stop at either airport in the Tri-Cities[,] men at the
  Davenport field identified it as one having a 12-cylinder Liberty motor.</p>
<p>The pilot's favorite trick and one that caused the loud roar of the motor was to climb at a sharp angle and then turn
  his plane almost directly to the ground tearing earthward at a tremendous speed.</p>
