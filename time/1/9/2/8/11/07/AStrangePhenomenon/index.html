<p>THE EDITOR.</p>
<p>Sir, -- On last Saturday morning [November 3] a strange phenomenon appeared about 7-7:30 in the heavens, and at about
  9, it was three-quarters the sky. [Is there a word or two missing here?] Its brightness would eclipse the rays of the
  sun. I have never seen anything so bright, and it went about twelve times faster than the sun. It was not an airship,
  for no airship could fly so high and live. It could be seen far away in the ethereal sky. Has the astronomer any light
  on such a phenomenon? Eight of us saw it. What can it be?</p>
<p>I am, etc.,</p>
<p>F. HALL</p>
