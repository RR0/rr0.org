<p class="abstract">London Receives Word From Trawler Plane Half Way Between Ireland and Iceland.</p>
<p>LONDON -- (UP) -- Aviation circles here were puzzled over a message received at 8:30 a.m. Saturday morning from the
  British fishing trawler Shackleton reporting it sighted an airplane passing overhead midway between Ireland and
  Iceland.</p>
<p>The trawler, which gave its position as 58:10 north, 14:20 west, sent the following message:</p>
<p><q>"Airplane bound east passed here this morning at 5 o'clock."</q></p>
<p>The message was picked up by the Malinhead radio station.</p>
<p>Aviation officials here said they did not know of any plane in the vicinity the Shackleton reported.</p>
