<p>London. -- (AP) -- A British trawler, fishing about 250 miles west of the outer Hebrides, or 300 miles west of the
  western Scotch coast, reported an airplane passed over it early today, flying eastward. The identity of the plane was
  a mystery here.</p>
<p>The radio message was received by the Malin Head station, in Ireland, from the trawler Shackleford, at 8:23 a.m. It
  said: "Airplane bound east passed here this morning at 5 o'clock. Position is 58.10 north and 14.30 west."</p>
<p>There was no knowledge here of any transatlantic flight in progress, and the public was left guessing what the plane
  might be doing so far out in the Atlantic as to be beyond the limit of any trial flight.</p>
<p>At the air ministry it was stated: "We have no knowledge of any flight over the Atlantic. Neither have we received
  any news."</p>
