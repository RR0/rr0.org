<p>London, April 20. - (U.P.) - The mystery of an airplane reported flying over the sea between Iceland and Ireland
  remained unsolved Saturday night [April 20].</p>
<p>The British fishing trawler Shackleton reported that she sighted the airplane, flying east, at 5 a.m. Saturday in
  latitude 58.10 north and longitude 14.20 west, about half way between Iceland and Ireland.</p>
<p>The captain of the Shackleton sent the following wireless message to the United Press:
</p>
<p>"Sighted airplane at 5 a.m. from west, flying approximately east. It was a large airplane flying low. Smoke coming
  from exhaust pipe. Gave no signal. Was approximately mile away."</p>
<p>Aviation experts were puzzled. They said that unless the plane had started secretly from the British Isles or Europe
  and turned back, she must have come from Iceland, Greenland or America since she was flying east. No reports of any
  transatlantic flight having been started from the old world were received.</p>
