<p>Windfall, Ind., Jan. 20 - (Tribune Special) - A strange phenomenon, which observers are at a loss to account for,
  appeared Tuesday evening [January 20], at the Methodist church, where revival services are in progress under the
  direction of the Rev. George Henninger of Indianapolis.</p>
<p>While the audience was awaiting the appearance of the choir at the opening of the services, a light flashed over the
  heads of the people, moving in a north to south direction across the auditorium. The body was described as resembling
  a comet in appearance and movement, the light being of a blue cast. It affected in no way the electric lights in the
  church.

</p>
<p>Members of the congregation were admittedly awed and extremely puzzled by the phenomenon which was the subject of
  much questioning.</p>
<p>It is said the strange sight was observed by scores whose eyes were fixed on the front of the church. Only a few who
  were looking in other directions missed seeing it.</p>
<p>While the origin of the strange light is not known, it may be a recurrence of St. Elmo's fire, a phenomenon which
  motorists on U.S. Highway 31, reported seeing Monday night.</p>
