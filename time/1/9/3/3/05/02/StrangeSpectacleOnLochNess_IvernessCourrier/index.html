<p class="abstract">What was itÂ ?</p>
<p>Loch Ness has for generations been credited with being the home of a fearsome looking monster, but, somehow or other,
  the "water kelpie", as this legendary creature is called, has always been regarded as a myth, if not a joke. Now,
  however, comes at the news that the beast has been seen once more, for on Friday of last week a well-known businessman
  who lives in Inverness, and his wife (a University graduate), when motoring along the north shore of the loch, not far
  from Abriachan pier, were startled to see a tremendous upheaval on the loch, which previously had been as calm as the
  proverbial millpond. The lady was the first to notice the disturbance, which occurred fully three-quarters of a mile
  from the shore, and it was her sudden cries to stop that drew her husband's attention to the water. </p>
<p>There, the creature disported itself, rolling and plunging for fully a minute, its body resembling that of a whale ,
  and the water cascading and churning like a simmering cauldron. Soon, however, it disappeared in a boiling mass of
  foam. Both onlookers confessed that there was something uncanny about the whole thing, for they realised that here was
  no ordinary denizen of the depths, because, apart from its enormous size, the beast, in taking the final plunge, sent
  out waves that were big enough to have been caused by passing steamer.The watchers waited for almost half an hour in
  the hope that the monster (if such it was) would come to the surface again; but they had seen the last of it.
  Questioned as to the length of the beast, the lady stated that, judging by the state of the water in the affected
  area, it seemed to be many feet long. </p>
<p>It will be remembered that a few years ago, a party of Inverness anglers reported that, when crossing the loch in a
  rowing boat, they encountered an unknown creature, whose bulk, movements, and the amount of water displaced at once
  suggested that it was either a very large seal, a porpoise, or, indeed, the monster itself! </p>
<p>But the story, which duly appeared in the press, received scant attention, and less credence. In fact most of those
  people who were aired their views on the matter did so in a manner that bespoke feelings of the utmost
  scepticism. </p>
<p>It should be mentioned that, so far as is known, neither seals nor porpoises have ever been known to enter Loch Ness.
  Indeed, in the case of the latter, it would be utterly impossible for them to do so, and, as to the seals, it is the
  fact that though they have on rare occasions been seen in the River Ness, their presence in Loch Ness has never been
  definitely established.</p>
