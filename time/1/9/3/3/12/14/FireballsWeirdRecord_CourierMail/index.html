<p class="abstract">Origin a Complete Mystery</p>
<p>As fearsome as they are mysterious, fireballs, which were regarded in a more superstitious age as omens and portents
  of dreadful happenings, have a record of rare but weird and tragic appearances.</p>
<p>That they are entirely inexplicable is the conclusion stated in a publication by the British Air Ministry in 1930
  which Mr. Inigo Jones has in his library. The technical term for them is ball lightning, although they are not always
  associated with lightning, and, according to this authority, they vary from the size of small nuts to spheres one foot
  or two feet in diameter, the usual size being from five to 10 inches. Clean holes have been bored through window
  panes, the glass appearing to have been melted.</p>

  <h2>The Original Goblins?</h2>
  <p>How fireballs have formed in closed rooms is not known, but an aspect of this manifestation of the phenomenon
    mentioned by Mr. Inigo Jones is that it may have contributed to the origin of belief in goblins.</p>
  <p>Their movements are never fast, being generally comparable to walking pace, and they are probably carried on air
    currents. One of the curious forms they take is what is known as "pearl necklace lightning"<br/> -- as a development
    of a flash of lightning. Production of effects similar to fireballs by powerful electrical apparatus using 10,000
    volts has not contributed much to the solution of the problem.</p></section>

  <h2>Rolled On Ocean.</h2>
  <p>One of the most terrifying incidents related by Drs. Klein and Thome in a book from which Mr. Inigo Jones quoted is
    that of a fireball about the size of a millstone rolling along the Atlantic in 1749 to petrify the crew of the
    English ship Montague as they watched it rise and alight on the main mast with a crash "like the discharge of many
    cannons." The mast was split from top to bottom, and five sailors were thrown stunned to the deck, one being
    severely burned.</p>
  <p>The house of Van der Smissen in Holland was entered by a fire ball as small as a hen's egg in 1826. With the speed
    of a mouse it crossed the floor of the room in which he was sitting and plunged down a staircase to the basement,
    where it exploded without doing any damage.</p>
  <p>Tragedy was associated with the visitation of a fireball to a school in Bouin, Prance, in 1860, while the pupils
    were saying grace after dinner. The building had been struck by lightning and in the confusion a small fireball was
    noticed rolling under the forms and beside the teacher, whose clothes were slightly scorched. His son and three or
    four other children were killed. The ball then passed cleanly through a pane of glass, which was the only one in the
    window undamaged.</p></section>

  <h2>Walked After It.</h2>
  <p>People in Milan in 1841, according to Arago, the scientist, were able to walk after a fireball for three minutes
    before it struck a cross on a church steeple and disappeared. Dr. Tripe recorded in the quarterly Journal of the
    Meteorological Society that in 1874 he was watching the progress of the most fearful storm he had ever witnessed
    when he saw a ball of fire rise with increasing rapidity until it produced the appearance of forked lightning.</p>
  <p>Globes of fire about the size of billiard balls were seen to rise and fall vertically during a thunderstorm at
    Weymouth in 1876. This is recorded in "Nature," which also tells of an occurrence at Brixham when a globe of
    lightning appeared in a valley and tore up the ground until it reached a house, where it broke through a door and a
    wall and killed one man and gravely injured another.</p></section>
