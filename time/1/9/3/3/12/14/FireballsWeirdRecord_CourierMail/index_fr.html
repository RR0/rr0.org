<p class="abstract">Une origine complètement mystérieuse</p>
<p>Aussi effrayante que mystérieuses, les <a
  href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/foudre/globulaire/index.html">boules de feu</a>, considérées à époque plus
  superstitieuse comme autant de présages et portents d'événement terribles, ont une histoire d'apparitions rares, mais
  étranges et tragiques.</p>
<p>Qu'elles sont entièrement inexplicables est la conclusion indiquée dans une publication du Ministère de l'Air
  Britanique en 1930 que M. Inigo Jones a dans sa bibliothèque. Le terme technique pour elles est <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/foudre/globulaire/index.html">foudre en boule</a>, bien qu'elles ne soient
  pas toujours associées avec de la <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/foudre/index.html">foudre</a> et, selon cette autorité, varient de la
  taille de petites noisettes à des sphères de 1 à 2 pieds de diamètre, la taille habituelle étant de 5 à 10 pouces. Des
  trous nets ont été bored à travers des vitres, le verre semblant avoir été fondu.</p>
<h2>Les Goblins d'origine ?</h2>
<p>How fireballs have formed in closed rooms is not known, but an aspect of this manifestation of the phenomenon
  mentioned by Mr. Inigo Jones is that it may have contributed to the origin of belief in goblins.</p>
<p>Their movements are never fast, being generally comparable to walking pace, and they are probably carried on air
  currents. One of the curious forms they take is what is known as "pearl necklace lightning"<br> -- as a development of
  a flash of lightning. Production of effects similar to fireballs by powerful electrical apparatus using 10,000 volts
  has not contributed much to the solution of the problem.</p>
<h2>Rolled On Ocean.</h2>
<p>One of the most terrifying incidents related by Drs. Klein and Thome in a book from which Mr. Inigo Jones quoted is
  that of a fireball about the size of a millstone rolling along the Atlantic in 1749 to petrify the crew of the English
  ship Montague as they watched it rise and alight on the main mast with a crash "like the discharge of many cannons."
  The mast was split from top to bottom, and five sailors were thrown stunned to the deck, one being severely
  burned.</p>
<p>The house of Van der Smissen in Holland was entered by a fire ball as small as a hen's egg in 1826. With the speed of
  a mouse it crossed the floor of the room in which he was sitting and plunged down a staircase to the basement, where
  it exploded without doing any damage.</p>
<p>Tragedy was associated with the visitation of a fireball to a school in Bouin, Prance, in 1860, while the pupils were
  saying grace after dinner. The building had been struck by lightning and in the confusion a small fireball was noticed
  rolling under the forms and beside the teacher, whose clothes were slightly scorched. His son and three or four other
  children were killed. The ball then passed cleanly through a pane of glass, which was the only one in the window
  undamaged.</p>
<h2>Walked After It.</h2>
<p>People in Milan in 1841, according to Arago, the scientist, were able to walk after a fireball for three minutes
  before it struck a cross on a church steeple and disappeared. Dr. Tripe recorded in the quarterly Journal of the
  Meteorological Society that in 1874 he was watching the progress of the most fearful storm he had ever witnessed when
  he saw a ball of fire rise with increasing rapidity until it produced the appearance of forked lightning.</p>
<p>Globes of fire about the size of billiard balls were seen to rise and fall vertically during a thunderstorm at
  Weymouth in 1876. This is recorded in "Nature," which also tells of an occurrence at Brixham when a globe of lightning
  appeared in a valley and tore up the ground until it reached a house, where it broke through a door and a wall and
  killed one man and gravely injured another.</p>
