<p>London, December 21 &#8212; M. A. Wetherell, a Central African big game hunter, has, according to the <em>Daily
  Mail</em>, found a definite spoor of an amphibian on the shores of Loch Ness, whence stories of a remarkable creature
  have emanated lately.</p>
<p>"It is a four-fingered beast." Mr. Wetherell says, "and has feet or pads about eight inches across. I should judge it
  to be a very powerful, soft-footed animal about twenty feet long. The spoor I found clearly shows the undulations of
  the pads and the outlines of claws or nails."</p>
<p>The spoor, Mr. Wetherell declares, was only a few hours old and bore evidence the animal had attempted to climb a
  gravel bank and slipped back.</p>
<p>Local residents who have been chaffed about "seeing things" were greatly relieved at Mr. Wetherell's disclosure.</p>
