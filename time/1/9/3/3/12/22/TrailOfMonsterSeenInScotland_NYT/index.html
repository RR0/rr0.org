<p>Trail of Monster Seen in Scotland </p>
<p class="abstract">Reports are Reinforced </p>
<p class="abstract2">Many Reliable Residents of the Region Had Told of Seeing Animal 50 Feet Long. </p>
<p>Special Cable to the New York Times. </p>
<p>London, Dec. 21---M.A Weatherell, Central American big game hunter, has found, according to the Daily Mail, a
  definite spoor of a huge amphibian on the shores of Loch Ness, the region from which stories of a remarkable
  “prehistoric sea monster” have emanated lately. </p>
<p>Mr. Weatherell described the creature as being twenty feet long, four fingered with evidence of claw marks or nails
  left on the bank. He further described the creature as “soft footed” with four pads, eight inches across. </p>
<p>It appeared from tracks and marks which were only “hours old” that the creature had attempted to climb a gravel bank
  of the Loch and fallen back.</p>
<p> Local eyewitnesses of which there seemed to be many were relieved that someone with some “expert” knowledge was
  backing there claims. They had chaffed a bit at the skepticism that there reports received.</p>
<p> The “sea monster” had first been reported the previous August and since that time many witnesses, even those of the
  “conservative type” the writer states had seen the “monster”. By conservative, perhaps he meant; non-drinkers.</p>
<p> A Commander Gould, British Navy, retired, an author of a book on the subject, had interviewed 51 eyewitnesses and
  came to the conclusion that at least one creature inhabited the Loch. Interviewing the 51 witnesses one by one and
  asking each either to draw or direct a drawing of what they had seen he reached the following conclusion;</p>
