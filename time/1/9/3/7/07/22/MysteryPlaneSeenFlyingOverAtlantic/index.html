<p class="abstract">Ship Sights Unidentified Craft Winging Way Eastward 500 Miles Off Newfoundland</p>
<p>NEW YORK, July 22 (AP). &ndash; The mystery of an airplane sighted 500 miles at sea and apparently headed for Europe
  had both the United States and Canada puzzled today.</p>
<p>The Radiomarine corporation said last night that the master of the British steamer Ranee reported the passage of an
  unidentified airplane 500 miles off Cape Race, Newfoundland, and added the sound of the plane's motor or motors was
  heard plainly as it passed overhead en route east, and its running lights were visible.</p>
<p>Members of the crew could not identify the plane, however, and were unable to determine the size of the aircraft or
  whether it was a land plane or seaplane.</p>
<p>Pan-American Airways said the plane was not one of the transatlantic survey planes used by Pan American and Imperial
  (British) Airways in charting a new air route to Europe.</p>
<p>Coast guard headquarters here said none of the coast guard's ocean-going patrol planes were in the vicinity of Cape
  Race.</p>
<p>Several American pilots have sought, or announced they would seek permits to fly the Atlantic recently, but none was
  believed ready for the flight.</p>
