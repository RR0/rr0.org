<p class="abstract">Mysterious Object Buzzing About Skies Has Astronomers Puzzled</p>
<p>The mysterious little dot in the sky discovered the latter part of October by Reinmuth at Heidelberg is creating
  considerable interest among astronomers. It seems to be one of the queerest objects that has [sic] ever been known to
  invade our part of the solar system. Until its real nature is learned, it is going under the name of the "Reinmuth
  object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As to what it is, the latest reports seem at a loss to give definite information. Calculations based on the
  assumption that it is a comet fail to give correctly its position from night to night. Some think it most likely an
  asteroid flying through space not far from the earth's orbital position.</p>
<p>The most noted characteristic of the Reinmuth object is its terrific angular speed through the sky. Recent locations
  24 hours apart show it moved 15 degrees westward during this period of time. This is faster than the moon's daily
  eastward movement against the background of fixed stars. It increased in brightness two magnitudes in three days.</p>
<p>One distance calculation placed it 750,000 miles from the earth. This is only about three times the moon's distance.
  It has been hinted that the earth may have picked up a stray body which will henceforth revolve around us as a small,
  second moon. Two of Jupiter's nine moons may have been acquired in this way.</p>
<p>A California astronomer has suggested that the Lick observatory staff use salt in the conventional way in order to
  catch up with this speedy little object. We hope to learn more about it soon.</p>
