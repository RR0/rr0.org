<p>British bombing-plane crews reported on their return from a recent foray into Germany that at one point they
  encountered a storm which, without any display of lightning, cloaked their aircraft in a bright, blue, wavering glow.
  Wingtips, engine nacelles and the propeller blades sprouted thin fingers of sparks and the trailing aerials glowed as
  if they were white-hot. What the fliers were seeing was St. Elmo's Fire, a harmless but awe-inspiring phenomenon that
  occurs under certain atmospheric conditions and that used to strike terror to the bones of superstitious sailors.</p>
<p>St. Elmo's Fire occurs on both land and sea, when, in maintaining the balance of nature, accumulated electricity
  flows from the tip of some conductor, whether it be a church steeple or the mast of a ship, back into the atmosphere.
  It is visible only at night or in the blackness of a storm, and then only when the discharge if fairly heavy.</p>
<p>Up to a century ago little was known of the phenomenon, and accordingly sailors feared it as an ill omen if nothing
  else. Their most familiar name for it was "the corposant," and this term like the other derived from the
  Mediterranean. The name St. Elmo is supposed to be a corruption of St. Erasmus, via Sant' Ermo, St. Erasmus being the
  protector of travelers and the mysterious lights being the body of the saint, or corposant. Another name given it,
  when it was seen as a double corposant, was Castor and Pollux.</p>
<p>The electrical discharges have been reported in many formsâ€”forked fingers, moving balls, wavering ribbons and
  drifting clouds. As time went on sailors got used to them, saw that they did not harm and were diverted by the
  displays. It was no less than laughable to see shipmates sprawled out on a yard arm fisting the sail while sparks and
  streamers outlined their heads. And to see a ball of pale blue fire stroll solemnly up the shrouds, out to the tip of
  the yard and then down to the deck in one bound, perharps to perch for a while on the oiled hat of some open-mouthed
  sailor, the wabble off along the scuppers, was more funny than frightening. A name that came into use in the latter
  days of the sailing ships was "williwalloo," the same name given to wavering, intermittent, catspaw winds.</p>
<p>The recorded history of these corposants and williwalloos goes back at least as far as Pliny, who thought they were
  stars come out of the heavens to guide sailors. Hakluyt wrote of them in 1598, saying they were much like
  candlelights, moving all over the ship for a space of three hours and sometimes appearing in two or three places at
  once. Burton in 1621 called them "fire-drakes," or celestial dragons. As late as 1710 a naturalist said the fires were
  caused by a "sulphureous spirit" and bituminous matter, ignited by agitation of the air. It is likely that Coleridge
  in "The Ancient Mariner" had reference to the phenomenon when he wrote:</p>
<p><em>The upper air bursts into life ;</em></p>
<p><em>And a hundred fire-flags sheen. </em></p>
