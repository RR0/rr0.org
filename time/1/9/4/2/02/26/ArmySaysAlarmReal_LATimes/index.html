<p>Overshadowing a nation-wide maelstrom of rumors and                       conflicting reports, the Army's Western Defense Command                       insisted that Los Angeles' early morning blackout and                       anti-aircraft action were the result of unidentified                       aircraft sighted over the beach area. In two official                       statements, issued while Secretary of the Navy Knox in                       Washington was attributing the activity to a false alarm and                       "jittery nerves," the command in San Francisco confirmed and                       reconfirmed the presence over the Southland of unidentified                       planes. Relayed by the Southern California sector office in                       Pasadena, the second statement read: "The aircraft which                       caused the blackout in the Los Angeles area for several                       hours this a.m. have not been identified." Insistence from                       official quarters that the alarm was real came as hundreds                       of thousands of citizens who heard and saw the activity                       spread countless varying stories of the episode. The                       spectacular anti-aircraft barrage came after the 14th                       Interceptor Command ordered the blackout when strange craft                       were reported over the coastline. Powerful searchlights from                       countless stations stabbed the sky with brilliant probing                       fingers while anti-aircraft batteries dotted the heavens                       with beautiful, if sinister, orange bursts of shrapnel. </p>
<h2>City Blacked Out For Hours</h2>
<p>The city was blacked out                       from 2:25 to 7:21 am after an earlier yellow alert at 7:18                       pm was called off at 10:23 pm. The blackout was in effect                       from here to the Mexican border and inland to the San                       Joaquin Valley. No bombs were dropped and no airplanes shot                       down and, miraculously in terms of the tons of missiles                       hurled aloft, only two persons were reported wounded by                       falling shell fragments. Countless thousands of Southland                       residents, many of whom were late to work because of the                       traffic tie-up during the blackout, rubbed their eyes                       sleepily yesterday and agreed that regardless of the                       question of how "real" the air raid alarm may have been, it                       was "a great show" and "well worth losing a few hours'                       sleep." The blackout was not without its casualties,                       however. A State Guardsman died of a heart attack while                       driving an ammunition truck, heart failure also accounted                       for the death of an air raid warden on duty, a woman was                       killed in a car-truck collision in Arcadia, and a Long Beach                       policeman was killed in a traffic crash enroute to duty.                       Much of the firing appeared to come from the vicinity of                       aircraft plants along the coastal area of Santa Monica,                       Inglewood, Southwest Los Angeles, and Long Beach. </p>
