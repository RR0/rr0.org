<p>Overshadowing a nation-wide maelstrom of rumors and conflicting reports, the Army's Western Defense Command insisted
  that Los Angeles' early morning blackout and anti-aircraft action were the result of unidentified aircraft sighted
  over the beach area. In two official statements, issued while Secretary of the Navy Knox in Washington was attributing
  the activity to a false alarm and "jittery nerves," the command in San Francisco confirmed and reconfirmed the
  presence over the Southland of unidentified planes. Relayed by the Southern California sector office in Pasadena, the
  second statement read: "The aircraft which caused the blackout in the Los Angeles area for several hours this a.m.
  have not been identified." Insistence from official quarters that the alarm was real came as hundreds of thousands of
  citizens who heard and saw the activity spread countless varying stories of the episode. The spectacular anti-aircraft
  barrage came after the 14th Interceptor Command ordered the blackout when strange craft were reported over the
  coastline. Powerful searchlights from countless stations stabbed the sky with brilliant probing fingers while
  anti-aircraft batteries dotted the heavens with beautiful, if sinister, orange bursts of shrapnel. </p>
<h2>City Blacked Out For Hours</h2>
<p>The city was blacked out from 2:25 to 7:21 am after an earlier yellow alert at 7:18 pm was called off at 10:23 pm.
  The blackout was in effect from here to the Mexican border and inland to the San Joaquin Valley. No bombs were dropped
  and no airplanes shot down and, miraculously in terms of the tons of missiles hurled aloft, only two persons were
  reported wounded by falling shell fragments. Countless thousands of Southland residents, many of whom were late to
  work because of the traffic tie-up during the blackout, rubbed their eyes sleepily yesterday and agreed that
  regardless of the question of how "real" the air raid alarm may have been, it was "a great show" and "well worth
  losing a few hours' sleep." The blackout was not without its casualties, however. A State Guardsman died of a heart
  attack while driving an ammunition truck, heart failure also accounted for the death of an air raid warden on duty, a
  woman was killed in a car-truck collision in Arcadia, and a Long Beach policeman was killed in a traffic crash enroute
  to duty. Much of the firing appeared to come from the vicinity of aircraft plants along the coastal area of Santa
  Monica, Inglewood, Southwest Los Angeles, and Long Beach. </p>
