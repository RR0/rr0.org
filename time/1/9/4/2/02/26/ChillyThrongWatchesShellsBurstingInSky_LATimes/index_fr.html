<p>Explosions stabbing the darkness like tiny bursting stars... Searchlight beams poking long crisscross fingers across
  the night sky...Yells of wardens and the whistles of police and deputy sheriffs...The brief on-and-off flick of
  lights, telephone calls, snatches of conversation: 'Get the dirty...' That was Los Angeles under the rumble of gunfire
  yesterday.</p>

  <h2>Des résidents réveillés</h2>
  <p>Sleepy householders awoke to the dull thud of explosions... "Thunder? Can't be!" Then: "Air Raid! Come here quick!
    Look over there...those searchlights. They've got something...they are blasting in with anti-aircraft!" Father,
    mother, children all gathered on the front porch, congregated in small clusters in the blacked out streets --
    against orders. Babies cried, dogs barked, doors slammed. But the object in the sky slowly moved on, caught in the
    center of the lights like the hub of a bicycle wheel surrounded by gleaming spokes. </p>

  <h2>Speculation Rife</h2>
  <p>Speculation fell like rain. "It's a whole squadron." "No, it's a blimp. It must be because it's moving so slowly."
    "I hear planes." "No you don't. That's a truck up the street." "Where are the planes then?" "Dunno. They must be up
    there though." "Wonder why they picked such a clear night for a raid?" "They're probably from a carrier." "Naw, I'll
    bet they are from a secret air base down south somewhere." Still the firing continued. Like lethal firecrackers, the
    anti-aircraft rounds blasted above, below, seemingly right on the target fixed in the tenacious beams. Other shots
    fell short, exploding halfway up the long climb. Tracers sparked upward like roman candles. Metal fell. It fell in
    chunks, large and small; not enemy metal, but the whistling fragments of bursting ack-ack shells. The menacing thud
    and clank on streets and roof tops drove many spectators to shelter. </p>

  <h2> Wardens Do Good Job</h2>
  <p> Wardens were on the job, doing a good job of it. "Turn off your lights, please. Pull over to the curb and stop.
    Don't use your telephone. Take shelter. Take shelter." On every street brief glares of hooded flashlights cut the
    darkness, warning creeping drivers to stop. Police watched at main intersections. Sirens wailed enroute to and from
    blackout accidents. There came lulls in the firing. The search lights went out. (To allow the fighter planes to
    attack?). Angelinos breathed deeply and said, "I guess it's all over." But before they could tell their neighbors
    good night, the guns were blasting again, sighting up the long blue beams of the lights. </p>

  <h2>Watchers Shiver</h2>
  <p> The fire seemed to burst in rings all around the target. But the eager watchers, shivering in the early morning
    cold, weren't rewarded by the sight of a falling plane. Nor were there any bombs dropped. "Maybe it's just a test,"
    someone remarked. "Test, hell!" was the answer. "You don't throw that much metal in the air unless you're fixing on
    knocking something down." Still the firing continued, muttering angrily off toward the west like a distant
    thunderstorm. The targeted object inched along high, flanked by the cherry red explosions. And the householders
    shivered in their robes, their faces set, watching the awesome scene.</p>
