<p>The reported presence of parachutists in the vicinity of Hyde Park, N. Y., has been discarded by the Army authorities
  as unfounded gossip, and they read a lecture on the circulation of such reports, the investigation of which uselessly
  takes up the time of Army intelligence men. The fact that no action was taken against the circulators of the report
  suggests that the gossip was innocent or idle and that the originator of it actually thought he saw parachutes. This
  would not be phenomenal, for the phantasmagoria created by imaginative gossip exceeds the spectacles of mummery. The "<a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/LosAngeles/index.html">Battle Of Los Angeles</a>," in which supposedly
  hostile planes were driven off by gunfire, has been its war-time opus thus far. Whether what someone said they saw and
  heard were hostile planes is still a moot question.</p>
<p>But the difference between innocent mongering and hair-frigger vigilance by citizens may be the measure of protection
  against suprise, and the authorities would certainly be loath to prescribe the ducking-stool for all who peddle
  unconfirmed reports of covert enemy infiltration. It was the cackling of the geese that saved Rome from surprise
  attack on one occasion, and idle gossips are only human geese. </p>
