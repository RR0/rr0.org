<p>WITH THE ATLANTIC FLEET OFF CASABLANCA -- (Delayed) -- (INS) -- "V for Victory" was more than a slogan for the
  American naval task force that forced capitulation of Casa Blanca.</p>
<p>Lt. George H. Simpson, 192 Edwards street, New Haven, Conn., observed that a strange nocturnal light in the skies
  formed a "V" while the task force was underway toward the battle.</p>
<p>Lt. Simpson and scores of others aboard this ship are ready to admit they aren't far from superstitious about that "V
  for Victory" slogan.</p>
