<p>COWAL, Ont., Feb. 5 (CP). &ndash; Residents of West Elgin county Monday night [February 4] pondered the problem of a
  "ghost" which left footprints &ndash; size six &ndash; and jumped fences at "breathless speed" when pursued.</p>
<p>The apparition, object of a spirited hunt since its first appearance last Tuesday, was described by various witnesses
  as headless, having a feminine appearance, and wearing a brown jacket and hood, a white skirt and men's boots.</p>
<p>Spoken of as "it" by a dozen Dunwich township residents who claim to have seen the figure on its rounds, the
  apparition is said to roam about an isolated area where Indians claim Tecumseh was buried in a secret grave 130 years
  ago.</p>
<p>Asked if he thought "it" was a ghost, Archie MacTavish, who took part in the hunt, said he believed it was someone
  "not quite right in the head."</p>
