<p><b> </b>A mysterious white shining light over the Stockholm horizon occasioned a lively inquiry on Friday evening
  both in the news-paper's telephone exchange and with the fire brigade. Some observers also heard reports [i.e., claps,
  peals], but they actually arose from some blasting work. [As far as the light is concerned], it is thought at the
  Saltsjobad Observatory that it probably could be some kind of aurora. People also observed the shining light [out
  there] in a northwesterly direction. It is believed that a changeover to clearer weather, which is now signalled has
  some connection with this celestial phenomenon.</p>
