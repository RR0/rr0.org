<p class="abstract"> "Wingless, cigar-shaped body" amazes Landskrona inhabitants</p>
<p>LANDSKRONA Fri. (TT). A flying object was observed, according to the Landskrona-Posten, at 2.20 o'clock on Friday in
  widely separated places in Landskrona. It was described by two night watchmen as a fireball with a tail, while a
  repairman, located 35 meters high, saw it drawn against the sky as a wingless, cigar-shaped body of the dimensions of
  a small airplane, which at regular intervals spurted bunches of sparks from its tail. All the observers reported that
  the body flew at about 100 meters altitude at an ordinary airplane's speed and in a southwesterly direction.</p>
