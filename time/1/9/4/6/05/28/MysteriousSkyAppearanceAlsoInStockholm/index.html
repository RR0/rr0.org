<p>It is not only in Landstrona and Gavie that fireballs and [unreadable] without wings are seen. Also from Karlakrona
  and Halsingborg are similar observations reported, and many persons in the Stockholm area stated to the MT that they
  saw they same phenomenon in Huddinge and Hagalund. </p>
<p>No one really knows what is going on. One guess is of experiments with secret weapons, but aviation experts think
  that in such a case it is serious that no sound is reported in connection with the observations--long-range bombing
  practice gives off noise. </p>
