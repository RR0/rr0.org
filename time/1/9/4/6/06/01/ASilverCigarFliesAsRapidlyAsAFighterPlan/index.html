<p>KATRINEHOLM, Friday (MT). It seems as if the mysterious flier, which was observed in Osternarke at the beginning of
  this week, was not altogether an illusion. Yesterday the same thing was reported in fact in Kat-rineholm. An object
  which can be compared most closely to a silver glistening rocket, in the shape of a giant cigar, was [discovered] in
  the east on the horizon. The time was then 11.43, right in the morning. </p>
<p>The "ghost airplane" had no hint of wings, but on the other hand some thought that it had the semblance of a
  stabilizer or the like. It travelled very rapidly through the air and many observers pointed out that not even the
  fastest fighter plane would be able to keep pace. A light rumble (drone) was heard, near the body after it had made a
  turn toward the west, in a diving contributed trip toward the south. The size of the mysterious monster did not agree
  with that of the one seen at Narke, neither was the altitude the same. [As to the appearance it came to be summarized]
  that the projectile, or whatever it might be, was as long as an ordinary training plane and went at 300 meters
  altitude. The Skavata air fleet out from Nykoping had none of its airplanes up at the right time in the immediate
  vicinity of Katrineholm. On an airplane seen from the side in broad daylight no wings are visible. Therefore it could
  be assumed that it was an ordinary airplane that the Katrineholm witnesses saw. </p>
<p>In this connection it can still be mentioned that one of the Katrineholm witnesses saw the object not only from the
  side but also front to back. The sun's rays in this case were not at their worst sharpness, wherefore one with reason
  can uphold it all [as] very mysterious. </p>
