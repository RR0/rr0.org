<p>A sky phenomenon of the same sort as was observed yesterday has occurred over Eskilstuna. The observation is reported
  by an engineer who flies daily and must be thought of as a reliable observer.</p>
<p>I had just put out [the light] and stood by my window when in the half-darkness I was able to see something come out
  of a cloud, related the engineer. The bomb, if it really was such, passed west of the city in a northward direction.
  It seemed as if it was on a descending course at close to a 30 degree angle--on this matter I can naturally not be
  completely sure--and in such a case ought to have fallen down some [where] in the area, probably going north over
  Hugesta. It could not have been any of our new jet planes, which have a continuous exhaust and thereby [look[ like
  true rockets. The later V-weapons did the same, but the first had intermittent [exhaust].</p>
