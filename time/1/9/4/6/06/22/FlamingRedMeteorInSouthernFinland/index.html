<p>At 22:20 o'clock on Thursday was observed again a strange luminous phenomenon in the sky. It was also obvious that a
  meteor was concerned. The luminosity, which was plainly perceptible against the light summer evening, moved slowly
  forward in a direction from south to north and flamed red. According to the observers' opinion the meteor ought to
  have fallen down somewhere in the Pellinge area of Nylands Island. </p>
