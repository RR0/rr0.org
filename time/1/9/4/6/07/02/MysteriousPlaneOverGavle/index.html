<p class="abstract">Long grey object disappears in smoke cloud.</p>
<p>GAVLE, Monday (correspondent). A strange sight in the heavens was seen in Gavle on Sunday evening just before 8
  o'clock. Several persons observed an object in the sky which likely might have been a rocket-bomb or something
  similar.</p>
<p>It went across over the city in an east to west direction in an altitude which witnesses estimated might be
  8,000-10,000 meters, but it was plainly seen against the clear evening sky. The projectile of whatever kind it may
  have been could be made out clearly as an elongated gray body with a bright light in the stern end. It disappeared
  after several moments [as if] in a smoke cloud.</p>
