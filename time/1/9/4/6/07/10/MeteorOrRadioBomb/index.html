<p>A mysterious phenomenon of the heavens--a meteor or a radio-directed projectile--was seen at midday Tuesday over the
  east coast. It was a brightly shining ball with a long tail, which was seen in the Stockholm area and up in
  Medelpad.</p>
<p>In the Stockholm area the ball was observed around 14.30 o'clock. The ball, which shone with an intensely white
  light, was around 1/3 the moon's diameter and the tail 10-12 moon diameters long. The projectile moved in a direction
  from west to east. Somewhat later was seen a similar ball in various places in Medelpad, and it is not impossible that
  it [belonged to] the same phenomenon. The ball, which resembled "a comet with a blue-white trail after it," had an
  easterly course. Also, it was observed from Lv 5 [correct], where the projectile was seen to rush from over the Sodra
  mountains at a low height. In Medanajo and Norrhassel as well, similar observations were made. In Nedansjo the
  projectile made a curve and descended, leaving a green streak and a 40-50 meter long tail of fire. It is not thought
  improbable that the projectile [came in] over land and later turned. A phenomenon of this type is known to be observed
  daily off the Norrland coast, then for the last few days in the Gavle area. </p>
