<h2>Stockholm experts investigateMany reports stream in</h2>
<p>Remains of possibly a rocket- or jet-propelled object, which fell on Tuesday afternoon at Bjorkon in Njurunda have
  been sent to Stockholm, the defense staff's air defense division, for investigation, stated the press officer at the
  Sundsvall air [base], Capt. R. Westlin, in an interview for MT. </p>
<ul>
  <li>An eyewitness, who was located closest ? 70 to 80 meters from the spot ? said an explosion took place in the fall
    against the ground, while another eyewitness continues to maintain that the projectile exploded a bit above the
    ground. The explosion created a hole about a decimeter deep, and about a meter wide. The projectile clearly produced
    a strong heat, and remains of the same were very hot [when first] found. The slag [left by] the projectile was black
    and burnt.</li>
  <li>The ground was examined a long way around and the [well-cared-for] remains now find themselves on the way to
    Stockholm, where they shall be examined carefully. </li>
</ul>
<h2>The pieces gathered up in a bag</h2>
<p>The finder of the remains of the projectile was airline pilot T. Linden. He lay and basked at Bjorkon when a blinding
  green shine lighted up the sky. Mr. Linden saw a 40 to 50 meter long trail after the nucleus itself, which he took to
  be a meteorite. With a faint thud it fell down 45 meters from the bathers and made a small crater in the sand. Bits of
  the projectile were strewn around and were found a total of many meters distant. Mr. Linden gathered up as much as he
  could find in a [3 kg.] bag. The bits seem like porous slag and are extremely light. </p>
<p>The thing went in a northwesterly direction and just before its fall had a 40-degree angle with the ground. </p>
<h2>"Public [treasure]-hunt" in Njurunda</h2>
<p>Wednesday on the beach in Njurunda people began picking up many coke-like, porous objects which had the same
  appearance as those which pilot Linden [already] had taken on Tuesday. Since some real pieces of coke were found
  [inland] as well and other wreckage here, it cannot be certain that everything taken was from the projectile. </p>
<p>One piece of the find was taken to the Kubikenborg cellulose laboratory, where Dr. Birger Backlund out of interest
  for the matter made a quick analysis of a fragment, and among other things declared the presence of metal. </p>
<p>A rather notable find on the beach was made by a journalist on Wednesday afternoon when he found a rust-colored,
  porous little thing, which bore a very plain mark [which was] situated next to some cylinder-like object. </p>
<p>While the rust-colored bit's surface was uneven and porous like all other samples of the find, this bit had in its
  center a semicircular-shaped hole, and it appeared as if this bit was pressed under strong heat against a round,
  tube-shaped object and pressed against it until it broke through the surface there. [?]</p>
<h2> "Checkerboard-squared paper"</h2>
<p>The little bit of the find in Njurunda, which Dr. Backland of the Cellulosenbolagets research division examined, was
  found to be at least in part organic material. It looked most nearlycarbon (carbide) which was exposed to weathering.
  I was somewhat more gray in color than other pieces of the find. </p>
<p>When Dr. Becklund picked at the object a little piece of paper Of about a quarter-millimeter size came off and under
  a magnifying glass it appeared that the paper was checkered almost like a checkerboard with white squares and black
  bottoms. The squares were microscopic but very regular and was all like a kind of screen which is used in
  electrotyping. Here it must be a question of an object which was not exposed to any exceptionally high
  temperature. </p>
<p>If the part of the find which now came under Dr. Backlund's eyes really issued from the projectile, which airline
  pilot Linden saw fall down in Njurunda, then it cannot be regarded as a meteorite. A more comprehensive investigation
  of all that was around will make it possible to give other ideas for solving the puzzle.</p>
<h2>"Crash" in Lake Barken in Dalarna</h2>
<p>BORLANGE, Wednesday (TT). From a series of places in Dalarna stream in reports about the ball phenomenon and at many
  places it is believed the crash of the projectile was witnessed. All the sightings were made at the same time--14.35
  o'clock on Tuesday--no trace of the crash has been found. </p>
<p>In Rommehed, Borlange and Falun was sighted a luminous object with a long smoking tail. In Soderbarks a woman saw how
  a drop-shaped object came out of the northeast and fell down in Lake Barken. The drop was blue-green in color and had
  a tail of the same color. Another crash was sighted in Mockfjard where a smell of burning was noted a long time after
  the crash. </p>
<h2>Were projectiles sighted in Stockholm and Ockelbe too?</h2>
<p>A person, who on Tuesday afternoon promenaded on the lake (sea?) road along Arstaviken's southern shore, said he saw
  a projectile high in space toward the north. He thought it looked like a rocket and wondered what was the reason for
  sending up such a thing in a bright afternoon. </p>
<p>In Ockelbo too a similar phenomenon was seen. Mr. Efrain Jamason of Gumglrden, who was one of those who made the
  sighting, states that exactly at 14.35 he caught sight of a strange cigar-like or rather sugar-loaf-like object over
  the weeds to the east. The object shone like silver and appeared like some glistening mass. It tumbled right down
  against the ground and was gone in a few moments. </p>
