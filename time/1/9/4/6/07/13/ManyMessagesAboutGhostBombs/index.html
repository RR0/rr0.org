<p lang="en-AU"> From all parts of the country reports still stream in about "ghost bombs" observed. In the Lidkoping
  area the phenomena is described as a projectile with a line after it, while at Thursday noon witnesses in Ljusdal told
  of a "fireball the size of a head." At almost the same time other persons saw a fireball fall down into a lake in the
  Ramajo area. </p>
<h2> Rumbling projectile with a line and ball behind it. MARIESTAD, Friday (TT).</h2>
<p> A Lyrestad resident who was located on the road in Otterslattes, near Fagerlid, at 14.3O o'clock on Tuesday
  discovered a flying object which had a silvery-lighted tail behind it and which passed over Otterslagen at only 1OO m.
  altitude. The direction was southeasterly and the object appeared to go at about a 35-degree angle. It is therefore
  believed that it fell somewhere in the territory between Otterslatten and a line [between] Hove-Algarls. Farmer Ejnar
  Anderson, Otterslatten, has reported that between 7.3O and 8 o'clock on Thursday morning he sighted a glittering
  object in the air around a meter long and with a tail of smoke behind it. At the time an airliner flew over the place
  as well. The luminous phenomenon at first seemed to be following the plane but then separated from it in a
  northeasterly direction. </p>
