<p class="abstract2">"Fireball the size of the head"</p>
<p>From all parts of the country reports still stream in about "ghost bombs" observed. In the <span class="place">Lidkoping</span>
  area the phenomena is described as a projectile with a line after it, while at Thursday noon witnesses in <span
      class="place">Ljusdal</span> told of a "fireball the size of a head." At almost the same time other persons saw a
  fireball fall down into a lake in the <span class="place">Ramajo</span> area. </p>

  <h2>Rumbling projectile with a line and ball behind it. <span class="place">MARIESTAD</span>, Friday (TT).</h2>
  <p>A <span class="place">Lyrestad</span> resident who was located on the road in Otterslattes, near Fagerlid, at 14.3O
    o'clock on Tuesday discovered a flying object which had a silvery-lighted tail behind it and which passed over
    Otterslagen at only 1OO m. altitude. The direction was southeasterly and the object appeared to go at about a
    35-degree angle. It is therefore believed that it fell somewhere in the territory between Otterslatten and a line
    [between] Hove-Algarls. Farmer Ejnar Anderson, Otterslatten, has reported that between 7.3O and 8 o'clock on
    Thursday morning he sighted a glittering object in the air around a meter long and with a tail of smoke behind it.
    At the time an airliner flew over the place as well. The luminous phenomenon at first seemed to be following the
    plane but then separated from it in a northeasterly direction. </p></section>
