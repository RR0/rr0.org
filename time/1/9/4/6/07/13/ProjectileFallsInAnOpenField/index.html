<p>Further reports have come in of observations of a mysterious flying object, and eyewitnesses assert that they saw a
  "fireball" fall. </p>
<p>At <span class="place">Dalzholm</span>, just out from <span class="place">Lidkoping</span>, several persons on
  Thursday afternoon saw a winged projectile with a [tail] shining like copper and with a ball, after which came a roar
  (hum) about 50 meters over their heads. The projectile fell in an open field where no one has yet bothered to make any
  investigations. </p>
<p>From Mariestad it is reported that there was seen a flying object with a silvery-shining tail in Otterslslatten,
  near Fagerlid, both at 14.30 o'clock Tuesday and on Thursday between 7:30 and 8 o'clock. Also in western Halsingland a
  fireball has been seen. In <span class="place">Ramsjo</span>, four miles north of Ljusdal, a pair of persons on
  Thursday afternoon observed a fireball which was thought to go straight over the treetops. The ball seemed to be the
  size of a head and left behind itself a four or five meter long fiery tail. It went eastward. At about the same time
  other persons saw a fireball fall into a lake in the Ramsjo area. </p>
<p>A "rocket bomb" also has passed over the <span class="place">Vastervik</span> area. A Vastervik and a Stockholm lady
  who were on a visit to a farmer in Cladha--ar at 14.3O o'clock on Wednesday discovered an object passing over treetops
  at a low altitude and disappeared behind the woods. Two persons saw a blue or green streak and another [saw] as well a
  small object ahead of the streak. No sound was heard. Clear sky and visibility prevailed. The direction was easterly
  or perhaps northeasterly and the path horizontal. </p>
<p>A mysterious fireball was observed between 13 and 14 o'clockon Thursday over Kopingsvik bathing area north of <span
    class="place">Borgholm</span>. It looked like a light green, brightly shining ball, which moved with great speed in
  an easterly direction. Behind the "ball" appeared a spiral-shaped violet streak of light. According to what many
  observers tell, the luminous phenomenon disappeared suddenly [into thin air]. No trace of it could be found. </p>
