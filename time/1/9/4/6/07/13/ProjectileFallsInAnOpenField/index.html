<p lang="en-AU"> Further reports have come in of observations of a mysterious flying object, and eyewitnesses assert
  that they saw a "fireball" fall. </p>
<p lang="en-AU"> At Dalzholm, just out from Lidkoping, several persons on Thursday afternoon saw a winged projectile
  with a [tail] shining like copper and with a ball, after which came a roar (hum) about 50 meters over their heads. The
  projectile fell in an open field where no one has yet bothered to make any investigations. </p>
<p lang="en-AU"> From Mariestad it is reported that there was seen a flying object with a silvery-shining tail in
  Otterslslatten, near Fagerlid, both at 14.30 o'clock Tuesday and on Thursday between 7:30 and 8 o'clock. Also in
  western Halsingland a fireball has been seen. In Ramsjo, four miles north of Ljusdal, a pair of persons on Thursday
  afternoon observed a fireball which was thought to go straight over the treetops. The ball seemed to be the size of a
  head and left behind itself a four or five meter long fiery tail. It went eastward. At about the same time other
  persons saw a fireball fall into a lake in the Ramsjo area. </p>
<p lang="en-AU"> A "rocket bomb" also has passed over the Vastervik area. A Vastervik and a Stockholm lady who were on a
  visit to a farmer in Cladha--ar at 14.3O o'clock on Wednesday discovered an object passing over treetops at a low
  altitude and disappeared behind the woods. Two persons saw a blue or green streak and another [saw] as well a small
  object ahead of the streak. No sound was heard. Clear sky and visibility prevailed. The direction was easterly or
  perhaps northeasterly and the path horizontal. </p>
<p lang="en-AU"> A mysterious fireball was observed between 13 and 14 o'clockon Thursday over Kopingsvik bathing area
  north of Borgholm. It looked like a light green, brightly shining ball, which moved with great speed in an easterly
  direction. Behind the "ball" appeared a spiral-shaped violet streak of light. According to what many observers tell,
  the luminous phenomenon disappeared suddenly [into thin air]. No trace of it could be found. </p>
