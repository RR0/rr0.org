<p>PORTLAND (AP)―A small cylinder shaped concrete object which fell from the sky in a localized shower of ice pellets
  has been taken over by an army representative for examination, Joseph A. Hill, president of Hill Military academy,
  said Sunday night.</p>
<p>The academy president said the object fell near Capt Leon G Thompson, an academy instructor, amid a shower of ice
  confined to a 15-foot square portion of the academy grounds Saturday when the sky was clear and while no aircraft were
  in sight The weather bureau here reported it could give no explanation and Hugh A. Pruett, University of Oregon
  astronomer, declined to speculate pending a study of another portion forwarded him by a Portland newspaper.</p>
<p>Hill refused to reveal the name of the army representative or the branch of army service interested in examining the
  portion, which Thompson said was coated with ice when it rolled at his feet.</p>
