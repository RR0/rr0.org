<p>STOCKHOLM, Sweden, March 21â€”Another of the "phantom bombs" that were seen frequently over Sweden last fall was
  observed today over the southern part of the country by several persons. At first they thought it an airplane, but
  looking more intently they noticed that smoke was coming from the tail and that its shape differed from that of a
  plane.</p><p>The projectile was flying from east to west at a considerable height. The witnesses described it as a
  cigar-shaped metallic body, approximately sixty feet long, traveling at slow speed and making no noise.</p><p>The
  "bomb" was visible for a considerable time and smoke was observed long after the projectile disappeared. Judging from
  the smoke, the missile turned at a certain point and flew back eastward. </p>
