<p>PENDLETON, Ore., June 26 -- (U.P.)-- Residents of Pendleton sought an explanation today for the nine strange
  "saucer-shaped" planes an amateur pilot claimed he saw flying at an estimated speed of 1,200 miles an hour across
  southwestern Washington.</p>
<p>The story was told by Kenneth Arnold, flying fire extinguisher salesman from Boise, Ida.</p>
<p>He landed here, slightly bug-eyed, Wednesday and told how he spotted the "extremely shiny nickle-plated aircraft"
  skimming along at 10,000 feet on Tuesday. Arnold was on a search for a missing Marine corps plane at the time.</p>
<p>"They were shaped like saucers and were so thin I could barely see them," he told Jack Whitman, a local
  businessman.</p>
<p>"There were nine of them and they were flying in a screwy formation about 25 miles away from me. It wasn't any
  military formation I ever saw before.</p>
<p>"I figure they were moving about 1,200 miles per hour because I clocked them with a stop watch during the time it
  took them to fly from Mount Rainer to Mount Adams. That's 42 miles and they made it in one minute 42 seconds -- about
  1,205 mph."</p>
<p>Arnold said the strange aircraft were skittering across the southwest slope of Mount Rainier when he first sighted
  them.</p>
<p>Whitman suggested tactfully, that Arnold had been seeing things but the pilot insisted, "I must be believe my
  eyes."</p>
<p>There was no comment from military authorities on Arnold's story. </p>
