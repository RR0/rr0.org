<p>KANSAS CITY, June 26, (AP) ? Nine shiny objects flying at a high rate of speed such as described by a Boise Idaho
  pilot were reported by W. I. Davenport, a carpenter, to have been sighted here Wednesday.</p>
<p>Davenport, working on the roof of a house, said he saw the objects flying west shortly after noon. He said he first
  heard the faint sound of motors.</p>
<p><q>There were nine of them, flying in a group with one a little to one side.</q> He said, <q>They were flying so fast
  I barely had time to count them before they were gone. They were leaving vapor trails.</q></p>
<p>He added that he could not describe the shape of the objects since he could not see them clearly.</p>
