<p class="body">(AP) ? A Boise flyer's tail of nine mysterious objects hurtling through the air over western Washington was discounted by Army and Air experts today, but received confirmation in reports from two midwestern cities.</p>
<p class="body">Descriptions of the shiny, <q>piepan</q> shaped objects, apparently flying in formation at terrific speed tallied in virtually all details, and at least two of the midwesterners added information on <q>motor noise</q> and <q>vapor trails</q>.</p>
<h3>Speed Terrific</h3>
<p class="body"><q>The machine, or whatever it was, was a shiny silvery color ? very big ? and was moving at a terrific rate of speed.</q></p>
<p class="body"><q>The funny thing about it was that it made no noise. I don't think it had any type of internal combustion engine.</q></p>
<p class="body">Referring to a claim by Kenneth Arnold, flying Boise Idaho businessman, that he saw nine shiny objects in western Washington similar to the one Savage described, the Oklahoma City man declared: <q>I know that boy up there </q>(<a href="/people/ArnoldKenneth/index.html">Arnold</a>)<q>, really saw them.</q></p>
<p class="body">Savage said he told his wife about the object at the time but <q>she thought I must have seen lighting</q> and he also told some skeptical pilot friends.</p>
<h3>Wife Convinced</h3>
<p class="body"><q>I kept quiet after that.</q> He continued <q>until I read about that man seeing nine of the same things. I saw it and I thought it only fair to back him up.</q></p>
<p class="body">Mrs. Savage said today she now was convinced her husband saw the object <q>he was very much worked up about it when he read about the man in Washington</q>, she declared.</p>
<p class="body">Savage said the object he saw was high up in the air ? <q>somewhere around 10,000 feet. I couldn't be sure, judging from the ground where I was.</q></p>
