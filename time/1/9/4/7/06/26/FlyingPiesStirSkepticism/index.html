    <p class="abstract">Army, <a href="/org/us/CAA.html">CAA</a> Officials Unable to Explain Whizzing, Mysterious Objects </p>
    <p>Pendleton, Ore.&#8212;(AP)&#8212;Army and <a href="/org/us/CAA.html">CAA</a> spokesmen expressed skepticism today over a report of nine mysterious objects&#8212;whizzing at 1,200 miles an hour.  </p>
    <p><a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Kenneth Arnold</a>, a flying Boise, Idaho, businessman who reported seeing them, clung, however, to his story of the shiny, flat objects, each as big as a DC-4 passenger plane, racing over Washington's Cascade Mountains with a peculiar weaving motion <q>like the tail of kite</q>.</p>
    <p>An Army spokesman in Washinton, D. C., commented, <q>as far as we know, nothing flies that fast except a <a href="../../../../../../../../tech/aero/appareil/missile/v2/index.html">V-2 rocket</a>, which travels at about 3,500 miles an hour&#8212;and that's too fast to be seen</q>.  </p>
    <p><a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a> described the objects as <q>flat like a pie-pan</q>, and so shiny that they reflected the sun like a mirror.</p>
    <p>He said he was flying east a 2:59 p. m. two days ago toward Mt. Rainier when they appeared directly in front of him 25-30 miles away at 10,000 feet altitude.</p>
    <p>By his plane's clock he timed them at 1:42 minutes for the 47 miles from Mt. Rainier to Mt. Adams, Arnold said, adding that he later figured by triangulation that their speed was 1,200 miles an hour.</p>
    <p><q>I could be wrong by 200 or 300 miles an hour</q>, he admitted, <q>but I know I never saw anything so fast</q>.  </p>
    <p>He said at first he thought they were geese, but quickly saw they were too big&#8212;as big as a DC-4 that was about 20 miles away, he said. The DC-4 pilot reported nothing unusual sighted. Then Arnold said he thought of jet planes and started to clock them, <q>but their motion was wrong for jet jobs</q>. </p>
    <p><q>I guess I don't know what they were&#8212;unless they were guided missiles</q>, said <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a>, who continued here on a business trip.  </p>
