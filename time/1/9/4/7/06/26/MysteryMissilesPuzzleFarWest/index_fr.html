    <p><em>Pour l'Associated Press</em></p>
    <p>Pendleton (Oregon), 26 juin?Army and <a href="/org/us/CAA.html">CAA</a> spokesmen expressed skepticism today over a report of nine mysterious objects?whizzing at 1200 miles an hour. </p>
    <p><a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Kenneth Arnold</a>, a flying Boise, Idaho, businessman who reported seeing them, clung, however, to his story of the shiny, flat objects, each as big as a DC-4 passenger plane, racing over Washington's Cascade Mountains with a peculiar weaving motion <q>like the tail of kite</q>.</p>
    <p>An Army spokesman in Washinton, D. C., commented, <q>as far as we know, nothing flies that fast except a <a
        href="/tech/aero/appareil/missile/v2/index.html">V-2 rocket</a>, which travels at about 3,500 miles an hour?and
      that's too fast to be seen</q>. </p>
    <p>The spokesman said no high-speed experimental tests were being made in the area where <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a> said the objects were.</p>
    <p>Mr. <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a> described the objects as <q>flat like a pie-pan</q>, and so shiny that they reflected the sun like a mirror. He said he was flying east a 2:59 p. m. two days ago toward Mt. Rainier when they appeared directly in front of him 25-30 miles away at 10,000 feet altitude.</p>
    <p>By his plane's clock he timed them at 1:42 minutes for the 47 miles from Mt. Rainier to Mt. Adams, Arnold said, adding that he later figured by triangulation that their speed was 1,200 miles an hour.</p>
    <p><q>I know I never saw anything so fast</q>, he said. </p>
    <p>At first he thought they were geese, but quickly saw they were too big?as big as a DC-4 that was about 20 miles away, he said. The DC-4 pilot reported nothing unusual sighted. Then Mr. Arnold said he thought of jet planes and started to clock them, <q>but their motion was wrong for jet jobs</q>. </p>
    <p><q>I guess I don't know what they were?unless they were guided missiles</q>, said <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a>, who continued here on a business trip. </p>
