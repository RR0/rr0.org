<p class="body">Oklahoma City June 26 (AP) ? Don't sell those strange flying objects reported whizzing over western
  Washington short until the returns are all in ? a flyer claimed today he saw one flash over Oklahoma City.</p>
<p class="body"><q>It was about five or six weeks ago, as near as my wife and I can remember</q> said Biron Savage, 38,
  Oklahoma City businessman pilot.</p>
<p class="body"><q>I was standing in my front yard at the time about dusk, with little sunlight in the sky when a flat
  disc-like object came across the city from just a little east of south and was gone in about four or five seconds.</q>
