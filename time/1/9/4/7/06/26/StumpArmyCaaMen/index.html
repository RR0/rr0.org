<p>Pendleton, Ore., June 26.&#8212;(UP)&#8212;Army and <a href="/org/us/CAA.html">CAA</a> spokesmen expressed skepticism
  today over a report of nine mysterious objects&#8212;whizzing at 1200 miles an hour. </p>
<p><a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE">Kenneth Arnold</a>, a flying Boise, Idaho, businessman who reported seeing them,
  clung, however, to his story of the shiny, flat objects, each as big as a DC-4 passenger plane, racing over
  Washington's Cascade Mountains with a peculiar weaving motion <q>like the tail of kite</q>.</p>
<p>An Army spokesman in Washinton, D. C., commented, <q>as far as we know, nothing flies that fast except a <a
    href="/tech/aero/appareil/missile/v2">V-2 rocket</a>, which travels at about 3,500 miles an hour&#8212;and that's
  too fast to be seen</q>. </p>
<p>The spokesman added that the V-2 rockets reported by <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE">Arnold</a>, and that no
  high-speed experimental tests were being made in the area where Arnold said the objects were.</p>
<p>A Civil Aeronautics Administration inspector in Portland, Ore., added <q>I rather doubt that anything would be
  traveling that fast</q>. </p>
<p><a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE">Arnold</a> described the objects as <q>flat like a pie-pan</q>, and so shiny that
  they reflected the sun like a mirror.</p>
<p>He said he was flying east a 2:59 p. m. two days ago toward Mt. Rainier when they appeared directly in front of him
  25-30 miles away at 10,000 feet altitude.</p>
<p>By his plane's clock he timed them at 1:42 minutes for the 47 miles from Mt. Rainier to Mt. Adams, Arnold said,
  adding that he later figured by triangulation that their speed was 1,200 miles an hour.</p>
<p><q>I could be wrong by 200 or 300 miles an hour</q>, he admitted, <q>but I know I never saw anything so fast</q>.
</p>
<p>He said at first he thought they were geese, but quickly saw they were too big&#8212;as big as a DC-4 that was about
  20 miles away, he said. The DC-4 pilot reported nothing unusual sighted. </p>
<p>Then Arnold said he thought of jet planes and started to clock them, <q>but their motion was wrong for jet jobs</q>.
</p>
<p><q>I guess I don't know what they were&#8212;unless they were guided missiles</q>, said <a
    href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE">Arnold</a>, who continued here on a business trip. </p>
