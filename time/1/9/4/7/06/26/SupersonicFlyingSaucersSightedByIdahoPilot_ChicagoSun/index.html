  Seen 10,000 Feet Up Near Mt. Rainier</p>
<p>PENDLETON, Ore., June 25â€”(AP).</p>
<p> NINE bright, saucer-like objects flying at "incredible" speed at 10,000 feet altitude were reported here today by
  <span class="people" title="Kenneth E. Arnold">Kenneth Arnold</span>, Boise (Idaho), pilot, who said he could not
  hazard a guess as to what they were.</p>
<p>Arnold, a U.S. Forest Service employee searching for a missing plane, said he sighted the mystery craft yesterday at
  3 p.m. They were flying between Mount Rainier and Mount Adams, in Washington state, he said, and appeared to weave in
  and out of formation. Arnold said he clocked them and estimated their speed at 1,200 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Inquiries at Yakima last night brought only blank stares, he said, but he added he talked today with an unidentified
  man from Ukiah, south of here, who said he had seen similar objects over the mountains near Ukiah yesterday.</p>
<p>"It seems impossible," Arnold said, "but there it is."</p>
