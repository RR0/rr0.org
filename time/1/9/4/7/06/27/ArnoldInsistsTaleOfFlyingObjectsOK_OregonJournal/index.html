<p>PENDLETON, June 27 (AP) ? <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Kenneth Arnold</a>, a veteran pilot and fire
  control engineer, Thursday clung stoutly to his story that he saw nine shiny crescent-shaped planes or pilotless
  missiles flying in formation at a speed of at least 1,200 miles per hour over the Mt. Rainier region.</p>
<p><q>It's God's truth ? I will swear it on a Bible. I saw them and I clocked them. They traveled 48 to 50 miles in 1
  minute and 42 seconds.</q></p>
<p>(A plane traveling 48 miles in 1 minute and 42 seconds would be moving at a speed of 1,692 miles per hour.)</p>
<p><a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a> said he saw the objects flying in <q>weaving formation</q>
  in a line at 10,000 feet as he piloted his own small private plane over Mineral, Wash. He said he flew at a right
  angle to the line of flashing objects.</p>
<p>When he landed at Pendleton, in route to Boise Idaho, Arnold told his story and stuck to it.</p>
<p><q>Some of the pilots thought it over and said it was possible. Some of them guessed that I had seen some secret
  guided missiles. People began asking me if I thought they were missiles sent over the North Pole. I don't know what
  they were, but I know this ? I saw them.</q></p>
<p><a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a>, general manager and owner of the Great Western Fire
  Control
  Company, said he first saw the objects when they flashed in the sun low over the slopes of Mt. Rainier.
</p>
<p><q>Then I saw them, weaving and ducking in and out as they came south not more than 500 feet over the plateau. They
  looked like they were rocking. I looked for the tails but suddenly realized they didn't have any. They were half-moon
  shaped, oval in front and convex in the rear. I was in a beautiful position to watch them. I thought they might be jet
  planes, and I clocked them. Then when I saw they had no tails and I realized how fast they were going, I knew they
  were like nothing I had ever heard of before. There were no bulges or cowlings; they looked like a big flat disk. They
  were larger than the ordinary jet plane but slightly smaller than a DC4, if you don't count the rear fuselage.</q></p>
<p>Arnold said that the objects waived <q>like the tail of a Chinese kite.</q></p>
<p><q>They hugged the horseback between Mt. Rainier and Mt. Adams, and the flashing they made in the sun reminded me of
  the reflection of a great mirror.</q></p>
