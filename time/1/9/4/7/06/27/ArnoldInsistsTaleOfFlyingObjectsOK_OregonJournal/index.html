  </table><p class="body">PENDLETON, June 27 (AP) ? <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Kenneth Arnold</a>, a
  veteran pilot and fire control engineer, Thursday clung stoutly to his story that he saw nine shiny crescent-shaped
  planes or pilotless missiles flying in formation at a speed of at least 1,200 miles per hour over the Mt. Rainier
  region.</p>
  <p class="body"><q>It's God's truth ? I will swear it on a Bible. I saw them and I clocked them. They traveled 48 to
    50 miles in 1 minute and 42 seconds.</q></p>
  <p class="body">(A plane traveling 48 miles in 1 minute and 42 seconds would be moving at a speed of 1,692 miles per
    hour.)</p>
  <p class="body"><a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a> said he saw the objects flying in <q>weaving
    formation</q> in a line at 10,000 feet as he piloted his own small private plane over Mineral, Wash. He said he flew
    at a right angle to the line of flashing objects.</p>
  <p class="body">When he landed at Pendleton, in route to Boise Idaho, Arnold told his story and stuck to it.</p>
  <p class="body"><q>Some of the pilots thought it over and said it was possible. Some of them guessed that I had seen
    some secret guided missiles. People began asking me if I thought they were missiles sent over the North Pole. I
    don't know what they were, but I know this ? I saw them.</q></p>
  <p class="body"><a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a>, general manager and owner of the Great
    Western Fire Control Company, said he first saw the objects when they flashed in the sun low over the slopes of Mt.
    Rainier.</p>
  <p class="body"><q>Then I saw them, weaving and ducking in and out as they came south not more than 500 feet over the
    plateau. They looked like they were rocking. I looked for the tails but suddenly realized they didn't have any. They
    were half-moon shaped, oval in front and convex in the rear. I was in a beautiful position to watch them. I thought
    they might be jet planes, and I clocked them. Then when I saw they had no tails and I realized how fast they were
    going, I knew they were like nothing I had ever heard of before. There were no bulges or cowlings; they looked like
    a big flat disk. They were larger than the ordinary jet plane but slightly smaller than a DC4, if you don't count
    the rear fuselage.</q></p>
  <p class="body">Arnold said that the objects waived <q>like the tail of a Chinese kite.</q></p>
  <p class="body"><q>They hugged the horseback between Mt. Rainier and Mt. Adams, and the flashing they made in the sun
    reminded me of the reflection of a great mirror.</q></p>
