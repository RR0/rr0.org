<p>Lloyd Kenyon, 26 of 6934 S. E. 45th Avenue, today told the journal he had seen the much discussed piepan objects
  while over-seas during the war and also while fishing on Johnson Creek less than a year ago.</p>
<p>Kenyon, a former shipfitter in the Navy, reported he first saw the disks while in the Russell Islands in 1943. He was
  aboard a ship at the time and said several others saw the objects traveling at an unbelievable speed.</p>
<p>"I have also seen the same objects several times while fishing."</p>
