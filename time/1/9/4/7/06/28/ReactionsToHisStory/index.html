<p>Pendleton, Ore., June 27—(U.P.)—<a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethEE/index.html">Kenneth Arnold</a> said
  Friday he would like to get on one of his 1,200-mile-an-hour "Flying Saucers" and escape from the furore caused by his
  story of mysterious aircraft flashing over southern Washington.</p>
<p>"I haven't has a moment of peace since I first told the story," the 32-year-old Boise, Idaho, businessman pilot
  sighed. </p>
<p>He said a preacher called him from Texas and informed him that the strange objects <a
  href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethEE/index.html">Arnold</a> claimed to have seen batting through the ozone actually were
  harbingers of doomsday.</p>
<p><a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethEE/index.html">Arnold</a> said he didn't get the preacher's name during their phone
  conversation, but the minister said he was getting his clocks "ready for the end of this world."</p>
<p>That was unnerving, according <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethEE/index.html">Arnold</a>, but it wasn't half as
  disconcerting as the episode in a Pendleton cafe.</p>
<p><a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethEE/index.html">Arnold</a> said a woman rushed in, took one look at him and then
  dashed
  out shrieking "there's the man who saw the men from Mars." She rushed out of the eating place "sobbing that she would
  have to do something for the children," <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethEE/index.html">Arnold</a> added with a
  shudder.
</p>
<p><a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethEE/index.html">Arnold</a>, a representative of a fire control equipment firm,
  startled
  the country Thursday by reporting he had seen nine shiny round objects skimming through the air in formation between
  Mt. Rainier, Wash., and Mt. Adams. <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethEE/index.html">Arnold</a> said he was able to clock
  them with the stop watch on his own plane's instrument panel. He said they were spinning off a neat 1,200 m. p. h.
</p>
<p>"This whole thing has gotten out of hand," <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethEE/index.html">Arnold</a> went on. "I want
  to talk to the <a href="/org/us/ic/fbi/index.html">FBI</a> or someone.</p>
<p>"Half the people I see look at me as a combination <a href="/people/e/EinsteinAlbert/index.html">Einstein</a>, Flash
  Gordon and Screwball. I wonder what my wife back Idaho thinks." </p>
<p>But all the hoopla and hysterics haven't caused <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethEE/index.html">Arnold</a> to change
  his mind or back down. He doesn't care if the experts laugh him off. He said most of his aviator friends tell him that
  what he saw were probably either one of two things: New planes or guided missiles still in the U. S. Army Air forces'
  secret category. Some theorized they were experimental equipment of another nation, probably Russia. </p>
<p>"Most people," he said, "tell me I'm right."</p>
<p>But meanwhile, aeronautical experts in Washington and elsewhere were teeing off on Arnold's story with facts and
  figures straight out of the books.</p>
<p>Their principal point seemed to be that if <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethEE/index.html">Arnold</a>'s saucers moved
  as fast as he claimed, they couldn't have been tracked with anything short of radar.</p>
<p>The fastest man has yet flown 647 miles per hour—a record set recently by Col. Albert Boyd in a P-80. </p>
