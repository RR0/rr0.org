<p>Two boys Sunday said they saw <q>flying disks</q> speeding southeast of the Lambert Gardens, 5120 S.E. 28th Avenue,
  shortly after 4 pm.</p>
<p>John Waymire, 6210 S.E. 34th Avenue and Freddie Hodge, 3438 S.E. Holman Street, both 13, telephoned the Journal that
  they observed the <q>disks</q> dipping and flashing in the sun.</p>
<p>They were flying very high, according to the boys, and appeared larger than a plane soaring near the earth.</p>
