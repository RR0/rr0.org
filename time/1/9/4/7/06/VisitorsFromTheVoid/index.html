<p>THERE have been signs, symbols and objects in the skies of earth described as snakes, swords, lights and rockets.
  Slow-moving so-called meteors have zig-zagged their way above the clouds, and stratospheric explosions have rocked the
  land below. Mysterious rays stopped airplaine motors over the world's largest city as unidentified phantom planes
  puzzled the war departments of four nations. Ships and men were observed to drop from the heavens in isolated areas
  only to vanish. </p>
<p>This is the startling story of bewildering events that have occured in the last few years. What relationship, if any,
  exists between these varied reports? Who or what lies behind them?</p>
<p>From Point Pleasant, W. Va., on <time>1931-10-11</time>, came the report that a blimp or dirigible was observed to
  have plunged to the earth in flames, men leaping from it in parachutes as it fell. There were many witnesses who
  stated that the crash had occurred in the hills south of the city. Observers at Gallipolis Ferry reported that the
  blimp had crossed the Ohio River and it had fallen while one man was watching it through field glasses. Described as
  being between a hundred and one hundred and fifty feet long, it was at an altitude of three hundred feet when it
  burst. White objects, believed to have been parachutes, fell with it.</p>
<p>Searching parties were organized. Nearby airports sent planes to assist in the all-day search. Officials at Akron,
  Ohio, announced that all naval blimps were safe in their hangars. And despite the extensive search and far-flung
  inquiries, not a single clue was turned up. The mystery remains â€” concealed somewhere in the West Virginia hills
  the solution to this puzzle is still a secret. </p>
<p>Then, slightly less that two months later, came a report from Hammonton, N. J. On Dec. 5, late in afternoon, an
  aviator was observed to fall in a parachute into the Folsom Swamp, one of the densest sections of bog and woodland in
  the southern part of the state, south of the city. Additional reports of witnesses came from Weymouth, a village on
  the other side of the swamp. Dropping from a high altitude, no place had been observed or heard. </p>
<p>Led by state police, five local fire companies and witnesses, a small army of volunteers searched the swamp all night
  and all the next day. Airports throughout the eastern part of the country reported taht all planes were accounted for.
  The long search was fruitless, but it was added that the swamp contains areas never penetrated before except by
  Indians.</p>
<p>A year later, on <time>1932-12-29</time>, it was reported that a large tri-motored airplane had been forced down in
  the woodlands eight miles west of New Brunswick, N. J. Observers said that its motors were silent and that its lights
  were blinking when it disappeared behind the wooded hills. Time of the observation was close to midnight. Again the
  state police made an unsuccessful search, and again all planes thoughout the east were accounted for.</p>
<p>These three reports were collected from the New York <em>Times</em> by David Markham, a member of the Fortean
  Society. According to Tiffany Thayer, secretary of the Fortean Society, Mr. Markham, who has been collecting material
  on maritime vanishments, has reached certain quasi-conclusions which he has asked him to <em>withhold temporarily as
    possibly too dangerous to make public.</em> My article "Strange Secrets of the Sea" presents the type of material
  referred to.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, these reports of men or airships dropping to earth and vanishing without a trace are not unique. The
  original records of the late <span class="people">Charles Fort</span> contain several similar accounts. How many more
  lie buried in the files of obscure newspapers we can only guess.</p>
<p>ONE year after the New Brunswick report a mysterious plane appeared over New York City. On <time>1933-12-26</time>,
  the metropolis was blotted out from above by a snowstorm. The first telephone call to police headquarters was made at
  9:30 a. m. and then the reports steadily increased. The plane could not be seen, but its progress was followed by the
  sound of its motor. Apparently the pilot was wandering blindly above the snow-shrouded towers of Manhattan in circles
  unable to find a place to land. </p>
<p>In the hop that the pilot had a short-wave receiver, the National Broadcasting Company tried to contact him. All
  airports were notified. Beacons and searchlights were lit. A ceiling of five hundred feet was reported at the Newark
  Airport. As the hours lengthened the ceiling rose, but the reports continued to flow in. Residents of Jersey City and
  the Bronx announced hearing the motor. By the middle of the afternoon, when the reports finally ceased, the visibility
  was set at a mile and the pilot could easily have landed at ports in New Jersey or Long Island, but all air fields in
  the Metropolitan area reported that there had been no flying during the day and no stray plane had appeared.</p>

<p>At this time a phantom plane was appearing over the Scandinavian countries. The first dispatch was released at
  Stockholm on Dec. 31, 1933, and it announced that Swedish army aviators had been ordered to chase a mysterious plane
  which had been sighted for several weeks over Lapland. Based, it was believed, somewhere in the mountains, it has been
  making night flights, and had recently been heard flying toward Norway during a heavy snowstorm. </p>
<p>Another dispatch from the same city on Jan. 9, 1934, stated that the "ghost plane" had been observed over
  Westerbotten in northern Sweden, and that the Swedish airforce had already lost two airplanes in effort to locate the
  base of the mystery ship. A party of four men who had been making a ground search along the Norvegian border had
  vanished. </p>
