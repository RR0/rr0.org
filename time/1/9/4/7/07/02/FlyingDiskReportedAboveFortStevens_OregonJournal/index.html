<p class="body">ASTORIA, July 2. ? <q>There is a flying disk right now over Fort Stevens</q>, Mrs. Earl Seado, housewife
  residing in the Fort Stevens annex, said Monday at 1 p.m., when she called an Astoria newspaper office.</p>
<p class="body">She was asked to chart its course. Mrs. Seado said it was heading across Fort Stevens in a northern
  direction and that it had been visible for 15 minutes, even when the sun was not shining. It was dazzling bright and
  saucer-shaped.</p>
<p class="body"><q>Everybody in the annex saw it</q>, she said. Mrs. Seado was asked to call another of the witnesses,
  preferably a man, to the phone.</p>
<p class="body">A man did come but said, <q>I won't give you my name. I don't want the same thing to happen to me that
  happened to the first man who said he saw a disk.</q></p>
<p class="body">The man said he was a welder and had looked at the disk through the welder's goggles because it was so
  bright. He said that he was not certain whether the disk was reflected light or some physical object but it was
  blinding bright. In contrast to Mrs. Seado, the welder said that he could not make out the direction taken by the
  disks because the <q>clouds were moving so fast.</q></p>
<p class="body">The reporter receiving the two reports rushed the call to Fort Stevens and was answered by a calm,
  drowsy voice which reported that no official report had reached the headquarters of flying disks. Fort Stevens, he
  reported, was intact. He did not refer the call to the commanding officer.</p>
<p class="body">A second call made to the Coast Guard, was answered by an alert man on the switchboard who reported that
  no disks had been reported. He stepped outside and saw none.</p>
