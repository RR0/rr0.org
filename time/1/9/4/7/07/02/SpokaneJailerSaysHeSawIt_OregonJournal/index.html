<p>Spokane, July 2. (AP) ? Two Spokane residents, one of them a sheriff's officer, said Tuesday they saw a <q>flying
  saucer</q> speeding over Spokane Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>John Mourning, county night jailer, submitted an official report to the sheriff's office saying there was a <q>bright,
  shiny object coming from the west</q> which was much higher than most airplanes fly and <q>did not have any wings but
  appeared to be round.</q></p>
<p>He said there was no motor sound and declared jet planes <q>are very slow in comparison with what I saw.</q></p>
<p>David Allen, 18, said he saw an object while washing windows downtown which <q>looked like a silver dollar and was
  going very fast.</q></p>
