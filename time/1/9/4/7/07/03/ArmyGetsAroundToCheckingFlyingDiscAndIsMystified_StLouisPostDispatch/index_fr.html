<p>WASHINGTON, July 3 (UP)- Army research experts can't explain the "flying saucers" reported seen in several western
  states, but they are investigating, they said.</p>
<p> The Army air forces has checked all of their research authorities and contractors, but none of them knew or could
  suggest anything concrete about the "saucers". </p>
<p>At first, Army officers laughed off the reports. Now they are beginning to take them at least a little seriously. At
  any rate, the Air Research Center at Wright Field, O., is looking into the reports, and all service intelligence
  agencies are at work on them.</p>
<p>Army experts suggested-as a bare possibility-that some civilian inventor has been making experiments of some
  kind.</p>
<p>The possibility that the discs might be of foreign origin was indirectly put forward by an A.A.F. spokesman who
  said: </p>
<p><q>If some foreign power is sending flying discs over the United States, it is our responsibility to know about it
  and take proper action.</q></p>
<p> Meanwhile eight more names were added to the list of persons who say they have seen strange objects in the sky.</p>
<p>E. E. Unger, meteorologist in charge of the United States Weather Bureau at Louisville, Ky., said today he saw one of
  the mysterious discs objects last night when leaving a Louisville theater.</p>
<p>In Boise, Lt. Governor Donald S. Whitehead revealed that last June 24, the day Keneth Arnold of Boise, Idaho, said he
  saw speeding objects wavering through the air along the slopes of Mount Rainer, he and Head Justice of the Peace, J.
  M. Lampert observed a strange, comet-like object hanging in the western sky.</p>
<p>Dick Rankin, a former Portland (Ore.) flyer with more than 7000 hours air time, declared he saw the mysterious discs
  over Bakersfield, Calif., going 300 to 400 miles an hour June 23. </p>
