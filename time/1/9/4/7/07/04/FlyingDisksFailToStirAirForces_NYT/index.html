<p> WASHINGTON, July 3 (AP)--A preliminary inquiry into reports that strange "flying disks" have been whizzing at 1,200
  miles an hour over the Western United States "has not produced enough fact to warrant further investigation," an Army
  Air Forces spokesman said today.</p>
<p> The official said "we don't have a thing that would give any realism" to a report made last week by a flying Boise
  (Idaho) business man. He said he saw nine mysterious objects--big as airplanes--racing over Washington State's Cascade
  Range. Several other persons in widely scattered localities later said they had glimpsed similar objects.</p>
<p> The Air Forces spokesman said the Army has no new experimental planes or guided missiles which would fit such a
  description. He said Air Forces people are inclined to believe either that the observers just imagined they saw
  something, or that there is some meteorological explanation for the phenomenon.</p>
<p> However, Wright Field (Dayton, Ohio) public relations officials said the Air Materiel Command is making an
  investigation of "saucer-shaped" missiles seen recently in the Pacific, Northwest and Texas.</p>
<p> Describing conversations with "a meteorologist from Langley Field, the Washington Air Forces spokesman said these
  meteorological "maybes" have been discussed:</p>
<p> That solar reflections on low-hanging clouds produced spectral "flashes" which might have appeared like moving
  objects. That a small meteor might have broken up. That icing conditions in high clouds produced "large hailstones
  which might have flattened out and glided a bit." </p>
