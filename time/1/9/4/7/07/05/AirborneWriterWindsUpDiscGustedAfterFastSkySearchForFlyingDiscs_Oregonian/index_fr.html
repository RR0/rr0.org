    This blank piece of low-quality paper, 23 1/2 by 36 inches, held by Sherman Cook, 2000 N. E. 65th Ave., fluttered
    down from a great height Friday afternoon to a landing on the Rose City golf course, where Cook retrieved it. During
    the paper's descent, it was reported by numerous observers as a "flying saucer" hovering. Earlier, a flurry of
    "saucer" reports had coincided with a flight of army jet planes over Portland.

<p>AT 10, 500 FEET OVER PORTLAND WITH THE OREGONIAN'S "FLYING SAUCER" HUNTING EXPEDITION. July 4 (Special) ? There's
  nobody up there but us and the birds. On second thought, there are no birds, either.</p>
<p>Persistent and widespread reports of scads of "flying saucers" over the city ? the Vancouver, Wash., sheriff's office
  reported 20 in a line "going like hell toward the west" ? sent our scientific party scrambling aloft.</p>
<section>
  <h2>Lonely Up There</h2>
  <p>Armed with a camera in the trembling (but eager) hands of Harold Gazin and the airplane in the hands of Bryce
    Piper, instructor at Oregon City's Sky Park airport, we circled upward over Oaks Amusement park where the flitting
    phenomena first were sighted.</p>
  <p>No balloons, no "flying saucers," no other planes were in sight.</p>
  <p>We leveled out at 10,500 feet and flew westward on the trail of the 20 saucers, peering eagerly for the first sight
    of the sun-reflecting, weaving discs.</p>
  <p>Over the crest of the Coast range hung a scanty fringe of clouds. We joined the clouds and looked westward. Ahead
    of us was Tillamook backed by a sizable chunk of Pacific ocean, but no discs. The only interesting sight was a lone
    plane, flitting toward Astoria in the distance.</p>

  <h2>Lots of Scenery Seen</h2>
  <p>Turning back over the Willamette valley, the expedition checked visibility. To the south we could see Salem and
    Albany. To the east were the Three Sisters, Mt. Jefferson, and Mt. Hood with few intervening clouds.</p>
  <p>Northward across the Columbia were Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Adams and the base of cloud-shrouded Mt. Rainier. But no
    saucers.</p>
  <p>The expedition returned to Portland, where it suddenly occurred to a scientific mind that the discs might be a
    modern version of the flying rugs popular in Arabian Nights days ? if they had days with their nights.</p>

  <h2>Real Planes Sighted</h2>
  <p>That might mean a silver foil rug too thin to be seen from the same altitude. The expedition plane dipped down 8000
    feet, still circling for a glimpse of the elusive saucer.</p>
  <p>No soap. Our scientific eager beavers spotted two or three light planes going about their business at an altitude
    of 1500 feet, but no discs.</p>
  <p>At that altitude there was nothing else for it. We landed satisfied there were no discs. And immediately reports of
    a new saucer infestation began to flood The Oregonian's city desk.</p>
