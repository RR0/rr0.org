    <p class="body">By Associated Press</p>
    <p class="body">The nation was baffled Saturday by the "flying saucers&rdquo; reported seen in 28 states by hundreds
      of persons while conjectures on their meaning flew as furiously as the reported speed of the silvery discs.</p>
    <p class="body">Official government sources took a "<q>let's see one</q>&rdquo; stand on the phenomenon, and so
      scientists preferred a detailed explanation.</p>
    <p class="body">Near unanimity was recorded on some of the discs' characteristics ? terrific speed, bright
      reflections, round or oval in shape, flat, and flying with a peculiar undulating motion. Size was moot and
      expressed by Captain Smith of United Air Lines as "hard to judge&rdquo; without knowing the distance from the
      observer to the objects.</p>
    <p class="body">An army air forces spokesman in Washington on July 3 said there was not enough fact to "<q>warrant
      further investigation</q>,&rdquo; but the air materiel command at <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html">Wright
      field</a>, Dayton, Ohio, said it was making a study. Saturday at Washington an army researcher admitted "<q>we're
      mystified</q>&rdquo; and the navy said it had no theories.</p>
    <h4><b>Astronomers Doubt Meteors</b></h4>
    <p class="body">Meanwhile <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Kenneth Arnold</a>, the man who first
      reported them, could recall his insistence when his report was widely questioned, that <q>"I don't believe it,
        either ? but I saw it.&rdquo;</q></p>
    <p class="body">Two Chicago astronomers said the discs probably are "<q>manmade</q>.&rdquo; The undulating, flashing
      objects "<q>couldn't be meteors</q>,&rdquo; said Dr. Gerard Kluper, director of the University of Chicago's Yerkes
      observatory at Williams Bay, Wis.</p>
    <p class="body">"<q>We realize</q>,&rdquo; said Dr. Oliver Lee, director of Northwestern university's Dearborn
      observatory, "<q>that the army and navy are working on all sorts of things we know nothing about.&rdquo;</q></p>
    <p class="body">Officials of the atomic energy commission in Washington said it had no experiments involving "flying
      saucers&rdquo; underway, and one official added, "<q>All we know is what we read in the papers.&rdquo;</q></p>
    <p class="body">An army air force official in Washington said the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/AAF.html">AAF</a> was "<q>completely
      mystified</q>&rdquo; by the saucer reports.</p>
    <h4><b>Hanford Role Denied</b></h4>
    <p class="body">Although no general alert had been sent out for radar scanning of the heavens, he said: "<q>Reports
      of the interception of any suspicious object or ground radar screens will be carefully evaluated.&rdquo;</q></p>
    <p class="body">Col. F. J. Clarke commanding officer of the Hanford engineering works in the Pacific coastal area,
      where the largest saucer influx was reported, said the saucers were not coming from the atomic plant there.</p>
    <p class="body"><q>"I have been waiting for someone to tie the discs to the Hanford atomic plant</q>,&rdquo; he
      said. But he declared that as far as he knew no experiments were under way there that would solve the mystery.</p>
    <p class="body">Credence in the saucers ? widely laughed off at their first reported appearance June 25 ? grew as
      hundreds of observers, many of them trained fliers, reported seeing them.</p>
    <h4><b>Portland Reports Fly</b></h4>
    <p class="body">A crowd of 200 observed a disc at Hauser Lake, Idaho, on the Fourth of July. A group of 60
      picnickers saw them at Twin Falls, Idaho.</p>
    <p class="body">And in Portland so many residents witnessed them that same day that the police department sent out
      an all cars broadcast.</p>
    <p class="body">The discs were seen Saturday in California, Oregon, Washington, Iowa, and South Carolina.</p>
    <p class="body">Two persons in different sections of Charleston, S. C. ? one of them a newspaper reporter ? said a
      flying saucer passed over Charleston heading east at 6:20 P. M. (EST) Saturday.</p>
    <p class="body">J. E. Jonston, Waterloo, Ia., said he saw one Saturday, too. His description ? about the size of a
      dinner plate and only some 25 feet above ground ? was at odds with most reporters which have said the saucers were
      big and flying at great heights.</p>
