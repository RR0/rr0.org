<p class="body">Opinions on the nature of the aerial whatzits which have been drawing the attention of the nation
  skyward came Saturday from these Oregon professional people:</p>
<p class="body">Dr. A. A. Knowlton, Reed college professor of physics:</p>
<p class="body"><q>"In view of the persistence of these reports, we cannot dismiss the &lsquo;flying disc' matter as
  simply another instance of mass hysteria. Probably 95 per cent of the reports come from victims of optical illusions,
  but you can't dismiss the statements of veteran airline pilots, such as Captain <q><a
      href="/people/SmithEmilJ/index.html">Smith</a></q>. (Capt. <a href="/people/SmithEmilJ/index.html">E. J. Smith</a>
  was the United Air Lines pilot who reported sighting the discs Friday night west of Boise.) There is a great
  possibility that the flying visitors are the result of secret experiments with guided missiles, either by our own or
  foreign governments. Some months ago, there were many reports of mysterious rockets flying over Sweden. Stories about
  these were never confirmed or officially explained.&rdquo;</q></p>
<h4><b>Weather Balloons Shine</b></h4>
<p class="body">Col. Eckley S. Ellison, chief of the weather bureau in Portland:</p>
<p class="body"><q>"Helium inflated, uncolored balloons sent aloft by meteorologists for wind observations or to carry
  small radio transmitters which send back information on upper air conditions frequently reflect the sun's rays and
  shine like stars of metal objects when they reach a great height. If someone wanted to play a joke on the country, he
  could hook a few of these balloons together and they would answer the description of the objects seen by some
  observers. Balloons, however, could not reach the great speed attributed to the &lsquo;saucers,' because even above
  the stratosphere, wind currents seldom exceed 100 miles an hour.&rdquo;</q></p>
<p class="body">Josephine Smythe, practicing <a href="../../../../../../../../Astrologie.html">astrologer</a>, 3703 S.
  E. Woodstock boulevard:</p>
<p class="body"><q>"My deduction, on the basis of a special chart I have just completed, is that government experiments,
  either by the army or navy, are responsible for the objects seen in the sky. There is a certain place in the horoscope
  which rules scientific experiments. In this place is the scientific planet, Uranus. It so happens that Uranus now is
  in conjunction with the planet Venus, which rules people. Since we now are in Gemini, the scientific sign of the
  zodiac, I am inclined to think that secret experiments are the answer.&rdquo;</q></p>
<h4><b>Mass Hysteria Possible</b></h4>
<p class="body">Dr. Frederick A. Courts, assistant professor of psychology, Reed college:</p>
<p class="body"><q>"There may be some mass psychological explanation to this sudden rash of &lsquo;flying saucer'
  reports. When people expect to see something, they frequently do. Also, some of these visions may be examples of
  negative after images, common in human beings after eye stimulation. If you look at a bright light for a time, you
  frequently get an after image in a complementary color when you look elsewhere. Looking too long at a shiny, black
  object, a person could see, or think he saw, a white spot in the sky. The whole thing could be the result of a general
  semi-hysteria due to the nervousness of the public over reports of atomic warfare and guided projectiles.&rdquo;</q>
</p>
<p class="body">Dr. J. Hugh Pruett, nationally known Eugene [OR] astronomer:</p>
<p class="body"><q>"I don't know what on earth these mysterious objects can be. One thing is certain; they are not
  meteorites. If they were, someone would have found traces on the ground by now.&rdquo;</q></p>
<h4><b>Pastor Looks to Science</b></h4>
<p class="body">Dr. Raymond Walker, pastor, First Congregational church:</p>
<p class="body"><q>"In the past, any unexplained manifestation, such as a meteor shower or eclipse, was seized upon by
  superstitious minds as a portent of doom. Intelligent church people today realize there is a rational, physical answer
  to such things. A scientific explanation surely will be forthcoming soon.&rdquo;</q></p>
<p class="body">Rev. Jessie Falmer, retired Assembly of God minister:</p>
<p class="body"><q>"These signs and portents in the sky may mean the coming of the Lord is near. The Bible says the
  second coming will be preceded by wars, great disasters and heavenly displays. The way we're having trouble with
  Russia, it certainly looks as if war is imminent.</q></p>
