    <p class="body">Written expressly for International News Service</p>
    <p class="body">How the "flying discs&rdquo; appear from the air is described by <a
        href="/people/SmithEmilJ/index.html">Capt. E. J. Smith</a>, United Airlines pilot, who got an aerial view Friday
      night while on the northwest leg of a Salt Lake City to Seattle flight.</p>
    <h4><b>SEATTLE, July 5 (INS)</b></h4>
    <p class="body">I didn't believe the stories about flying discs myself when I first heard about them. Now I don't
      know what to believe.</p>
    <p class="body">We were on our regular run from Salt Lake City to Seattle just eight minutes out of Boise when my
      co-pilot, First Officer Ralph Stevens, who was flying at the time, blinked our landing lights.</p>
    <p class="body">I asked him what he was doing and he replied: "<q>There's a plane approaching off our
      bow.&rdquo;</q></p>
    <p class="body">But a few seconds later we both decided the object was not a plane, it was a flying disc.</p>
    <h4><b>Four More Appear</b></h4>
    <p class="body">We saw only one of them at first, but soon four more appeared to the left of our plane, in a
      northwesterly direction.</p>
    <p class="body">We couldn't tell what their exact shape was except to notice that they definitely were larger than
      our plane (a DC-30), fairly flat, smooth on the bottom and rough on top.</p>
    <p class="body">Just to check, I called our stewardess, Marty Morrow, to the cockpit, and simply asked her</p>
    <p class="body"><q>"Do you see anything in the sky around us?&rdquo;</q></p>
    <p class="body">Immediately she pointed at the discs and said, "Yes, what are those?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="body">That's what we wanted to know, so I contacted our ground radio station at nearby Ontario, Or., gave
      them our estimated direction and altitude and asked if they could see them. They couldn't.</p>
    <p class="body">Shortly thereafter, the discs disappeared for a few minutes then reappeared again. This time they
      were in our view for 15 minutes.</p>
    <p class="body">None of our eight passengers saw the discs because they were off our bow, and we didn't think to
      turn the plane, so intense was our interest.</p>
    <p class="body">It was impossible to estimate their speed or if they were moving at all. All I know is that when
      they did disappear they vanished suddenly.</p>
    <p class="body">In all the time Ralph and I were flying during the war, and in my 14 years with United Airlines,
      I've never seen anything like it.</p>
    <p class="body">I leave Saturday night on a flight for Chicago and you can bet your life I'm going to keep my eyes
      open.</p>
    <p class="body">Up until last night, we all had discounted 90 per cent of the reports we'd read in the papers or
      heard over the radio, but now.</p>
    <p class="body">Frankly, I'm baffled.</p>
