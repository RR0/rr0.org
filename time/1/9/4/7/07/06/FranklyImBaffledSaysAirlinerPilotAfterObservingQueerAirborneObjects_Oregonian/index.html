    "They weren't aircraft. They were bigger than aircraft and flat and circular," Capt. E. J. Smith, UAL pilot, told
    The Oregonian when he landed here after seeing "discs."

<p>How the "flying discs&rdquo; appear from the air is described by <a
    href="/people/SmithEmilJ/index.html">Capt. E. J. Smith</a>, United Airlines pilot, who got an aerial view Friday
  night while on the northwest leg of a Salt Lake City to Seattle flight.</p>

  <h2>SEATTLE, July 5 (INS)</h2>
  <p>I didn't believe the stories about flying discs myself when I first heard about them. Now I don't know what to
    believe.</p>
  <p>We were on our regular run from Salt Lake City to Seattle just eight minutes out of Boise when my co-pilot, First
    Officer Ralph Stevens, who was flying at the time, blinked our landing lights.</p>
  <p>I asked him what he was doing and he replied: "<q>There's a plane approaching off our bow.</q></p>
  <p>But a few seconds later we both decided the object was not a plane, it was a flying disc.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Four More Appear</h2>
  <p>We saw only one of them at first, but soon four more appeared to the left of our plane, in a northwesterly
    direction.</p>
  <p>We couldn't tell what their exact shape was except to notice that they definitely were larger than our plane (a
    DC-30), fairly flat, smooth on the bottom and rough on top.</p>
  <p>Just to check, I called our stewardess, Marty Morrow, to the cockpit, and simply asked her</p>
  <p><q>"Do you see anything in the sky around us?</q></p>
  <p>Immediately she pointed at the discs and said, "Yes, what are those?</p>
  <p>That's what we wanted to know, so I contacted our ground radio station at nearby Ontario, Or., gave them our
    estimated direction and altitude and asked if they could see them. They couldn't.</p>
  <p>Shortly thereafter, the discs disappeared for a few minutes then reappeared again. This time they were in our view
    for 15 minutes.</p>
  <p>None of our eight passengers saw the discs because they were off our bow, and we didn't think to turn the plane, so
    intense was our interest.</p>
  <p>It was impossible to estimate their speed or if they were moving at all. All I know is that when they did disappear
    they vanished suddenly.</p>
  <p>In all the time Ralph and I were flying during the war, and in my 14 years with United Airlines, I've never seen
    anything like it.</p>
  <p>I leave Saturday night on a flight for Chicago and you can bet your life I'm going to keep my eyes open.</p>
  <p>Up until last night, we all had discounted 90 per cent of the reports we'd read in the papers or heard over the
    radio, but now.</p>
  <p>Frankly, I'm baffled.</p>
