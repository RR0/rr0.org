<p>P-51 fighter planes of the Oregon national guard's 123d squadron, equipped with gun cameras and telescopic cameras,
  will be on the alert to run down and photograph any mysterious "flying discs" reported hereafter in Northwest skies,
  according to an announcement Saturday by Col. Al Dutton, commanding officer.</p>
<p>A flight of six planes will be ready to take off on an instant's notice every week-day afternoon and evening, he
  said. On week ends the squadron will maintain a condition of readiness from dawn to dusk.</p>
<p>Colonel Dutton asked persons sighting the objects to notify The Oregonian or squadron headquarters so that location
  and direction of flight of the "discs" can be plotted.</p>
