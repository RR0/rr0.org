<p class="body">P-51 fighter planes of the Oregon national guard's 123d squadron, equipped with gun cameras and
  telescopic cameras, will be on the alert to run down and photograph any mysterious "flying discs&rdquo; reported
  hereafter in Northwest skies, according to an announcement Saturday by Col. Al Dutton, commanding officer.</p>
<p class="body">A flight of six planes will be ready to take off on an instant's notice every week-day afternoon and
  evening, he said. On week ends the squadron will maintain a condition of readiness from dawn to dusk.</p>
<p class="body">Colonel Dutton asked persons sighting the objects to notify The Oregonian or squadron headquarters so
  that location and direction of flight of the "discs&rdquo; can be plotted.</p>
