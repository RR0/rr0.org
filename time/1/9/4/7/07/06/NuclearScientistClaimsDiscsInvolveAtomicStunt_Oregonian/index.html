<p class="body">LOS ANGELES, July 5 (AP)</p>
<p class="body">The Evening Herald and Express quoted an unnamed "scientist in nuclear physics&rdquo; at California
  Institute of Technology Saturday as suggesting that "transmutation of atomic energy,&rdquo; experiments might be
  responsible for the flying saucers.</p>
<p class="body">The newspaper described him as a researcher on the Manhattan atomic project and said he asked that his
  name be withheld. It quoted him:</p>
<p class="body">"These saucers so-called are capable of high speed, but can be controlled from the ground. They are 20
  feet in width in the center and are partially rocket propelled on the takeoff.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">The paper said such experiments are being conducted at Muroc Dry Lake, Cal.; White Sands, N. M.;
  Portland, Or., and elsewhere. It further quoted the scientist:</p>
<p class="body">"People are not seeing things. Such flying discs actually are in experimental existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">In Chicago, Dr. Harold Urey, atom scientist at the University of Chicago, commented "Transmutation of
  atomic energy sounds like gibberish. You can transmute metals not energy.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><b>Guard Posts &lsquo;Disc Watch'<br> Airplanes Alerted With Gun Cameras</b></h3>
<p class="body">P-51 fighter planes of the Oregon national guard's 123d squadron, equipped with gun cameras and
  telescopic cameras, will be on the alert to run down and photograph any mysterious "flying discs&rdquo; reported
  hereafter in Northwest skies, according to an announcement Saturday by Col. Al Dutton, commanding officer.</p>
<p class="body">A flight of six planes will be ready to take off on an instant's notice every week-day afternoon and
  evening, he said. On week ends the squadron will maintain a condition of readiness from dawn to dusk.</p>
<p class="body">Colonel Dutton asked persons sighting the objects to notify The Oregonian or squadron headquarters so
  that location and direction of flight of the "discs&rdquo; can be plotted.</p>

<h3><b>&lsquo;Frankly, I'm Baffled,' Says Airliner Pilot After Observing Queer Airborne Objects</b></h3>
<p class="body"><i>[photo of Stevens in uniform on phone]</i></p>
<p class="body"><i>[Caption:] In Portland, First Officer Ralph Stevens described strange "discs&rdquo; he and other crew
  members of a United Air Liner transport plane sighted on a flight from Boise Friday.</i></p>
<p class="body"><i>[photo of Smith in uniform talking]</i></p>
<p class="body"><i>[Caption:] "They weren't aircraft. They were bigger than aircraft and flat and circular,&rdquo; Capt.
  E. J. Smith, UAL pilot, told The Oregonian when he landed here after seeing "discs.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p class="body">By Capt. E. J. SMITH</p>
<p class="body">Written expressly for International News Service</p>
<p class="body">How the "flying discs&rdquo; appear from the air is described by Capt. E. J. Smith, United Airlines
  pilot, who got an aerial view Friday night while on the northwest leg of a Salt Lake City to Seattle flight.</p>
<h4><b>SEATTLE, July 5 (INS)</b></h4>
<p class="body">I didn't believe the stories about flying discs myself when I first heard about them. Now I don't know
  what to believe.</p>
<p class="body">We were on our regular run from Salt Lake City to Seattle just eight minutes out of Boise when my
  co-pilot, First Officer Ralph Stevens, who was flying at the time, blinked our landing lights.</p>
<p class="body">I asked him what he was doing and he replied: "There's a plane approaching off our bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">But a few seconds later we both decided the object was not a plane, it was a flying disc.</p>
<h4><b>Four More Appear</b></h4>
<p class="body">We saw only one of them at first, but soon four more appeared to the left of our plane, in a
  northwesterly direction.</p>
<p class="body">We couldn't tell what their exact shape was except to notice that they definitely were larger than our
  plane (a DC-30), fairly flat, smooth on the bottom and rough on top.</p>
<p class="body">Just to check, I called our stewardess, Marty Morrow, to the cockpit, and simply asked her</p>
<p class="body">"Do you see anything in the sky around us?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">Immediately she pointed at the discs and said, "Yes, what are those?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">That's what we wanted to know, so I contacted our ground radio station at nearby Ontario, Or., gave them
  our estimated direction and altitude and asked if they could see them. They couldn't.</p>
<p class="body">Shortly thereafter, the discs disappeared for a few minutes then reappeared again. This time they were
  in our view for 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="body">None of our eight passengers saw the discs because they were off our bow, and we didn't think to turn
  the plane, so intense was our interest.</p>
<p class="body">It was impossible to estimate their speed or if they were moving at all. All I know is that when they
  did disappear they vanished suddenly.</p>
<p class="body">In all the time Ralph and I were flying during the war, and in my 14 years with United Airlines, I've
  never seen anything like it.</p>
<p class="body">I leave Saturday night on a flight for Chicago and you can bet your life I'm going to keep my eyes
  open.</p>
<p class="body">Up until last night, we all had discounted 90 per cent of the reports we'd read in the papers or heard
  over the radio, but now.</p>
<p class="body">Frankly, I'm baffled.</p>
<p class="body"></p>

<h3><b>Puzzle Alerts Entire Nation to Scan Sky</b></h3>
<p class="body">By Associated Press</p>
<p class="body">The nation's perplexity over discs reported spinning through the skies deepened Saturday in the wake of
  July 4 reports from virtually all parts of the country.</p>
<p class="body">There was no scientific explanation offered to fit the observations which spanned the nation from the
  Pacific to the gulf to the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="body">A mass of evidence piled up swiftly as holiday throngs and fliers joined in telling of seeing bright,
  pancakelike objects skimming through the air at varying estimates of altitude and speed.</p>
<p class="body">Former skeptics joined the ranks of the believers as the flashing objects glittered before their eyes.
  Reliable observers, such as Capt. E. J. Smith of United Air Lines, his copilot Ralph Stevens, and his stewardess Marty
  Morrow, told of seeing the round flat objects for 12 minutes while flying west from Boise, Idaho, on Independence day
  evening. Ex-airmen, picnickers, motorists, and housewives swelled the number of witnesses to the strange
  phenomenon.</p>
<h4><b>Pilot Sees Objects First</b></h4>
<p class="body">The first published report of "flying saucers&rdquo; came from Kenneth Arnold, Boise, Idaho, businessman
  pilot, who reported at Pendleton, Or., on June 25 that he had seen nine flying at 1200 miles an hour in formation,
  shifting position "like the tail of a kite,&rdquo; over Washington state's Cascade mountains.</p>
<p class="body">Before scoffers had more than begun to offer explanations such as "reflections,&rdquo; "persistent
  vision&rdquo; and "snow blindness,&rdquo; an Oklahoma City private flier, Byron Savage, said he had seen a similarly
  shaped object some weeks earlier, but that fear of ridicule kept him quiet.</p>
<p class="body">Then the reports began to filter in, mostly from individuals. The discs were seen in Texas, New Mexico,
  Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Missouri, Colorado, California, Arkansas, Nebraska. The number varied from one to a dozen,
  seen by one or two people mostly.</p>
<h4><b>Reports Come in From East</b></h4>
<p class="body">Then the July 4 deluge hit. Two hundred persons in one group and 60 in another saw them in Idaho;
  hundreds saw them in Oregon, Washington and other states throughout the West.</p>
<p class="body">And for the first time, the Eastern states had their reports. Observers, earlier all from west of the
  Mississippi river, came in with reports from Michigan, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Indiana, Kentucky,
  Georgia, South Carolina, and Canada's Atlantic seaboard.</p>
<p class="body">Ted Tannich and William Lemon, of Albany, Saturday saw a silvery object fly southward, halt abruptly,
  and then retrace its course. It was visible for possibly 15 seconds, they said.</p>

<h3><b>Flying Saucers Everywhere; New Tales Convert Skeptics<br> The Great Flying Disc Mystery: It Evokes Theories From
  Scientists and Stargazers, Preachers and Pilots</b></h3>
<p class="body">Opinions on the nature of the aerial whatzits which have been drawing the attention of the nation
  skyward came Saturday from these Oregon professional people:</p>
<p class="body">Dr. A. A. Knowlton, Reed college professor of physics:</p>
<p class="body">"In view of the persistence of these reports, we cannot dismiss the &lsquo;flying disc' matter as simply
  another instance of mass hysteria. Probably 95 per cent of the reports come from victims of optical illusions, but you
  can't dismiss the statements of veteran airline pilots, such as Captain Smith. (Capt. E. J. Smith was the United Air
  Lines pilot who reported sighting the discs Friday night west of Boise.) There is a great possibility that the flying
  visitors are the result of secret experiments with guided missiles, either by our own or foreign governments. Some
  months ago, there were many reports of mysterious rockets flying over Sweden. Stories about these were never confirmed
  or officially explained.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><b>Weather Balloons Shine</b></h4>
<p class="body">Col. Eckley S. Ellison, chief of the weather bureau in Portland:</p>
<p class="body">"Helium inflated, uncolored balloons sent aloft by meteorologists for wind observations or to carry
  small radio transmitters which send back information on upper air conditions frequently reflect the sun's rays and
  shine like stars of metal objects when they reach a great height. If someone wanted to play a joke on the country, he
  could hook a few of these balloons together and they would answer the description of the objects seen by some
  observers. Balloons, however, could not reach the great speed attributed to the &lsquo;saucers,' because even above
  the stratosphere, wind currents seldom exceed 100 miles an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">Josephine Smythe, practicing <a href="../../../../../../../../Astrologie.html">astrologer</a>, 3703 S.
  E. Woodstock boulevard:</p>
<p class="body">"My deduction, on the basis of a special chart I have just completed, is that government experiments,
  either by the army or navy, are responsible for the objects seen in the sky. There is a certain place in the horoscope
  which rules scientific experiments. In this place is the scientific planet, Uranus. It so happens that Uranus now is
  in conjunction with the planet Venus, which rules people. Since we now are in Gemini, the scientific sign of the
  zodiac, I am inclined to think that secret experiments are the answer.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><b>Mass Hysteria Possible</b></h4>
<p class="body">Dr. Frederick A. Courts, assistant professor of psychology, Reed college:</p>
<p class="body">"There may be some mass psychological explanation to this sudden rash of &lsquo;flying saucer' reports.
  When people expect to see something, they frequently do. Also, some of these visions may be examples of negative after
  images, common in human beings after eye stimulation. If you look at a bright light for a time, you frequently get an
  after image in a complementary color when you look elsewhere. Looking too long at a shiny, black object, a person
  could see, or think he saw, a white spot in the sky. The whole thing could be the result of a general semi-hysteria
  due to the nervousness of the public over reports of atomic warfare and guided projectiles.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">Dr. J. Hugh Pruett, nationally known Eugene [OR] astronomer:</p>
<p class="body">"I don't know what on earth these mysterious objects can be. One thing is certain; they are not
  meteorites. If they were, someone would have found traces on the ground by now.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><b>Pastor Looks to Science</b></h4>
<p class="body">Dr. Raymond Walker, pastor, First Congregational church:</p>
<p class="body">"In the past, any unexplained manifestation, such as a meteor shower or eclipse, was seized upon by
  superstitious minds as a portent of doom. Intelligent church people today realize there is a rational, physical answer
  to such things. A scientific explanation surely will be forthcoming soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">Rev. Jessie Falmer, retired Assembly of God minister:</p>
<p class="body">"These signs and portents in the sky may mean the coming of the Lord is near. The Bible says the second
  coming will be preceded by wars, great disasters and heavenly displays. The way we're having trouble with Russia, it
  certainly looks as if war is imminent.</p>

<h3><b>Disc With Teeth</b></h3>
<p class="body">GRAFTON, Wis., July 7 (INS) ? A Catholic priest here Sunday night reported that a round, metal disc,
  which might be one of the mysterious "flying saucers,&rdquo; had crashed into his parish yard and that he was holding
  it for the federal bureau of investigation.</p>
<p class="body">The recovered disc, with "gadgets and wires,&rdquo; proved after thorough investigation to be a circular
  saw, which had been hurled into the yard, probably by a prankster.</p>

<h3><b>Disc Blitz Feared As Lights Go Out</b></h3>
<p class="body">LODI, Cal., July 7 (UP) ? Residents of Acampo, a residential community one mile north of here, thought
  for sure they were being attacked by flying saucers before dawn Sunday when they heard a roar, saw a glow in the sky,
  and then all the lights went out.</p>
<p class="body">Mrs. W. C. Smith, wife of a high school physics instructor, said the noise was like a four-motored
  bomber with its props feathered for take-off. Looking toward the sky, she saw the glow just as all power in the
  community went off.</p>
<p class="body">Her neighbors said they had seen the same glow and heard the same roar.</p>
<p class="body">Erving Newcomb of the Pacific Gas and Electric company pooh-poohed the flying saucer theory, and said, a
  low-flying, crop dusting plane probably had struck a power line, and burned out a transformer.</p>
<p class="body">The people of Acampo clung to the flying saucer idea, though, especially after no one was able to locate
  any crop dusting plane which had been in the air before dawn on Sunday morning.</p>

<h3><b>Pursuit Plane Pilot Tells Of Dodging Flying Discs</b></h3>
<p class="body">BOZEMAN, Mont. July 7 (AP) ? Casey Baird, pilot of a P-38 pursuit plane working for the United States
  geodetic survey, reported Monday he was forced to evade a group of flying discs, and that his photographer tried to
  get a picture.</p>
<p class="body">Baird said the film would be developed next Monday.</p>
<p class="body">The pilot said he ran into the flying objects at 32,000 feet and had to dodge out of their path while
  trying to photograph them. He said there were eight or nine in the group.</p>
<p class="body">Baird described the flying objects as looking like yo-yo's with a periscope or domelike object on top.
  He said they were 14 or 15 feet in diameter and traveling rapidly.</p>

<h3><b>Eight &lsquo;Flying Saucers' Reported Down on Idaho Mountain</b></h3>
<h3><b>Air Search Scheduled For Region<br> Flights Continue To Be Observed Over Wide Area</b></h3>
<p class="body"><i>Pictures on Wirephoto Page</i></p>
<p class="body">While national guard aircraft Sunday hunted the skies over Pacific Northwest states for sight of the
  mysterious "flying saucers,&rdquo; eight of the flying gadgets were reported to have made a landing on a mountainside
  near St. Maries, Idaho, in full view of ten persons.</p>
<p class="body">Mrs. Walter Johnson of Dishman, Wash., a suburb of Spokane, said she saw the saucers come down in timber
  near St. Maries Thursday, but the incident had not been reported until she returned to her home Sunday.</p>
<p class="body">Col. G. R. Dodson, whose 123rd fighter squadron of the Oregon national guard scoured Oregon and
  Washington skies Sunday searching for the elusive missiles, said a flight of four P-51s would be sent early Monday
  morning to check the area. "So far we haven't found saucer, disc or anything,&rdquo; Colonel Dodson commented.</p>
<p class="body">He described the operation Sunday as "routine,&rdquo; but said the pilots carried instructions to watch
  for flying discs.</p>
<h4><b>Extreme Speed Reported</b></h4>
<p class="body">Mrs. Johnson said the saucers were seen to fall near Butler's bay on the St. Joe river six miles west of
  St. Maries, where she was visiting her parents.</p>
<p class="body">She said they came into view at an extreme speed, traveling from the south to the north. Suddenly they
  slowed, she said, and then "fluttered like leaves to the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">"The mysterious part was that we couldn't see them after they landed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Johnson. "We
  could see them flutter down into the timber yet we couldn't see that they did anything to the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">She said the objects were saucer-shaped, but thicker than she had expected, resembling wash tubs more
  than discs. She described them as "about the size of a five-room house.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><b>Officers See Discs</b></h4>
<p class="body">Mrs. Johnson said the objects were seen by her relatives as well as the neighbors who viewed them
  independently. She said the incident had not been reported earlier because she didn't know whom to contact.</p>
<p class="body">Meanwhile, the man who first started this business of "flying saucers,&rdquo; Kenneth Arnold, Boise,
  Idaho, flying businessman, reported he had invested $150 in a movie camera to get photographic proof of the discs he
  said flipped through the blue yonder "like fish skimming through water.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">Spiking rumors of Army Air Force connection with the flying discs, Gen. Carl Spaatz, commandant of the
  army air forces, denied in Seattle knowing anything about the flying saucers or of plans to use army air force planes
  to look for them. Then he continued on to Medford on a fishing trip.</p>
<h4><b>Utah Group Observed</b></h4>
<p class="body">Discs continued to be sighted at various locations throughout the day Sunday. They were said to have
  been seen at Chicago over Lake Michigan, in Southwestern Ontario, in Wisconsin, Minnesota and in Maryland.</p>
<p class="body">In Utah, ex-state treasurer Oliver G. Ellis and his son saw a group of discs high in the sky west of
  Salt Lake City. He said the "luminous discs behaved like radio-controlled objects, hovering in a group for a moment,
  then suddenly formed a swiftly whirling horizontal circular pattern.&rdquo; He said two discs broke loose from the
  group "as if snapped from the end of a giant whip.&rdquo; Later the flight was continued in a V-formation and moved
  south-westward until it disappeared, Ellis said.</p>
<p class="body">In Portland, reports on the flying objects did not come in before noon. At 12:42 P. M. police were
  called by a man who said he saw what he thought was a flying disc headed south and traveling very fast. A woman
  reported that she saw a reddish object "round as a dollar&rdquo; about 5 P. M. that zoomed out of sight so fast
  neighbors she summoned to look at it failed to glimpse it. Another man standing on the corner of N. W. 6th avenue and
  Glisan street, told The Oregonian he saw four flying discs heading south at a "good rate of speed.</p>
<h4><b>2000 MPH Reported</b></h4>
<p class="body">Reports continued to come in during the daylight hours with one taxi cab driver reporting the
  platter-like objects traveling high and nearly 2000 miles an hour. Another report came in of seven of the discs
  traveling in a "geeselike formation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">The 123d fighter squadron at Portland Army Air base will have airplanes and pilots ready to take off
  Monday if anyone sees any discs, flying around, according to Colonel Dodson. The stable of 23 fast P-51 fighter
  planes, equipped with gun-sight movie cameras, was lined up on the concrete apron Sunday ready to comb the skies for
  any aerial marauders citizens might report.</p>

<h3><b>Guard Planes Plan Search<br> Pictures Sought Of Mystery Discs</b></h3>
<p class="body"><i>See Story on Page 1 also.</i></p>
<p class="body">Northwest national guard air squadrons went on an emergency footing Monday, determined to keep Oregon,
  Washington and Idaho skies under constant surveillance until the mystery of the "flying saucers&rdquo; is solved.</p>
<p class="body">Fighter groups from Portland, Boise and Spokane began arranging sector patrols designed to include every
  portion of the Northwest in a systematic search for the strange aerial visitors.</p>
<p class="body">Col. G. R. Dodson, commander of Portland's 123rd fighter squadron, was in close communication with Col.
  Tom Lamphier, leader of the 190th squadron at Boise, and Col. Frank Frost, Spokane squadron commander. The top air
  officers plotted the areas in which the discs have been reported and made plans for regular patrols by fast,
  camera-equipped warplanes in "flyways&rdquo; established along the Columbia river from Walla Walla to the sea and from
  Puget Sound south to headwaters of the Willamette river.</p>
<p class="body">Additional supplies of movie film for the planes gunsight movie cameras was being flown here from
  Washington, D. C., the officers reported.</p>
<h3><b>Disc Contact Hoax</b></h3>
<p class="body">Earlier in the day Col. Robert Delashaw and Maj. David Warwick, regular AAF officers attached to the ONG
  fighter squadron as instructors, took two P-51s up for a fruitless search flight over Portland after a report that an
  unidentified object had been sighted in the sky above the Eastmoreland golf course.</p>
<p class="body">Additional supplies of movie film for the planes' gunsight movie cameras are expected to arrive Tuesday
  by air express from Washington, D. C., squadron headquarters announced.</p>
<p class="body">Colonel Dodson said he had been informed by telephone from Spokane that Colonel Frost led two search
  missions in flights over the St. Maries, Idaho, area where picknickers Sunday reported seeing eight huge, shining
  discs land in a dense forest. The searchers found nothing, he said.</p>
<p class="body">The story of a P-38 tangling with one of the hurtling hallucinations while engaged in aerial mapping at
  32,000 feet over Montana also proved to be a complete hoax.</p>
<p class="body">Russell Baird, pilot of the photographic plane at Bozeman, Mont., said he was "just sitting around the
  hangar gassing&rdquo; and somebody must have told the tale to the newspapers.</p>
<p class="body"></p>
<hr>
<p class="body">07/08/1947 The Oregonian</p>
<h3><b>Air Forces Deny Discs U.S.-Made</b></h3>
<p class="body">If there is any such thing as a flying saucer disc, washtub or luminous ball of any kind flying around
  loose, it was not made in America. That was the official announcement from the army air forces Monday night in answer
  to the epidemic of reports from 40 states ranging from the Northwest to New England.</p>
<p class="body">"Neither the AAF nor any other component of the armed forces has any plane, guided missile, or other
  aerial device under development which could possibly be mistaken for a saucer or formation of flying discs,&rdquo;
  Maj. Gen. Nathan F. Twining, chief of the AAF air material command, told The Oregonian unequivocally when reached by
  phone at Kirtland army airbase at Albuquerque, N. M.</p>
<h4><b>Air Force Investigates</b></h4>
<p class="body">"Some of these witnesses evidently saw something,&rdquo; General Twining, a native of Portland,
  declared. "But we don't know what. We are investigating.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">AAF laboratories at Wright Field confirmed General Twining's statements to The Oregonian.</p>
<p class="body">The navy and atomic energy commission also officially announced they had no knowledge of or connection
  with the mysterious missiles.</p>
<p class="body">One of the most promising reports from Russell Baird, pilot of a photographic plane near Bozeman, Mont.,
  collapsed when the pilot announced he had merely been "gassing around the hangar&rdquo; and had no intention of
  telling a story for publication.</p>
<p class="body">Another apparently fizzled out when national guard pilots from Spokane failed to find any trace of
  flying platters "big as houses&rdquo; supposed to have fluttered into the timber near St. Maries, Idaho.</p>
<h4><b>Reports Come In Yet</b></h4>
<p class="body">But more reports continued to come spinning in, most of them as elusive and varied as the reported
  missiles themselves.</p>
<p class="body">A Rutland, Vt., woman said she saw a brilliant object in the night sky which she assumed to be a "flying
  saucer,&rdquo; although it was stationary.</p>
<p class="body">At Cambridge, Mass., a housewife said she saw "a group of white flying saucers whirling around and going
  at a tremendous speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">Harvard university astronomical observatory took note of New England's entrance into the game of
  "spinning the platter,&rdquo; but said it had had no luck so far in photographing one of the discs.</p>
<p class="body">Curbstone explanations of the phenomena ranged from the theory they were radio-controlled flying
  missiles sent aloft by U.S. military scientists to the suggestion they might be merely sunlight reflected from the
  wing tanks of jet-propelled planes.</p>
<p class="body">The mysterious saucers first were reported June 25 in the state of Washington, but Charlie T. Hamlet,
  superintendent of the Kingsport, Tenn., Times-News composing room, said he had seen the discs two years ago.</p>
<p class="body">They were "of a bright, aluminum color&rdquo; and "were going at a terrific speed,&rdquo; Hamlet said,
  explaining he kept quiet about them because of the Oak Ridge atomic bomb plant, then a war secret.</p>
<h4><b>Aluminum Discs Seen</b></h4>
<p class="body">Norman Hargrave, a Houston, Tex., jeweler, told a Chronicle reporter Sunday that he had found an
  aluminum disk floating near the beach while he and his wife were walking along the beach.</p>
<p class="body">He said the disk was about 20 inches in diameter and six inches thick.</p>
<p class="body">Monday, however, Hargrave said it was all just a joke.</p>
<p class="body">But the Chronicle, in its final edition Monday pointed out that "there are some mysterious facts
  contained in his (Hargrave's) first report that lend credence to the tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">Hargrave reported the disk bore this inscription:</p>
<p class="body">"Military secret of the United States of America, army air forces M 4339658. Anyone damaging or
  revealing description or whereabouts of this missile subject to prosecution by the United States government. Call
  collect at once LO446 army air forces depot, Spokane, Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><b>Officer Denies Report</b></h4>
<p class="body">In big letters, Hargrave said were plainly printed "nonexplosive.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">At Spokane, Col. Frank D. Hackett, commanding officer of the Spokane air depot, told the Associated
  Press late Monday that he knew "nothing about&rdquo; the reported finding of a flying disk on the Texas Gulf coast
  other than that his public relations office had received a call from the Houston Chronicle.</p>

<p class="body">FORTH WORTH, Tex. July 9 (AP) ? An object found near Roswell, N. M., which created a storm of
  speculation Tuesday that it might be one of the mysterious flying "discs&rdquo; or "saucers&rdquo; was a weather
  balloon and its kite, the 8th air force announced Tuesday.</p>
<p class="body">The announcement was made by Maj. Gen. Roger M. Ramey, commander of the 8th air force with headquarters
  at Fort Worth.</p>
<p class="body">The object was flown from Roswell to Fort Worth by the air force, where it was identified by Warrant
  Officer Irving Newton of Medford, Wis., of the base weather station.</p>
<p class="body">General Ramey said that several of the balloons were released daily according to changes in the
  weather.</p>
<h4><b>Radar Work Aided</b></h4>
<p class="body">(A similar object was identified Monday night at Adrian, Mo., by the Kansas City weather bureau.)</p>
<p class="body">Grant Cook of Adrian found the tin-foil covered object on his farm and notified authorities.
  Investigation by meteorologists revealed it as a reflector for radar signals.</p>
<p class="body">(Printed on the reflector was the notation: "W. X. X. N.-Feb. 21 ? M. P.&rdquo;)</p>
<p class="body">Army weather experts in Washington, however, discounted any idea that the such weather targets might be
  the basis for the scores of reports of "flying discs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">Brig. Gen. Donald Yates, chief of the AAF weather service, said only a very few of them are used daily
  at points where some specific project requires accurate wind information from extreme altitudes. Without field
  reports, he would not hazard a guess on a precise number, he said.</p>
<h4><b>Army Describes Tests</b></h4>
<p class="body">For ordinary purposes, General Yates told a reporter, the AAF uses balloon-borne radiosondes much on the
  order of those employed by the weather bureau, tracking them with radio direction finders. Those instruments consist
  of a milky white balloon five or six feet in diameter with the automatic radio transmitting apparatus suspended below
  in a package about cigar box size.</p>
<p class="body">During the war, General Yates said, the radar target method of wind checking was standard practice
  because of the high degree of accuracy needed.</p>
<p class="body">The weather bureau said it uses none of the radar target balloons at land stations. Some are used from
  coast guard vessels in the Atlantic, bureau officials said, but they normally blow eastward toward Europe.</p>
<h4><b>Many Freed Daily</b></h4>
<p class="body">Between the army and the weather bureau, hundreds of weather balloons without the metallic target are
  released daily from points all over the country.</p>
<p class="body">Ivan R. Tannehill, weather bureau chief forecaster, pointed out, however, that such balloons have been
  in use for many years. He said, they were unlikely to have been mistaken "all over the country and all in one week&rdquo;
  for mysterious objects speeding through the sky at supersonic speeds.</p>
<p class="body">Suspended from the balloons are kites or six-sided stars, covered with a shiny material such as tinfoil.
  These objects are traced by radar and computations from the radar reveal air currents.</p>
<h4><b>Object Damaged</b></h4>
<p class="body">The object found in New Mexico was badly damaged.</p>
<p class="body">The balloons measure 50 inches across but expand greatly as they ascend, air force officers reported.
  They sometimes reach 60,000 feet. The kites and stars generally are more than five feet in diameter.</p>
<p class="body">The balloon and the object it carries are technically known as ray wind [sic] high altitude sounding
  devices, popularly known as "weather radar targets.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">General Ramey said the object found in New Mexico definitely was a United States army device.</p>
<p class="body">Plans to fly the object to Wright field for further investigation were cancelled.</p>
<p class="body">A public relations officer said it was in this office, "and it'll probably stay right there.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">General Ramey spoke over a local radio station (WBAP) Tuesday night after the 8th air force headquarters
  was flooded with queries concerning the object.</p>
<p class="body">In his broadcast, he said that anyone who found an object he believed to be a "flying disc&rdquo; should
  contact the nearest army office or sheriff's office.</p>

<h3><b>&lsquo;Discs' Swoop Over Angler</b></h3>
<p class="body"><i>See Story on Page 1, Also</i></p>
<p class="body">The mysterious "flying saucers&rdquo; ? big and little, black and luminous ? still are plentiful in the
  Pacific Northwest, according to the unflagging volume of reports from wide-eyed sky gazers.</p>
<p class="body">More than 50 telephoned "disc&rdquo; reports came in Tuesday to switchboards at The Oregonian and
  station KGW, which interrupted its regular broadcasts to give listeners the vital statistics on aerial thingumabobs
  citizens said they saw.</p>
<p class="body">Local descriptions included that of a fisherman who was bewildered by four flying objects which he said
  swooped down over his boat, the Darlene Jack, as he was pulling up his nets at the mouth of the Willamette river about
  2 A. M.</p>
<h3><b>Fisherman Hears 'Swoosh'</b></h3>
<p class="body">Malcolm Morrill, who lives on his boat at the North Portland moorage on N. Swift boulevard, told The
  Oregonian that the shapes were bigger than any airplane he had ever seen and made a swooshing noise "something like a
  jet plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">Two discs which looked like silver footballs drew attention of Richard C. Maynard, 3915 N. Houghton
  street, as he sat in a downtown office. The objects he said traveled eastward at about the speed of transport
  planes.</p>
<p class="body">A report from a Mrs. Clement, Vanport, said she saw a disc land and explode near Triangle lake.</p>
<p class="body">The 2-year-old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Hilderbrant, 3405 N. E. 74th avenue, called their
  attention to a pair of very bright spheres high in the sky heading south about 7 P. M., Hilderbrant reported.</p>
<h3><b>Editor Sees Object</b></h3>
<p class="body">Mrs. L. Rutan of 3837 S. E. 40th avenue, her neighbor, Malcolm King, 3715 S. E. 40th avenue, and King's
  mother, father, uncle, and another neighbor saw "a whole cloud of swirling things in the sky&rdquo; about 4:25 P. M.,
  they reported. King said there were 25 of them ? some square ? and that they circled and later disappeared to the
  southeast.</p>
<p class="body">A similar sight greeted the startled eyes of Frank Watson, 3124 N. E. 15th avenue, who breathlessly
  announced he saw a group of about 30 objects in the sky at 4:20 P. M. at an estimated altitude of 7000 feet.</p>
<p class="body">"They were playing dipsy-daisy and chasing each other,&rdquo; he related.</p>
<p class="body">A. T. Pritchard, 8717 N. E. Webster street, editor of the Oregon-Northwest Angler and Hunter magazine,
  said he saw a large object, followed by a bluish haze, zip across the sky between Mt. Hood and Mt. Adams</p>

<h3><b>New Craft Hit As &lsquo;Nonsense'<br> People &lsquo;Imagine' Speeds of 1200</b></h3>
<p class="body">By Ron Moxness<br> <i>Staff Writer, The Oregonian</i></p>
<p class="body"><i>Pictures on Wirephoto Page</i></p>
<p class="body">Those space sailing discs which have given sky-gazing residents of the Pacific Northwest a collective
  pain in the neck might be secret army missiles or "whatzits&rdquo; from another world to some people, but to Mrs.
  Hester Wilson of 2324 N. W. Johnson street they're nothing but toy balloons on the loose.</p>
<p class="body">And she just nodded confidently when army officials announced the "flying disc&rdquo; found in New
  Mexico Tuesday was just a radar reflecting kite attached to a weather balloon.</p>
<p class="body">Mrs. Wilson, for the past 24 years operator of balloon concessions at country fairs and rodeos over
  Oregon and Washington, walked into The Oregonian editorial rooms a little bit fed up with "all this nonsense&rdquo;
  about saucers in the sky.</p>
<p class="body">"They're nothing but fugitives from a concession stand,&rdquo; she muttered. "Made of rubber, full of
  helium and pretty hard to describe when they're traveling high with six or seven more balloons tired on
  behind.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><b>People Termed Imaginative</b></h4>
<p class="body">Mrs. Wilson blamed estimates of 1200-mile speeds attributed to the mystery objects on people's
  "imagination&rdquo; ? and she said that balloons, when they get high enough, look flat and shiny. Dangling string, she
  avers, could be "vapor.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">Willing to prove her point, she invited an Oregonian reporter and photographer to the top of Mt. Tabor
  for an eyewitness test. A helper, Clinton Fromm, who spent most of July Fourth blowing up balloons at the St. Paul
  rodeo, brought along a tank of helium and a generous supply of the rubber spheroids.</p>
<p class="body">"Until about a year ago you couldn't get helium gas for balloons,&rdquo; Mrs. Wilson said, as Fromm set
  up his equipment. "Balloons filled with air won't float, except under a good breeze. Lots of times concession men have
  a string of six or seven balloons get away ? and often kids lose them, too. So we have "flying discs.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><b>Balloons Let Loose</b></h4>
<p class="body">Mrs. Wilson let loose a brilliant orange balloon to test wind direction while Oregonian Photographer
  Milton Werschkul poised a camera. Fromm then tied a string of varicolored balloons with a big-eared "cat&rdquo;
  balloon at the head of the string. Then Mrs. Wilson freed the string.</p>
<p class="body">As the balloons soared straight up into the air, they gradually lost shape. At roughly 1000 feet they
  appeared flat and their to-and-fro tugging motion on the long string gave their motion the same sort of undulating
  movement described by other "disc&rdquo; spotters. The string of balloons disappeared within a few minutes ? heading
  southwest over the Mt. Tabor district.</p>
<p class="body">The "fins&rdquo; on some of the flying missiles, Mrs. Wilson argued, could be the big "ears&rdquo;
  sported by the popular "cat&rdquo; balloons which carry the painted face of a cat under rubber finlike ears. To prove
  this point, she sent a second string of the balloons skyward and at a good height the optical illusion proved
  puzzling.</p>
<h4><b>High Altitudes Reached</b></h4>
<p class="body">The balloons, the weather bureau reported, could reach a height of 30,000 feet and could sail along for
  a couple of days before breaking up under ideal conditions.</p>
<p class="body">"Lots of times,&rdquo; Mrs. Wilson said, "concession men have a few balloons left over at the end of the
  day and let them go rather than try to deflate them and use them again. Sometimes they break loose by
  accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">The balloon theory might be shrugged off by the irate eyewitnesses of something bigger and better than
  rubber toys ? but weather bureau officials pointed out that in the United States alone, four times a day 1000 balloons
  are freed into the sky in connection with the gathering of weather data.</p>
<h4>Metallic Foil Covers Disc</h4>
<p class="body">Radio sound balloons are sent aloft 100 times a day over the North American continent, the weatherman
  said. And these, coincidentally enough, carry a 2-foot disc with a metallic foil covering which are tracked with radar
  in the assembly of everyday weather facts.</p>
<p class="body">Wind-aloft balloons, released at night at this time of the year, carry small electric lights powered by
  batteries dropped by 8-inch parachutes.</p>
