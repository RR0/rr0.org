<p>SACRAMENTO, Cal., July 5 (AP)</p>
<p>The public relations officer of near-by McClellan Field cautioned Saturday against undue concern about the mysterious
  flying discs reported in skies over the United States.</p>
<p><q>"Lots of people are worried to heck about the things</q>," Maj. Duncan Arnam said, <q>"but there's nothing to get
  excited about. If there were anything to them, the army would have notified me."</q></p>
<p>The officer suggested the discs might be part of some army training experiment and added "<q>they might be good
  propaganda, too."</q></p>
<p>Major Arnam said his remarks were personal opinions.</p>
<p>He said radar at Mather Field ? the air material area depot for northern California ? had not recorded any trace of a
  disc reported by picknickers on the Sacramento river.</p>
