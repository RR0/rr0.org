<p>CIRCLEVILLE, O., July 5 (AP)</p>
<p>Folks in Pickway county, who have been following the "flying saucer" mystery, became excited Saturday when
  Sherman Campbell found a strange object on his farm.</p>
<p>It was in the form of a six pointed star, 30 inches high and 48 inches wide, covered with tinfoil. It weighed about
  two pounds. Attached to the top were the remains of a balloon with a rock 5 inches in circumference.</p>
<p>The Fort Columbus airfield weather station at Columbus said the description tallied with an object used by the army
  air forces to measure wind velocity at high altitudes by the use of radar.</p>
<p>Some of the flying discs reported seen in various parts of the country were much larger and flying at terrific
  speed.</p>
