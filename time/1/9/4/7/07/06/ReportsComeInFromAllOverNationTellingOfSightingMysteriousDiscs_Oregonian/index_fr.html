<p>Des signalements des "disques volants" inexpliqués sont venus de tous les points du continent Samedi. Voici des
  dépêches typiques.</p>
<p><b>Philadelphie, 5 juillet (AP)</b> ? Un phénomène astral était investigué ici Samedi pour déterminer si les
  philadelphiens avaient vu les mystérieux "disques volants" dans le ciel.</p>
<p>Le Dr. M. K. Leisy, un interne junior de l'hôpital de Pennsylvanie pour les maladies mentales, et d'autres personnes
  dans la section ouest de la ville signalèrent avoir vu des appareils étranges dans les cieux la nuit de Vendredi.</p>
<p>C'était quelque chose de rond avec un halo lumineux dessus, déclara le Dr. Leisy. Il n'était pas brillant lui-même,
  mais de couleur sombre et semblait être propulsé par des ailes tourbillonnantes.</p>
<p>Contrairement à des signalements précédents d'autres parties du pays sur la haute vitesse des disques volants, le Dr.
  Leisy dit que l'objet qu'il vit se déplaçait approximativement à la vitesse du vent, sous les <a
      href="../../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/nuage/index.html">nuages</a>. Il finit par disparaître dans les <a
      href="../../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/nuage/index.html">nuages</a>, ajouta-t-il.</p>
<p><b>Akron, O., July 5 (AP)</b> ? Des "soucoupes volantes" ont fait leur apparition ici la nuit de Vendredi.</p>
<p>Le Dr. Forrest Shaver a dit que le disque argenté qu'il avait vu <q>ressemblait à un <a
    href="../../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/ballon/">ballon</a> avec une lumière à l'intérieur.</q></p>
<p>Harry E. Hoertz le décrivit comme <q>une lumière avec un dispositif de propulsion</q>. Les 2 hommes dirent qu'ils
  avaient vu les "soucoupes" vers 20 h 30 en roulant près de Akron.</p>
<p><b>Springfield, Ill., 5 juillet (INS)</b> ? Un groupe de motorists reported Saturday they had glimpsed the mysterious
  "soucoupes volantes" which had been puzzling army officials and meteorologists.</p>
<p>One of them, Claude Price, superintendent of concessions at the Illinois state fair, said the group stopped their
  cars on a road two miles west of Decatur and watched the discs shoot across the sky.</p>
<p><b>LOS ANGELES, July 5 (AP)</b> ? Pilot Dan J. Whelan and a flying companion, Duncan Underhill, reported they were
  "<q>scared silly</q>" when they saw what they believed was a "living saucer" about 25 miles south of here
  Friday.</p>
<p><q>"The saucer was above us, traveling at what we'd estimate was 450 to 500 miles an hour,</q>" said Whelan.
  "<q>It was at 7000 feet, about 2000 feet above me. It was not spinning, but looked exactly like a skeet (a disc used
    in target practice).</q></p>
<p><q>"We checked its direction ? north by northwest ? and we'd say it was 40 to 50 feet in diameter."</q></p>
<p><b>AUGUSTA, ME., July 5 (AP)</b> ? The civil aeronautics administration office said it had received a report that a
  dozen of the mysterious sky discs had been seen over this city.</p>
<p>The CAA said Dr. Kelly, program director at radio station WRDO here, advised that he saw about 12 objects believed to
  be discs.</p>
<p>Kelly said the objects were traveling northerly "<q>very fast."</q></p>
<p><b>ROGERS, ARK. July 5 (AP)</b> ? J. P. Crumpler, a Rogers real estate dealer, said Saturday he saw one of the
  "flying saucers" Monday night during a windstorm. He was watching the approach of a storm cloud from the porch
  of his home when the disc appeared out of the northwest and vanished rapidly into the southwest, he said.</p>
<p><b>SAN JOSE, CAL., July 5 (AP)</b> ? Sgt. Charles R. Sigala of the army air forces said he and three others saw a
  silvery, flying disc over his home at near-by Mountain View Saturday at 11 A. M.</p>
<p>Sigala, who is on leave from Hamilton Field, said the object was clearly visible to him, his wife, mother-in-law, and
  a neighbor. It circled around over the mountain at about 5000 feet, dipped several times and then headed toward the
  sea, he said.</p>
<p>He estimated the object was as big as an automobile.</p>
<p><b>SUMMERSIDE, Canada, July 5 (AP)</b> ? Farmers in this Prince Edward Island region claim to have seen more of the
  mysterious disc-like missiles reported flying through northern skies earlier this week.</p>
<p>James Harris, farmer at Sherbrooke, one mile north of here, and his hired man, Herman Linkletter, said they saw one
  of the objects last night traveling from the northwest toward the southeast.</p>
<p>At about the same time Brenton Clark at Augustine Cove, about 18 miles from Sherbrooke, said he saw a bright object
  traveling north to south at medium height.</p>
<p><b>NEW ORLEANS, July 5 (INS)</b> ? The "flying disc" mystery spread to the deep South Saturday.</p>
<p>Miss Lillian Lawless of New Orleans said she saw a saucer-like "pure silver" object hurtling over Lake
  Pontchartrain at New Orleans. The disc, she said, was flying in a northeasterly direction "with terrific speed."</p>
<p><b>AUGUSTA, Ga., July 5 (INS)</b> ? An Augusta physician said he was certain Saturday that he saw the "flying
  saucers."</p>
<p>Dr. Colden R. Battey claims he spotted the peculiar soaring discs six weeks ago in the middle of the day while
  fishing in St. Helena sound near Beaufort, S. C. This was four weeks before the first published reports of the
  discs.</p>
<p>He said that when he saw the four discs at 11 A. M., they were traveling at an altitude of more than 20,000 feet and
  at a high rate of speed.</p>
<p>He described them as silver.</p>
<p><b>PORT HURON, Mich., July 5 (INS)</b> ? The mysterious "flying saucers" which have been sighted in several
  states across the country Saturday were reported over Port Huron, Mich.</p>
<p>Mrs. John R. Warner, a 34-year-old housewife, told International News Service that she and several neighbors
  witnessed the fast-moving objects criss-crossing across the sky last night.</p>
<p><b>WALTER, Okla., July 5 (AP)</b> ? Two "<q>flying saucers</q>" which "were flying in the air ? passing each other
  and going back and forth" were reported Saturday by C. E. Holman, 67-year-old Walter gardener.</p>
<p>Holman said he saw the discs about 10 P. M. the night of June 25, and that after watching them "<q>flying around each
  other</q>" for about 30 minutes he went to bed.</p>
<p><q>"I thought about waking up some of my neighbors but decided if it meant the end of the world they would be just
  about as happy sleeping when the world ended</q>," he said.</p>
<p><b>LOS ANGELES, July 5 (INS)</b> ? Leo Bentz, once a noted builder of auto racing cars, produced a possible new
  theory Saturday on the enigma of the "flying saucers."</p>
<p>Bentz, now an automobile dealer in suburban Whitter, told of a confidential demonstration of a saucer-like flying
  model in Los Angeles' Griffith park back in 1928.</p>
<p>He said the inventor's name was George De Bay, a native of France.</p>
<p>He quoted the inventor as saying:</p>
<p><q>"It's like a saucer ? an oblong saucer ? or meat plate."</q></p>
<p>Bentz said they went out to Griffith park where de Bay flipped a disc-like model of the device into the air with
  rubber bands and demonstrated its feasibility.</p>
<p><b>SEATTLE, July 5 (INS)</b> ? Another flying disc was reported seen over Seattle Saturday by a woman and her
  four-year-old son.</p>
<p>Mrs. Florence Frye, a librarian at the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, said her son, Carl, first spotted the object and
  pointed it out to her. She described it as:</p>
<p><q>"Brilliant ? so brilliant in fact that it hurt my eyes to watch and I had to blink and turn away."</q></p>
<p>Viva Anderson, Portland attorney reported she and a friend, Betty MacManneman, also an attorney, saw a group of
  objects from in front of her home at Melcrest Court apartments, 711 S.E. 11th Ave.</p>
<p><q>"They looked like half-inflated footballs and appeared to be faceted on top like rough cut diamonds</q>,"
  Miss Anderson said. She said that the main group of objects flashed like tinfoil, but that one which dropped much
  lower than the rest appeared to be "<q>slightly brown."</q></p>
<p>States where the discs have been reported: Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas,
  Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Missouri, Nebraska, Michigan, Indiana, Louisiana, Kentucky, Georgia, South Carolina,
  Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, Illinois, Arkansas, Tennessee, Maine, Florida, Utah, Maryland, Iowa, Kansas and the
  District of Columbia.</p>
