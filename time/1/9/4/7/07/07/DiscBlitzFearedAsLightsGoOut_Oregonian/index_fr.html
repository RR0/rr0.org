<p>LODI, Cal., July 7 (UP) ? Residents of Acampo, a residential community one mile north of here, thought for sure they
  were being attacked by flying saucers before dawn Sunday when they heard a roar, saw a glow in the sky, and then all
  the lights went out.</p>
<p>Mrs. W. C. Smith, wife of a high school physics instructor, said the noise was like a four-motored bomber with its
  props feathered for take-off. Looking toward the sky, she saw the glow just as all power in the community went
  off.</p>
<p>Her neighbors said they had seen the same glow and heard the same roar.</p>
<p>Erving Newcomb of the Pacific Gas and Electric company pooh-poohed the flying saucer theory, and said, a low-flying,
  crop dusting plane probably had struck a power line, and burned out a transformer.</p>
<p>The people of Acampo clung to the flying saucer idea, though, especially after no one was able to locate any crop
  dusting plane which had been in the air before dawn on Sunday morning.</p>
