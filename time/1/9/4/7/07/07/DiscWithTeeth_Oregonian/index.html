<p>GRAFTON, Wis., July 7 (INS) ? A Catholic priest here Sunday night reported that a round, metal disc, which might be
  one of the mysterious "flying saucers," had crashed into his parish yard and that he was holding it for the
  federal bureau of investigation.</p>
<p>The recovered disc, with "<q>gadgets and wires</q>," proved after thorough investigation to be a circular saw,
  which had been hurled into the yard, probably by a prankster.</p>
