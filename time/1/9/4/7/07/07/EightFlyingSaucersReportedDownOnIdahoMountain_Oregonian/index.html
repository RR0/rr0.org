    <p>While national guard aircraft Sunday hunted the skies over Pacific Northwest states for sight of the mysterious
      "flying saucers," eight of the flying gadgets were reported to have made a landing on a mountainside near
      St. Maries, Idaho, in full view of ten persons.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Walter Johnson of Dishman, Wash., a suburb of Spokane, said she saw the saucers come down in timber near St.
      Maries Thursday, but the incident had not been reported until she returned to her home Sunday.</p>
    <p>Col. G. R. Dodson, whose 123rd fighter squadron of the Oregon national guard scoured Oregon and Washington skies
      Sunday searching for the elusive missiles, said a flight of four P-51s would be sent early Monday morning to check
      the area. "<q>So far we haven't found saucer, disc or anything,</q>" Colonel Dodson commented.</p>
  <p>He described the operation Sunday as "<q>routine</q>," but said the pilots carried instructions to watch
      for flying discs.</p>
    <h4><b>Extreme Speed Reported</b></h4>
    <p>Mrs. Johnson said the saucers were seen to fall near Butler's bay on the St. Joe river six miles west of St.
      Maries, where she was visiting her parents.</p>
    <p>She said they came into view at an extreme speed, traveling from the south to the north. Suddenly they slowed,
      she said, and then <q>"fluttered like leaves to the ground."</q></p>
  <p>"The mysterious part was that we couldn't see them after they landed," said Mrs. Johnson. "<q>We could see them
    flutter down into the timber yet we couldn't see that they did anything to the trees."</q>
    </p>
    <p>She said the objects were saucer-shaped, but thicker than she had expected, resembling wash tubs more than discs.
      She described them as "<q>about the size of a five-room house."</q></p>
    <h4><b>Officers See Discs</b></h4>
    <p>Mrs. Johnson said the objects were seen by her relatives as well as the neighbors who viewed them independently.
      She said the incident had not been reported earlier because she didn't know whom to contact.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, the man who first started this business of "flying saucers," Kenneth Arnold, Boise, Idaho,
      flying businessman, reported he had invested $150 in a movie camera to get photographic proof of the discs he said
    flipped through the blue yonder <q>"like fish skimming through water."</q></p>
    <p>Spiking rumors of Army Air Force connection with the flying discs, Gen. Carl Spaatz, commandant of the army air
      forces, denied in Seattle knowing anything about the flying saucers or of plans to use army air force planes to
      look for them. Then he continued on to Medford on a fishing trip.</p>
    <h4><b>Utah Group Observed</b></h4>
    <p>Discs continued to be sighted at various locations throughout the day Sunday. They were said to have been seen at
      Chicago over Lake Michigan, in Southwestern Ontario, in Wisconsin, Minnesota and in Maryland.</p>
    <p>In Utah, ex-state treasurer Oliver G. Ellis and his son saw a group of discs high in the sky west of Salt Lake
      City. He said the <q>"luminous discs behaved like radio-controlled objects, hovering in a group for a moment, then
        suddenly formed a swiftly whirling horizontal circular pattern." He said two discs broke loose from the group
        "as if snapped from the end of a giant whip</q>." Later the flight was continued in a V-formation
      and moved south-westward until it disappeared, Ellis said.</p>
    <p>In Portland, reports on the flying objects did not come in before noon. At 12:42 P. M. police were called by a
      man who said he saw what he thought was a flying disc headed south and traveling very fast. A woman reported that
      she saw a reddish object "<q>round as a dollar</q>" about 5 P. M. that zoomed out of sight so fast neighbors
      she summoned to look at it failed to glimpse it. Another man standing on the corner of N. W. 6th avenue and Glisan
      street, told The Oregonian he saw four flying discs heading south at a "<q>good rate of speed.</q></p>
    <h4><b>2000 MPH Reported</b></h4>
    <p>Reports continued to come in during the daylight hours with one taxi cab driver reporting the platter-like
      objects traveling high and nearly 2000 miles an hour. Another report came in of seven of the discs traveling in a
      <q>"geeselike formation."</q></p>
    <p>The 123d fighter squadron at Portland Army Air base will have airplanes and pilots ready to take off Monday if
      anyone sees any discs, flying around, according to Colonel Dodson. The stable of 23 fast P-51 fighter planes,
      equipped with gun-sight movie cameras, was lined up on the concrete apron Sunday ready to comb the skies for any
      aerial marauders citizens might report.</p>
