<p>UNEXPLAINED FLYING DISCS<br> 7 July <a href="../../../index.html">1947</a></p>
<p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE OFFICER IN CHARGE:</p>
<ol>
  <li> At 1305, 4 July 1947, a radio alert was issued via the Portland City Police Radio, advising all cars and
    listeners that some fast flying objects were in the air over Portland and vicinity. Upon contacting the radio
    dispatcher, this agent was advised that Kenneth A. McDowell, Patrolman, Portland City Police Department, residing at
    916 St Et. Bush Street, Portland, Oregon, on duty at Precinat al, Portland City Police, Southeast Morrisson at 10th
    Avenue had called in advising the dispatcher of the flying objects.</li>
  <li>This agent interviewed Officer McDowell who stated at approximately 1306, 4 July 1947, he was on duty at Precinct
    A1, and was in the parking lot back of the Police Station, feeding the pidgeons. At this time the pidgeons became
    very excited over something and fluttered in the air all at once. Officer McDowell stated in looking around to see
    what has disturbed them, he saw five large discs in the air to the East of Portland two discs flying South and three
    flying in an Easterly direction. Officer McDowell stated he could determine no polce to the discs, but advised they
    were dipping in an up and down oscillating motion and were traveling at a great speed. He was unable to give an
    estimate of the speed or altitude of these discs as they were out of sight before any detailed observation could be
    made. Officer McDowell adviced he notified the Police radio he immediated broadcast an alert. Officer McDowell
    advised he saw no indication of any motivating force or heard any sound coming from these discs and could give no
    description other than round.</li>
  <li>This agent interviewed Sergeant Claude Cross, Oregon 13tile Police Officer on duty at Discrict Number 1 Station,
    Milwaukie, Oregon. Cross atitude on hearing the radio alert he went outside and upon looking in an northerly
    direction, he saw three discs following each other at an undertermined altitude and at a terrific speed, traveling
    in a Northwesterly direction. Cross advised he noticed a whitish brown glint to these objects as the sun reflected
    from them. Cross was unable to give any other description nor could he judge the objects speed or altitude. No sound
    was made by the objects.</li>
  <li>This agent interviewed Earl E. Patterson, Patrolman, Portland City Police Department, and residing at 124
    Southeast 13th avenue, Portland, Oregon. Patterson advises he was a former Air Corps pilot during the war. He stated
    that the time the radio alert sounded he was at Southeast 82nd and Foster Rand, Portland, and upon getting out of
    his car he saw one disc flying in a Southwesterly direction over Portland. Petterson advised this disc was aluminium
    in color, left no vapor trail or smoke trail and was traveling at a terrific speed, faster than he has ever seen any
    flying object before. Patterson further advised, although not knowing the exact size of the object it is difficult
    to determine the altitude, he estimates the altitude at 30,000 feet.<br> Patterson further advised the flying dic
    was definitely some type of craft out he could not give any further description as its speed made observation
    difficult. He heard no sound emitted by the flying object.</li>
