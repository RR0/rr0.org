<p>BOZEMAN, Mont. July 7 (AP) - Casey Baird, pilote d'un avion de poursuite P-38 travaillant pour la United States
  geodetic survey, reported Monday he was forced to evade a group of flying discs, and that his photographer tried to
  get a picture.</p>
<p>Baird said the film would be developed next Monday.</p>
<p>The pilot said he ran into the flying objects at 32,000 feet and had to dodge out of their path while trying to
  photograph them. He said there were eight or nine in the group.</p>
<p>Baird described the flying objects as looking like yo-yo's with a periscope or domelike object on top. He said they
  were 14 or 15 feet in diameter and traveling rapidly.</p>
