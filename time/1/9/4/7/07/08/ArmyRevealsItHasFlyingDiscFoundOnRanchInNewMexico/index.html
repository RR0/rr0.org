  <p>The army gave no other details. Haught's statement:</p>
  <p>"The many rumors regarding the flying discs became a reality yesterday when the intelligence office of the 509th
    (atomic) Bomb Group of the 8th Air Force, Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc
    through the cooperation of one of the ranchers and the sheriff's office of Chaves county."</p>
  <p>"The flying object landed on a ranch near Roswell sometime last week. Not having phone facilities, the rancher
    stored the disc until such time as he was able to contact the sheriff's office, who inturn notified Jesse A. Marcel,
    of the 509th Bomb Group intelligence office."</p>
