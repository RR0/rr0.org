<p>Sydney, Australia, July 8 (AP)-- Strange tales of "flying saucers" were told in Sydney today, and the Daily Telegraph
  headlined the story "It Had To Happen Here."</p>
<p>Several Sydney persons told of seeing disc-shaped objects across the sky last night and early today (7/7 and
  7/8).</p>
<p>"The night was so clear and bright we were able to get a good look at them," he (sic) said. "They traveled very fast
  in a north and westerly direction."</p>
<p>These manifestations came several hours after 22 Sydney University students reported glimpsing objects after an
  experiment organized by Professor Frank S. Cotton who said what they actually saw was the "effect of red corpuscles of
  the blood passing before the retina of the eye,"</p>
<p>(22 out of 450 students saw the alleged "spots.")</p>
