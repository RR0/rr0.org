<p>SYDNEY - (Reuters) - Prof. F. S. Cotton, professor of physiology at Sydney University, yesterday conducted a "flying
  saucers" experiment.</p>
<p>After discussing North American reports on "flying saucers," he led his class of 450 students into the open and told
  them to look at the clear sky and to concentrate their gaze on a fixed point while standing perfectly still.</p>
<p>Within 10 minutes, 22 students reported they had seen bright oval-shaped objects which moved rapidly sometimes
  following each other in a line and sometimes resembling a string of pearls.</p>
<p>Professor Cotton then explained that the students saw exactly what he expected them to see - the red corpuscles of
  the blood passing in front of the retina.</p>
