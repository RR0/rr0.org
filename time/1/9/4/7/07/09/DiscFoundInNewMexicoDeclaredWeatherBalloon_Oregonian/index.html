  <h2>Airmen End Excitement Over Object<br> Shiny Kite-Stars in Regular Use On Radar Tests</h2>
  <p>FORTH WORTH, Tex. July 9 (AP) ? An object found near Roswell, N. M., which created a storm of speculation Tuesday
    that it might be one of the mysterious flying "discs" or "saucers" was a weather balloon and its kite, the 8th air
    force announced Tuesday.</p>
  <p>The announcement was made by Maj. Gen. Roger M. Ramey, commander of the 8th air force with headquarters at Fort
    Worth.</p>
  <p>The object was flown from Roswell to Fort Worth by the air force, where it was identified by Warrant Officer Irving
    Newton of Medford, Wis., of the base weather station.</p>
  <p>General Ramey said that several of the balloons were released daily according to changes in the weather.</p>

    <h3>Radar Work Aided</h3>
    <p>(A similar object was identified Monday night at Adrian, Mo., by the Kansas City weather bureau.)</p>
    <p>Grant Cook of Adrian found the tin-foil covered object on his farm and notified authorities. Investigation by
      meteorologists revealed it as a reflector for radar signals.</p>
    <p>(Printed on the reflector was the notation: "W. X. X. N.-Feb. 21 ? M. P.")</p>
    <p>Army weather experts in Washington, however, discounted any idea that the such weather targets might be the basis
      for the scores of reports of "flying discs."</p>
    <p>Brig. Gen. Donald Yates, chief of the AAF weather service, said only a very few of them are used daily at points
      where some specific project requires accurate wind information from extreme altitudes. Without field reports, he
      would not hazard a guess on a precise number, he said.</p>

    <h3>Army Describes Tests</h3>
    <p>For ordinary purposes, General Yates told a reporter, the AAF uses balloon-borne radiosondes much on the order of
      those employed by the weather bureau, tracking them with radio direction finders. Those instruments consist of a
      milky white balloon five or six feet in diameter with the automatic radio transmitting apparatus suspended below
      in a package about cigar box size.</p>
    <p>During the war, General Yates said, the radar target method of wind checking was standard practice because of the
      high degree of accuracy needed.</p>
    <p>The weather bureau said it uses none of the radar target balloons at land stations. Some are used from coast
      guard vessels in the Atlantic, bureau officials said, but they normally blow eastward toward Europe.</p></section>

    <h3>Many Freed Daily</h3>
    <p>Between the army and the weather bureau, hundreds of weather balloons without the metallic target are released
      daily from points all over the country.</p>
    <p>Ivan R. Tannehill, weather bureau chief forecaster, pointed out, however, that such balloons have been in use for
      many years. He said, they were unlikely to have been mistaken "all over the country and all in one week" for
      mysterious objects speeding through the sky at supersonic speeds.</p>
    <p>Suspended from the balloons are kites or six-sided stars, covered with a shiny material such as tinfoil. These
      objects are traced by radar and computations from the radar reveal air currents.</p></section>

    <h3>Object Damaged</h3>
    <p>The object found in New Mexico was badly damaged.</p>
    <p>The balloons measure 50 inches across but expand greatly as they ascend, air force officers reported. They
      sometimes reach 60,000 feet. The kites and stars generally are more than five feet in diameter.</p>
    <p>The balloon and the object it carries are technically known as ray wind [sic] high altitude sounding devices,
      popularly known as "weather radar targets."</p>
    <p>General Ramey said the object found in New Mexico definitely was a United States army device.</p>
    <p>Plans to fly the object to Wright field for further investigation were cancelled.</p>
    <p>A public relations officer said it was in this office, "and it'll probably stay right there."</p>
    <p>General Ramey spoke over a local radio station (WBAP) Tuesday night after the 8th air force headquarters was
      flooded with queries concerning the object.</p>
    <p>In his broadcast, he said that anyone who found an object he believed to be a "flying disc" should contact the
      nearest army office or sheriff's office.</p>
