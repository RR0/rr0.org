  <h2>'Discs' Swoop Over Angler</h2>
  <p><i>See Story on Page 1, Also</i></p>
  <p>The mysterious "flying saucers" ? big and little, black and luminous ? still are plentiful in the Pacific
    Northwest, according to the unflagging volume of reports from wide-eyed sky gazers.</p>
  <p>More than 50 telephoned "disc" reports came in Tuesday to switchboards at The Oregonian and station KGW, which
    interrupted its regular broadcasts to give listeners the vital statistics on aerial thingumabobs citizens said they
    saw.</p>
  <p>Local descriptions included that of a fisherman who was bewildered by four flying objects which he said swooped
    down over his boat, the Darlene Jack, as he was pulling up his nets at the mouth of the Willamette river about 2 A.
    M.</p>

  <h2>Fisherman Hears 'Swoosh'</h2>
  <p>Malcolm Morrill, who lives on his boat at the North Portland moorage on N. Swift boulevard, told The Oregonian that
    the shapes were bigger than any airplane he had ever seen and made a swooshing noise "something like a jet
    plane."</p>
  <p>Two discs which looked like silver footballs drew attention of Richard C. Maynard, 3915 N. Houghton street, as he
    sat in a downtown office. The objects he said traveled eastward at about the speed of transport planes.</p>
  <p>A report from a Mrs. Clement, Vanport, said she saw a disc land and explode near Triangle lake.</p>
  <p>The 2-year-old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Hilderbrant, 3405 N. E. 74th avenue, called their attention to a
    pair of very bright spheres high in the sky heading south about 7 P. M., Hilderbrant reported.</p>

  <h2>Editor Sees Object</h2>
  <p>Mrs. L. Rutan of 3837 S. E. 40th avenue, her neighbor, Malcolm King, 3715 S. E. 40th avenue, and King's mother,
    father, uncle, and another neighbor saw "a whole cloud of swirling things in the sky" about 4:25 P. M., they
    reported. King said there were 25 of them ? some square ? and that they circled and later disappeared to the
    southeast.</p>
  <p>A similar sight greeted the startled eyes of Frank Watson, 3124 N. E. 15th avenue, who breathlessly announced he
    saw a group of about 30 objects in the sky at 4:20 P. M. at an estimated altitude of 7000 feet.</p>
  <p>"They were playing dipsy-daisy and chasing each other," he related.</p>
  <p>A. T. Pritchard, 8717 N. E. Webster street, editor of the Oregon-Northwest Angler and Hunter magazine, said he saw
    a large object, followed by a bluish haze, zip across the sky between Mt. Hood and Mt. Adams</p></section>

  <h2>New Craft Hit As 'Nonsense'<br> People 'Imagine' Speeds of 1200</h2>
  <p>By Ron Moxness<br> <i>Staff Writer, The Oregonian</i></p>
  <p><i>Pictures on Wirephoto Page</i></p>
  <p>Those space sailing discs which have given sky-gazing residents of the Pacific Northwest a collective pain in the
    neck might be secret army missiles or "whatzits" from another world to some people, but to Mrs. Hester Wilson of
    2324 N. W. Johnson street they're nothing but toy balloons on the loose.</p>
  <p>And she just nodded confidently when army officials announced the "flying disc" found in New Mexico Tuesday was
    just a radar reflecting kite attached to a weather balloon.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Wilson, for the past 24 years operator of balloon concessions at country fairs and rodeos over Oregon and
    Washington, walked into The Oregonian editorial rooms a little bit fed up with "all this nonsense" about saucers in
    the sky.</p>
  <p>"They're nothing but fugitives from a concession stand," she muttered. "Made of rubber, full of helium and pretty
    hard to describe when they're traveling high with six or seven more balloons tired on behind."</p>
  <section>
    <h3>People Termed Imaginative</h3>
    <p>Mrs. Wilson blamed estimates of 1200-mile speeds attributed to the mystery objects on people's "imagination" ?
      and she said that balloons, when they get high enough, look flat and shiny. Dangling string, she avers, could be
      "vapor."</p>
    <p>Willing to prove her point, she invited an Oregonian reporter and photographer to the top of Mt. Tabor for an
      eyewitness test. A helper, Clinton Fromm, who spent most of July Fourth blowing up balloons at the St. Paul rodeo,
      brought along a tank of helium and a generous supply of the rubber spheroids.</p>
    <p>"Until about a year ago you couldn't get helium gas for balloons," Mrs. Wilson said, as Fromm set up his
      equipment. "Balloons filled with air won't float, except under a good breeze. Lots of times concession men have a
      string of six or seven balloons get away ? and often kids lose them, too. So we have "flying discs."</p></section>
  <section>
    <h3>Balloons Let Loose</h3>
    <p>Mrs. Wilson let loose a brilliant orange balloon to test wind direction while Oregonian Photographer Milton
      Werschkul poised a camera. Fromm then tied a string of varicolored balloons with a big-eared "cat" balloon at the
      head of the string. Then Mrs. Wilson freed the string.</p>
    <p>As the balloons soared straight up into the air, they gradually lost shape. At roughly 1000 feet they appeared
      flat and their to-and-fro tugging motion on the long string gave their motion the same sort of undulating movement
      described by other "disc" spotters. The string of balloons disappeared within a few minutes ? heading southwest
      over the Mt. Tabor district.</p>
    <p>The "fins" on some of the flying missiles, Mrs. Wilson argued, could be the big "ears" sported by the popular
      "cat" balloons which carry the painted face of a cat under rubber finlike ears. To prove this point, she sent a
      second string of the balloons skyward and at a good height the optical illusion proved puzzling.</p>
  </section>

    <h3>High Altitudes Reached</h3>
    <p>The balloons, the weather bureau reported, could reach a height of 30,000 feet and could sail along for a couple
      of days before breaking up under ideal conditions.</p>
    <p>"Lots of times," Mrs. Wilson said, "concession men have a few balloons left over at the end of the day and let
      them go rather than try to deflate them and use them again. Sometimes they break loose by accident."</p>
    <p>The balloon theory might be shrugged off by the irate eyewitnesses of something bigger and better than rubber
      toys ? but weather bureau officials pointed out that in the United States alone, four times a day 1000 balloons
      are freed into the sky in connection with the gathering of weather data.</p>

    <h3>Metallic Foil Covers Disc</h3>
    <p>Radio sound balloons are sent aloft 100 times a day over the North American continent, the weatherman said. And
      these, coincidentally enough, carry a 2-foot disc with a metallic foil covering which are tracked with radar in
      the assembly of everyday weather facts.</p>
    <p>Wind-aloft balloons, released at night at this time of the year, carry small electric lights powered by batteries
      dropped by 8-inch parachutes.</p>
