<h3><b>&lsquo;Discs' Swoop Over Angler</b></h3>
<p class="body"><i>See Story on Page 1, Also</i></p>
<p class="body">The mysterious "flying saucers&rdquo; ? big and little, black and luminous ? still are plentiful in the
  Pacific Northwest, according to the unflagging volume of reports from wide-eyed sky gazers.</p>
<p class="body">More than 50 telephoned "disc&rdquo; reports came in Tuesday to switchboards at The Oregonian and
  station KGW, which interrupted its regular broadcasts to give listeners the vital statistics on aerial thingumabobs
  citizens said they saw.</p>
<p class="body">Local descriptions included that of a fisherman who was bewildered by four flying objects which he said
  swooped down over his boat, the Darlene Jack, as he was pulling up his nets at the mouth of the Willamette river about
  2 A. M.</p>
<h3><b>Fisherman Hears 'Swoosh'</b></h3>
<p class="body">Malcolm Morrill, who lives on his boat at the North Portland moorage on N. Swift boulevard, told The
  Oregonian that the shapes were bigger than any airplane he had ever seen and made a swooshing noise "something like a
  jet plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">Two discs which looked like silver footballs drew attention of Richard C. Maynard, 3915 N. Houghton
  street, as he sat in a downtown office. The objects he said traveled eastward at about the speed of transport
  planes.</p>
<p class="body">A report from a Mrs. Clement, Vanport, said she saw a disc land and explode near Triangle lake.</p>
<p class="body">The 2-year-old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Hilderbrant, 3405 N. E. 74th avenue, called their
  attention to a pair of very bright spheres high in the sky heading south about 7 P. M., Hilderbrant reported.</p>
<h3><b>Editor Sees Object</b></h3>
<p class="body">Mrs. L. Rutan of 3837 S. E. 40th avenue, her neighbor, Malcolm King, 3715 S. E. 40th avenue, and King's
  mother, father, uncle, and another neighbor saw "a whole cloud of swirling things in the sky&rdquo; about 4:25 P. M.,
  they reported. King said there were 25 of them ? some square ? and that they circled and later disappeared to the
  southeast.</p>
<p class="body">A similar sight greeted the startled eyes of Frank Watson, 3124 N. E. 15th avenue, who breathlessly
  announced he saw a group of about 30 objects in the sky at 4:20 P. M. at an estimated altitude of 7000 feet.</p>
<p class="body">"They were playing dipsy-daisy and chasing each other,&rdquo; he related.</p>
<p class="body">A. T. Pritchard, 8717 N. E. Webster street, editor of the Oregon-Northwest Angler and Hunter magazine,
  said he saw a large object, followed by a bluish haze, zip across the sky between Mt. Hood and Mt. Adams</p>

<h3><b>New Craft Hit As &lsquo;Nonsense'<br> People &lsquo;Imagine' Speeds of 1200</b></h3>

<p class="body">Those space sailing discs which have given sky-gazing residents of the Pacific Northwest a collective
  pain in the neck might be secret army missiles or "whatzits&rdquo; from another world to some people, but to Mrs.
  Hester Wilson of 2324 N. W. Johnson street they're nothing but toy balloons on the loose.</p>
<p class="body">And she just nodded confidently when army officials announced the "flying disc&rdquo; found in New
  Mexico Tuesday was just a radar reflecting kite attached to a weather balloon.</p>
<p class="body">Mrs. Wilson, for the past 24 years operator of balloon concessions at country fairs and rodeos over
  Oregon and Washington, walked into The Oregonian editorial rooms a little bit fed up with "all this nonsense&rdquo;
  about saucers in the sky.</p>
<p class="body">"They're nothing but fugitives from a concession stand,&rdquo; she muttered. "Made of rubber, full of
  helium and pretty hard to describe when they're traveling high with six or seven more balloons tired on
  behind.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><b>People Termed Imaginative</b></h4>
<p class="body">Mrs. Wilson blamed estimates of 1200-mile speeds attributed to the mystery objects on people's
  "imagination&rdquo; ? and she said that balloons, when they get high enough, look flat and shiny. Dangling string, she
  avers, could be "vapor.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">Willing to prove her point, she invited an Oregonian reporter and photographer to the top of Mt. Tabor
  for an eyewitness test. A helper, Clinton Fromm, who spent most of July Fourth blowing up balloons at the St. Paul
  rodeo, brought along a tank of helium and a generous supply of the rubber spheroids.</p>
<p class="body">"Until about a year ago you couldn't get helium gas for balloons,&rdquo; Mrs. Wilson said, as Fromm set
  up his equipment. "Balloons filled with air won't float, except under a good breeze. Lots of times concession men have
  a string of six or seven balloons get away ? and often kids lose them, too. So we have "flying discs.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><b>Balloons Let Loose</b></h4>
<p class="body">Mrs. Wilson let loose a brilliant orange balloon to test wind direction while Oregonian Photographer
  Milton Werschkul poised a camera. Fromm then tied a string of varicolored balloons with a big-eared "cat&rdquo;
  balloon at the head of the string. Then Mrs. Wilson freed the string.</p>
<p class="body">As the balloons soared straight up into the air, they gradually lost shape. At roughly 1000 feet they
  appeared flat and their to-and-fro tugging motion on the long string gave their motion the same sort of undulating
  movement described by other "disc&rdquo; spotters. The string of balloons disappeared within a few minutes ? heading
  southwest over the Mt. Tabor district.</p>
<p class="body">The "fins&rdquo; on some of the flying missiles, Mrs. Wilson argued, could be the big "ears&rdquo;
  sported by the popular "cat&rdquo; balloons which carry the painted face of a cat under rubber finlike ears. To prove
  this point, she sent a second string of the balloons skyward and at a good height the optical illusion proved
  puzzling.</p>
<h4><b>High Altitudes Reached</b></h4>
<p class="body">The balloons, the weather bureau reported, could reach a height of 30,000 feet and could sail along for
  a couple of days before breaking up under ideal conditions.</p>
<p class="body">"Lots of times,&rdquo; Mrs. Wilson said, "concession men have a few balloons left over at the end of the
  day and let them go rather than try to deflate them and use them again. Sometimes they break loose by
  accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">The balloon theory might be shrugged off by the irate eyewitnesses of something bigger and better than
  rubber toys ? but weather bureau officials pointed out that in the United States alone, four times a day 1000 balloons
  are freed into the sky in connection with the gathering of weather data.</p>
<h4>Metallic Foil Covers Disc</h4>
<p class="body">Radio sound balloons are sent aloft 100 times a day over the North American continent, the weatherman
  said. And these, coincidentally enough, carry a 2-foot disc with a metallic foil covering which are tracked with radar
  in the assembly of everyday weather facts.</p>
<p class="body">Wind-aloft balloons, released at night at this time of the year, carry small electric lights powered by
  batteries dropped by 8-inch parachutes.</p>
