<h3><b>&lsquo;Discs' Swoop Over Angler</b></h3>
<p class="body"><i>See Story on Page 1, Also</i></p>
<p class="body">The mysterious "flying saucers&rdquo; ? big and little, black and luminous ? still are plentiful in the
  Pacific Northwest, according to the unflagging volume of reports from wide-eyed sky gazers.</p>
<p class="body">More than 50 telephoned "disc&rdquo; reports came in Tuesday to switchboards at The Oregonian and
  station KGW, which interrupted its regular broadcasts to give listeners the vital statistics on aerial thingumabobs
  citizens said they saw.</p>
<p class="body">Local descriptions included that of a fisherman who was bewildered by four flying objects which he said
  swooped down over his boat, the Darlene Jack, as he was pulling up his nets at the mouth of the Willamette river about
  2 A. M.</p>
<h3><b>Fisherman Hears 'Swoosh'</b></h3>
<p class="body">Malcolm Morrill, who lives on his boat at the North Portland moorage on N. Swift boulevard, told The
  Oregonian that the shapes were bigger than any airplane he had ever seen and made a swooshing noise "something like a
  jet plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="body">Two discs which looked like silver footballs drew attention of Richard C. Maynard, 3915 N. Houghton
  street, as he sat in a downtown office. The objects he said traveled eastward at about the speed of transport
  planes.</p>
<p class="body">A report from a Mrs. Clement, Vanport, said she saw a disc land and explode near Triangle lake.</p>
<p class="body">The 2-year-old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Hilderbrant, 3405 N. E. 74th avenue, called their
  attention to a pair of very bright spheres high in the sky heading south about 7 P. M., Hilderbrant reported.</p>
<h3><b>Editor Sees Object</b></h3>
<p class="body">Mrs. L. Rutan of 3837 S. E. 40th avenue, her neighbor, Malcolm King, 3715 S. E. 40th avenue, and King's
  mother, father, uncle, and another neighbor saw "a whole cloud of swirling things in the sky&rdquo; about 4:25 P. M.,
  they reported. King said there were 25 of them ? some square ? and that they circled and later disappeared to the
  southeast.</p>
<p class="body">A similar sight greeted the startled eyes of Frank Watson, 3124 N. E. 15th avenue, who breathlessly
  announced he saw a group of about 30 objects in the sky at 4:20 P. M. at an estimated altitude of 7000 feet.</p>
<p class="body">"They were playing dipsy-daisy and chasing each other,&rdquo; he related.</p>
<p class="body">A. T. Pritchard, 8717 N. E. Webster street, editor of the Oregon-Northwest Angler and Hunter magazine,
  said he saw a large object, followed by a bluish haze, zip across the sky between Mt. Hood and Mt. Adams</p>
