<p class="abstract">Identified at Army Air Field here</p>
<p> A New Mexico rancher's discovery which for several hours Tuesday rocked the disk-conscious nation was identified at
  <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/CarswellAFB.html">Fort Worth Army Air Field</a> Tuesday night as a weather balloon-kite,
  exploding a rumor that a flying disk finally had been captured.</p>
<p>The contraption, of tinfoil, narrow wooden beams and synthetic rubber that once had been an Army Air Forces Rawin
  machine used to determine direction and velocity of winds at high altitudes, was flown to <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/base/CarswellAFB.html">FWAAF</a> from Roswell, N. M., Army Air Field by B-29 Tuesday morning.
</p>
<p>Here, Brig. Gen. <span class="people">Roger M. Ramey</span>, commanding officer of the 8th Air Force and Col. <span
    class="people" title="Thomas Jefferson Dubose">Thomas J. Dubose</span>, his chief of staff, both identified the
  discovery as a "weather device" used by the AAF. Warrant Officer <span class="people">Irving Newton</span> of Medford,
  Mis. [sic], a forecaster at the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/CarswellAFB.html">FWAAF</a> weather station here,
  positively listed the object as a ray wind [sic] target. </p>
<h3>Looks Like Star</h3>
<p> When rigged up, <span class="people">Newton</span> stated, the device is six-pointed and looks very much like a
  star. He said it was silvery in appearance as a result of the tinfoil, and rose in the air like a kite, mounted to a
  100-gram balloon.</p>
<p>The balloon expands as it rises into the rarified atmosphere, <span class="people">Newton</span> said, and usually
  will reach an altitude of 60,000 feet before bursting and falling to the ground with the kite.</p>
<p><q>We use them because they can go so much higher than the eye can see,</q> <span class="people">Newton</span>
  explained. A radar set is employed to follow the device, which gives off radar impressions through the tinfoil, he
  added. Through a process of triangulation the winds aloft are then charted.</p>
<p><span class="people">Newton</span> said there were some 80 weather stations in the United States using this type of
  gadget, and it could have come from any of them.</p>
<p>The weather officer said he had sent up kite-balloons identical to this one during the invasion of Okinawa to
  determine ballistics information for heavy guns. </p>
<p>Colonel <span class="people">Dubose</span> declared that tinfoil objects of the type used on the kite were employed
  in Europe during bombing missions to throw off German radar. The tinfoil causes huge "blips" on a radar screen, he
  added.</p>
<p> The same device also was used on life rafts in the Pacific to facilitate air-sea rescue work. </p>
<p> The remains of the weather device were flown here at the command of General <span class="people">Ramey</span>, after
  their discovery by <span class="people" title="William Ware Brazel">W. W. Brazell</span> on his ranch, about 85 miles
  northwest of Roswell, and the subsequent reporting of the incident to authorities at Roswell Army Air Field. </p>
<p><span class="people" title="William Ware Brazel">Brazell</span>, whose ranch is 30 miles from the nearest telephone
  and has no radio, knew nothing about flying discs when he found the remains of the weather device scattered over a
  square mile of his property three weeks ago. </p>
<p>He bundled together the large pile of tinfoil and broken wooden beams about one-fourth of an inch thick and half-inch
  wide and the torn mass of synthetic rubber that had been the balloon and rolled it under some brush, according to Maj.
  <span class="people">Jesse A. Marcel</span> of Houma, La., 509th Bomb Group Intelligence Officer at Roswell, who
  brought the device to <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/base/CarswellAFB.html">FWAAF</a>. </p>
<p>On a trip to town Saturday night to Corona, N.M., <span class="people" title="William Ware Brazel">Brazell</span>
  heard the first reference to the "silver flying disks," Major <span class="people">Marcel</span> related at General
  <span class="people">Ramey</span>'s headquarters here. <q>Brazell then hurried home, and bright and early Sunday, dug
    up the remnants of the kite balloon</q>, <span class="people">Marcel</span> continued, <q>and on Monday headed for
    Roswell to report his find to the sheriff.</q></p>
<p>This resulted in a call to Roswell Army Air Field by the sheriff and to <span class="people">Marcel</span>'s being
  assigned to the case. Marcel and Brazell then journeyed back to the ranch, where the major took the object into
  custody of the Army.
</p>
<p><q>The ranch is out in the middle of nowhere</q>, <span class="people">Marcel</span> declared, <q>and we spent a
  couple of hours Monday afternoon looking for any more parts of the weather device. We found a few more patches of
  tinfoil and rubber.</q></p>
<p><span class="people">Marcel</span> brought back the discovery to Roswell Army Air field early Tuesday morning, and at
  8 a.m. reported to his commanding officer, Col. <a
      href="/people/b/BlanchardWilliamHugh/index.html">William H. Blanchard</a>, 509<sup>th</sup> Bomb Group chief.
  Blanchard, in turn, reported to General <span class="people">Ramey</span>, who ordered the find flown to Fort Worth
  immediately. <br> <br> About that time, word broke from Roswell that flying disk finally had been found. In a matter
  of minutes, wire services across the nation were screaming for news of the discovery and the airwaves were full of the
  story. </p>
<p> As soon as the "disk" was brought into General <span class="people">Ramey</span>'s office, he and Colonel <span
    class="people">Dubose</span> tabbed it as a weather device. The weather officer on duty at the time, Warrant Officer
  <span class="people">Newton</span>, merely made identification positive. </p>
<p>Previously, General <span class="people">Ramey</span> in a phone conversation with the <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/index.html">Air Material Command</a> at <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html">Wright
  Field</a>, Ohio, had been ordered to fly the "disk" there immediately for observation. When it was positively
  identified as a Rawin machine, the flight to <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html">Wright Field</a> was
  canceled. </p>
