<p>(UP) -- Les signalements de soucoupes volantes sifflant à travers le ciel ont brusquement chuté aujourd'hui alors que
  l'armée et la marine ont entâmé une campagne concentrée pour stopper les rumeurs.</p>
<p>Une par une, les personnes qui pensaient avoir leurs mains sur les 3000 $ offerts pour une véritable soucoupe volante
  se sont retrouvées les mains vides.</p>
<p>Le siège de la 8ᵉ armée à Fort Worth, Texas, a annoncé que l'épave d'un objet couvert de feuille métallique sur un
  ranch du Nouveau-Mexique n'était rien de plus que les restes d'un <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon">ballon</a> météo. Le siège de l'<a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/AAF.html">AAF</a> à Washington aurait délivré un "blistering" rebuke to officers at the
  Roswell, New Mexico, base for suggesting that it was a <q>flying disc</q>. A 16 inch aluminum disc equiped with two
  radio condensers, a fluorescent light switch and copper tubing found by F.G. Harston near the Shreveport, Louisiana,
  business district was declared by police to be <q>obviously the work of a prankster</q>. Police believed the prankster
  hurled it over a sign board and watched it land at Harston's feet. It was turned over to officials at Barksdale army
  air field. </p>
<p>U.S. naval intelligence officers at Pearl Harbor investigated claims by 100 navy men that they saw a mysterious
  object <q>silvery colored, like aluminum, with no wings or tail</q>, sail over Honolulu at a rapid clip late
  yesterday. The description fit a weather balloon but 5 of the men, familiar with weather observation devices, swore
  that it was not a balloon. </p>
<p><q>It moved extremely fast for a short period, seemed to slow down, then disappeared high in the air</q>, said Yeoman
  1/C Douglas Kacherle of New Bedford, Massachusetts. His story was corroborated by Seaman 1/C Donald Ferguson,
  Indianapolis ; Yeoman 3/C Morris Kzamme, La. Crosse, Wisconsin, Seaman 1/C Albert Delancey, Salem, West Virginia, and
  Yeoman 2/C Ted Pardue, McClain, Texas. </p>
<p>Admiral William H. Blandy, commander-in-chief of the Atlantic fleet, said like everyone else he was curious about the
  reported flying saucers <q>but I do not believe they exist</q>.</p>
<p>Lloyd Bennett, Oelwein, Iowa, salesman, was stubborn about the shiny 6 1/2-inch steel disc he found yesterday.
  Authorities said it was not a <q>flying saucer</q> but Bennett said he would claim the reward offered for the
  mysterious discs. </p>
<p>There were other discards. Not all the principles were satisfied with the announcement that the wreckage found on the
  New Mexico ranch was that of a weather balloon. </p>
<p>The excitement ran thru this cycle : </p>
<ol>
  <li> Lieut. Warren Haught, public relations officer at the Roswell Base released a statement in the name of Col. <span
      class="people" title="William Hugh Blanchard">William Blanchard</span>, base commander. It said that an object
    described as a <q>flying disk</q> was found on the nearby Foster ranch three weeks ago by <a
        href="/people/b/BrazelWilliamWare/index.html">W. W. Brazel</a> and had been sent to <q>higher officials</q> for
    examination. </li>
  <li> Brig. Gen. Roger B. Ramey, commander of the 8th Air Force said at Fort Worth that he believed the object was the
    <q>remnant of a weather balloon and a radar reflector</q>, and was <q>nothing to be excited about</q>. He allowed
    photographers to take a picture of it. It was announced that the object would be sent to <a
        href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html">Wright Field</a>, Dayton, OH.</li>
  <li> Later, Warrant Officer <span class="people">Irving Newton</span>, Stetsonville, Wisconsin, weather officer at
    Fort Worth, examined the object and said definitely that it was nothing but a badly smashed target used to determine
    the direction and velocity of high altitude winds. </li>
  <li> Lt. <span class="people" title="Walter G. Haut">Haught</span> reportedly told reporters that he had been <q>shut
    up by two blistering phone calls from Washington</q>.</li>
  <li> Efforts to contact Col. Blanchard brought the information that <q>he is now on leave</q>. </li>
  <li> Maj. <span class="people">Jesse A. Marcel</span>, intelligence officer of the 509th bombardment group, reportedly
    told Brazel, the finder of the object, that <q>it has nothing to do with army or navy so far as I can tell</q>.
  </li>
  <li> Brazel told reporters that he has found weather balloon equipment before, but had seen nothing that had resembled
    his latest find. </li>
  <li> Those men who saw the object said it had a flowered paper tape around it bearing the initials <q>D.P.</q></li>
