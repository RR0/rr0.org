<h2>People "Imagine' Speeds of 1200</h2>
<p><i>Pictures on Wirephoto Page</i></p>
<p>Those space sailing discs which have given sky-gazing residents of the Pacific Northwest a collective pain in the
  neck might be secret army missiles or "whatzits" from another world to some people, but to Mrs. Hester Wilson of 2324
  N. W. Johnson street they're nothing but toy balloons on the loose.</p>
<p>And she just nodded confidently when army officials announced the "flying disc" found in New Mexico Tuesday was just
  a radar reflecting kite attached to a weather balloon.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson, for the past 24 years operator of balloon concessions at country fairs and rodeos over Oregon and
  Washington, walked into The Oregonian editorial rooms a little bit fed up with "all this nonsense" about saucers in
  the sky.</p>
<p>"They're nothing but fugitives from a concession stand," she muttered. "Made of rubber, full of helium and pretty
  hard to describe when they're traveling high with six or seven more balloons tired on behind."</p>
<h4><b>People Termed Imaginative</b></h4>
<p>Mrs. Wilson blamed estimates of 1200-mile speeds attributed to the mystery objects on people's "imagination" ? and
  she said that balloons, when they get high enough, look flat and shiny. Dangling string, she avers, could be
  "vapor."</p>
<p>Willing to prove her point, she invited an Oregonian reporter and photographer to the top of Mt. Tabor for an
  eyewitness test. A helper, Clinton Fromm, who spent most of July Fourth blowing up balloons at the St. Paul rodeo,
  brought along a tank of helium and a generous supply of the rubber spheroids.</p>
<p>"Until about a year ago you couldn't get helium gas for balloons," Mrs. Wilson said, as Fromm set up his equipment.
  "Balloons filled with air won't float, except under a good breeze. Lots of times concession men have a string of six
  or seven balloons get away ? and often kids lose them, too. So we have "flying discs."</p>
<h4><b>Balloons Let Loose</b></h4>
<p>Mrs. Wilson let loose a brilliant orange balloon to test wind direction while Oregonian Photographer Milton Werschkul
  poised a camera. Fromm then tied a string of varicolored balloons with a big-eared "cat" balloon at the head of the
  string. Then Mrs. Wilson freed the string.</p>
<p>As the balloons soared straight up into the air, they gradually lost shape. At roughly 1000 feet they appeared flat
  and their to-and-fro tugging motion on the long string gave their motion the same sort of undulating movement
  described by other "disc" spotters. The string of balloons disappeared within a few minutes ? heading southwest over
  the Mt. Tabor district.</p>
<p>The "fins" on some of the flying missiles, Mrs. Wilson argued, could be the big "ears" sported by the popular "cat"
  balloons which carry the painted face of a cat under rubber finlike ears. To prove this point, she sent a second
  string of the balloons skyward and at a good height the optical illusion proved puzzling.</p>
<h4><b>High Altitudes Reached</b></h4>
<p>The balloons, the weather bureau reported, could reach a height of 30,000 feet and could sail along for a couple of
  days before breaking up under ideal conditions.</p>
<p>"Lots of times," Mrs. Wilson said, "concession men have a few balloons left over at the end of the day and let them
  go rather than try to deflate them and use them again. Sometimes they break loose by accident."</p>
<p>The balloon theory might be shrugged off by the irate eyewitnesses of something bigger and better than rubber toys ?
  but weather bureau officials pointed out that in the United States alone, four times a day 1000 balloons are freed
  into the sky in connection with the gathering of weather data.</p>
<h4>Metallic Foil Covers Disc</h4>
<p>Radio sound balloons are sent aloft 100 times a day over the North American continent, the weatherman said. And
  these, coincidentally enough, carry a 2-foot disc with a metallic foil covering which are tracked with radar in the
  assembly of everyday weather facts.</p>
<p>Wind-aloft balloons, released at night at this time of the year, carry small electric lights powered by batteries
  dropped by 8-inch parachutes.</p>
