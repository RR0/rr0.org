<h2>Appareil de type cerf-volant trouvé au N.M.; Etudié par l'Armée</h2>
<p>Washington, 8 juillet -- (UP) -- Le mystère des "soucoupes volantes" a pris un nouveau virage ce soir avec la
  révélation que les <a href="/org/us/dod/af/AAF.html">forces aériennes de l'armée</a> avaient récupéré un objet étrange
  au <a href="/org/us/state/nm/index.html">Nouveau-Mexique</a> et l'avaient transféré à <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html">Wright Field</a>, Dayton, O., pour examen. </p>
<p>L'annonce de la découverte vint d'abord de la <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/RoswellAFB.html">base aérienne de l'armée
  de Roswell</a>, au Nouveau-Mexique, près de laquelle une "soucoupe" avait été trouvée 3 semaines plus tôt. </p>
<p>Les quartiers-généraux de l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/AAF.html">AAF</a> révélèrent plus tard qu'un <q>couvercle de
  sécurité</q> avait été maintenu sur tout mis à part les détails les plus grossiers de la découverte. </p>
<p>Le porte-parole de l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/AAF.html">AAF</a> would say only that the "saucer" was a
  flimsily-constructed, kite-like object measuring about 25 feet in diameter and covered with a material resembling tin
  foil. </p>
<p>A telephonic report from Brig. Gen. <span class="people" title="Roger M. Ramey">Roger B. Ramey</span>, commander of
  the Eighth Air Force at Ft. Worth, Texas, said the purported "saucer" was badly battered when discovered by a rancher
  at Corona, 75 miles northwest of Roswell, N.M. </p>
<p>Ramey scoffed at the possibility that the object could have attained the supersonic speeds credited to the "flying
  saucers" allegedly spotted in recent weeks. </p>
<p>He reported that the object was too lightly constructed to have carried anyone and that there was no evidence that it
  had had a power plant of any sort. </p>
<p>It bore no identification marks and <span class="people">Ramey</span> emphasized that no one had seen it in flight.
</p>
<p>AAF sources ruled out the possibility that it might have been an army weather-kite. Helium balloons have been used
  for weather recording for the past seven or eight years. </p>
<p>They said it had been sent to <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/CarswellAFB.html">Ft. Worth</a> by Superfortress for
  transhipment to the AAF experimental center at Dayton. </p>
<p>AAF commanders in New Mexico refused to permit the object to be photographed on the grounds that it was <q>high level
  stuff</q>, although Ramey indicated he was not attaching too great importance to the find pending an investigation.
</p>
<p>The Roswell announcement came from Col. <a href="/people/b/BlanchardWilliamHugh/index.html">William H. Blanchard</a>,
  commanding officer of the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/RoswellAFB.html">Roswell army air base</a>, who specifically
  described the discovery as <q>a flying disc</q>. </p>
<p>He said the disc had been forwarded to higher headquarters, presumably the commanding general of the 8th air force at
  <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/CarswellAFB.html">Ft. Worth</a>, Tex. </p>
<p>Blanchard would reveal no further details. </p>
<p>Sheriff George Wilcox of Roswell said the disc was found about three weeks ago by <a
    href="/people/b/BrazelWilliamWare">W.W. Brizell</a> <em>(sic)</em>, on the Foster ranch at Corona, 75 miles
  northwest of Roswell. </p>
<p>Wilcox said that Brizell does not have a telephone and so did not report finding the disc until the day before
  yesterday. Brizell told the sheriff he didn't know just what the disc was, but that at first it appeared to be a
  weather meter. </p>
<p>The sheriff's office notified the army, which sent intelligence officers to pick up the object. Then today the army
  announced possession of a disc. </p>
<p>The sheriff quoted Brizell as saying the object <q>seemed more or less like tinfoil</q>. The rancher described the
  disc as about as large as a safe in the sheriff's office. </p>
<p>The safe is about three and one-half by four feet. </p>
