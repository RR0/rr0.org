<p>Fort Worth, Texas, July 9 (AP) An examination by the army revealed last night that <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/index.html">mysterious objects found on a lonely New Mexico
  ranch</a> was a harmless high-altitude weather <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon/index.html">balloon</a> - not a grounded flying disk. Excitement
  was high until Brig. Gen. <span class="people">Roger M. Ramey</span>, commander of the Eighth air forces with
  headquarters here cleared up the mystery.</p>
<p>The bundle of tinfoil, broken wood beams and rubber remnants of a balloon were sent here yesterday by army air
  transport in the wake of reports that it was a flying disk.</p>
<p>But the general said the objects were the crushed remains of a ray wind target used to determine the direction and
  velocity of winds at high altitudes.</p>
<p>Warrant Officer <span class="people">Irving Newton</span>, forecaster at the army air forces weather station here
  said, "<q>we use them because they go much higher than the eye can see</q>."</p>
<p>The weather balloon was found several days ago near the center of New Mexico by Rancher <a
    href="/people/b/BrazelWilliamWare/index.html">W. W. Brazel</a>. He said he didn't think much about it until he went
  into Corona, N. M., last Saturday and heard the flying disk reports.</p>
<p>He returned to his ranch, 85 miles northwest of Roswell, and recovered the wreckage of the balloon, which he had
  placed under some brush.</p>
<p>Then Brazel hurried back to Roswell, where he reported his find to the sheriff's office.</p>
<p>The sheriff called the Roswell air field and Maj. <span class="people">Jesse A. Marcel</span>, 509th bomb group
  intelligence officer was assigned to the case.</p>
<p>Col. <a href="/people/b/BlanchardWilliamHugh/index.html">William H. Blanchard</a>, commanding officer of the bomb
  group, reported the find to General Ramey and the object was flown immediately to the army air field here.</p>
<p>Ramey went on the air here last night to announce the New Mexico discovery was not a flying disk.</p>
<p>Newton said that when rigged up, the instrument "<q>looks like a six-pointed star, is sivery in appearance and rises
  in the air like a kite</q>."</p>
<p>In Roswell, the discovery set off a flurry of excitement.</p>
<p>Sheriff <span class="people">George Wicox</span>'s telephone lines were jammed. Three calls came from England, one of
  them from The London Daily Mail, he said.</p>
<p>A public relations officer here said the balloon was in his office "<q>and it'll probably stay right there</q>."</p>
<p>Newton, who made the examination, said some 80 weather stations in the U. S. were using that type of balloon and that
  it could have come from any of them.</p>
<p>He said he had sent up identical balloons during the invasion of Okinawa to determine ballistics information for
  heavy guns.</p>
