<p><a href="/people/b/BrazelWilliamWare/index.html">W. W. Brazel</a>, 48, Lincoln county rancher living 30 miles south of Corona,
  today told his story of finding what the army at first described as a flying disk, but the publicity which attended
  his find caused him to add that if he ever found anything else short of a bomb, he sure wasn't going to say anything
  about it.</p>
<p><a href="/people/b/BrazelWilliamWare/index.html">Brazel</a> was brought here late yesterday by W. E. Whitmore, of radio
  station KGFL, had his picture taken and gave an interview to the Record and Jason Kellahin, sent here from the
  Albuquerque bureau of the Associated Press to cover the story. The picture he posed for was sent out over AP telephoto
  wire sending machine specially set up in the Record office by R. D. Adair, AP wire chief sent here from Albuquerque
  for the sole purpose of getting out his picture and that of sheriff <span class="people">George Wilcox</span>, to whom
  <a href="/people/b/BrazelWilliamWare/index.html">Brazel</a> originally gave the information of his find.</p>
<p><a href="/people/b/BrazelWilliamWare/index.html">Brazel</a> related that on June 14 he and an 8-year old son, Vernon, were
  about 7 or 8 miles from the ranch house of the J. B. Foster ranch, which he operates, when they came upon a large area
  of bright wreckage made up on rubber strips, tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks.</p>
<p>At the time <a href="/people/b/BrazelWilliamWare/index.html">Brazel</a> was in a hurry to get his round made and he did not
  pay much attention to it. But he did remark about what he had seen and on July 4 he, his wife, Vernon and a daughter,
  Betty, age 14, went back to the spot and gathered up quite a bit of the debris.</p>
<p>The next day he first heard about the flying disks, and he wondered if what he had found might be the remnants of one
  of these.</p>
<p>Monday he came to town to sell some wool and while here he went to see sheriff <span
    class="people">George Wilcox</span> and "whispered kinda confidential like" that he might have found a flying disk.
</p>
<p><span class="people">George Wilcox</span> got in touch with the Roswell Army Air Field and Maj. p<span
    class="people">Jesse A. Marcel</span> and a man in plain clothes accompanied him home, where they picked up the rest
  of the pieces of the "disk" and went to his home to try to reconstruct it.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/people/b/BrazelWilliamWare/index.html">Brazel</a> they simply could not reconstruct it at all. They
  tried to make a kite out of it, but could not do that and could not find any way to put it back together so that it
  could fit.</p>
<p>Then <span class="people" title="Jesse A. Marcel">Major Marcel</span> brought it to Roswell and that was the last he
  heard of it until the story broke that he had found a flying disk.</p>
<p><a href="/people/b/BrazelWilliamWare/index.html">Brazel</a> said that he did not see it fall from the sky and did not see it
  before it was torn up, so he did not know the size or shape it might have been, but he thought it might have been
  about as large as a table top. The balloon which held it up, if that was how it worked, must have been about 12 feet
  long, he felt, measuring the distance by the size of the room in which he sat. The rubber was smoky gray in color and
  scattered over an area about 200 yards in diameter.</p>
<p>When the debris was gathered up the tinfoil, paper, tape, and sticks made a bundle about three feet long and 7 or 8
  inches thick, while the rubber made a bundle about 18 or 20 inches long and about 8 inches thick. In all, he
  estimated, the entire lot would have weighed maybe five pounds.</p>
<p>There was no sign of any metal in the area which might have been used for an engine and no sign of any propellers of
  any kind, although at least one paper fin had been glued onto some of the tinfoil.</p>
<p>There were no words to be found anywhere on the instrument, although there were letters on some of the parts.
  Considerable scotch tape and some tape with flowers printed upon it had been used in the construction.</p>
<p>No strings or wire were to be found but there were some eyelets in the paper to indicate that some sort of attachment
  may have been used.</p>
<p><a href="/people/b/BrazelWilliamWare/index.html">Brazel</a> said that he had previously found two weather observation balloons
  on the ranch, but that what he found this time did not in any way resemble either of these.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I am sure that what I found was not any weather observation balloon, he said. But if I find anything else besides a
    bomb they are going to have a hard time getting me to say anything about it.</p>
