<p><q>The many rumors regarding the flying disk became a reality yesterday when the intelligence office of the 509th
  Bomb Group of the Eight Air Force, Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc through
  the co-operation of one of the local ranchers and the Sheriff's Office of Chaves county. </q></p>
<p><q>The flying object landed on a ranch near Roswell sometime last week. Not having phone facilities, the rancher
  stored the disc until such time as he was able to contact the Sheriff's office, who in turn notified Major Jesse A.
  Marcel, of the 509th Bomb Group Intelligence office. </q></p>
<p><q>Action was immediately taken and the disc was picked up at the rancher's home. It was inspected at the Roswell
  Army Air Field and subsequently loaned by Major Marcel to higher headquarters.</q></p>
