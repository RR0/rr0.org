<p class="abstract">New York, July 6.-While United States military aircraft hunted the skies over the Pacific coast
  areas today without result, flying saucers were reported over Canada for the first time.</p>
<p class="abstract2">Scores of residents in <span class="place">Walsenburg, South-western Ontario</span>, asserted that
  they saw two large formations of illuminated discs flying over a wide arc in the sky on Saturday night.</p>
<p>In South Dakota a National Guard pilot already in the air was ordered by radio to "run down" a silvery disc with a
  short tail which a resident of Sioux Falls said he saw shoot acrosss the sky a few minutes previously.</p>
<p>The pilot went in the direction of the reported disc, but radioed that he could not find it.</p>
<h2>Test on students</h2>
<p><span class="people">Sidney</span>, July 7.-Red corpuscles passing in front of the retina of the eye may be the
  "flying saucers" now baffling America.</p>
<p>This was proved today in a test conducted on 22 students at the Sydney University by Professor F. S. Cotton,
  professor of physiology.</p>
<p>Addressing 450 students, he drew attention to the rables messages referring to the fact that hundreds of persons in
  many parts of the United States has reported seeing flying saucers. The professor took the students outside the main
  building and told them to look at the sky about a mile away and concentrate their gaze on a fixed point white standing
  perfectly still. He told them to let him know if they saw any objects corresponding to those described in the rabled
  reports. Within 10 minutes 22 students reported they had seen "flying saucers."</p>
<p>A written report submitted by every student indicated that he had seen objects which they said were oval-shaped and
  bright, moving rapidly in the direction of the long axis and with a tendency for the path of their motion to be
  curved.</p>
<p>A remarkable feature of drawings submitted by each student was that they revealed three features. These were: Silvery
  discs with a short tail, discs swinging in an arc, and discs resembling a string of flying pearls.</p>
<p>Professor Cotton said tonight that the objects seen by the students were readily caused by the effect or red
  corpuscles passing in front of the retina. Normally people acquainted with the red-cell phenomena might not be
  prepared to trace the connexion, because frequently these red-cell effects revealed a large number of objects. When
  looking at a blue sky, with scattered clouds, however, a person could see only a small number of objects apparently
  darting across the blue.</p>
<p>Professor Cotton added athat readers could draw their own conclusions about the reports of the "flying saucers".</p>
