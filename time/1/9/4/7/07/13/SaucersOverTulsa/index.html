<p class="abstract">Saucers Over <span class="place">Tulsa</span>?</p>
<p>No one yet has been able to capture a flying saucer but Enlo Gilmore, free lance photographer, came up with this
  picture which he said was made on the Main st. viaduct Saturday afternoon when eight objects whizzed over. Other
  photographers, perhaps jealous that they had missed the flight, said it would be possible to make the photo by
  superimposing spots on a negative.
