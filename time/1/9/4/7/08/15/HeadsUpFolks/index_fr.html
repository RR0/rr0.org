    vues </p>
    <p>Just as Magic Valley and the nation were starting to let go of lampposts after reeling under a weiter of flying
      saucer reports, two more Twin Falls county men revived speculation on the mystery with vivid descriptions of discs
      they saw. </p>
    <p>From A. C. Urie, who operates the Auger Falls Trout Farm, six miles west of Blue Lakes Ranch to Snake River
      Canyon, came perhaps the most detailed account of any of the fast flying objects the nation has yet produced. </p>
    <p>The flying saucer Urie saw was skimming along through Snake River Canyon at a height of about 75 feet at 1:00 pm
      Wednesday. At 9:30 am the same day, L. W. Hawkins, Twin Falls county commissioner and former county sheriff, also
      saw two circular objects soaring along at great speeds near Salmon Dam 40 miles south west of Twin Falls. </p>
    <p>Here is Urie's eye-witness description of the flying discs, seen by him and his son, Keith, 8, and Billy,10: </p>
    <p>"I obtained a close-up view of the flying saucer as it passed the trout farm at 1:00pm August 13th going down
      Snake River Canyon at a height of about 75 feet from the canyon floor. I would estimate the speed about a 1000
      miles per hour." </p>
    <p>Urie explained that the incident occurred while the two boys were coming across the river from the north side in
      a boat. He had become concerned about what was delaying them, and walked toward the river to see if they were all
      right. </p>
    <p>"I had a side view of a distance of about 300 feet and almost was level with the thing," he continued. "Two of my
      boys, Keith and Billy were below me and they also saw it at about a right angle. They both a lower and a side
      view, and we and we were staring at it from the north side of the facing toward the north. The boys saw it coming
      from about a half a mile up the canyon, and we all lost site of it in less then a mile." </p>
    <p>While the the impression was still vivid in their minds, the three all got together and made rough sketches of
      what they had seen. These inturn were the basis of the artist conception of the strange affair by Vic Goertson of
      Twin Falls for the Times-News. </p>
    <p>"The canyon floor underneath at that particular point was that it rode up and down over the hills and hollows at
      a speed indicating some type of control faster then the reflexes of man. It is my opinion it is guided by some
      type of instruments and must be powered by atomic energy, as it made very little noise-just a s-w-i-s-h when it
      passed by." </p>
    <p>Urie described the size as about 20 feet long by 10 feet high and 10 feet wide, giving it an oblong shape. It
      might be described as looking at an inverted pie-plate, or broad-brimmed straw hat that been compressed from two
      sides. </p>
    <p>Pressed for his opinion of just what it was, he said he was convinced there was something to this "flying saucer"
      situation. "I know a number of people who have also seen them, and I know now that they're not just imagining
      seeing these things or trying to get their names in the paper. </p>
    <p>"I do know that it scared the boys, and made me feel uneasy," he added. </p>
    <p>Tracing down a rumor that county commissioner Hawkins had seen an unusual object in the air on the same day as
      Urie's experience, the Times-News called him at his Filer home. </p>
    <p>"Yes I did," he replied without hesitation. "I'll have to admit, I've been skeptical all along until I saw it
      with my own eyes. I can't say what it was, but I can say there is something in the air." </p>
    <p>Hawkins related that while at Salmon dam Wednesday morning, a sound resembling that of an echo of a motor caused
      him to look upward, and there he saw to circular objects that reflected light. They were traveling at a great
      speed, and higher then most airplanes, according to Hawkins. </p>
    <p>Aside from this, he declined to add details, except to say, "there's something in the air." </p>
    <p>His general description however, corresponded closely to hundreds of persons who reported seeing "flying saucers"
      after Kenneth Arnold, Boise business man, touched a deluge by telling of coming upon nine disc-like objects while
      he was flying in his private plane in Washington. </p>
    <p>Thereafter the nation became increasingly "flying saucer" conscious creating a state of mind for four teen age
      Twin Falls boys to cause a mild sensation when they built a model flying disc and tossed in a local yard July
      10th. This was subsequently revealed as a hoax, following the investigation by the army and the FBI. </p>
    <p>There after the saucer reports tapered off into a few scattered incidents until the question was revived by this
      weeks occurrences. </p>
    <p>Speculation has ranged from mention that the discs could be army navy guided missile experiments, or they could
      be experiments by some foreign country, to something out of this world. </p>
    <p>What ever they are, a lot of people have seen something. </p>
