<p>Are the flying disks the product of another world?</p>
<p>Before snickering at this question, the reader is requested to wade through the formidable but thought-awakening <em>Books
  of Charles Fort</em>, published for the Fortean Society by Henry Holt &amp; Company, 1941, namely : <em>The Book of
  the Damned</em>, <em>Lo!</em> and <em>Wild Talents.</em></p>
<p>The argument of this article is as follows :</p>
<ol>
  <li>If the flying discs are a <em>new</em> phenomenon in earthly skies it may be that some foreign power is ready to
    test out a new weapon, or that it is one of our own, because it must now be admitted that the discs are solid
    objects which are not the product of Nature. They travel against the wind and at rapidly varying velocities, also
    changing direction of flight with great frequency, according to numerous observations throughout the nation.</li>
  <li>If, however, the flying discs are <em>not</em> a new phenomenon, and if they have been seen repeatedly in past
    centuries before our earthly civilizations had a yet produced even so much as a Zeppelin, then it follows that they
    must be the product of some extra-terrestrial civilization.</li>
</ol>
<p>Are we being watched over as though we were cattle, <em>owned</em> by superior beings who live beyond this earth?
  Systematized scientists would willingly guffaw or smile at this "imaginative" assumption, but such facial calisthenics
  go no farther toward solving the problem than the lowing of cattle tends to free them from bondage.</p>
<p>Man's greatest psychological weakness is that he attemps to <em>reduce</em> the Unknown to his own level of
  understanding—if only for the sake of his own egotism and prestige, or for the sake of orthodox <em>System</em>—rather
  than try to <em>raise</em> his own understanding to such a level that it encompasses the Unknown.</p>
<p>This writer's sister-in-law was in Honolulu at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack. She was driving her car to a
  filling station when the attack occurred. A Japanese plane zoomed low over her head, and her daughter, seated beside
  her, remarked upon the Japanese markings which they could both plainly see on the wings. "Strange," said my
  sister-in-law, "that the government would go to such extremes of realism in the <em>practice maneuvers."</em></p>
<p>She could not conceive of the reality behind what her own eyes had beheld. She, like most human beings, automatically
  placed the phenomenon in a category which lay within the scope of her understanding.</p>
<p>When Galileo insisted that the Earth revolved about the sun he was persecuted for his trouble, because a
  non-stationary Earth did not conform to the long established (Aristotelean and ecclesiastic) <em>System</em> of
  things.</p>
<p>When Louis Pasteur spoke of micro-organisms and propounded his germ-theory of disease, orthodox science, which
  represented the current System of his time, wished to ostracize him.</p>

<p>Now we have seen flying discs. Somebody in Seattle, in keeping with the darkest of mediaeval traditions, gained
  popularity in the press by asserting that they were nothing but the aluminium seals out of beer bottle caps. Then we
  are to believe that the aluminium seals out of beer bottle caps: 1. Travel in formation; 2. May be seen in almost
  every state of the Union and parts of Canada (not to mention one press report from Peru); 3. Travel at changing
  velocities, and <em>against</em> the wind!</p>
<p>Let us credit ourselves with more intelligence. Life is real and life is earnest—not a soap opera. A serious mystery
  has been widely observed. Let us not distort the evidence to fit a <em>System</em> or to salve our vanity. Remember
  that the meek shall inherit the Earth, and this had been borne out in the fact that the humblest members of our
  civilization have always contributed the greatest values while those quick to laugh at an original thought or unusual
  insight into the Unknown have always been the quickest to seize upon the benefits which the humble and open of heart
  and mind have offered them even while gasping in the death throes of martyrdom. An idiot can laugh and guffaw and
  snicker. It takes a man of wisdom to think boldly and originally. So let us not tend toward social idiocy. Let us
  leave our world series and our juke boxes for a moment and take advantage of one of the greatest gifts of creation—the
  human mind. let is <em>think</em>. (Lest someone start doing it <em>for</em> us!). Let us examine the evidence without
  being influenced by what the discs "ought" to be, but guided by the thought that science, while doing the best job it
  can, is still greatly handicapped before the awful immensity of the Unknown, and that there are many things above our
  heads which are certainly beyond our full understanding today.</p>
<p><span class="people">Charles Fort</span> repeatedly proves that <a
    href="/people/astronomes.html">astronomers</a> and other authorities on physical phenomena beyond this planet are
  very much like the astrologers as described by Lord Bacon when he "pointed out that the astrologers had squirmed into
  prestige and emolument by shooting at marks, disregarding their misses, and recording their hits with unseemly
  advertisement." (<em>New Lands.)</em> (Still, one day we may learn that the astrologers also have a leg to stand on,
  when orthodox science learns more about the inter-relationship of gravitation and electromagnetism, and especially
  about extra-terrestrial radiations and their periodic effect on the controlling physiological factors of heredity.)
</p>
<p>Many astronomers claimed the discovery of the planet Neptune to be a triumph of mathematical deduction, but <span
    class="people">Fort</span> patiently points out the true facts of the case :</p>
<ol>
  <li>According to Leverrier, there was <em>one</em> planet external to Uranus.</li>
  <li>According to another contemporary astronomer, Hansen, there were <em>two</em> planets.</li>
  <li>According to a third contemporary, Airy, there was <em>none.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>All three scientists based their prediction upon mathematical deductions.</p>
<p>When Neptune was finally sighted it was found so far from the position in which Leverrier had predicted it would be
  that astronomers in the United States refused to accept that the planet had been discovered by means of
  calculation.</p>
<p><span class="people">Fort</span> points out: "One planet was found—so calculated Leverrier, in his profound
  meditations. Suppose two had been found—confirmation of the brilliant computations of Hansen. None—the opinion of the
  great astronomer, Sir George Airy." <em>(New Lands.)</em></p>
<p>Up until the accidental discovery of the trans-Neptunian planet, Pluton, by Mr. <a
    href="/people/t/TombaughClydeWilliam/index.html">Tombaugh</a>, in <time>1930</time>, on a photographic plate (<em>not </em>by
  exact calculation, although <a
      href="/people/l/LowellPercival/index.html">Lowell</a> predicted it would be found), Leverrier's name enjoyed a
  high place in the history of <a
      href="/science/discipline/hard/nat/univ/astro/index.html">astronomy</a>, and still does, because he apparently
  "called his shot" to some reasonable extent. However, now that <em>two </em>trans-Uranian planets have been
  discovered, all the textbooks should be rewritten, giving Leverrier's place to the <em>great</em> astronomer, Mr.
  Hansen, who predicted two planets would be found (though, for all we known, there may be six more).</p>
<p>All this boils down to one point: <em>Keep your eyes—and your mind—open</em>. Our politicians, for example, are <em>not</em>
  solving the problems of this world, because the depth and scope of those problems require the insight of men of higher
  training and a modicum of wisdom. We must not accept in blind faith what all politicians tell us. It is the same with
  our scientific authorities. We must keep them on their toes by challenging what they say. Let is not munch placidly
  the lotus blossoms they print in the textbooks. Let us pat them all on the back and give them all on the back and give
  them all the credit and cooperation they deserve, to be sure, but let THEM<em> not </em>build around our vision the
  blinding walls of a <em>System</em> that will not accept new things if those new things do not <em>conform !</em></p>
<p>Flying discs have just visited our skies. Beware of the definitions of the systematists. One "authority" said it was
  all the result of hallucinations. We must shout back at this "authority" with the righteous indignation of adults
  whose intelligence has been grossly insulted. Why should people in thirty-nine or more states suddenly all acquire
  equivalent hallucinations at the same time? How can an hallucination be <em>photographed?</em></p>
<p>Dear Professor Orthodox: Life is real and life is earnest—even more so than the <em>System</em> you go by.</p>
<p>The discs are real and <em>they</em> may be earnest. They are not the product of Nature. Intelligent beings made
  them. If the discs belong to Russia or any other foreign power, we must prepare for an attack. But evidence would seem
  to point out that the discs are the product of a civilization which produced them centuries ago. As no civilization on
  Earth has been known to have produced such objects it follows that extra-terrestrial intelligences own them.</p>
<p>For the discs have been seen in past centuries. Just read <span class="people">Charles Fort</span> for the
  authoritatively recorded <em>masses</em> of evidence.</p>

<p><span class="people">Charles Fort</span> points to the Sargasso Sea, that great mass of seaweed and debris in the
  North Atlantic Ocean which has been formed largely by the action of ocean currents. In other words, the floating
  substances in the Sargasso Sea are in the center of a vortex.</p>
<p><span class="people">Fort</span> then speaks of gravitational currents in outer space. Between the moon and the earth
  is a neutral, or balanced zone, somewhere, just as there are many neutral zones between other mutually attracting
  heavenly bodies. Into such neutral zones there may drift huge masses of spacial debris, meteors, cosmic dust, even
  water moisture in the form of ice. Fort says there is some evidence that these quasi-worlds float away into orbits
  around the earth, once formed, like a gigantic log raft in a stream, or around other planets, depending on where they
  were first concentrated. Inasmuch as the nebular hypothesis has achieved general acceptance in orthodoxy, <a
      href="/people/f/FortCharles/index.html">Fort</a>'s hypothesis dealing with this coagulation of cosmic dust and
  debris in the neutral gravity zones should meet with equal acceptance. Where two whirlpools, currents, or vortices
  impinge upon one another, eddies are often formed. Suns have been formed by cosmic matter being drawn into huge
  electromagnetic vortices, and as the material captured gravitated toward the core of the vortex it traveled faster and
  in closer quarters. The resultant friction caused heat great enough to disrupt atoms and start the chain of atomic
  disintegrance that is a sun's source of energy. Now it may be just as possible that some of these vortices which
  capture cosmic matter are not as powerful or energetic and therefore the central drifting material is never condensed
  sufficiently nor moved swiftly enough to create either fusion heat or atomic disintegrance. Hence, amorphous dark
  bodies, loosely hung together—spacial Sargassos. In regard to unknown, amorphous earth satellites, the sun has been
  repeatedly blotted out (<a
      href="/people/f/FortCharles/index.html">Fort</a> carefully points out specific instances) by something not
  accepted as being an eclipse. <a
      href="/people/f/FortCharles/index.html">Fort</a> then goes on to say that the orbits of these Super Sargassos
  sometimes come so close to earth than an interplay of gravitational attraction occurs. Among many instances he tells
  of bodies bursting out of graves in a cemetery (Riobamba, Brazil) and flying eight hundred or so feet into the air.
  Ice blocks have fallen from clear skies, also pebbles have descended inside of hailstones. An engineer friend of the
  writer related a relatively recent experience in the jungles of eastern Bolivia in which dangerously large rocks
  rained out of a starlit sky. Earthquakes have occured in unusual places (from the standpoint of seismology). Our
  atmosphere has been disturbed violently by such proximity of extra-terrestrial bodies. <a
      href="/people/f/FortCharles/index.html">Fort</a> then gives case after case of strange appearances in earthly
  skies of flying saucers, lights, even —Zeppelin-like structures, long before we knew about the aeroplane.</p>
<p>After reading <a href="/people/f/FortCharles/index.html">Fort</a>, then one begins to wonder. Consider, for example,
  the bad storms in the middle eastern part of the United States in the middle and latter part of June, 1947, which this
  writer personally witnessed. From St. Louis to the Twin Cities and beyond—pressure areas, strange, upside-down clouds
  (photographed and published in the newspapers), cyclones and electrical storms. Highest Mississippi flood level in 103
  years. An earthquake in St. Louis. <em>Pebbles</em> broke windows in St. Paul during a hailstorm. And contemporaneous
  with all this—flying discs.</p>
<p><a href="/people/f/FortCharles/index.html">Fort</a> wonders if extra-terrestrial visitors do not camp on these Super
  Sargassos and watch us. When such masses approach us more closely the watchers apparently fly into earthly skies to
  look us over, then go back quickly to their sky islands. <a
      href="/people/f/FortCharles/index.html">Fort</a> also records instances in which reputable astronomers have
  observed lights and searchlights, stationary and moving, on the dark portion of the moon. This writer once clearly
  observed in his four-inch Newtonian telescope three symmetrical, circular bodies fly in formation across a field of
  vision that covered an area of the moon's surface the diameter of which could not have been less than five hundred
  miles. These objects traversed that field of vision in approximately three seconds. They were flying in perfect
  formation. All three were exactly the same size. Such symmetry in Nature would be rarer than space ships. This
  observation was made eighteen years ago and never forgotten.</p>
<p>A question now arises : But this time there were too many flying discs. This was not like anything ever seen
  before.</p>
<p>Answer: We're liable to see a great many things soon in earthly skies that our human race does not conciously recall
  having seen before. Consider our startling advancement of the past fifty years. Since previous flying disc visitations
  (some were recorded in the 19<sup>th</sup> century) we have even shot off a few atomic bombs.</p>
<p><em>Atomic power!</em> Somebody is playing with the building blocks of the Universe.</p>
<p>An alarm bell rings in outer space.</p>
<p>Earth has come of age! Earth has grown dangerous! Terrestrial men now have one of the keys to interplanetary
  navigation. We cannot let them come nosing out here into our territory!</p>
<p>So—special investigation by extra-terrestrials. The discs are nosing about friends. Maybe this is all nonsense,
  but—think it over. The writer is of the opinion that an alarm bell had better ring in the cranial vacuae of some
  authorities' heads.</p>
<p>Remember: Beware of the systematists!</p>
<p>It would actually be good for this world to be presented with proof of the existence of extra-terrestrial beings,
  whether they be friends or foes. Because then perhaps men would cease regarding each other as Russians, Americans,
  Englishmen or Frenchmen, but would recognize the universality of Man. All men would simply call themselves
  Terrestrials and would unite against the dangers of the great Unknown. . . .</p>
