  <li>By letter dated 30 December 1947 from the Director of Research and Development Headquarters USAF, your
    Headquarters was required to establish Project "SIGN".</li>
  <li>The conclusion appears inescapable that some type of flying object has been observed. Identification and the
    origin of these objects is not discernible to this Headquarters. It is imperative, therefore, that efforts to
    determine whether these objects are of domestic or foreign origin must be increased until conclusive evidence is
    obtained. The needs of national defense require such evidence in order that appropriate countermeasures may be
    taken.</li>
  <li>In addition to the imperative need for evidence to permit countermeasures, is the necessity of informing the
    public as to the status of the problem. To date there has been too little data to present to the public. The press,
    however, is about to take it into its own hands and demand to be told what we do or do not know about the situation.
    Silence on our part will not long be acceptable.</li>
  <li>Request immediate information as to your conclusions to date and your recommendations as to the information to be
    given to the press. Your recommendation is requested also as to whether that information should be offered to the
    press or withheld until it is actively sought by the press.</li>
