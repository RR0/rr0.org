<h1> Annexe "A" - Unidentified Aerial Objects Facts and Discussion </h1>
<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<ol>
  <li> As of 10 March <a href="../../../index.html">1949</a>, a total of 256 incidents involving unidentified aerial
    objects had been recorded, under Project "<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/sign/index.html">SIGN</a>." The
    majority of these were domestic observations but there were many from reports from foreign sources. In each incident
    the observers have been interrogated by investigators and the results have been analyzed by technical personnel.
  </li>
  <li> Condensed summaries have been prepared on each incident to provide basic information to individuals and agencies
    having a responsibility or interest in the project. </li>
  <li> The extreme lack of accurate observed details and the unpredictable occurrence of incidents have made positive
    identification extremely difficult. Data on unidentified aerial objects has grouped the incidents as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>13.3% - discs </li>
      <li>43.0% - spherical or elliptical [sic] shape(including balls of fire) </li>
      <li>6.0% - cylindrical shape </li>
      <li>2.5% - winged objects </li>
      <li>32.2% - shapes other than those above</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> In order to identify ordinary and conventional objects, that have probably been included in the list of reported
    incidents, graphical methods have been applied as follows: </li>
  <li> Prepared graphical data includes:
    <ol type="a">
      <li> Charts concerning unidentified aerial objects, to indicate
        <ol>
          <li> Type of object observed</li>
          <li> Vicinity in which particular type of object was observed </li>
          <li> Direction of flight</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li> Location of guided missiles, research and related centers</li>
      <li> Location of airlines, airfields, both military and commercial </li>
      <li> Locations of radio beacon stations </li>
      <li> Known or projected radar stations from which reports and assistance may be derived </li>
      <li> Meteorological stations from which balloon release data, radiosonde or theodolite readings may be
        obtained </li>
      <li> Past, current, and projected celestial phenomena </li>
      <li> Flight paths of migratory birds</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> A psychological analysis of the reported data is being prepared by Aero-Medical Laboratory, <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/index.html">AMC</a>, for the purpose of determining those incidents that are probably
    based upon errors of the human mind and senses. A preliminary verbal report from the professional psychologists
    indicates that a considerable number of incidents can be explained as ordinary occurrences that have been
    misrepresented, as the result of human errors. </li>
  <li> Specialist services, supplementary to those of <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/index.html">AMC</a> technical offices,
    are being provided by a number of agencies. </li>
  <li> The Air Weather Service has reviewed incident data and has provided the information that 24 of the first 172
    coincide, both with respect to location and time, with the release of weather balloons. </li>
  <li> The Ohio State University has contracted with <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/index.html">AMC</a> to supply
    astronomical services in an effort to identify meteors, planetoids and associated phenomena. Professor <a
        href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen/index.html">Hynek</a>, Ohio State University Astrophysicist and head of the
    University Observatory has reviewed the incident summary sheets. </li>
  <li> Preliminary report of Dr. <a href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen/index.html">Hynek</a>, indicates that 30 per cent of
    the first 200 incidents are positively attributable to astronomical phenomena, and 45 per cent could be explained on
    the basis of such phenomena or the sighting of weather balloons and other objects. This gives a total of 75 per cent
    of all incidents with possible explanation. </li>
  <li> Members of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Chief of Staff, USAF, who have provided consultant services to
    Project "<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge/index.html">Grudge</a>," include Dr. <a
        href="/people/l/LangmuirIrving/index.html">Irving Langmuir</a>, Chief, General Electric Research and Dr. G. E.
    Valley of <a href="/org/us/region/ma/MIT/index.html">MIT</a>.</li>
  <li> Dr.G. E. Valley has displayed an active interest in Project "<a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge/index.html">Grudge</a>" to the extent of reviewing the reported
    incidents and writing an overall type of analysis in which he groups the various objects and then analyzes each
    group from the standpoint of scientific feasibility. </li>
  <li> Inasmuch as various surmises have been advanced that some of the reported observations may have represented
    "space ships" or satellite vehicles, a special study has been initiated with the <a href="/org/us/RAND.html">Rand
      Corporation</a>, under the Rand Project, to provide an analysis from this standpoint and also to provide
    fundamental information, pertaining to the basic design and performance characteristics that might distinguish a
    possible "space ship." Rand Corporation has also informed <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/index.html">AMC</a> that their
    analysis of all incidents leads them to the conclusion that there is nothing in any reported incidents which would
    go against a rational explanation. </li>
  <li> The Weather Bureau Library of the Department of Commerce has supplied information on "<a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/foudre/globulaire">ball lightning</a>." This was requested because of
    the belief by some persons that some of the observations may have represented "<a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/foudre/globulaire">ball lightning</a>." It appears that the subject of
    "ball lightning" occupies an undetermined status and authorities are not at all convinced that such a phenomenon
    actually exists. </li>
  <li> On 8 April <a href="../../../index.html">1949</a> the repeated occurrence of green fireball phenomena in New
    Mexico was discussed with Dr. <span class="people">Joseph Kaplan</span>, member of the USAF Scientific Advisory
    Board. This phenomenon has caused considerable concern on the part of Hq, Fourth Army and has occupied the interests
    of Dr. <a href="/people/l/LaPazLincoln/index.html">Lincoln LaPaz</a> of the University of New Mexico. Dr. <a
        href="/people/l/LaPazLincoln/index.html">LaPaz</a> believes that the phenomena are not <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/rentree/meteore">meteorites</a>. Because of Dr. <a
        href="/people/l/LaPazLincoln/index.html">LaPaz</a>' outstanding ability for accurate observation and his
    experience in identification of meteoritic phenomena, Dr. <span class="people">Kaplan</span> expressed the belief
    that the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/GreenFireballs">green fireball phenomena</a> should be further
    investigated. Dr. <span class="people">Kaplan</span>'s views and this phenomena were discussed
    <time>1948-04-12</time> with Dr. <span class="people">Theodore
      vonKarman</span>, Chairman, USAF Scientific Advisory Board, who feels that the problem is more properly in the
    field of upper atmosphere research than the field of intelligence. </li>
  <li> A summary of the incidents reported would indicate that:
    <ol type="a">
      <li> All incidents which coincide with explainable aerial activities or recorded natural phenomena should be
        eliminated from further consideration. </li>
      <li> Creditable unexplained incidents involving light phenomena should be further investigated and analyzed by
        highly competent scientists who can establish the identity either within or without the limits of known natural
        phenomena. </li>
      <li> Creditable unexplained incidents which might involve the use of atomic powered craft of usual [sic] design
        should be considered jointly by the Atomic Energy Commission and highly competent aerodynamicists to determine
        the necessity for further consideration of such incidents by the National Defense Intelligence Agencies.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<ol start="17">
  <li> The majority of reported incidents are reliable to the extent that they have involved the sighting of some object
    or light phenomenon. </li>
  <li> In spite of the lack of accurate data provided by witnesses, the majority of reported incidnts have been caused
    by mis-identification of weather balloons, high altitude balloons with lights and/or electronic equipment, meteors,
    bolides, and the planet Venus. </li>
  <li> There are numerous reports from reliable and competent observers for which a conclusive explanation has not been
    made. Some of these involve descriptions which would place them in the category of new manifestations of probable
    natural phenomena but others involve configurations and described performance which might conceivably represent an
    advanced aerodynamical development. A few unexplained incidents surpass these limits of credibility. </li>
  <li> It is unlikely that a foreign power would expose a superior aerial weapon by a prolonged ineffectual penetration
    of the United States.</li>
