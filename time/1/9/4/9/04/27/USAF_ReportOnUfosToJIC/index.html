  <h2>The problem</h2>
  <ol>
    <li> To advise the Joint Intelligence Committee of the findings of the Directorate of Intelligence, USAF, regarding
      the sightings of unidentified aerial objects and the Air Force organization established for further investigation
      and solution of the problem. </li>

  <h2>Facts bearing on the problem</h2>
  <ol>
    <li value="2"> Following the great number of reported sightings of flying discs during the summer of 1947, Hq, <a
        href="/org/us/dod/af/amc">Air Materiel Command</a>, in a letter dated <time>1947-09-23</time>, requested that
      the Commanding General, Army Air Forces, issue a directive assigning a priority, security classification and code
      name for a detailed study of flying disc reports. Hq, <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/index.html">Air Materiel
        Command</a> explained that their action was based on the opinion that phenomena reported appeared to be real and
      that there were objects in existence which would approximate the shape of a disc. <a
          href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/index.html">AMC</a> concluded that some incidents might be caused by natural
      phenomena but that some incidents described characteristics which suggested evasive tactics. Awaiting a specific
      directive, Hq, <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/index.html">AMC</a> continued to collect information on flying disc
      incidents in order to more clearly define the nature of the phenomena. On the <time>1947-12-22</time>, in a
      memorandum, "Analysis of Flying Disc Reports," the Director of Intelligence concurred with <a
          href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/index.html">Air Materiel Command</a>'s recommendation and forwarded their letter to
      the Director of Research and Development, DCS/M for reply. </li>
    <li> In a letter dated <time>1947-12-30</time>, the Director of Research and Development, DCS/M, advised the
      Commanding General, <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/index.html">AMC</a>, that Air Force policy was not to ignore
      reports of sightings and phenomena in the atmosphere but to recognize that part of its mission to collect,
      evaluate and act on information of this nature. To implement this policy it was directed that Hq, <a
          href="/org/us/dod/af/amc">Air Materiel Command</a> set up a project with the purpose of collecting, collating,
      evaluating, and distributing to interested government agencies and contractors, all information concerning
      sightings and phenomena in the atmosphere which could be construed to be of concern to the national security. This
      directive assigned a priority of 2-A to the project, a RESTRICTED classification, and a code name of "<a
          href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/sign/index.html">SIGN</a>." </li>
    <li> At <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/index.html">Air Materiel Command</a> the Technical Intelligence Division was
      assigned the responsibility for accomplishing this mission with the full assistance of all divisions and
      activities within Air Materiel Command to permit successful completion of the project. The cooperation of the
      Army, Navy, Coast Guard and <a href="/org/us/ic/fbi/index.html">F.B.I.</a> was solicited in order to facilitate
      the forwarding and investigation of all reports. Arrangements were effected for handling such reports directly
      with Air Materiel Command. </li>
    <li> In addition to the collection, analysis and investigation activities directed by the project personnel at Hq,
      Air Materiel Command, Air Intelligence Memorandum dated 6 August <a href="../../../../8/index.html">1948</a>,
      subject: "Flying Saucers," required that a study be made by the Air Intelligence Division to examine the pattern
      of tactics of reported flying saucers and develop conclusions as to their probability. The results of this
      analysis were prepared as Air Intelligence division(DI/USAF-ONI) Study nÂ° 203, "Analysis of Flying Object
      Incidents in the United States." The Directorate of Intelligence has maintained close liaison with Project "SIGN"
      activities in order that appropriate staff sections of Headquarters, <a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">USAF</a>
      may be adequately advised on the entire subject of unidentified aerial phenomena reports. </li>
    <li> The code name of "<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/sign/index.html">SIGN</a>" for the project was
      changed to "<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge/index.html">GRUDGE</a>" by a request on 16 December
      1948 by the Director of Research and Development, DCS/M, Hq, USAF. "<a
          href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge/index.html">GRUDGE</a>" under the U.S. Joint Services Code Word
      Index refers to the title "Detailed Study of Flying Discs." </li>

  <h2>Assumptions and conclusions</h2>
  <ol start="7">
    <li> Hq, <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/index.html">Air Materiel Command</a> will continue its investigations under
      project "<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge/index.html">GRUDGE</a>" and the Directorate of
      Intelligence, <a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">USAF</a>, will maintain close liaison with that Command in order
      to advise Staff sections on the subject of unidentified aerial objects. </li>
