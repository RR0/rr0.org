<p>TO: Director, FBI.</p>
<p>The following information was furnished by SA <span class="note">"Special Agent" in the FBI</span> <span
    class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> by <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXX</span>. <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span>ÃŽ
</p>
<p>An investigator for the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Forces</a> stated that three so-called flying saucers
  has been recovered in New Mexico. They were described as being circular in shape with raised centers, approximately 50
  feet in diameter. Each one was occupied by three bodies of human shape but only 3 feet tall, dressed in metallic cloth
  of a very fine texture. Each body was bandaged in a manner similar to the blackout suits used by speed flyers and test
  pilots.
</p>
<p>According the Mr. <span class="caviar">XXXXXXX</span> informant, the saucers were found in New Mexico due to the fact
  that the Government has a very high-powered radar set-up in that area and it is believed the radar interferes with the
  controling mechanism of the saucers.
</p>
<p>No further evaluation was attempted by SA<span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXX</span> concerning the above.</p>
