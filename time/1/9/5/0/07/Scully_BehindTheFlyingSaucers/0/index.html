<p>We are publishing Behind The Flying Saucers because we believe it to be an exciting, timely, and straightforward
  interpretation of one of the strangest phenomenon in modern times. It is obvious, of course, that any discussion of
  flying saucers from whatever point of view is bound to be controversial. This book is no exception, for Frank Scully&#39;s
  conclusions as to the nature of these craft differ sharply from those held officially by the Department of
  Defense. </p>
<p>However, we are as convinced as any thoughtful publisher can be that Mr. Scully has approached his subject with
  probity and has interpreted the facts and figures given him with care and caution. In writing this book he has had
  extensive interviews and assistance from scientists and other experts in such fields as magnetic energy, astronomy,
  and aerodynamics men who are reputedly high in their profession but some of whose names, as will be apparent in
  reading this book, must be kept anonymous. </p>
<p>We, like most people, including Mr. Scully, have never seen a flying saucer. But from the mass of evidence as
  reported in the press and magazines by reputable persons, there is much reason to believe that they actually do exist.
  What they are, where they come from, or how they fly, we do not presume to know. Mr. Scully attempts to answer some of
  these questions and we&#39;re sure that you&#39;ll find his answers both fascinating and provocative. We did.</p>
