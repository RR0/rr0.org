<p>THOUGH THERE WERE stories printed to the effect that the Air Force had released just about everything it had gathered
  in the two years it operated Project Saucer, the nearest most peasants like ourselves came to such a feast of reason
  was a seven-thousand-word digest of preliminary studies released on April 27, 1949, by the Air Materiel Command at
  Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio.</p>
<p>Project Saucer was officially activated on January 22, 1948. It released its digest of preliminary studies fifteen
  months later. It declared itself officially "discontinued" on December 27, 1949. But on April 4, 1950, it admitted
  that it had continued and would continue to receive and evaluate "through normal field intelligence channels any
  substantial reports of any unusual aerial phenomena."</p>
<p>This was the first official admission of a charge I made in January, 1950 that "Project Saucer had not closed down
  but only had dummied up." Its April 4 release admitted it had decentralized the chase.</p>
<p>As a further example of how badly synchronized these top level characters can become, on April 4, in a statement from
  Key West, wherein the President was dragooned into blowing down David Lawrence&#39;s story about flying saucers,
  Charles G. Ross, White House Secretary, told correspondents he would take their morning questions and report back with
  answers in the afternoon. He did so. He quoted Rear Admiral Robert L. Dennison as saying he knew nothing of the flying
  saucer. Then he had Brigadier General Robert B. Landry, the President&#39;s Air Force aide, explain that the Air Force
  had set up a project in December, 1947, and had "carried on this project until last August, 1949 when it made a final
  report there was nothing to these flying saucers."</p>
<p>The fact that the project did not cease until four months after General Landry said it was closed down and the
  further fact that it had opened a month after he said it had opened in December, 1947 are samples of how little team
  work or accuracy there is between the members of this team.</p>
<p>While it would have been nice to have had all the cards on the table, especially since the Department of Defense
  insisted it was not conducting experiments "classified or otherwise" with disk-shaped flying objects, nevertheless I
  suppose we should be thankful for the crumbs that have been allowed to drop from the banquet table.</p>
<p>In the first place let me say for a report of this character that the Air Materiel Command&#39;s Digest was supremely
  well-written, and aside from such typographical errors as the spelling of Henry Holt and Company as "Holte," Mt.
  Rainier as "Ranier," splitting infinitives, and such trivia, the report had a feeling of substance. It begins with the
  famous case of Kenneth Arnold, who on Tuesday, June 24, 1947, looked from his private plane and spotted a chain of
  nine saucer-like objects playing tag with the jagged peaks of Washington&#39;s Mt. Rainier.</p>
<p class="c1 c4">Arnold&#39;s report set off what the Air Force&#39;s literary arm described as "a veritable celestial
  chain reaction." Flying saucers were followed by reports of chromium hub-caps whirling through space, flying dimes,
  flying teardrops, flying gaslights, flying ice cream cones, and flying pie plates.</p>
<p>It seems more fantastic than the fantastic reports that the Air Force could set up a Project Saucer if it had no more
  than this sort of fluff to begin with. Nevertheless, as it rounded the turn toward the home stretch in the spring of
  1949, it revealed that it had looked into 240 domestic and 30 foreign incidents. With the assistance of government and
  private agencies and the entire facilities of Wright Field laboratories, the Project Saucer personnel said that in
  fifteen months they had identified about thirty per cent of the 270 cases under survey as being nothing more than
  conventional aerial objects-such as weather balloons, guided missile research activities, astronomical phenomena,
  commercial and military aircraft in unscheduled flights, migratory birds, shots from flare guns, practical jokers,
  victims of optical illusions, and phenomena of mass hallucinations. The official prognosis was that equally
  commonplace explanations would take care of at least another thirty per cent of these riddles of the sky.</p>
<p>But as of that spring day of 1949 Air Materiel Command Intelligence still admitted there were question marks in the
  saucer story. The possibility of technical development far in advance of the knowledge available to American engineers
  and scientists had been widely considered. That the saucers might be visitations from Mars, Venus, or distant planets
  attached to other star systems was looked upon by Air Materiel Command Intelligence as "an almost complete
  impossibility."</p>
<p>That, you will observe on re-reading, is not quite the same as saying "an impossibility." "Almost" is a little
  loop-hole, but if a flying saucer slipped through it, Air Materiel Command Intelligence could point to the fact that
  it had never quite closed the door.</p>
<p>Another cautious summary was this:</p>
<p>"While Project Saucer evaluation teams report that no definite and conclusive evidence is yet available to either
  prove or disprove the existence of at least some of the remaining unidentified objects as real aircraft of unknown and
  unconventional configuration. exhaustive investigations have turned up no alarming probabilities."</p>
<p>As thin as that line was between life or death for flying saucers, thirty-four cases were left dangling in space,
  unidentified, unexplained, unburied when Project Saucer was officially closed December 27, 1949.</p>
<p>From the Digest of Air Materiel Command Intelligence, it is not possible for a detached observer to tell whether they
  believed they had identified Kenneth Arnold&#39;s nine flying saucers or not. At least three years after Arnold first
  reported the flying saucers he still maintained his position and has probably been more overwhelmed with reports of
  like character than any other civilian on earth.</p>
<p>His story is simplicity itself. He dealt in fire-control equipment and covered the Northwest in his private plane. On
  June 24, 1947, he saw the reflection of a bright flash on his wing, he looked around and caught a chain of nine
  peculiar aircraft approaching Mt. Rainier. They flew like geese in a diagonal line as if they were linked together.
  They flew close to the mountaintops. He judged them to be about the size of a DC-4. They were approximately twenty or
  twenty-five miles away, near enough for him to see if they had tails, but he couldn&#39;t see a tail on any of them.
  He watched them for about three minutes. They were flat like a pie pan and so shiny they reflected the sun like a
  mirror. He clocked their speed at about 1,200 miles per hour.</p>
<p>"I never saw anything so fast," he told investigators.</p>
<p>Air Materiel Command Intelligence put Professor Joseph A. Hynek, head of the Ohio State University Observatory, to
  work on the Arnold report. Dr. Hynek was under contract with Air Materiel Command to check on the astrophysicist
  phases of Project Saucer. Dr. Hynek thought the objects were traveling at subsonic speed and were therefore some sort
  of known aircraft.</p>
<p>Arnold had stated that they were traveling at 1,200 miles per hour, which would make them definitely supersonic.</p>
<p>I take it that Air Materiel Intelligence screens even its astronomers. Had it found itself saddled with Dr. Walter
  Lee Moore,</p>
<p>astronomer of the University of Louisville, instead of Dr. Hynek of Ohio State University, it might have got a
  different story about flying saucers. Dr. Moore reported that he personally focused his telescope on several flying
  disks. They headed straight toward Venus. Venus was nearer to the sun-in its pirogee phase. The day was clear. In fact
  the planet could have been seen that day during the daytime with the naked eye.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Moore the disks headed straight toward Venus on the return trip. This led him to suspect that as
  little as we know of what is going on behind those Venusian cloudbanks, Venus was the point of origin of those flying
  saucers which he saw and those which Kenneth Arnold saw.</p>
<p>But Aero-Medical Laboratory men instead of Dr. Moore were called in by Air Materiel Command Intelligence to needle
  Arnold&#39;s story. They stated that an object traveling at 1,200 miles per hour would not be visible to the naked
  eye.</p>
<p>But Arnold didn&#39;t say he looked at them with a naked eye, and the Aero-Medical Laboratory men, who of course were
  not up there with Arnold, never reported how fast Arnold&#39;s eyes might be at spotting objects twenty-five miles
  away and possibly scooting by him as he jogged along at 200 miles per hour. They never checked on Dr. Moore&#39;s
  either. In fact as far as I could find, Air Materiel Command Intelligence never evaluated, and, if so, never released
  Dr. Moore&#39;s report at all.</p>
<p>Among the filed-and-forgotten of Air Materiel Command Intelligence&#39;s "Unidentified File" was the Captain Thomas
  F. Mantell case, which everybody tried a hand at explaining until the scientist at the University of Denver came up
  with the real answer-magnetic disintegration at the hand of some intelligence which understands both magnetic
  propulsion and magnetic destruction.</p>
<p>Other cases which I presume Air Materiel Command Intelligence never solved-at least they were not solved in the
  unclassified handout which gentlemen of the press, ladies of the evening, or anybody could have for the asking-run to
  quite a formation, but the following few give you the general idea.</p>
<p>Listed as perhaps their most fantastic saucer story, the Air Materiel Command gave its version of the space ship
  reported by two Eastern Airline pilots in the skies near Montgomery, Alabama, in July, 1948. The same object was
  reported by ground observers at Robins Air Force Base at Macon, Georgia, about an hour before the commercial pilots
  sighted it above Montgomery. All the reports agreed the space ship was going in a southerly direction, that various
  colored flames were trailing from it and that it maneuvered with great speed.</p>
<p>The Eastern Airline pilots were Captain C. S. Chiles and John B. Whitte. They described the object as "a wingless
  aircraft a hundred feet long, cigar-shaped, and about twice the diameter of a B-29, with no protruding surfaces."</p>
<p>They both saw it at the same time and asked each other what in the world was this? It flashed toward them and they
  veered to the left. It veered to its left and passed them about 700 feet to their right. At this point it was above
  them.</p>
<p>"Then, as if the pilot had seen and wanted to avoid us," Chiles testified to investigators, "it pulled up with a
  tremendous burst of flame from the rear and zoomed into the clouds, its prop wash or jet wash rocking our DC3."</p>
<p>Captain Chiles said the illumination inside the craft itself reminded one of the brilliance of a magnesium flare.</p>
<p>From the side of the craft came an intense blue glow that ran the entire length of the fusilage-like a blue
  fluorescent factory light. The exhaust was a red-orange flame, which extended thirty to fifty feet behind the craft
  and became deeper in intensity as the unidentified ship pulled up into a cloud. The commercial pilots judged its speed
  to be about one-third faster than a jet&#39;s, which would mean about 800 miles per hour.</p>
<p>In their investigation of the Chiles-Whitte story Project Saucer personnel screened 225 civilian and military flight
  schedules and found the only other aircraft in the vicinity at the time was an Air Force C-47.</p>
<p>At this point came one of those impressive but bewildering contributions from Air Materiel Command Intelligence.</p>
<p>"Application of the Prandtl theory of lift to the incident indicated of the fusilage of the dimension reported by
  Chiles and Whitte could support a load comparable to the weight of an aircraft of this size at flying speeds in the
  subsonic range."</p>
<p>What in heaven&#39;s name does that mean? This is a digest of a report from one branch of the people to another
  branch of the people, but it certainly doesn&#39;t sound as though it were written by the people. The only possible
  clew as to what all this has to do with the case is that remark about "subsonic range," and even that doesn&#39;t seem
  quite bright. The commercial pilot said that the space ship was traveling about one-third faster than a jet. Jets can
  go faster than sound. Certainly a ship traveling one-third faster than even a common jet would be doing at least 800
  m.p.h., and that&#39;s not subsonic; that&#39;s seventy miles per hour faster than sound.</p>
<p>But Prandtl, his theory, subsonic or supersonic to the contrary, Air Materiel Command left the object on April 27,
  1949, as "still considered `Unidentified.&#39; "</p>
<p>Those southern skies in fact seem to have had almost as many reports of flying saucers as Oregon and New Mexico.
  Early in August, 1947, two pilots from Bethel, Alabama, told investigators that they spotted a huge black object which
  seemed bigger than a C-54. It stood out against a brilliant evening sky.</p>
<p>To avoid collision, the pilots had to pull up to 1,200 feet. The object crossed their path at right angles. They
  swung in behind and followed at 170 m.p.h. until it left them far behind and about four minutes later disappeared from
  sight.</p>
<p>Though described as resembling a C-54, this was a very general and somewhat erroneous classification. The two pilots
  further qualified the description by saying it was "without motors, wings, or visible means of propulsion, and was
  smooth surfaced and streamlined."</p>
<p>By way of closing the case, Air Materiel Command Intelligence concluded not without anticlimactic humor, "No balloons
  were reported in the area."</p>
<p>The famous case of Lieutenant George F. Gorman of the North Dakota National Guard, and his twenty-seven-minute dog
  fight with a flying saucer above Fargo, is recapitulated in the Air Materiel Command Digest of its preliminary
  studies, but this one doesn&#39;t even come out with the consoling words "still considered unidentified."</p>
<p>Gorman, a solid character, manager of a Fargo construction company was preparing to land at the Fargo airport on the
  night of October 1, 1948, after a routine F-51 patrol flight. Cleared by the tower to land, Gorman asked if there were
  anything in his way, because he saw what appeared to be the tail light of another plane a 1,000 yards away. The tower
  told him there was a Piper Cub below him, and that was all. He could see that clearly enough, but that was not what he
  was alluding to.</p>
<p>He decided to close in and take a look at the mystery light a 1,000 yards ahead of him. It was small, clear and
  white, and it kept blinking on and off. As he approached, however, the light became sharp and steady and pulled into a
  sharp left bank.</p>
<p>"I thought it was making a pass at the tower," Lieutenant Gorman reported. "I dived after it and brought my manifold
  pressure up to 60 inches, but I couldn&#39;t catch up with the thing. It started gaining altitude and made another
  left turn."</p>
<p>Lieutenant Gorman put his F-51 into a sharp turn, and tried to cut the light off in its attempt to turn. By then they
  were 7,000 feet up. The light made a sharp right turn, and they were headed straight at each other. When they were
  about to collide, Gorman guessed he got scared.</p>
<p>"I went into a dive," he said, "and the light passed over my canopy at about 500 feet. Then, it made a left circle at
  about 1,000 feet above, and I gave chase again."</p>
<p>It looked as if they were headed for another collision, when this time it was a case of the light that failed. The
  object shot straight into the air. Lieutenant Gorman went after it to 14,000 feet, when his plane went into a power
  stall, and the lighted object turned to a northwest direction and disappeared.</p>
<p>The lieutenant reached his home field pretty worn out after that twenty-seven-minute chase, at speeds varying from
  300 to 400 m.p.h.</p>
<p>Had the lieutenant come with this story on his own, he probably would have found it subsequently explained away by
  some psychiatrist consulted by Air Materiel Command Intelligence as just another man with another hallucination. But
  it so happened that the airport traffic controller at Fargo, L. D. Jensen, reported that he had watched the mystery
  light through a pair of binoculars, and while Gorman and Jensen could possibly both be wrong, two don&#39;t quite make
  a "mass hysteria."</p>
<p>Jensen said he was unable to distinguish any form other than what appeared to be the tail light of a very fast moving
  craft. Lieutenant Gorman, who was a pilot instructor for French military students during the Second World War, said he
  was sure there was an intelligence behind the maneuvers, and that it was limited by intelligence, too, because it was
  unable to make turns beyond the natural curves. That it could out-turn and out-speed the F-51 was also conceded. He
  doubted if many earth-born pilots could have withstood the turn and speed affected by the light without blacking
  out.</p>
<p>Except for raising a psychological question-Is it possible for an object without appreciable shape or known
  aeronautical configurations to appear to travel at variable speeds and maneuver intelligently?-Air Materiel Command
  Intelligence left Lieutenant Gorman and his light pretty much in the dark.</p>
<p>Again the answer to this one may be in the hands of the magnetic research engineers, scientists who seemingly were
  not consulted in the manufacture of this brochure.</p>
<p>From saucers six or eight inches in diameter, to those seeming to have the bulk of B-29&#39;s and the speed three
  times that of jets, the Air Force had its troubles clearing up that "Unidentified" file.</p>
<p>One more incident and I am done with Air Materiel Command&#39;s unsolved mysteries. This one took place 5,000 feet
  above sea level in the Cascade Mountains, where one Fred M. Johnson,</p>
<p>a prospector, told of spotting five or six disks about thirty feet in diameter. He grabbed his telescope and watched
  the disks for fifty seconds while they banked in the sun. While the disks were in sight, the hand of his compass watch
  "weaved wildly from side to side."</p>
<p>Here was another magnetic clew, but like the solution of its other mysteries Air Materiel Command Intelligence, was
  leaning heavily on astronomers or psychiatrists and having no part of the Velikovskys, Einsteins, or Newtons, who had
  decided that this earth and all other planets in our solar system were just big dynamos governed by electromagnetic
  energy.</p>
<p>"To sum up," Air Materiel Command Technical Intelligence Division stated, "no definite conclusive evidence is yet
  available, that would prove or disprove the possibility that a portion of the unidentified objects are real aircraft
  of unknown or unconventional configuration."</p>
<p>The Digest concluded: "There are scores of possible explanations for the scores of different types of sighting
  reporters. Many of the aerial phenomena have been positively identified. However, the correct tagging of the remaining
  percentage is still the job of Project Saucer. The saucers are not a joke. Neither are they a cause for alarm to the
  population. Many of the incidents already have answers. Meteors. Balloons. Falling stars. Birds in flight. Testing
  devices, etc. Some of them still end in question marks. It is the mission of the Air Material Command Technical
  Intelligence Division&#39;s Project Saucer to supply the periods."</p>
<p>There must have been a high priority on punctuation marks between 1947 and 1950, because as late as May, 1950, months
  after Project Saucer was officially closed (but still operating unofficially on local levels), nobody in the
  Department of Defense, from the unidentified spokesman of Air Materiel Command Technical Intelligence up to Defense
  Secretary Louis Johnson himself, ever supplied those periods.</p>
