<p>9 "SAUCERS" FLYING 1200 MPH SIGHTED-BUT WHAT ARE THEY?</p>
<p>Pendleton, Ore. June 25 (AP) Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine shiny objects flying at 1,200 miles an hour over the
  Cascade range of Western Washington. The objects were bright and saucer-like, flying at 10,000 feet altitude. When
  first sighted they were approximately 25-30 miles away, and flying north.</p>
<p>June 29, 1947: Los Angeles Daily News</p>
<p>MANY REPORT SEEING FLYING SAUCERS</p>
<p>White Sands Proving Ground, N. M. June 28 (UP) The Kenneth Arnold report of seeing nine objects which flew like
  flying saucers and supported by other residents in the Northwest area as having seen flying objects, was discounted by
  Air Force officers in New Mexico. Lt. Col. Harold R. Turner, commanding officer of the Army&#39;s rocket proving
  ground, said the disks must have been jet airplanes.</p>

<p>AIR FORCE PROBES "FLYING DISKS" MYSTERY; HITS MISSILE THEORY</p>
<p>Wright Field, Ohio, July 3 (INS) Officers of the air research and development section of the AAF&#39;s Air Materiel
  Command were asked by General Carl Spaatz, the Army&#39;s air commander, to try to ascertain what the disks are. Lt.
  William C. Anderson, public relations officer at the field, said: "So far we haven&#39;t found anything to confirm
  that the disks exist. We don&#39;t think they are guided missiles." He said as things were they now appear to be
  either a phenomenon or figment of somebody&#39;s imagination.</p>

<p>AIRLINE PILOT SIGHTS FLYING DISK CLUSTER Boise, Idaho, July 4 (AP) Captain Smith, United Airlines pilot, with
  co-pilot, First Officer Stevens, reported "three to five" disks at an altitude of 7,500 feet, 15 miles southwest of
  Ontario, Oregon. The first photograph taken of the mystery saucers was claimed by Yeoman Frank Ryman. Ryman&#39;s
  estimate was that the saucer was 9,000 to 10,000 feet in the air and traveling 500 m.p.h.</p>

<p>INVENTOR&#39;S TEST OF "FLYING SAUCERS" HERE IN 1928 BARED</p>
<p>Leo Bentz, one time builder of automobiles, said that he and a friend saw a confidential demonstration of saucer-like
  flying model in Griffith Park in 1928. The inventor was George de Bay interested in a new principle for airplanes. De
  Bay produced drawings showing designs of contrivance that would skip through the air like a flat stone-an upside down
  saucer that worked on a vacuum principle requiring ten times less power for propulsion. Inventor de Bay, it is
  believed, may have gone to Russia. July 5, 1947: Los Angeles Examiner</p>

<p>FLYING SAUCERS NO JOKE, AIR FORCE SAID TO HAVE FOUND AFTER INQUIRY</p>
<p>Dayton, Ohio, April 26 (UP) The Air Force has not ruled out the possibility that the flying saucers are foreign
  aircraft. They have assigned a crew of technical intelligence agents of the Air Materiel Command to track down reports
  of the mysterious object. A total of 240 domestic and 30 foreign incidents of saucers reported have been investigated.
  Thirty per cent of these found to be due to conventional objects such as weather, meteors, and cosmic ray research
  balloons. Commonplace answers are expected to be found for thirty per cent and the remaining forty per cent are still
  a mystery, the journal Herald said. "It is believed very unlikely that any other nation of the earth could have
  knowledge so far above the level of ours."</p>

<p>White Sands Proving Grounds, N. M. August 29. Flying saucers or at least some mysterious objects seen by the service
  personnel at this center were reported today. One officer believes the objects were space ships. Weather balloon,
  familiar to observer, was therefore disqualified. Observation made through a photo theodolite, showed ship to be

<p>NEW THEORY HINTED-"FLYING SAUCERS" ARE REALLY REAL</p>
<p>Flying saucers are real objects not figments of imagination, reports Daily Mirror. They may even be from some other
  planet.</p>
<p>Basis for the conclusion apparently was that enough evidence has been gathered from varied and far flung sources to
  blast the notion that "there&#39;s nothing to the flying saucers." October 12, 1949: Variety (New York)</p>

<p>"FLYING SAUCER" MYTH BLOWN SKY HIGH BY AIR FORCE STUDY</p>
<p>Washington, December 28 (UP) The Air Force has closed project saucer, because the 375 reports that the Air Force has
  made of the flying saucers show no verification whatever of the reports, and attributes the reports to
  "misinterpretation of conventional objects, a mild form of mass hysteria or hoaxes."</p>

<p>NO EVIDENCE-FLYING DISKS BRANDED "JOKE" BY AIR FORCE</p>
<p>Washington, December 27 (AP) Air Force said today that two years of investigation have convinced them that flying
  saucers are just a joke. It ordered ended a special "flying saucer" project which was set up in January, 1948. The
  announcement of its final report served as a denial of a story published by True Magazine, which said saucers were
  real and were from another planet. Analyses indicate flying objects are: (1) Misinterpretation of various conventional
  objects (2) a mild form of mass hysteria (3) or hoaxes.</p>

  space ships from another planet have come here." It further states: "Americans want their flying saucers and their men
  from Mars. They want their bugaboos and boogie men. They want their scandal and ordeals by fire. If the facts

<p>IS YOUR SAUCER VIEW DIM OR DIMMICK&#39;S?</p>
<p>Los Angeles, March 10 (AP) Ray L. Dimmick, a dynamite salesman, backtracked today. He said the flying saucer story
  was related to him by two business associates. All Dimmick actually saw, according to revised version, was a strip of
  metal about six feet long, eight inches wide, and three-quarters of an inch thick. Dr. Vallarta, Mexico&#39;s leading
  nuclear scientist, stated that the saucer-seers were viewing balloons released by the U. S. Weather stations along the

<p>For the third consecutive day flying saucers have been reported over Farmington. And on each of the three days their
  arrival was reported between 11 A.M. and noon. Fully half of this town&#39;s population is certain today that it saw
  space ships or some strange aircraft-hundreds of them-zooming through the skies yesterday. Whatever they were, they
  caused a major sensation in this community, which lies only 110 air miles northwest of the</p>
<p>huge Los Alamos atomic installation. One witness who took a triangulation sighting on one of the objects estimated
  its speed at about 1,000 miles an hour, and estimated its size as approximately twice that of a B-29.</p>
<p>March 18, 1950: Las Vegas Daily Optic Editorial titled: GIVE US THE FACTS Yesterday hundreds of reliable, sober
  people in Farmington saw "something" in the skies. At least half believe what they saw was an armada of space ships.
  Others saw something they never saw before, but won&#39;t venture a guess as to what it was. And still others say that
  what was seen was cotton, or jet planes or some other familiar object. The American population is not composed chiefly
  of children or idiots. Most of us are adults who are willing to embrace new concepts of time and space without panic.
  Attempts to keep the public in the dark invariably have hurt the general welfare, not helped it. We can say, however,

<p>New York, April 3 (UP) Flying saucers actually are two types of top-secret U. S. military inventions, radio
  commentator Henry</p>
<p>J. Taylor said. The real facts are good news for the nation. One type a disk that whizzes through space, halts
  suspended in the air, soars to 30,000 feet and more, drops to 1,000 feet and then usually disintegrates in the air.
  Saucers are harmless, pilotless disks-20 inches to 250 feet in diameter. The other objects are Flying Phantoms, XF5U,
  jet propelled.</p>
<p>"The Navy is not experimenting with or doing research on any type of plane or guided missile that resembles in any
  way a flying saucer." (quote by Navy spokesman) The XF5U-1 was unsuccessful and never flown.</p>
<p>It was June 25, 1947, commentator H. J. Taylor said, that saucer experiments began, and they have been expanded
  constantly ever since. (The Air Force denied Taylor&#39;s story.) These words, Taylor says are stenciled on the back
  of every real saucer: "Anyone damaging or revealing description or whereabouts of this missile is subject to

  saucers: "There is no intention of reopening Project Saucer, an Air Force Special project officially closed three
  months ago. However the Air Force has and will continue to receive and evaluate through normal field intelligence
  channels any substantial reports of any unusual aerial phenomena."</p>

<p>GRIFFITH PARK DIRECTOR SCOFFS AT FLYING DISKS</p>
<p>Just their imagination, says Dr. Dinsmore Alter, Director of the Griffith Park Observatory. "Flying saucers are all
  kinds of</p>
<p>imagination-flavored things-but they certainly aren&#39;t space ships from Mars." He goes further to state that "The
  saucers just are `ordinary phenomena,&#39; twisted by untrained observers, whose reading and discussions about the
  possibility of space travel lead them to interpret some of what they see on high as saucers."</p>

<p>FLYING ORANGE SPOTTED IN SKIES: Disk, Too, Seen Performing Aerial Antics</p>
<p>A woman called the Rocky Mountain News reporting that she saw an object completely round except that it was silver
  and gray in color instead of orange. It was spinning in a conventional flying disk manner. This object was sighted by
  four other persons. Another object sighted in the same area was disk-like in shape, but not round as the orange one
  reported.</p>

<p>REACTIONARY HOLD OUT AGAINST SAUCERS THAT FLY by Max Hamilton. Hamilton states that if there were flying saucers they
  would have to originate either on the earth or elsewhere in the universe. The latter, he feels, is preposterous. "Not
  even atomic fission, the most sensational discovery in history, burst full blown upon the world. The possibilities of
  it were discussed generations before. But no reputable aeronautical engineer has ever suggested that a saucer-shaped
  vehicle would be a wonderful new way of conquering the air," further states Hamilton.</p>
<p>April 7, 1950: Denver Post ANOTHER DISK GUESS "It isn&#39;t hard at all to explain the flying `saucer,"&#39; writes
  Cornelius Donovan, of New York City. "It is a `secret&#39; project of an earth government, namely the United States of
  America. . . - Quite understandably, government officials deny having anything to do with the `flying saucer&#39;
  method of taking the American taxpayer for a ride through the stratosphere! Could they be just a bit ashamed, by any
  chance?"</p>
<p>April 7, 1950: Los Angeles Daily News "FLYING CANDLES" ARE THE LATEST El Centro, April 7 (UP) Several residents
  reported seeing hundreds of lights hovering over the city. Some moved fast-others more slowly-before disappearing.</p>

<p>EXPERT SAYS FLYING SAUCERS U. S. MILITARY SECRET</p>
<p>Montvale, N. J. April 7 (UP) Willy Ley, one of the world&#39;s outstanding authorities on rockets and flight above
  the stratosphere, said he firmly believed that the flying saucers have been winging across the U. S. He said they are
  not rocket-propelled. The U. S. might very probably have learned how to send disks soaring over the nation in
  controlled flight. He gives three possibilities: (1) They are a U. S. military secret, (2) They are the secret of some
  foreign power, or (3) The flying saucers are from another planet. Ley&#39;s personal opinion is that the flying
  saucers are a U. S. military secret.</p>

<p>Washington, D. C. Quotes from the U. S. News and World Report, also Ken Purdy, editor of True, which published the
  two articles written by Donald Keyhoe and Commander McLaughlin. "You are quite correct in saying that the flying
  saucers exist," Lawrence quoted Purdy as saying. "Of course they do, and I think no one can properly write this story
  without reference to the fact that we first made the statement in December 1949." Lawrence added, that "clearly
  something is lacking to explain what the competent Air Force flyers wrote in reporting their observations of the
  flying saucers-which reports are reposing in official files and have never been made</p>

<p>VIEWER BREAKS SILENCE TO TELL OF L. A. SAUCER Denver, April 9, Denver Post Special. One Denver flying-saucer-viewer
  broke a ten month silence Saturday to describe what he says must surely have been a flying saucer he viewed one
  afternoon last July in Los Angeles. Mr. J. S. Stankavage, a retired painter, said he kept quiet because "my wife and I
  were afraid if I said anything about it people would accuse me of `seeing&#39; things." Stankavage said the
  heart-shaped object he saw appeared to have two portholes along the side. It did not spin, but moved with the point of
  the heart headed forward.</p>

<p>THOSE FLYING SAUCERS: ARE OR AREN&#39;T THEY? by Joseph Nolan.</p>
<p>In a by-lined story spreading over four columns the Times recapitulated stories of the flying saucers. Everybody had
  been left puzzled, including the President and many guesses were made.</p>

<p>SCORCHED BOY INSISTS HE TOUCHED SAUCER Amarillo, Tex., April 9 (UP) David Lightfood, 12, sighted what was at first
  thought to be a balloon, but turned out to be an object about the same circumference as an automobile tire, and about
  18 inches thick. It was rounded on the bottom with a top resembling a flat plate. He barely touched it when he claimed
  it was slick like a snake and hot. It was blue-gray in color and had no opening other than the divided section. There
  was some release of gas or spray when the object took off, which turned his arms and face bright red, causing welts. A
  younger boy of 9 confirmed this story.</p>
<p>April 10, 1950: The Salinas Sun SALINAN SPOTS FLYING SAUCER Lindsborg, April 10. P. E. Patchin of Lindsborg, said he
  saw a gray-white, clam-shaped object streaking across the sky near</p>
<p>Lindsborg at 11:30 A.M. Wednesday. The object was visible to him for about five and one-third miles. It made no
  noise, and according to Patchin&#39;s mathematical calculations, it was heading southwest at about 650 miles per hour
  and at an altitude of two miles.</p>

<p>LINKS FLYING DISKS WITH MYSTERY SUB</p>
<p>Boise, Idaho, April 10 (UP) Kenneth Arnold is again in the news. Arnold believes there is a link between the flying
  saucers and the mysterious submarines reported off the U. S. coastline. He agrees with those who think that the
  strange aircraft might be space ships from another planet.</p>

<p>CHROMELIKE "SAUCER" SEEN OVER MONTEREY Monterey, April 10 (AP) A chromelike flying saucer was spotted here today by
  seven persons. It was cruising at a high rate of speed over Monterey. The object was 30 feet in diameter and was at an
  altitude of approximately 4,000 feet.</p>
<p>April 14, 1950: Los Angeles Daily News FLYING DISK DESIGNED 23 YEARS AGO Monterey, Calif., April 14 (UP) Alexander G.
  Weygers, a mechanical engineer and architect, designed a "discopter" 23 years ago. The patented designs for this gas
  or jet powered craft were rejected by Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corp. in April, 1945 as being "too advanced."</p>

<p>TEXANS REPORT SEEING FLYING BANANA-SYMINGTON POOH-POOHS IT</p>
<p>Dallas, Tex., April 19 (UP) Bewildered Texans today sought an explanation for flying saucers, flying bananas, and
  even a dinner plate which they thought they saw in the sky. Hundreds saw them, in Fort Worth, Austin, and Clarendon as
  well as Dallas.</p>
<p>Ira Maxey, a Fort Worth veteran of 3,600 hours of Air Force flying, produced pictures of curved banana-like objects
  which he photographed. He said they left vapor trails. Air Force Secretary Symington, who wasn&#39;t in Texas, but in
  San Francisco at the time, said "there is nothing at all to such reports."</p>

<p>Fort Worth, Tex., April 20, 1950 (AP) The 8th Air Force still doesn&#39;t believe in flying saucers but its pilots
  will keep an eye out for "any unusual aerial phenomena" said a recent memorandum issued by 8th Air Force
  Headquarters.</p>

<p>RANCHER CAPTURES FLYING DISK: SAYS IT&#39;S NAVY PROPERTY</p>
<p>Douglas, Wyo., April 20 (UP) Everett Fletcher, a rancher, sighted a flying ball in the skies 32 miles north of here
  and followed it to the ground. Stamped on a name-plate was, "this scientific apparatus is the joint property of the U.
  S. Navy and the University of Minnesota. Made in Lexington, Kentucky." A telephone call to Minneapolis said it was a
  Navy instrument used for measuring cosmic rays. "Don&#39;t open it," a Naval officer warned. "Ship it here
  immediately, but don&#39;t touch it."</p>

<p>MAN CHASED BY FLYING SAUCER SHOWERING SPARKS</p>
<p>Lufkin, Tex., April 22 (UP) Jack Robertson, 28, a pharmacist graduated from the University of Texas, was motoring
  along Highway 94 west of town. He felt something following him. He stopped and got out of his car. An object
  approached, hovered 200 feet over him, turned a 50-degree angle and speeded off,</p>
<p>dropping sparks as it climbed. It whirled like a flying saucer. Five minutes later his face started burning. His
  experience changed his views about the nonexistence of flying saucers, Air Force or no Air Force.</p>

<p>CIVILIAN TRAINING IN ATOM DETECTION</p>
<p>"I believe," said Paul J. Larson, director of the Office of Civilian Mobilization of the National Security Resources
  Board, "it is essential that, insofar as it is possible, all of us tell the same story."</p>

<p>OIL BASIN FOLKS WONDER, DID THEY SEE FLYING SAUCERS?</p>
<p>Rangely, Colo., April 27 Seven persons including the Continental Oil Co. Superintendent A. W. Jay and his wife and
  daughter, said that they simultaneously saw a glowing object flash across the sky Thursday night in this northwestern
  Colorado oil town. Mr. and Mrs. Glen Holden saw one 50 to 75 feet away. It was circular and appeared to be covered
  with a "phosphorescent metallic paint." Also Ronnie Grisdale and Carley Cook, oil field workers, reported a "strange
  glow which seemed to hang in the sky." By their reports, one flew fast, one flew low, one stood still.</p>

<p>AIRLINER FLIRTS WITH A "DISK"; &#39;TWAS RED, ROUND AND GLOWING</p>
<p>South Bend, April 29 (Chicago Times, Special) Capt. Robert Adickes, a veteran TWA pilot, and several passengers said
  they saw a mysterious "round, glowing mass" in the air as they flew over South Bend Thursday night. "I used to laugh
  at all those flying saucer reports, but it&#39;s no laughing matter now," Adickes said. "I saw one." Adickes&#39;
  story was confirmed by First Officer Robert Manning and several of the 19 passengers aboard</p>
<p>and Christianity in no way excluded the possibility that God has created other groups of intelligent beings, who may
  or may not inhabit other planets. In fact the Bible tells us many times of a group of intelligent beings, called
  angels. It even records the visitations of a few of these beings to our earth. God has told us about the angels; there
  could be other beings He has created about which He has told us nothing. After all, there are some men who find it
  difficult to accept what He has told them.</p>
