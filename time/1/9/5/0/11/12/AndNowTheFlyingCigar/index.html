<p>In the North-West of England last Tuesday observers claim to have seen a "flying cigar."</p>
<p>Just before noon Mr. Edward Leslie Docker, director of a firm of wholesale fruiterers, reported seeing a huge
  cylindrical object from the window of his dockside office in Hindpool-road, Barrow-in-Furness. </p>
<p>"Out of the clouds to the west came a huge thing shaped like a cigar," he said. </p>
<p>"The ends looked darker than the centre, which was an aluminium colour.</p>
<p>"It was flying at about 4,000ft., and I estimated its length as about 100ft. It was moving through broken cloud at
  about 80 m.p.h."</p>
<p>Mr. John Clarke, of Geneva-street, Barrow, ex-R.A.F. man, also saw the object. "It was much too big for an
  aeroplane," he said. "It was tapered at each end."</p>
<p><strong>Saucer With Lights :</strong> In a letter to the <em>Sunday Dispatch</em> Mr. P. D. Bell, 23-year-old civil
  engineer with an honours degree in technical science, says that at Didsbury, Manchester, on Sunday he saw a strange
  aircraft approach and fly overhead at great speed. It was circular, a light shone from the underside, and it made no
  noise.</p>
<p><strong>A Green One :</strong> Inhabitants of Caruari, Northern Argentina, claim to have seen a "large round object
  of transparent green" circling the town. </p>
