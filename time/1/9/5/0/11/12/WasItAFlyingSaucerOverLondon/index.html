<p class="abstract">Following reports in last week's Sunday Dispatch of "flying saucers" over Devon, four men at London
  Airport say they saw last Sunday "something new and unknown" in the sky.</p>
<p>Each of the four is well qualified to make accurate observations of aerial phenomena.</p>
<p>This is the evidence :</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Fred Wikinson</strong>?Pan-American Airways operational staff man at Heathrow, five years R.A.F. flight
  engineer :</p>
<p>"About 7 o'clock last Sunday evening I was on the ramp supervising preparations for a Transatlantic flight when I saw
  a lighted body coming from east to west at terrific speed.</p>
<h2>'Not A Jet'</h2>
<p>"I thought at first it was a jet. But then I saw that its shape, light and presence of a blue flame from the tail
  made that impossible.</p>
<p>"It flew on a straight line. It did not describe a curve as a shooting star, comet, or rocket would. I put its speed
  at about 1,000 m.p.h."</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Patrick Joseph Maloney</strong>?ex-<a href="/org/uk/mod/RAF.html">R.A.F.</a> gunner for 5&frac12;
  years, at London Airport with Pan-American for 12 months after three years at Shannon :</p>
<p>"It was going east to west and much too close for a shooting star. It was a bright white light, metallic coloured,
  elongated, but as it went out of sight it seemed to become spherical. There was no noise."</p>
<h2>'Flat, Round'</h2>
<p><strong>Mr. Fred Perrier</strong>?ex-anti-aircraft gunner, aircraft and recognition spotter :</p>
<p>"It was cigarette-shaped when I first saw it. It was not a jet aircraft : nor was it a shooting star or comet ; it
  was not a firework.</p>
<p>"Before it dispappeared, it looked flat and round."</p>
<p><strong>Mr. E. Newman</strong>?American-Pan American Airways maintenance man, eight years in air service, ten months
  at London Airport :</p>
<p>"I put it as a bluish-green light, lasting for a few seconds. It travelled on a straight line. I'm dead sure it was
  no aircraft or meteor." </p>
