    arguments pour l'origine interplanétaire des soucoupes.</q></figcaption>

<p class="abstract">L'Air Force est aujourd'hui prête à admettre que de nombreuses observations de soucoupes et de
  boules lumineuses continuent à défier toute explication ; LIFE offre ici des preuves scientifiques qu'il existe une
  réelle possibilité de soucoupes interplanétaires.</p>
<p>Durant 4 ans le public américain s'est interrogé, inquiété ou [smirked] sur les contes étranges et insistants
  d'objets eerie fusant à travers le ciel américain. Généralement les contes ont seulement provoqué des frissons ou des
  [titters], mais seulement rarement, une réflexion et une analyse.</p>
<p>La semaine dernière l'U.S. Air Force a porté à la connaissance de LIFE les faits suivants :</p>
<ul>
  <li> Suite aux rapports continus de soucoupes volantes l'Air Force maintient une enqu&ecircêétude de renseignement
    constante des objets aériens non-identifiés.</li>
  <li>Une politique d'action positive a été adoptée pour découvrir, dès que possible, ce qui est responsable des
    observations qui ont été faites. Dans le cadre de cette étude, les appareils militaires sont altertés pour tenté des
    interceptions, et les équipement radar et photographiques seront utilisés pour tenter d'obtenir des données
    factuelles. Si l'opportunité en est donné, des tentatives seront faites pour récupérer de tels objets
    non-identifiés.</li>
  <li> Toutes les unités opérationnelles de l'Air Force ont déjà été alertées pour rapporter en détails toute
    observation d'objets aériens non-identifiés. D'autres groupes ? scientifiques, pilotes privés ou commerciaux,
    observateurs météo ? tous observateurs entraînés dont le travail touche de quelque façon au ciel, et quoi qu'il s'y
    passe, sont vivement incités à faire des rapports immédiats au <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">Centre
      de Renseignement Technique</a> de l'Air à <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB">Wright-Patterson AFB</a>, Dayton,
    Ohio de tout objet aérien non-identifié qu'il aient vu.
  </li>
  <li> Par la suite, pour la 1ère fois depuis le projet "Soucoupe" ait été modifié d'un projet de type spécial en une
    fonction standard du renseignement, en 1949-12, l'Air Force invite l'ensemble des citoyens à signaler leurs
    observations à l'installation de l'Air Force la plus proche. Tous les rapports recevront l'attention des experts et
    ceux d'un intérêt parêr feront l'objet d'enquêtes pouss&eês. L'identité de ceux faisant de tels rapports sera gardée
    confidentielle ; personne ne sera ridiculisé pour en avoir fait un.
  </li>
  <li> Il n'y a pour l'instant aucune raison de croire qu'aucun des phénomènes aériens régulièrement décrits comme des
    soucoupes volantes soient causées par une puissance étrangère ou constitue un danger clair et présent pour les
    Etats-Unis ou ses citoyens.</li>

<p>Ces révélations, sharply amending past Air Force policy, climaxed a review by LIFE, with Air Force officials, of all
  facts known in the case. This review has resulted from more than a year of sifting and weighting all reports of
  unexplained aerial phenomena ? from the so-called flying saucers to the mysterious green fireballs so often sighted in
  the Southwest (above ? main picture). This inquiry has included scrutiny of hundreds of reported sightings, interview
  with eyewitnesses across the country and careful reviews of the facts with some of the world's ablest physicists,
  astronomers, and experts on guided missiles. for the first time the Air Force (while in no way identifying itself with
  any particular conclusions) has opened its files for study.</p>
<p> Out of this exhaustive inquiry these propositions seem firmly shaped by the evidence:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Disks, cylinders and similar objects of geometrical form, luminous quality and solid nature for several years
    have been, and may be now, actually present in the atmosphere of the earth.</li>
  <li>Globes of green fire also, of a brightness more intense than the full moon's, have frequently passed through the
    skies.</li>
  <li>These objects cannot be explained by present science as natural phenomena ? but solely as artificial devices,
    created and operated by a high intelligence.</li>
  <li>Finally, no power plant known or projected on earth could account for the performance of these devices.</li>
</ol><p>Let us first review some widely known facts.</p>
<p> The shapes and inscrutable portents of the flying disks first broke upon the skies of the world in the early months
  of 1947, with several sightings reported to the Air Force. the story first reached the nation on June 24, 1947, when a
  private pilot named Kenneth Arnold was flying from Chehalis to Yakima, Wash. Some 25 miles away, Arnold saw nine
  "saucerlike things ... flying like geese in a diagonal chainlike line," approaching Mount Rainier. They swerved in and
  out of the high peaks at a speed Arnold estimated to be 1200 miles/h.</p>
<p> Arnold told the whole story to his hometown newspaper, and like summer lightning it flashed across the country.
  Within a month, saucers had been reported by people in 40 states. For the public (as LIFE itself merrily reported in
  its issue of July 21, 1947) the saucers provided the biggest game of hey-diddle-diddle in history. Any man, woman, or
  child with talent enough to see spots before his eyes could get his name in the newspaper.</p>
<figure class="left side">
  <strong>The initial Air Force explanation for this was that the pilots had seen a weather balloon radar target from
    nearby Maxwell AFB, just like they had claimed Roswell and all the 1947 saucer reports were explained by radar
    targets. Click here for one newspaper story. This "explanation" for the sighting was so absurd, it was quickly
    withdrawn. Later the claim was that the pilots had seen a meteor fireball.</strong>
</figure>
<p>Nevertheless in serious moments most people were a little worried by all the "chromium hubcaps," "flying washtubs"
  and "whirling doughnuts" in the sky. Buried in the heap of hysterical reports were some sobering cases. One was the
  calamity that befell Air Force Captain Thomas F. Mantell on Jan. 7, 1948. That afternoon Mantell and two other F-51
  fighter pilots sighted an object that looked like "<q>an ice-cream cone topped with red</q>" over Godman Air Force
  Base and Fort Knox, Ky. Mantell followed the strange object up to 20000 feet and disappeared. Later in the day his
  body was found in a nearby field, the wreckage of his plane scattered for a half mile around. It now seems possible
  that Mantell was one of the very few sighters who actually were deceived by a Skyhook balloon, but the incident is
  still listed as unsolved by the Air Force files.
</p>
<p>There was no such easy explanation for the strange phenomenon observed at 2:45 a.m. on July 24, 1948 by two Eastern
  Air Lines pilots. <a href="../../../../../../../../1948-07-24_Chiles_Whitted.html">Captain Clarence S. Chiles and
    Copilot John B. Whitted were flying in bright moonlight near Montgomery</a>, Ala. when they suddenly saw "<q>a
    bright glow"</q> and a "long rocketlike ship" veer past them. They subsequently agreed that it was a <q>"wingless
    aircraft, 100 feet long, cigar-shaped and about twice the diameter of a B-29, with no protruding surfaces, and two
    rows of windows ... From the sides of the craft came an intense, fairly dark blue glow ... like a fluorescent
    factory light."</q> They said the weird craft <q>"pulled up with tremendous burst of flame from the rear and zoomed
    into the clouds at about 800 miles an hour,</q>" rocking their DC-3 with its "<q>prop or jet wash</q>."
</p>
<p>Just as inexplicable was the experience of Lieut. George Gorman of the North Dakota Air National Guard. On Oct. 1,
  1948 Gorman was coming in at dusk to land his F-51 at Fargo, when he saw an intense, bright light pass 1000 yards
  away. Curious, Gorman followed the light and saw that it seemed to be attached to nothing. for 27 hair-raising minutes
  Gorman pursued the light through a series of intricate maneuvers. He said it was about 6 inches in diameter and going
  faster than his F-51 (300-400 mph). It made no sound and left no exhaust trail. After Gorman landed, the light having
  suddenly flashed away in the upper air, he found support for his story -- the chief of the control tower had followed
  the fantastic "combat" with binoculars.</p>
<p> The occurrences, jarring though they must have been to the participants, left the official calm of the Air Force
  unruffled. The project set up to investigate the saucers ("<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/sign/index.html">Project
    Sign</a>," known to the press as "Project Saucer") seemed to have been fashioned more as a sedative to public
  controversy than as a serious inquiry into the facts. On Dec. 27, 1949, after two years of operation, Project Saucer
  wrote off all reports of unidentified aerial phenomena as hoaxes, hallucinations or misinterpretations of familiar
  objects -- that is, all but 34. These stubborn 34, seemingly unexplainable, were briskly dismissed as psychological
  aberrations.
</p>
<p> While these assurances appeased most of the press and pacified the public, some elements in the Air Force just about
  this time began to worry a bit more seriously. Saucer reports continued to come in a rate of about one a day and were
  handled under the code name of "Project Grudge." Officers at policy level began to show concern. <q>"The higher you go
    in the Air Force,</q>" conceded one Intelligence officer, <q>"the more seriously they take the flying saucers."</q>
</p>
<p> There was good reason to be serious. As review of all records has shown, these years have produced literally dozens
  of incidents defying simple explanation -- and provoking the most incredible questions.</p>
<p> Checked and rechecked, 10 cases out of the formidable list on record are here presented in essential detail. Of
  these, three wee discovered in the course of LIFE's own investigation and are reported for the first time.</p>

  <h2>Incident 1</h2>
  <figure class="left side">
    <img alt="" src="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Lubbock/Lubbock_3.jpg"/>
    <figcaption> Les lumières de Lubbock, volant en formation, sont considérées par l'Air Force comme les phénomènes les
      plus inexplicables observés jusqu'ici. Ces photographies ont été faites à Lubbock, Texas le 30 août 1951, par Carl
      Hart Jr. Des scientifiques disent que les lumières n'étaient pas des objets naturels, mais qu'elles voyageaient
      trop vite et de manière trop silencieuse pour être des machines ê." Cela dépeint 3 d'une double rangée de lumière
      en forme de boomerang
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>["<a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Lubbock">Lumières de Lubbock</a>"] le <time>1951-08-25 21:10</time>,
    le Dr. W. I. Robinson, professeur de géologie à la Faculté de Technoloie du Texas, se tenait dans le jardin de sa
    maison à <span class="place">Lubbock (Texas)</span> et discutait avec 2 collègues. Les autres hommes étaient le Dr.
    A. G. Oberg, un professeur d'ingéniérie chimique, et le professeur W. L. Ducker, directeur du département
    d'ingéniérie pétrolifère. La nuit était claire et sombre. Soudain l'ensemble des 3 hommes vit un certain nombre de
    lumières foncer sans bruit à travers le ciel, d'horizon en horizon, en quelques secondes. the donna l'impression
    d'environ 30 perles lumineuses, arrangées en forme de croissant. Quelques instants plus tard une autre formation
    semblable fonça à travers la nuit. Cette fois les scientifiques purent juger que les lumières s'étaient déplacées
    sur 30 ° d'arc en 1 s. Une vérification le lendemain auprès de l'Air Force montra qu'aucun avion ne s'était trouvé
    au-dessus de la région à ce moment. This was but the beginning: Professor Ducker observed 12 flights of the luminous
    objects between August and November of last year. Some of his colleagues observed as many as 10. Hundreds of
    nonscientific observers in a wide vicinity around Lubbock have seen as many as three flights of the mysterious
    crescents in one night. On the night of Aug. 30 an attempt to photograph the lights was made by 18-year old Carl
    Hart Jr. He used a Kodak 35-mm camera at f 3.5, 1/10 of a second. Working rapidly, Hart managed to get five
    exposures of the flights. The pictures exhibited by Hart as the result of this effort show 18 to 20 luminous
    objects, more intense than the planet Venus, arranged in one or a pair of crescents. In several photographs, off to
    one side of the main flight, a larger luminosity is visible -- like a mother craft hovering near its aerial brood.

  </figure>
  <p>
    <strong>Evaluation </strong>: The observations have been too numerous and too similar to be doubted. In addition the
    Air Force, after the closest examination, has found nothing fraudulent about Hart's pictures. The lights are much
    too bright to be reflections, and therefore bodies containing sources of light. Since Professors Ducker, Oberg, and
    Robinson could not measure the size and distance of the formations, they could form no precise estimate of their
    speed. However they calculated that if the lights were flying at an altitude of 5000 feet they must then have been
    traveling about 1800 mph. The professors, along with other scientists, agree that in order to explain the silence of
    the objects, it must be assumed that they were at 50000 feet in the air; in which case they were going not 1800 but
    18000 mph. [Note: See follow-up letter from professors at end questioning authenticity of Hart's photos.]

<article>
  <h2>Incident 2</h2>
  <p>Le <time>1947-07-10 16:47</time>, one of the U.S.'s top astronomers was driving from Clovis to Clines Corners
    (Nouveau Mexique) [Note : Later revealed to be Dr. <span class="people">Lincoln La Paz</span> -- see Incident 10,
    green fireballs, which La Paz investigated.] His wife and his teen-aged daughters were also in the car. (For
    professional reasons he has asked LIFE to withhold identity.) It was a bright sunny day, but the whole western half
    of the sky was a "<q>confused cloud sea."</q> All at once, as the car headed toward these clouds, <q>"all four of us
      almost simultaneously became aware of a curious bright object almost motionless"</q> among the clouds. Instantly,
    from long habit in dealing with celestial phenomena, he began to make calculations. with what crude materials he had
    at hand. He held a pencil at arm's length, measured the size of the object against the windshield of the car,
    measured the distance between his eyes and the windshield, etc. His wife and two daughters did the same, each making
    independent calculations. The object, says the scientist, <q>"showed a sharp and firm regular outline, namely one of
      a smooth elliptical character much harder and sharper than the edges of the cloudlets... The hue of the luminous
      object was somewhat less white than the light of Jupiter in a dark sky, not aluminum or silver-colored.... The
      object clearly exhibited a sort of wobbling motion.... This wobbling motion served to set off the object as a
      rigid, if not solid body."</q> After 30 seconds in plain view, the ellipsoid moved slowly behind a cloud (273 °
    azimuth. élévation 1 °) <q>"and we thought we had lost it."</q> But approximately five seconds later it reappeared
    (275 ° azimuth, elevation 2 °). <q>"This remarkably sudden ascent thoroughly convinced me that we were dealing with
      an absolutely novel airborne device."</q> After reappearing, the object moved slowly from south to north across
    the clouds. <q>"As seen projected against these dark clouds, the object gave the strongest impression of
      self-luminosity."</q> About two and a half minutes after it first came into view, the thing disappeared finally
    behind a cloudbank.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Evaluation </strong>: The astronomer vouches for the approximate accuracy of his observations and
    computations. He determined that the object was not less than 20 nor more than 30 miles from his viewing point; that
    it was ellipsoidal and rigid; that it was 160 feet long and 65 feet thick, if seen at minimum distance; or 245 feet
    long and 100 feet thick if at maximum; and that its horizontal speed ranged between 120 and 180 mph and its vertical
    rise between 600 and 900 mph. He also observed that the object moved with a wobble, no sounds, and left no exhaust
    or vapor trail. His wife and daughters support his observations, and their computations were in accordance with his
    own, though slightly less conservative. The object's appearance and behavior answer no known optical or celestial
    phenomenon. No known or projected aircraft, rocket or guided missile can make such a rapid vertical ascent without
    leaving an exhaust or vapor trail.
  </p>
</article>
<section title="Incident 3">
  <p>Le <time>1949-04-24 10:20</time>, un groupe de 5 techniciens under the general supervision of J. Gordon Vaeth, an
    aeronautical engineer employed by the Office of Naval Research, were preparing to launch a Skyhook balloon near
    Arrey, N. Mex. A small balloon was sent up first to check the weather. Charles B. Moore Jr., an aerologist of
    General Mills Inc. (pioneers in cosmic ray research) was tracking the weather balloon through a theodolite -- a
    25-power telescopic instrument, which gives degrees of azimuth and elevation (horizontal and vertical position) for
    any object it is sighted on. At 10:30 a.m. Moore leaned back from the theodolite to glance at the balloon with his
    naked eye. Suddenly he saw a whitish elliptical object, apparently much higher than the balloon, and moving, in the
    opposite direction. At once he picked the object up in his theodolite at 45 degrees of elevation and 210 degrees of
    azimuth, and tracked it east at the phenomenal rate of 5 d of azimuth-change per second as it dropped swiftly to an
    elevation of 25 d. The Object appeared to be an ellipsoid roughly two and a half times as long as it was wide.
    Suddenly it swung abruptly upward and rushed out of sight in a few seconds. Moore had tracked it for about 60
    seconds altogether. The other members of his crew confirmed his report. No sound was heard, no vapor trail was seen.
    The object, according to rough estimations by Moore and his colleagues, was about 56 miles above the earth, 100 feet
    long and was traveling at seven miles per second. [Note: This is the same Charles B. Moore who is now debunking the
    Roswell UFO crash object of June/July 1947 as nothing more than one of his secret Mogul balloons that he helped
    launch.]</p>
  <p> EVALUATION. No known optical or atmospheric phenomenon fits the facts. A natural object traveling at seven miles
    per second has never been seen to make a sudden upward turn. There is no known or projected source of silent,
    vaporless power for such a machine. No human being could have borne the tremendous "G" load brought to bear on the
    craft during its abrupt vertical veer.</p>
</section>
<h3> Incident 4</h3>
<p> One night in the summer of 1948 Clyde W. Tombaugh, the discoverer of the planet Pluto, was sitting in the back yard
  of his home at Las, Cruces, N. Mex. With him were his wife and his mother-in-law. It was about 11 p.m. and they were
  all sitting quietly, admiring the clarity of the southwestern sky, like any proper astronomical family. All at once
  they all saw something rush silently overhead, south to north, too fast for a plane, too slow for a meteor. -It seemed
  to be quite low. All three of the witnesses agreed that the object was definitely a solid "ship" of a kind they had
  never seen before. It was of an oval shape and "seemed to trail off at the rear into a shapeless luminescence." There
  was a blue-green glow about the whole thing. About half a dozen "windows" were clearly visible at the front of the
  ship and along the side. They glowed with the same blue-green color as the rest of the ship, only the glare was
  brighter, and had a touch of yellow in it. [Note: Tombaugh also had two other UFO sightings] </p>
<p> EVALUATION. The object bore a resemblance to <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/ChilesWhitted">the craft
  seen by Pilots Chiles and Whitted</a>. It bore resemblance to no aircraft known to be in operation on earth.
</p>
<h3> Incident 5</h3>
<p>In this case LIFE's informant is an Air Force officer who holds a top military post at a key atomic base. [Note:
  Thought to be in New Mexico] Since his assignment and whereabouts must be kept a secret he has asked LIFE to withhold
  his name. He has the highest security rating given. Before he took his present assignment, this officer was in command
  of the radar equipment that keeps watch over a certain atomic installation. One day in the fall of 1949, while
  watching a radarscope that covered an area of sky 300 miles wide and 100,000 feet deep, he was startled to detect five
  apparently metallic objects flying south at tremendous speed and great height. They crossed the 300-mile scope, in
  less than four minutes. The objects flew the whole time in formation.</p>
<p>EVALUATION. There is no dead-certain explanation of this phenomenon--radar is as full of tricks as an old-maid's
  imagination. However, the officer involved is an experienced observer, well aware of the eccentricities of the
  instrument. He believes that in this instance he made a legitimate radar contact. If so, it can be said that the only
  natural objects known to travel at such a speed are meteors, but meteors do not fly in formation. If the officer
  picked up machines, they were performing in a manner that rocket experts agree is still beyond the capabilities of
  earth's most advanced weapons.</p>
<h3> Incident 6</h3>
<p> On May 29, 1951 at 3:48 p.m., three technical writers for the aerophysics department of North American Aviation's
  plant at Downey, outside Los Angeles, were chatting on the factory grounds. They were Victor Black, Werner Eichler and
  Ed J. Sullivan. All at once they stared at the sky. Sullivan describes what they saw: "Approximately 30 glowing,
  meteorlike objects sprayed out of the east at a point about 45 degrees above the horizon, executed a right-angle turn
  and swept across the sky in an undulating vertical formation ... that resembled a tuning fork on edge. It took each of
  them about 25 seconds to cross 90 degrees of the horizon before performing another right-angle turn westward toward
  downtown Los Angeles.... We estimated their diameter at 30 feet and their speed to be 1,700 mph. Each appeared as an
  intense electric blue light, round and without length. They moved with the motion of flat stones skipping across a
  smooth pond."</p>
<p> EVALUATION. No known natural or optical phenomenon, makes the peculiar light, in bright day, attributed to these
  objects by Sullivan and his colleagues; nor can any natural object, hurtling at such a speed, execute a right angle
  turn. As in the Moore theodolite sighting, the execution of such a turn would have crushed any human crew under the
  impact of "G" forces. Finally, of course, no known machine travels at 1,700 mph without making a sound or leaving an
  exhaust or vapor trail.</p>

<h3>Incident 7</h3>
<p>Le <time>1951-01-20 20:30</time>, le capitaine Lawrence W. Vinther of Mid-Continent Airlines was ordered by the
  control tower at the Sioux City airport, to investigate a "<q>very bright light</q>" above the field. He took off in
  his DC-3 with his copilot, James F. Bachmeier, and followed the light. All at once the light dived at the DC-3 almost
  head on; it passed silently and at great speed about 200 feet above its nose. Both pilots wrenched their heads back to
  see where it had gone, only to discover that the thing had somehow reversed direction in a split second and was now
  flying parallel to the airliner heading in the same direction. It was a clear moonlight night and both men got a good
  look at the object. It was as big or bigger than a B-29, had a cigar-shaped fuselage and a glider-type wing, set well
  forward, without sweepback and without engine nacelles or jet pods. There was not exhaust glow. The white light
  appeared to be recessed in the bottom of the plane. After a few seconds the object lost altitude, passed under the
  DC-3 and disappeared. A civilian employee of Air Intelligence was a passenger on the flight, saw the object and
  confirms the description by the pilots.
</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation </strong> : The conditions for observation were excellent. One fact alone --the astonishing
  reversal of direction performed by the object--suffices to classify it as a device far beyond the known capacities of
  aeronautical science. Although its shape is different, the soundlessness of the object and the absence of observable
  means of propulsion relate it to the saucer class of phenomena.

  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A <time>1952-02-18 06:45</time>, juste avant le lever du Soleil , un photographe nommé C. E. Redman conduisant dans
  Albuquerque (Nouveau Mexique) en route pour photographier un mariage. Arrêté à un fêe, il remarqua 2 choses brillantes
  dans le ciel. <q>Elles étaient au-dessus du Canyon de Tijeras... Celle au Nord était sur son bord. L'autre s'étendait
    horizontalement. Elles étaient brillantes, d'un blanc bleuté... C'était probablement la chose la plus étonnante que
    j'avais jamais vue. Ces choses étaient sans bruit. Il n'y avait ni réacteurs ni traînées de vapeur. J'ai vu des
    centaines d'avions à réaction et de traînées de vapeur.</q> Redman fut interrogé plus tard le jour même par un
  journaliste de <em>Life</em> et un scientifique proéminent, travaillant ensemble. De ce témoignage, et d'après la
  configuration du terrain, il a été estimé que les disques étaient éloignés de 20 miles et à 4 miles dans les airs, et
  qu'ils avaient un diamètre de 136 pieds. Un autre témoin vit les mêmes objets que Redman avait vu, etêcirc;me moment,
  mais depuis un autre côtê; de la ville. W. S. Morris, un sergent-chef à la retraîte de l'Air Force qui est aujourd'hui
  distributeur de journaux à Albuquerque, était dehors pour jeter ses journaux du matin lorsqu'il vit 2 objets étranges
  au-dessus du Canyon de Tijeras. <q>Je les ai regardés pendant <time>P12M</time>. They were a blinding silver, long and
    thin, gleaming all over. They hovered, one kind of above the other to the right. They seemed brighter than the sun,
    which wasn't yet over the Sandia mountains. It just touched their bottoms and they glowed red. They didn't flutter
    or move. They just hung there. It must have been 20 miles away. Then they just suddenly dropped down behind the
    mountain, and the upper one tilted so that I could see its profile. It looked like a bell pepper-with a bump on top,

<p><strong>Evaluation </strong> : La <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/KirtlandAFB.html">base de Kirtland</a> confirma qu'il
  n'y avait aucun appareil dans cette zone à ce moment-là. Les observations se renforcent l'une-l'autre et point to
  several striking facts. D'abord, un disque proved itself three dimensional when it tilted, to descend. Second, the
  suddenness of the disk's descent indicates that the bodies contained a source of power. Third, the power that can
  suspend a three-dimensional body, of the size Morris describes and in the position he indicates, without turning a
  blade or roaring a jet, is unknown. </p>
<h3>Incident 9</h3>
<p> Le <time>1952-01-29 just before midnight</time>, a B-29 was on solo mission over Wonsan, Korea. It was flying at a
  speed somewhat less than 200 miles/h, at an altitude somewhat above 20 000 pieds. Simultaneously the tail gunner and
  the fire-control man in the waist saw a bright round orange object in the sky near the plane. Both said it was about
  three feet in diameter, flew with a revolving motion on a course parallel to theirs, and wore a halo of bluish flame.
  It also appeared to pulsate. The object followed the B-29 for about five minutes, then pulled ahead and shot away at a
  sharp angle. On the same night a similar globe was seen by the tail gunner and waist man of another B-29, 80 miles
  away over Sunchon, but flying at about the same height. The globe followed the plane for about a minute, then
  disappeared.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Evaluation </strong> : Theoreticians in the Air Force believe the fireballs were not natural phenomena but
  propelled objects. They bear some similarity to the balls of fire called "fireball fighters" or "foo fighters" --
  which flew wing on Allied aircraft over Germany and Japan during 1944-45 and which have never been satisfactorily
  explained. In the Korean incidents, the fireballs seem -- on the evidence of their sharp acceleration, their blue
  light and their abrupt, angular swerve -- to resemble the saucers described earlier.
</p>

<h3> Incident 10</h3>

<p>Dans la nuit du 2 Novembre <a href="../../../../../../../../detection/historique/1951.html">1951</a> a ball of
  kelly-green fire, larger than the moon, and blazing several times more brightly, flashed eastward across the skies of
  Arizona. It raced, straight as a bullet, parallel to the ground, and then exploded in a frightful paroxysm of light
  --- without making a sound. At least 165 people saw the incredible thing; hundreds more witnessed the similar flight
  of countless other fireballs that since Décembre <a
      href="../../../../../../../../detection/historique/1948.html">1948</a> have bathed the hills of the Southwest in
  their lunar glare. In the last year they have been seen as far afield as Pennsylvania, Maryland and Puerto Rico. The
  chief Air Intelligence officer for the Albuquerque district saw one. Colonel Joseph D. Caldara, USAF, attached to the
  Joint Chiefs of Staff, saw one in Virginia. Hundreds of pilots, weather observers and atomic scientists have sighted
  them. Reports came so thick and fast during <a href="../../../../../../../../detection/historique/1948.html">1948</a>
  that in <a href="../../../../../../../../detection/historique/1949.html">1949</a> the Air Force established "<a
      href="../../../../../../../../Grudge.html#Twinkle">Project Twinkle</a>" to investigate them. Project Twinkle
  established a triple phototheodolite post at Vaughn, N. Mex. to obtain scientific data on the fireballs. Day and
  night, week in, week out, for three months, a crew kept vigil. Ironically, while fireballs continued flashing
  everywhere else in the Southwest, they saw nothing until the project was transferred to the Holloman Air Force Base at
  Alamogordo, N. Mex. There, during another three-month siege, they saw a few but were unable to make satisfactory
  computations because of the fireballs' great-speed. Search parties have had no better luck. They have combed in vain
  the countryside beneath the point of disappearance; not a trace of telltale substance has been found on the ground.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Evaluation </strong> : The popular Southwest belief that a strange meteor shower was underway has been blasted
  by Dr. <a href="../../../../../../../../LaPazLincoln.html">Lincoln La Paz</a>, mathematician, astronomer and director
  of the Institute of Meteoritics at the University of New Mexico. He points out that normal fireballs do not appear
  green, they fall in the trajectory forced on them by gravity, are generally noisy as a freight train, and leave
  meteorites where they hit. The green New Mexican species does none of these things. Neither do the green fireballs
  appear to be electrostatic phenomena -- they move too regularly and too fast.
</p>
<p>If the fireballs are the product of a U.S. weapons project, as some Southwesterners believe, it is a very secret one
  indeed: the Atomic Energy Commission and every other government agency connected with weapons development has denied
  to LIFE any responsibility for the fireballs.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p> Could they be self-destroying Russian reconnaissance devices? Not likely. While the U.S. believes the Russians have
  an intercontinental guided missile, there is no intelligence that indicates they have developed silent power plants or
  objects capable of moving nearly as fast as meteors (12 miles a second). Yet--for whatever it may be worth--the only
  reports of green fireballs prior to 1948 came from the Baltic area. [Note: The 1946 Scandinavian "Ghost Rockets," 200
  of them on radar]</p>
<p>If the fireballs do not respond to gravity, they could only be explained as lighter-than-air craft or electrical
  phenomena--but they have characteristics which rule these out. Therefore they must be propelled. If propelled and not
  natural phenomena, they must be artificial. The extreme greenness of the fireballs has impressed most witnesses. When
  asked to indicate the approximate color on a spectrum chart, most of them have touched the band at 5,200 angstroms,
  close to the green of burning copper. Copper is almost never found in meteorites; the friction of the air oxidizes it
  shortly after the meteor enters the upper atmosphere. However, a curious fact has been recorded by aerologists.
  Concentrations of copper particles are now present in the air of Arizona and New Mexico, particularly in "fireball
  areas." These were not encountered in air samples made before 1948.</p>
<h2>Ce qu'ils ne sont pas -- Et ce qu'ils pourraient être</h2>
<p> What are the flying saucers, the luminous fuselages, the foo fighters and the green fireballs? The answer -- if any
  answer at this time is possible -- lies in the field of logic rather than of evidence. What the things are may be
  adduced partially by reviewing what they are not.</p>
<p>THEY ARE NOT PSYCHOLOGICAL PHENOMENA. Although the Air Force cheerily wrote off its 34 unexplained incidents with
  this pat theory, the explanation does not hold up. There is no evidence, beyond textbook speculation, for such a
  supposition, and there is the direct evidence already cited against it. To doubt the observers in the foregoing cases
  is to doubt the ability of every human being to know a hawk from a handsaw.</p>
<p>THEY ARE NOT THE PRODUCT OF U.S. RESEARCH. LIFE investigated this possibility to exhaustion. Not fully satisfied by
  the public denials of President Truman, Secretary Johnson and others, the investigators put the question directly to
  Gordon Dean, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. He said: "<q>There's nothing in our shop that could account for
    these things, and there's nothing going on that I know of that could explain them.</q>" Still unconvinced, LIFE
  checked the whereabouts and present business of every scientist who might have anything to do with the development of
  superaircraft. All were accounted for in other ways. Careful feelers through the business and labor world encountered
  no submerged projects of the immensity necessary to build a fleet of flying disks. And there is still the conclusive
  fact: U.S. science has at its command no source of power that could put a flying machine through such paces as the
  saucers perform.
</p>
<p>THEY ARE NOT A RUSSIAN DEVELOPMENT. It is inconceivable that the Russians would risk the loss of such a precious
  military weapon by flying a saucer over enemy territory. No man-made machine is foolproof; sooner or later one would
  crash in the U.S. and the secret would be out. Nor is there any reason to believe that Russian science, even with
  German help, has moved beyond not only the practical but the THEORETICAL horizons of U.S. research.</p>
<p>THEY ARE NOT DISTORTIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE RESULTING FROM ATOMIC ACTIVITY. To quote the answer David Lilienthal,
  former <a href="../../../../../../../../Organisation/AEC.html">AEC</a> commissioner, once made to that suggestion: <q>"I
    can't prevent anyone from saying foolish things.</q>" Nor are they aberrations of the northern lights. Magnetic
  disturbances cannot account for them and neither can a notion (recently fathered by Dr. Urner Liddel, the Navy
  physicist) that they are "<q>vertical mirages</q>" -- reflections from a vertical (instead of a horizontal) layer of
  heated air.
</p>
<p>THEY ARE NOT SKYHOOK BALLOONS. This was the, original Liddel explanation, and in a few instances it may have been
  correct. But not many. They could scarcely be "<q>fireflies in the cockpit</q>," as one Air Force colonel suggested,
  since most of the observers were no in a cockpit when they saw their saucers. And it is hard to believe that saucers
  could be the reflections of automobile headlights on clouds, when they are seen in daylight under cloudless skies.
  These being the dead-end alleys of negative evidence, is there hope of an explanation on the open avenues of
  scientific theory? The answer is yes.
</p>
<p> The rank of science his taken the saucers far more seriously than the file of laymen and, after five years of close
  watch on all reports, a number of scientists were ready with some conclusions. One of these was Dr. Walther Riedel,
  once chief designer and research director at the German rocket center in Peenemunde, now engaged on secret work for
  the U.S. Dr. Riedel has never seen a saucer himself, but for several years he has kept records of saucer sightings all
  over the world. He told LIFE: <q>"I am completely convinced that they have an out-of-world basis."</q></p>
<p> Dr. Riedel has four points to his argument: <q>"First, the skin temperatures of structures operating under the
  observed conditions would make it impossible for any terrestrial structure to survive. The skin friction of the
  missile at those speeds at those altitudes would melt any metals or nonmetals available.</q>
</p>
<p><q>"Second, consider the high acceleration at which they fly and maneuver... In some descriptions the beast spirals
  straight up. If you think of the fact that the centrifugal force in a few minutes of such a maneuver would press the
  crew against the outside, and do likewise to the blood, you see what I mean.</q></p>
<p><q>"Third.... There are many occurrences where they have done things that only a pilot could perform but that no
  human pilot could stand.</q></p>
<p><q>"Fourth, in most of the reports there is a lack of visible jet. Most observers report units without visible flame
  . . . and no trail. If it would be any known type of jet, rocket, piston engine, or chain-reaction motor, there would
  be a very clear trail at high altitude. It is from no power unit we know of . . ."</q></p>
<p> Dr. Riedel's arguments are reinforced by those of Dr. Maurice A. Biot, one of the leading aerodynamicists in the
  U.S. and a prominent mathematical physicist. From an aerodynamical viewpoint, says Dr. Biot, the saucer shape makes
  very little sense if the machine is to travel in the atmosphere. A disk has a high drag and is a poor airfoil unless
  stabilized; when whirled at high speed through the air, it "wobbles" distressingly -- a movement observed in several
  of the saucers sighted. However, for space travel, where there is no atmosphere to oppose, the disk has significant
  advantages. The sphere, theoretically better, presents several difficult problems of construction and utilization. The
  disk, easier to build, has almost all the virtues of the sphere and some of its own. Reviewing the evidence presented
  here, Dr. Biot said: <q>"The least improbable explanation is that these things are artificial and controlled. ...My
    opinion for some time has been that they have an extraterrestrial origin."</q></p>
<h2>Qui ? Quoi ? Et Quand ?</h2>
<p> There, at least, is a plausible explanation of the disk shape. But the real depths of the saucer mystery bemuse
  penetration, as the night sky swallows up a flashlight beam. What of the other shapes? Why do the things make no
  sound? How to explain their eerie luminosity? What power urges them at such terrible speeds through the sky? Who, or
  what, is aboard? Where do they come from? Why are they here? What are the intentions of the beings who control
  them?</p>
<p> Before these awesome questions, science -- and mankind -- can yet only halt in wonder. Answers may come in a
  generation -- or tomorrow. Somewhere in the dark skies there may be those who know.</p>

<h2>Commentaires sur l'article de Life par le capitaine Edward J. Ruppelt, ancien directeur du projet de l'Air Force
  Blue Book, dans son livre "Le rapport sur les objets volants non identifiés," 1956, pp. 177-178.
</h2>

<p> The LIFE article undoubtedly threw a harder punch at the American public than any other UFO article ever written.
  The title alone, "Have We Visitors From Outer Space?" was enough. Other very reputable magazines, such as TRUE, had
  said it before, but coming from LIFE, it was different. LIFE didn't say that the UFO's were from outer space; it just
  said maybe. But to back up this "maybe," it had quotes from some famous people. Dr. Walther Riedel, who played an
  important part in the development of the German V-2 missile and is presently the director of rocket engine research
  for North American Aviation Corporation, said he believed that the UFO's were from outer space. Dr. Maurice Biot, one
  of the world's leading aerodynamicists, backed him up.</p>
<p> But the most important thing about the LIFE article was he question in the minds of so many readers: "Why was it
  written?" LIFE doesn't go blasting off on flights of space fancy without a good reason. Some of the readers saw a clue
  in the author's comments that the hierarchy of the Air Force was now taking a serious look at UFO reports. "Did the
  Air Force prompt LIFE to write the article?" was the question that many people asked themselves.</p>
<p> When I arrived at Dayton [Wright-Patterson AFB, home of ATIC and Project Blue Book], newspapermen were beating down
  the door. The official answer to the LIFE article was released through the Office of Public Information in the
  Pentagon: "The article is factual, but LIFE's conclusions are their own." In answer to any questions about the
  article's being Air Force-inspired, my weasel-worded answer was that we had furnished LIFE with some raw data on
  specific sightings.</p>
<p> My answer was purposely weasel-worded because I knew that the Air Force had unofficially inspired the LIFE article.
  The "maybe they're interplanetary" with the "maybe" bordering on "they are" was the personal opinion of several very
  high-ranking officers in the Pentagon -- so high that their personal opinion was almost policy. I knew the men and I
  knew that one of them, a general, had passed his opinions on to Bob Ginna.</p>
<p> Oddly enough, the LIFE article did not cause a flood of reports. The day after the article appeared we got nine
  sightings, which was unusual, but the next day they dropped off again.</p>
<p> The number of reports did take a sharp rise a few days later, however. The cause was the distribution of an order
  that completed the transformation of the UFO from a bastard son to the family heir. The piece of paper that made
  Project Blue Book legitimate was Air Force Letter 200-5, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects. The letter, which was
  duly signed and sealed by the Secretary of the Air Force, in essence stated that UFO's were not a joke, that the Air
  Force was making a serious study of the problem, and that Project Blue Book was responsible for the study. The letter
  stated that the commander of every Air Force installation was responsible for forwarding all UFO reports to ATIC by
  wire, with a copy to the Pentagon. Then a more detailed report would be sent by airmail. Most important of all, it
  gave Project Blue Book the authority to directly contact any Air Force unit in the United States without going through
  any chain of command. This was almost unheard of in the Air Force and gave our project a lot of prestige.</p>
