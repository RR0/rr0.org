<p>For the benefit of those who were not present at the general meeting held on April 22nd, the Chairman opened the
  meeting with a brief resume of dicussions leading to the formation of this Committee and the terms of reference. He
  then tabled three books by <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Kehoe</a>, <a
      href="/people/s/ScullyFrank/index.html">Scully</a> and <a href="/people/h/HeardGerald/index.html">Heard</a>
  dealing with Flying Saucers sightings as worthy study as they give a fairly useful summary of the most important
  publically recorded sightings. These can be used in addition to newspaper reports.</p>
<p>S/L Bing tabled a report by the the <a href="/org/ca/RCAF.html">RCAF</a> relative to the <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">USAF</a> project of Flying Saucers. This report is to be duplicated by the <a
    href="/org/ca/RCAF.html">RCAF</a> and copies passed to the Secretary for distribution to the Committee members.</p>
<p>The question of the security classification of the work of the committee was then discussed. It was agreed that
  CONFIDENTIAL was sufficient, but that members should be cleared to SECRET to facilitate any exchange of information
  from international sources.</p>
<p>The Chairman stated that it would probably be better to divorce this work from the questionable title of "Flying
  Saucers", and thought that some name entirely without meaning such as "Project Theta" should be adopted. The Committee
  agreed in principle to this suggestion, with the exception that the project name is not to be used during exchange of
  information of an international character. Such "exchanges" are to be effected through established channels only.
  There being no further suggestions acceptable, the name "Project Theta" was adopted, subject to investigation by the
  Secretary as to the validity of the use and possible duplication of the name.</p>
<p>The possibility of obtaining U.S. data on a reciprocal basis was considered desirable and the Secretary was
  instructed to have a formal approach to this effect made through the <a href="/org/ca/drb/index.html">DRB</a> Member
  in Washington.</p>
<p>Consideration was given to the interrogation form presently in use by the <a href="/org/ca/RCAF.html">RCAF</a>. After
  discussion, it was agreed that the form should immediately be revised with accompanying instructions for its use. The
  revised form (<a href="form/index.html">copy attached</a>) was drawn up and copies are to be distributed by the
  Secretary prior to the next meeting. The preparation of the instructions was divided among the members as follows:</p>
