<p> Paris. June 17 -- A fresh wave of flying saucer reports swept France today. </p>
<p>An employee of La Bourget Airport control tower claimed that last Firday he saw a "star, red like the setting sun"
  and about four times the size of an ordinary star, moving Southeast of the Airfield. </p>
<p>The pilot of a French transport plane also saw the "star", reported to the control tower, and made an extra circuit
  to take a closer look but as he circled, the star moved into the wind and vanished. </p>
<p>Last Sunday, Albert Roux, who lives near La Bourget, reported seeking a white silvery disc cross the sky from
  northwest to southwest "about four times as fast as a jet plane." Thirty other persons in Cholet, western France, said
  they saw a "flying saucer".</p>
