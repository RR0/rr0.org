<p>While working on daily reports I was summoned by Base Photographer, one Shell Alpert, SN(PH) who called me to hurry
  and look at airborne lights. Looking out the window to the North West there appeared to be what was thought to be a
  quick flash, I actually could not say that it was anything. It could have been reflections from passing cars or from
  the ocean.
