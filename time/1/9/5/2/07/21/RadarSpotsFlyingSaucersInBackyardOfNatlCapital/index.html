<p>Washington (UP)- The Air Force today investigated reports that several “flying saucers” had been spotted by radar
  virtually in its own backyard on the outskirts of the nation’s capital.</p>
<p>Not only were unidentified objects seen on radar—indicating actual substance instead of mere light—but two airline
  pilots and a newsman saw eerie lights fitting the general description of flying saucers the same night.</p>
<p>Officials could not immediately agree on whether this was the first time radar has picked up flying saucers. Some
  said it was. All agreed it was unusual.</p>
<p>The objects also were different from the average reported saucer in that they traveled at a relatively slow speed, as
  well as later disclosing the customary burst that far outspeeds normal airplanes.</p>
<p>One thing was certain: A thorough investigation is being made by the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic">Air Technical
  Intelligence Center</a>, <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</a>, Dayton, O., which
  has been set up to look into <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/FlyingSaucers.html">flying saucers</a> reports.</p>
<p>Such reports, officials has said earlier yesterday, are coming in faster than at any time since the initial flood in
  <time>1947</time>. The current average is about 10° sightings a month.</p>
<p>The flying saucers over the capital were reported late yesterday, about 36 hours after the incident actually
  occurred.</p>
<p>This is the story as pieced together from Air Force reports, persons involved, and other sources :</p>
<p>An operator at the Air Traffic Control Center at Washington National Airport, across the Potomac from the capital,
  spotted eight unidentified images on one of his radars-the area surveillance scope, with a range of possibly 70
  miles.</p>
<p>The control center, operated by the Civil Aeronautics Administration, notified the Air Force and also asked planes in
  the air if they could see anything.</p>
<p>That was around midnight.</p>
<p>Capt. S.C. (Casey) Pierman of Detroit, piloting Capital Airlines Flight 807, southbound from National Airport, soon
  reported seeing sever objects between Washington and Martinsburg, W. Va. He said they changed pace, sometimes moving
  at tremendous speed, at other times hanging almost motionless.</p>
<p>He was careful in his report, and later in an interview, not to identify the objects as flying saucers. He described
  them as <q>like falling stars without tails</q> but added:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In my years of flying I’ve seen a lot of falling or shooting stars... But these were much faster... They couldn’t
    have been aircraft. They were moving too fast for that. They were about the same size as the brighter stars, and
    were much higher than our 6,000-foot altitude</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another airliner, Capital - National Airlines Flight 610, also reported seeing a light following it from Herndon, Va.
  to within four miles of Washington.</p>
<p>Saul Pett, an Associated Press newsman, said he saw a "flying saucer" that came night near his home at River Edge, N.
  J., outside of New York</p>
