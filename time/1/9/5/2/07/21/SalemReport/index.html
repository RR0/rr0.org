    rheostat. Objects appeared to waver slightly and glow as a light source. ALPERT could not determine the shape nor
    formation, aerodynamic features, or propulsion system. ALPERT did not see any trail, exhaust, or maneuvers. ALPERT
    did not hear any sound and could not tell if the objects were moving, After ALPERT developed the photograph, he
