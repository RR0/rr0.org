        <li>Une étude has been completed of the Coast Guard negative of unknown aerial objects. A full report to
          describe the steps in this study will be sent to you in a short time. Until it is completed, this brief
          summary will contain the findings of the Photo Reconnaissance Laboratory.
        </li>
        <li>
          The central point in question is the apparent brightness of the 4 objects coupled with the total absence of
          any corresponding highlights or reflections of these objects from the automobiles in the picture. The
          brightness of these objects would appear to be of the same order of magnitude as the reflections of the sun in
          the chromium bumpers and trim of the automobiles. This is indicated by the inclosed prints in Series A,
          numbered on the reverse side in pencil, and representing: A-l is normal print exposure time, A-2 is double
          this exposure time, A-3 is four times, and A-4 is eight times.
        </li>
        <li>
          Further examination of the Series A prints shows no trace of highlights on the automobiles caused by the
          objects. All bright spots that can be seen are directly related to the sun, which is to the rear and to the
          left of the camera position. There are, however, surfaces which should show highlights, eg, the auto directly
          under the largest object. It is obviously a fairly new car, with average polish to the paint. Yet nowhere on
          the roof is any suggestion of an overhead illumination directly above or beyond the car.
        </li>
        <li>
          This point has been tested experimentally in the Series 3 and C prints. A standard studio photoflood lamp was
          placed above and some 50 ft beyond a row of parked automobiles beside the Photographic Reconnaissance
          Laboratory. A camera was set up on an elevated platform about 200 ft from the central auto, in the photograph,
          indicated by the photoflood lamp appearing directly above it. The Series B prints show the cars with the lamp
          turned off, while the Series C prints show the same scene with the lamp on. An unmistakable bright line
          highlight can be seen in the car appearing directly under the lamp, a highlight which is not there when the
          lamp is off. A similar bright line should be seen somewhere on the top of the car in the Series A prints, had
          distant bright objects been actually located as indicated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Series D prints show how easy it is to construct a hoax by means of double exposure. The glowing objects,
          hovering over the Photographic Reconnaissance Laboratory are multiple exposures of a simple street lamp,
          stauchion [sic, probably should be "stanchion"] type. The film was multiply exposed at night, with a dark view
          field surrounding the lamp. The daytime exposure of the building was carefully oriented to -produce the aerial
          hovering effect. However, the fraud is indicated because no highlights may be seen in the auto roofs. (The
          possibility of building shading in Series D is not existent in Series A).
        </li>
        <li>
          It is therefore concluded that the authenticity of the picture, taken by the Coast Guard photographer, is open
          to serious doubt.
