<p>WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 —(AP)— Coast Guard Headquarters today made public a photograph of "unidentified aerial phenomena"
  taken by a Coast Guard photographer.
</p>
<p>The photo clearly shows four round objects. Each appears to have two identical shafts of light extending across its
  center and protruding at the forward and rear ends. The lights are in a "V" formation.
</p>
<p>The Coast Guard said it had no opinion as to the cause or source of the objects and was releasing the picture only
  because of the widespread public interest in aerial phenomena.
</p>
<p>The picture was snapped by Shell R. Alpert, Salem, Mass., Air Station photographer, who said he sighted several
  brillant white lights through the station's photo lab window at 9:35 a.m., July 16.
</p>
<p>Alpert watched the lights for five or six seconds before attempting to photograph them. By the time he had focused
  his camera the lights were reported "considerably dimmed down."
