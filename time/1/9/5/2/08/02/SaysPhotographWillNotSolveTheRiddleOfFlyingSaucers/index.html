  That Is Opinion of Prof. Menzel, One of Nation's Top-Ranking Astro-Physicists
</p>
<p>
  BOSTON, Aug. 2 -- A Coast Guardsman's photograph probably will not help solve the riddle of flying saucers, one of the
  nation's ranking astro-physicists said today.
</p>
<p>
  Professor Ronald H. Menzel of Harvard university, who has devoted himself to the "flying saucer" problem for more than
  six years, expressed doubt about the value of the picture of "four wavering lights" taken at the Salem Coast Guard
  station by photographer Shell R. Alpert of Denver, Colo. Alpert was filing negatives when he saw a light in the sky
  and took the picture July 16.
</p>
<p>
  "As I have maintained, reflections and retractions can account for all flying saucers," said Menzel, who has not seen
  the photograph. He insists it is valueless if not accompanied by scientific data.
</p>
<p>
  The picture shows four egg shaped objects.
</p>
<p>
  "There has been no mention of the temperature distribution, no bearing was taken, there is no estimate of altitude,
  and other important information is lacking," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Alpert said it was "extremely hot" and the sun was brilliant with a six-mile visibility when he took the picture. He
  said he did not know what the objects could be.
</p>
<p>
  "Almost Blue White"
</p>
<p>
  The objects were reported to be "very white, almost blue white." Commenting on this color and the "bright red" hue of
  objects reportedly seen in the sky yesterday by jet interceptor pilots from Wright-Patterson Air Force base in Dayton,
  O., Menzel commented:
</p>
<p>
  "I distrust estimates of color taken under special conditions. There are certain psychological circumstances which
  most people do not understand. I can set up a laboratory experiment in which you will swear that red is green and
  green is red. You don't have to be color blind, either."
