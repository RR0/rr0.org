<p><a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html">Wright-Patterson AFB</a>, Ohio â€” The <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a> has changed its plan of studying "flying saucers" from one of volume
  to one of valid observation, according to Capt. <span class="people" title="Edward J. Ruppelt">E. J. Ruppelt</span>,
  head of the Aerial Phenomena Section at <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html"> Wright-Patterson</a>.

<p>When the study was first begun, it was thought that progress might be made by collecting large numbers of reports,
  sifting out those that were <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/canular">hoaxes</a> and others that could be traced to <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon/ballon.JPG">balloons</a>, plants, and various U. S. military
  activities: and trying to form the unexplainable portion into a pattern according to area, time of sighting, etc.</p>
<p>These studies yielded no pattern. Now the project is concentrating on obtaining <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/photo">photographs</a> from cameras equipped with a diffraction grid over
  the lens, and on Schmidt telescopic cameras. The grid breaks up the photograph and allows scientists to discover from
  what substances the light photographed is made.</p>
<p>The Schmidt telescope gives a continuous record of the sky in night. Similar cameras are already in use in many
  observatories The Schmidt telescopes cost from $3000 to $5000 each and are not yet in production.</p>
<p>Another approach is that of briefing trained persons in the hope that they can make simultaneous sightings which
  would provide information for calculation of the altitude of the objects.</p>
<p>Timing the appearance and disappearance, and simple calculation of the angle of the object can be made by such
  trained observers.</p>
<p>Ordinary observation, whether from civilians with no aviation experience or from <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a> officers or airline <a href="/people/pilotes.html">pilots</a>, are of
  little or no worth. These provide no means of measuring altitude, angle, or size.</p>
<p>The <a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a> already has called in civilian experts to help study the saucer
  reports, and is considering assigning the job to civilian contractors.</p>
<p>The AF Aerial Phenomena project would continue in cooperation with any such private investigation.</p>
