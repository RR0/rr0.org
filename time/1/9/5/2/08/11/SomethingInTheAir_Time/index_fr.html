<p><em>Science</em></p>
<p>Au large des Îles Aléoutiennes, à l'été dangereux de <time>1943</time>, le détachement spécial de surveillance radar
  de la Marine repéra les blips de vaisseaux de guerre ennemis. In a brisk, 45-minute fire fight, the battle fleet
  expended more than 1,000 rounds of 14-in. and 8-in. ammunition. From their battle stations, lookouts reported the
  flares and star shells of the otherwise invisible Japanese. Radar operators called in corrections for what seemed to
  be near misses. But there was no return fire. Eventually, a bewildered Navy decided that it had been slugging it out
  with phantoms.</p>
<p>Last week in Washington, Vice Admiral Robert C. Giffen (ret.), who had commanded U.S. forces during the great
  Alaskan "Battle of the Blips." had reason to recall his embarrassing adventure. Washington itself had just lived
  through a phantom invasion when unidentified blips on a Civil Aeronautics Authority radar brought jet fighters
  screaming over from Delaware to hunt "flying saucers" (TIME, Aug. 4). The fighters had shot down no night-flying
  saucers, but two of them had found radar targets. It appeared later that they had been drawing a bead on each
  other. </p>
<p>The Navy, said Admiral Giffen, was convinced by now that its Alaskan battle force had steamed in under a high-riding
  layer of warm air that acted as a kind of electronic ceiling. Radar pulses bounced off the "inversion" layer and
  echoed back from the Amchitka mountains, more than 100 miles away. A similar temperature inversion was hovering over
  the capital when the saucers flew in. Admiral Giffen thought that atmospheric conditions were still the best
  explanation for the ghostly targets. </p>
<p>Crockery. But Washington was not the only city attacked last month by the airborne crockery. From all over the
  country frightened phone calls and irate demands for information rang through the Pentagon. Air Force intelligence,
  official guard ian of saucer information, was smothered by an alltime record of reported sightings. Items: </p>
<ul>
  <li> In Salem, Mass., Coast Guard Photographer Shell Alpert glanced out the window and saw several bright lights
    shimmering in the morning sunshine. After calling a friend to verify what he could not quite believe, Alpert managed
    to photograph the strange formation just before it vanished. Even a dirty screen on the photo-lab window did not
    blot out the luminous formation near the power plant smokestacks (see cut). </li>
  <li>Flying over Greenfield, Ind., an airline pilot reported a brilliant green, tear-shaped light "going like a bat out
    of hell." </li>
  <li>In Chenango County, N.Y., citizens gathered in crowds to watch a "whole flotilla of bright, shiny balls moving
    rapidly in a northerly direction." Jet fighters scrambled from Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome. N.Y., but found
    nothing. </li>
  <li>Over the AEC's atomic laboratory at Los Alamos. N.M., observers watched a shiny and "apparently metallic" object
    jerk through the sky for 30 minutes at high speed.</li>
  <li> Off Korea, the crew of a Canadian destroyer spotted two "flying discs" that disappeared at dawn. By radar, the
    objects were fixed two miles high and seven miles away. <q></q></li>
</ul>
<p>Satisfaction. Last week, in an effort to clear the air and take the heat off its frantic Intelligence Section, the
  Air Force answered some questions. Major General Roger M. Ramey, Director of Operations, and Major General John A.
  Samford, Director of Intelligence, did their best to explain away the excitement. All the reports together, said
  General Ramey, do not establish any pattern that can be construed as menacing. After six years of study, he is
  "reasonably well" convinced that there is no such thing as a "flying saucer." </p>
<p>Like the Navy, the Air Force was sure that temperature inversions over the nation's capital had permitted
  high-angling radars to pick up trucks and other moving targets on the ground. But what about the other 1,000 or more
  sightings elsewhere? In a Pentagon press conference, just as if he meant to be reassuring, General Samford went on to
  state that such things as missiles, ice formations, birds, meteors, and honest misinterpretations of natural phenomena
  account for all but 20% of them. That still left plenty unexplained. So the Air Force plans to distribute 200 special
  cameras to competent observers and has ordered some powerful new telescopes that will scan the sky continuously from
  horizon to horizon. </p>
