<p class="abstract">In War of the Worlds, A-bomb-proof spaceships were a headache. It takes technology to build even a
  make-believe flying saucer.</p>

        </tr></table><p>How would you build even a make-believe flying saucer ?</p>
        <p>That was the toughest problem confronting George Pal, the producer of <em>When Worlds Collide</em> and <em>Destination
          Moon</em>, when he set out recently to make a movie of H. G. Well's famous <a
            href="/science/crypto/ufo/culture/litterature/index.html">science-fiction</a> story, <em>War of the
          Worlds</em>. </p>
        <p>You'll see the result on your local screen when his picture is released. Pal called his studio technicians
          together and told them to discard all thoughts of antiquated rocket ships. He wanted to set the style for
          space vehicles of the future. and, in line with Well's original novel, these Martian blitz machines had to
          look their deadly part.</p>
        <p>That was where Art Director, Al Nozaki came in. Roughing in the first of the 1,006 sketches used to set the
          mood and action of the film, he crossed a flying wing with a flying saucer to produce the aerial devilfish
          that Pal demanded. A cobra-like death eye, flickering magnetic legs, and an atom-bomb-resistant envelope that
          spread itself over the space ship with the ease of a motor-operated convertible top, completed tentative
          specifications.</p>
        <p>Then it was up to the model builders. Sculptors tooled the design in plaster, forming a pattern for the
          workers who produced the three 45-inch copper models used in the actual filming. Windows, to fit nose, wings
          and wing tips were cast in plastic. Into the 31-pound miniatures went fifteen hundred dollars' worth of
          special neon and incandescent lighting. Two motors were used to control the cobra head. Magnesium, burned on
          window screening, provided the fires caused by the saucers as they flew.</p>

            <p>Using double exposure, these were superimposed, one at a time, on the corresponding photo frames. The
              same blending of photography and drawings made possible breath-taking glimpes of flying-saucer victims,
              military equipment and whole cities being reduced to ashes under the scorching eyes of the Martian
              Juggernaut. </p>
