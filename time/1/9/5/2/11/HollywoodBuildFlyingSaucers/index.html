<p class="abstract">In War of the Worlds, A-bomb-proof spaceships were a headache. It takes technology to build even a
  make-believe flying saucer.</p>

<p>How would you build even a make-believe flying saucer ?</p>
<p>That was the toughest problem confronting George Pal, the producer of <em>When Worlds Collide</em> and <em>Destination
  Moon</em>, when he set out recently to make a movie of H. G. Well's famous <a
  href="/science/crypto/ufo/culture/litterature/index.html">science-fiction</a> story, <em>War of the Worlds</em>. </p>
<p>You'll see the result on your local screen when his picture is released. Pal called his studio technicians together
  and told them to discard all thoughts of antiquated rocket ships. He wanted to set the style for space vehicles of the
  future. and, in line with Well's original novel, these Martian blitz machines had to look their deadly part.</p>
<p>That was where Art Director, Al Nozaki came in. Roughing in the first of the 1,006 sketches used to set the mood and
  action of the film, he crossed a flying wing with a flying saucer to produce the aerial devilfish that Pal demanded. A
  cobra-like death eye, flickering magnetic legs, and an atom-bomb-resistant envelope that spread itself over the space
  ship with the ease of a motor-operated convertible top, completed tentative specifications.</p>
<p>Then it was up to the model builders. Sculptors tooled the design in plaster, forming a pattern for the workers who
  produced the three 45-inch copper models used in the actual filming. Windows, to fit nose, wings and wing tips were
  cast in plastic. Into the 31-pound miniatures went fifteen hundred dollars' worth of special neon and incandescent
  lighting. Two motors were used to control the cobra head. Magnesium, burned on window screening, provided the fires
  caused by the saucers as they flew.</p>

    wires carry current to the saucers motors.

<p>The actual flying of the saucers followed time-tested overhead-wire technique. But the bombproof hood was a puzzler
  until a series of animated overlay drawings was developped.</p>
<p>Using double exposure, these were superimposed, one at a time, on the corresponding photo frames. The same blending
  of photography and drawings made possible breath-taking glimpes of flying-saucer victims, military equipment and whole
  cities being reduced to ashes under the scorching eyes of the Martian Juggernaut. </p>
