<p class="abstract">Dans la <em>Guerre des Mondes</em>, des vaisseaux spatiaux à l'épreuve des bombes A were a headache.
  Cela demande de la technologie pour construire une soucoupe volante même qui vous y fasse croire.</p>

        <p>Ce fut le problème toughest confronting George Pal, le producteur de <em>When Worlds Collide</em> et <em>Destination
          Moon</em>, lorsqu'il set out recently de faire un film de la fameuse histoire de <a
            href="/science/crypto/ufo/culture/litterature/index.html">science-fiction</a> de H. G. Well, <em>La Guerre
          des Mondes</em>. </p>
        <p>You'll see the result on your local screen when his picture is released. Pal called his studio technicians
          together and told them to discard all thoughts of antiquated rocket ships. He wanted to set the style for
          space vehicles of the future. and, in line with Well's original novel, these Martian blitz machines had to
          look their deadly part.</p>
        <p>That was where Art Director, Al Nozaki came in. Roughing in the first of the 1,006 sketches used to set the
          mood and action of the film, he crossed a flying wing with a flying saucer to produce the aerial devilfish
          that Pal demanded. A cobra-like death eye, flickering magnetic legs, and an atom-bomb-resistant envelope that
          spread itself over the space ship with the ease of a motor-operated convertible top, completed tentative
          specifications.</p>
        <p>Then it was up to the model builders. Sculptors tooled the design in plaster, forming a pattern for the
          workers who produced the three 45-inch copper models used in the actual filming. Windows, to fit nose, wings
          and wing tips were cast in plastic. Into the 31-pound miniatures went fifteen hundred dollars' worth of
          special neon and incandescent lighting. Two motors were used to control the cobra head. Magnesium, burned on
          window screening, provided the fires caused by the saucers as they flew.</p>

              Juggernaut. </p>
