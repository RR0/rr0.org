<title>Official Records</title>

<p>As one of the first steps in this study, all records of these phenomena reported in the logs of the Washington ARTC
  Center were tabulated. The tabulation, given as <a href="../table1/index.html">Table I</a> of this report, was taken
  to the Analysis Section of the United States Weather Bureau where it was correlated with meteorological data for the
  periods involved. It was then discovered that a temperature inversion had been indicated in almost every instance when
  the unidentified radar targets or visual objects had been reported. Weather analysts were asked whether any unusual
  weather conditions had prevailed over the Washington area during the period covering the occurrences of large numbers
  of the unidentified radar targets. Their report may be condensed as follows: </p>
<h2>Monthly Weather Summary, July 1952.</h2>
<p>The heat wave that broke records in the eastern portion of the United States during the month of Tune continued on
  through July, becoming intensified during the latter part of the month. July weather maps were characterized by a
  well-developed Bermuda high pressure area which remained in the vicinity of the southeastern coast line during the
  entire period. This high pressure area was responsible for an anticyclonic (clockwise) circulation of air over the
  eastern United States, a movement which continued during the month. This flow brought warm, moist air up from the Gulf
  of Mexico. The warm air mass usually extended up to about 10,000 feet. At higher levels the flow was from the
  west-southwest, and this continental air mass from the southwestern desert and drought area was hot and dry.
  Stagnation and heating of the air over the eastern United States was further increased because of an extremely strong
  band of westerly winds along the northern United States border, winds which prevented cold Canadian air masses from
  pushing south. Cyclonic activity was confined mostly to the area north of this band of westerly winds. There was a
  notable lack of thunderstorm activity in the Washington area. Physicists at the Naval Observatory reported that the
  amount of electrification in the air was very low. </p>
<p>The foregoing analysis indicated that the lack of cloud cover promoted solar heating in the daytime and rapid
  radiation cooling of the surface at night, This combination, with the prevailing light winds, was unusually conducive
  to the formation of temperature inversions during the hours of darkness.</p>
<p> Since the visual reports of flying saucers indicated that the observed lights spanned the same color range as the
  aurora borealis and since auroral effects closely follow sunspot activity, personnel of the Naval Observatory were
  consulted in order to determine whether any unusual sunspot activity had occurred during the period in question. They
  reported that there had been no unusual activity of this nature. </p>
<h2>Reports from Other Locations.</h2>
<p>The Washington ARTC Center is the only one equipped with air route surveillance radar. However, several CAA control
  towers are equipped with airport surveillance radar, Type ASR-1. A survey of these locations produced the following
  results:</p>
<ul>
  <li> ATLANTA, Municipal Airport. No unidentified targets of this nature have been reported. </li>
  <li>BOSTON, Logan Field. Unidentified targets have been noticed on rare occasions. One slow-moving target was observed
    during instrument flying weather conditions about August 1, 1952. No interference with traffic has been caused by
    this problem. </li>
  <li>CHICAGO, Midway Airport. Unidentified targets have been seen on many occasions, particularly when temperature
    inversions have been in effect and low smoke hung over the city. They are usually given as traffic information to
    other aircraft and occasionally form a nuisance problem, since there is a considerable helicopter activity at and
    around the airport. </li>
  <li>CLEVELAND, Municipal Airport. Unidentified radar targets have been observed many times. The chief controller
    reported that on a recent occasion such targets moving slowly from west to east showed up in all portions of the
    scope face. </li>
  <li>MINNEAPOLIS, International Airport. No targets of this nature have been reported. </li>
  <li>NEW YORK, New York International Airport. No targets of this nature have been reported. LaGuardia Airport. Only
    one such instance was reported. At the time it was thought to be due to difficulties within the radar itself. </li>
  <li>WASHINGTON, National Airport. Targets of this nature have been observed occasionally over a long period. Recent
    occasions are logged in Table I of this report. </li>
</ul>
