<title>Enregistrements officiels</title>

<p>Dans le cadre des premières étapes de cette étude, l'ensemble des enregistrements de ces phénomènes rapportés dans
  les journaux du Centre ARTC de Washington ont été tabulés. La tabulation, telle que donnée dans le <a
      href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/table1.htm">tableau 1</a> de ce rapport, a été apportée à la Section
  d'Analyse du Bureau Météo des Etats-Unis où elle a été corrélée avec les données météorologigues des périodes
  concernées. Il a alors été découvert qu'une inversion de température a été indiquée dans pratiquement chaque cas où
  les cibles radar non-identifiées ou objets visuels ont été signalés. Les analystes météo furent interrogés pour savoir
  si des conditions météo inhabituelles avaient prévalu au-dessus de la région de Washington durant la période couvrant
  les occurrences de grands nombres de cibles radar non-identifiées. Leur rapport peut être condensé comme suit : </p>
<h2>Synthèse météo mensuelle, juillet 1952</h2>
<p>The heat wave that broke records in the eastern portion of the United States during the month of Tune continued on
  through July, becoming intensified during the latter part of the month. July weather maps were characterized by a
  well-developed Bermuda high pressure area which remained in the vicinity of the southeastern coast line during the
  entire period. This high pressure area was responsible for an anticyclonic (clockwise) circulation of air over the
  eastern United States, a movement which continued during the month. This flow brought warm, moist air up from the Gulf
  of Mexico. The warm air mass usually extended up to about 10,000 feet. At higher levels the flow was from the
  west-southwest, and this continental air mass from the southwestern desert and drought area was hot and dry.
  Stagnation and heating of the air over the eastern United States was further increased because of an extremely strong
  band of westerly winds along the northern United States border, winds which prevented cold Canadian air masses from
  pushing south. Cyclonic activity was confined mostly to the area north of this band of westerly winds. There was a
  notable lack of thunderstorm activity in the Washington area. Physicists at the Naval Observatory reported that the
  amount of electrification in the air was very low. </p>
<p>The foregoing analysis indicated that the lack of cloud cover promoted solar heating in the daytime and rapid
  radiation cooling of the surface at night, This combination, with the prevailing light winds, was unusually conducive
  to the formation of temperature inversions during the hours of darkness.</p>
<p> Since the visual reports of flying saucers indicated that the observed lights spanned the same color range as the
  aurora borealis and since auroral effects closely follow sunspot activity, personnel of the Naval Observatory were
  consulted in order to determine whether any unusual sunspot activity had occurred during the period in question. They
  reported that there had been no unusual activity of this nature. </p>
<h2>Reports from Other Locations.</h2>
<p>The Washington ARTC Center is the only one equipped with air route surveillance radar. However, several CAA control
  towers are equipped with airport surveillance radar, Type ASR-1. A survey of these locations produced the following
  results:</p>
<ul>
  <li> ATLANTA, Municipal Airport. No unidentified targets of this nature have been reported. </li>
  <li>BOSTON, Logan Field. Unidentified targets have been noticed on rare occasions. One slow-moving target was observed
    during instrument flying weather conditions about August 1, 1952. No interference with traffic has been caused by
    this problem. </li>
  <li>CHICAGO, Midway Airport. Unidentified targets have been seen on many occasions, particularly when temperature
    inversions have been in effect and low smoke hung over the city. They are usually given as traffic information to
    other aircraft and occasionally form a nuisance problem, since there is a considerable helicopter activity at and
    around the airport. </li>
  <li>CLEVELAND, Municipal Airport. Unidentified radar targets have been observed many times. The chief controller
    reported that on a recent occasion such targets moving slowly from west to east showed up in all portions of the
    scope face. </li>
  <li>MINNEAPOLIS, International Airport. No targets of this nature have been reported. </li>
  <li>NEW YORK, New York International Airport. No targets of this nature have been reported. LaGuardia Airport. Only
    one such instance was reported. At the time it was thought to be due to difficulties within the radar itself. </li>
  <li>WASHINGTON, National Airport. Targets of this nature have been observed occasionally over a long period. Recent
    occasions are logged in Table I of this report. </li>
</ul>
