<title>Analysis of Washington data</title>
<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<p>It will be noted from Table I that many more unidentified targets are picked up by the Washington ARTC Center than
  by the Washington Airport Traffic Control Tower. This may be explained by the fact that the center is equipped with a
  MEW radar, while the tower is equipped with an airport surveillance radar, Type ASR-1. The most significant
  differences between the two types of equipment are listed in the following: </p>
<ol>
  <li> The peak power of the MEW is 3 decibels (db) higher than the ASR-1.</li>
  <li>The average power of the MEW is 6 db higher than the average power of the ASR-1.</li>
  <li>The MEW has a higher elevation angle coverage.</li>
  <li>The MEW elicits approximately twice as many hits per scan per target since the scan rate of the MEW is 6
    revolutions per minute (rpm). Additional specifications of these radars are listed in Table IV. </li>
</ol>
<p>The almost simultaneous appearance of the first moving targets with the ground returns, signifying the beginning of
  the temperature inversion, suggested that the target display was perhaps caused by some effects existing in or near
  the inversion layers.</p>

    href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/fig3a.htm">Fig. 3</a> that all targets observed in the first period were
  moving from the north or northwest. In <a href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/fig5-8a.htm">Fig. 6</a> all
  targets were moving from the south or southwest, and in <a href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/fig5-8a.htm">Fig.
    7</a> all were moving from the west or northwest. The definite directional trend in each case eliminated the
  possibility that the unidentified targets were surface vehicles such as trains, trucks, automobiles, or boats. Had
  this been the case, some vehicles would have been moving in the reverse directions. In each case, target directions
  corresponded with the wind directions reported aloft. This fact suggested that whatever was producing the targets as
  being carried by the wind, the next step of the analysis was to determine, if possible, the altitude of the objects
  which produced the radar targets. Since the radar actually measures slant range which could in some cases be almost
  directly overhead from the high-beam MEW antenna, the minimum range of each target was used to determine the absolute
  maximum altitude of the object producing the target. </p>

<p>For example, a target which came within five nautical miles of the radar antenna could not be above an altitude of
  five nautical miles, or 30,400 feet. With the use of the slant-range principle, the absolute maximum altitude of each
  target was determined and is listed in Table V. When attempting later to determine the probable altitude of each
  target by studying the winds aloft, it was useful to have these maximum altitude figures to eliminate the necessity
  for consideration of higher altitude levels.
</p></p><p>Since winds aloft can vary considerably during the period of a few hours, it was decided to use in this
  analysis only data on targets which were under observation during the periods from one hour before to one hour after
  the observations of the local winds aloft. These targets are listed in Table V. </p>
<p>During the observation period on the night of August 13-14, all targets on a southerly heading had ground speeds of
  at least 24 knots. The only reported winds with a southerly heading had a velocity of only 12 knots. These were winds
  at the 2,000- and 3,000-foot levels. Targets on a southeasterly heading had a speed range of 32 to 48 knots. However,
  the only winds on this heading were from 14 knots at 4,000 feet to 38 knots at 20,000 feet.</p>
<p><a id="Three">D</a>uring the August 15-16 observations, targets on a north or northeasterly heading had speeds of 35
  to 42 knots. The only reported winds moving in this direction ranged between 5 and 26 knots from the surface up to
  9,000 feet. Targets on easterly headings had speeds from 22 to 45 knots. The only reported winds moving in this
  direction had speeds of from 10 to 24 knots between 10,000 and 25,000 feet. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/fig9.htm">Fig. 9</a> and <a
    href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/fig10.htm">Fig. 10</a>, the directions and velocities of the winds aloft
  are plotted on a polar projection diagram together with the directions and velocities of the observed targets.
  Agreement between the directions of the winds and the directions of the targets is apparent. </p>

<p>One of the theoretically possible causes of the unidentified targets was the delayed pulse or second-time-around
  effect inherent in the radar method of time measurement. With a second-time-around effect, objects beyond the normal
  sweep range of a radar can be displayed on the scope because of reception of an echo pulse elicited not by the
  transmitted pulse which triggers the range sweep but by the preceding transmitted pulse. The apparent velocity of the
  target on the radar is no greater than and normally less than the velocity of the object producing the return. The
  heading of the radar target would not necessarily be parallel to the heading of the object unless the object was on a
  course radial to the radar antenna. These effects are illustrated in <a
      href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/fig11-12.htm">Fig. 11</a>. </p>
<p>If we assume then that an object producing a second-time-around radar target was being carried by the wind, the
  apparent velocity of the target would be no greater than the wind velocity. However, the analysis of the targets
  listed in Table V showed that they were actually moving at speeds approximately double the wind velocities reported
  for the directions involved. This fact eliminated the possibility that the targets were being produced by the
  second-time-around effect. </p>
<p>When the target velocities plotted in <a href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/fig9b.htm">Fig. 9</a> and <a
    href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/fig10b.htm">Fig. 10</a> were halved, those plotted points clustered very
  closely around the wind plots. Further investigation of the doubled-speed effect indicated that this effect could be
  produced if the original radar beam were reflected downward to give a ground return, as shown in <a
      href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/Fig11-12b.htm">Fig. 12</a>. If we assume that some sort of horizontal
  reflector was present aloft and that the angle of reflection equaled the angle of incidence of the radar beam, any
  horizontal movement of the reflector would produce a movement twice as great in the image being received on the radar
  scope. Furthermore.- the apparent motion of the image would be parallel to the motion of the reflector, as illustrated
  in <a href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/fig13-14.htm">Fig. 13</a>. </p>
<p>When the observed target velocities were divided by two, the target motions corresponded closely to the reported wind
  directions and velocities at certain altitude levels. In nearly all of these cases the altitude levels, which are
  listed as probable altitudes in Table V, were at or adjacent to the temperature inversion levels. </p>
<p>With only one exception, no targets were seen moving at the speed and heading of the reported wind at any altitude.
  This suggested that the reflecting areas, which were capable of bending the radar beam, were nevertheless not of
  sufficient density to produce direct returns on the radar scope. Thus, it appeared likely that the reflection effect
  was being produced by the atmosphere itself. If this were the case, it would probably be a refraction rather than a
  reflection which was involved. This effect is shown in <a href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/fig13-14.htm">Fig.
    14</a>. </p>
<p>The uniformly small size of the observed targets as well as the relatively low frequency of their occurrences
  suggested that the conditions producing this effect were extremely localized and decidedly critical. Although the
  exact nature of the discontinuity is not known, one possible explanation might be that it is an eddy in the
  atmosphere. Such eddies may be produced by the shearing effect of dissimilar air masses moving at different speeds and
  headings at or near the inversion boundary. They might under certain conditions produce bulges in the inversion layer,
  concentrating and directing the radar energy with a lens effect to produce a return signal strong enough to show up on
  the radar scope. The relatively short paths of some of the radar targets before their fadeout might be attributed to
  the dissipation of these eddies in the stratified air mass.</p>
<p>Intermediate speed checks on numerous targets indicated that individual velocities remained quite steady during the
  observation period. It became possible to predict with accuracy the progress of specific targets from minute to
  minute. There was no evidence of hovering or of sudden increases in speed by any target. It is believed that previous
  reports of sudden accelerations of targets to supersonic velocities were due to a controller's transfer of identity
  from a faded target to another target which was just appearing on a different section of the scope. </p>
<p>It would be unwise to assume that all unidentified slow-moving radar targets are caused by refraction of radar
  energy. Small rain clouds produce much the same appearance on the scope. Other targets could be direct returns from
  bird formations, balloons, or debris carried aloft by convection or tornadoes. It has recently been reported that more
  than 4,000 balloons are released in the United States every day by Government and civilian research organizations

  recent analysis of more than 1,000 visual reports of unidentified flying objects by the Air Technical Intelligence
  Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base indicates that 21.3 per cent of these may be attributed to balloons <span

</p>
<p>Examination of the logs of the Washington ARTC Center indicates that there is considerable correlation between the
  appearance of unidentified targets on the radar scope and the receipt of numerous visual reports of flying saucers. It
  should be noted that abrupt temperature inversions aloft can refract light in much the same way as radar waves and
  produce mirage effects. In a standard reference work on meteorology <span class="source">	Humphreys, W. J., "Physics of the Air," McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, New York, 1940</span>.
  Humphreys reports that a temperature inversion (near the surface) of 1 deg. C per meter bends down a light ray into an
  arc whose radius is 0.16 that of the earth; an inversion of 10 deg. C per meter gives an arc radius of 0.016 that of
  the earth, or approximately 60 miles. This effect makes it possible for an observer to see in the sky the sun or some
  other bright light that is actually well below the observer's horizon. On rare occasions, multiple images of the same
  object may be visible. It is believed that many visual sightings of flying saucers can be explained by this
  phenomenon. </p>
