<p> August 13-14, 1952. </p>
<p>The observation period started at 1830 Eastern standard time (EST) on the evening of August 13. At the beginning of
  this period, the moving target indicator was gated to cancel out ground returns up to a range of 10 nautical miles.
  Beyond this range the scope was clear except for a few permanent echoes that were visible.</p>
<p> Suddenly, at approximately 1957 EST, a group of seven strong stationary targets became visible in an area about 15
  miles north-northeast of the radar antenna. During the next two or three antenna revolutions, the area on the scope
  between Washington and Baltimore became heavily sprinkled with stationary targets in a belt about 6 miles wide. A
  group of additional targets became visible in an area approximately 10 to 15 miles south of the radar antenna. This
  was evidence of the beginning of a temperature inversion. </p>
<p>Within the next minute, at approximately 1958 EST. four unidentified moving targets showed up 5 miles southeast of
  the radar antenna and moved in a southerly direction away from it. When the radar beam was switched from high to low,
  the targets disappeared. The beam was switched back to high, and the targets returned. </p>
<p>Targets were uniformly small and usually had a weak, fuzzy appearance. However, the target intensity varied from
  sweep to sweep. Occasionally one or two very strong returns would be received in succession, followed by almost total
  blanking.</p>
<p><a id="One">For</a> the next four and one-half hours, many unidentified targets were carefully plotted with a grease
  pencil on the face of the Type VG scope. The time for each was entered on these plots in order to calculate ground
  speeds. To secure a permanent record, time data and track plots were transferred from the scope face to a sheet of
  frosted acetate. These plots are reproduced in<a href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/fig1-2.htm"> Figs. 1,
    2</a>, and <a href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/fig3.htm">Fig. 3</a>. The distribution of target ranges is
  shown in <a href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/fig4.htm">Fig. 4</a>. The average distance that any target was
  tracked continuously was approximately 2.1 nautical miles.</p>
<p> The observation period was discontinued at 0030 EST on August 14, and steps were taken to secure all available
  meteorological data relevant to the observation period. The local radiosonde observation which was taken near the
  midpoint of the observation period, at 2200 EST on August 13, is reproduced in <a
      href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/fig5-8.htm">Fig. 5</a>. Winds aloft, as observed at the same time, are
  listed in Table II. </p>
<p>August 15-16, 1952. </p>
<p>On the night of August 15-16, additional track plots were obtained by Washington ARTC Center personnel. During this
  period, the radar was operating on the high beam with the moving target indicator gated to 12 miles. The same
  stationary targets in the Washington-Baltimore belt and in an area 10 to 15 miles south of the radar antenna were
  visible again on the scope face. </p>
<p>Track plots for this period are shown in <a href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/fig5-8.htm">Figs. 6 and 7</a>.
  The local radiosonde observation taken at 2200 EST on August 15 is reproduced in <a
      href="https://www.cufon.org/cufon/wash_nat/fig5-8.htm">Fig. 8</a>. Winds aloft, as observed at the same time, are
  listed in Table III.</p>
