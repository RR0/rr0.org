<p class="abstract">On the Lookout For the Flying Saucers?</p>
<p>Ottawa, Nov. 11—The world's first scientific flying saucer sighting station is being constructed by Canadian
  electronic engineers at Shirley's Bay, 10 miles northwest of here.</p>
<p>The work of "<a href="/org/ca/nrc/projet/Magnet/index.html">Project Magnet</a>"—code name for the secret development
  of a flying disc powered by electromagnetic propulsion—the station is being equipped with every conceivable type of
  recording device in the hope of obtaining the scientific measurements necessary to prove or disprove the existence of
  flying saucers.</p>
<h2>Station Manned 24 Hours a Day</h2>
<p>When completed, the station will be manned 24 hours a day. I will contain the various types of radar, an ionosphere
  recorder, a magnetometer to mesure electrical charge, a recording gravometer to measure gravity and a radio set
  running full volume at 530 kilocycles to pick up any radio noise.</p>
<p>A bell will ring when any instrument is activated and personnel will be instructed to make such visual observation as
  they can. The all-important records, however, will be made by the instruments in the hope of getting any measurement
  to which we can attach a number."</p>
<h2>To Provide Proof, Now Lacking</h2>
<p>It is this lind of scientific proof which has been lacking in the saucer sightings obtained so far in both this
  country and the United States. Because of this lack, scientists and officials who have analyzed flying saucer reports
  are split into two camps. One group—apparently the minority—is convinced that the weight of available evidence
  supports the belief that the saucers exist. The other group is equally satisfied that the sightings can be explained
  in the more conventional terms of atmospheric conditions, optical illusions and astronomical observations.</p>
<h3>New Cycle Due</h3>
<p>Both groups are agreed, however, that nowhere in the world is there data constituting complete scientific proof of
  flying saucers. The Shirley's Bay station will be the first attempt to secure such data. While it will be ready by the
  end of the year, its worth is not expected to be established until late summer of next year when, on basis of past
  experience, another cycle of saucer sightings should be at its height.</p>
<p>"Project Magnet" researchers have found that flying saucer reports have come in flurries about two years and two
  months apart. It may or may not be significant that they have occured when the planet <a
      href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/mars/index.html">Mars</a> has been in opposition to the <a
      href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/index.html">earth</a> and that reports are most frequent when <a
      href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/mars/index.html">Mars</a> reaches its closest point to the <a
      href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/index.html">earth</a>. The last batch of sightings was in
  July-September, 1952, and very few reports are now being received by the Defence Research board here. According to
  this cycle, reports will become frequent again next summer.</p>

<p>Since the board began systematic investigation of flying saucer sightings early in 1952, heavy secrecy has surrounded
  the work. It is known, however, that a considerable number of reports have been received on the special forms printed
  in order to obtain as much precise observation as possible from the person or instrument making the sighting. While
  not classified material, these forms are held to be "for official use only." The board has never published any
  analysis of them or made any report on progress of the investigation.</p>
<p>It is no secret, however, that official opinion is deeply divided on interpretation of the evidence available thus
  far. Dr. J. J. Green, <a href="/org/ca/drb/index.html">DRB</a> aeronautics expert in charge of the investigation, is
  content to dismiss <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/FlyingSaucers.html">saucers</a> as non-existent. At the other extreme
  is <a
      href="/people/s/SmithWilbertBrooker/index.html">Wilbur B. Smith</a>, engineer in charge of "<a
      href="/org/ca/nrc/projet/Magnet/index.html">Project Magnet</a>," in the telecommunications divisions of the <a
      href="/org/ca/DoT.html">department of transport</a>.</p>
<h3>Sees "90% Probability"</h3>
<p>The department has meteorological officers and radio operators from coast to coast and sea captains beyond that, all
  under standing instructions to report strange phenomena; it supplies by far the bulk of the sighting reports.</p>
<p>Analysis of all reports is done on a "probability" basis and had led Mr. Smith to conclude there is a 90 to 95 per
  cent probability that the sighted phenomena actually existed - in other words, that it was not a hoax or a delusion of
  the mind. There is a 60 per cent probability that they originate on the earth, and a 30 per cent probability that they
  constitute something of which man knows and can conceive absolutely nothing—for example, some form of time travel
  involving a form of life other than protoplasma.</p>
<p>In the middle between Dr. Green and Mr. Smith is the opinion represented by Dr. Peter Millman, astrophysicist at the
  Dominion Observatory. Dr. Millman agrees with Mr. Smith that the great majority of reported sightings are related to
  actual phenomena but feels the weight of evidence supports more conventional explanations. Not all sightings can be so
  explained, he admits, but this only emphasizes that man's existing knowledge is relatively very limited.</p>
<h3>Obtain Some Measurements</h3>
<p>While data which will satisfy the scientific method is lacking, some measurements — chiefly radarscope plots of
  speeds and distances — have been obtained on saucer sightings. To refute these, the saucer sceptics only rely on the
  temperature inversion explanation put forward by Dr. <a href="/people/m/MenzelDonaldH/index.html">Donald Menzel</a> of
  Harvard University. This is simply the atmospheric condition which produces mirages in the key and it is argued that
  it can also cause an earthward refraction of the radar beam, with the result that ground objects are picked up on the
  screen.</p>
<p>Those who take the same attitude as Dr. Millman feel that the <a href="/people/m/MenzelDonaldH/index.html">Menzel</a>
  explanation is at least a step toward a complete explanation, but Mr. Smith finds two basic objections: The geometry
  of the theory won't hold water and the source of light of the ground objects being picked up would have to be
  tremendously powerful — so much so that they could not escape normal observation.</p>
<h3>Could Use Electric Reaction</h3>
<p>Mr. Smith's personal belief that saucer sightings are related to alien vehicles, probably powered by electromagnetic
  propulsion, and coming from outer space, may at least be argued consistently. Scientists have long been aware that the
  creation a magnetic "sink"—a collapse of the earth's magnetic field — would release electrical current and could be
  used to develop powerful reaction forces capable of driving a suitably designed aircraft at fantastic speed.</p>
<p>"<a href="/org/ca/nrc/projet/Magnet/index.html">Project Magnetic</a>" is an effort to create such a magnetic sink and
  to use the current to propel a flying disc. Laboratory experiments have satisfactorily proven the theory but
  researchers so far have been unable to create a sink which lasts for more than a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>The project has thus run into a stone wall. Scientists do not know how to make a permanent magnetic sink even in
  theory, and they do not know enough about the nature of energy to produce a source of power capable of meeting the
  demands of a flying saucer. (This, of course, does not apply to the saucer-shaped aircraft which <a
      href="/org/ca/Avro/index.html">A. V. Roe</a> Company Malton is designing to use gas-turbine propulsion.)</p>
<p>There is no reason to believe these difficulties are insurmountable. Supporters of the project point out that man's
  knowledge of electronics is less that 100 years old and his knowledge of nucleonics only 10 years old. One problem is
  the staggering mathematical calculations involved: project engineers have been unable to find a mathematician able to
  solve their questions. This has meant going back of finding a form in which the problem can be submitted to an
  electronic computer. An informed estimate would be that it will take 10 to 25 years before the nature of electrical
  fields is adequately understood to carry the project to the next stage.</p>
<p>How a human being could live in such a machine and withstand the tremendous gravitational forces which would be
  created might be relatively simple. Researchers believe the cabin of the flying disc could be completely filled with
  water containing at least 10 per cent oxygen. Human lungs would act as fish gills and a person could "breathes" such a
  solution reasonably comfortably. Immersed in the water, he would be immune to the force of gravity.</p>
<h3>Sure Man Will Do It</h3>
<p>Because he is convinced man will eventually be able to build a flying saucer. Mr. Smith sees no reason to doubt that
  some being on some other planet has already done so. He therefore feels that the public should be fully informed on
  this possibility and its co-operation sought in obtaining accurate observations of unusual phenomena. While this would
  produce a great raft of spurious sightings, these can be easily weeded out from the legitimate ones worthy of
  analysis.</p>
<p>Since the saucer believers are in a minority in official circles, it is not likely that any official information on
  sighting reports will be publicized, unless and until science is able to produce a conventional explanation which
  covers almost all cases. It is generally agreed that the average layman wold conclude from the more dramatic sighting
  reports that flying saucers do indeed exist.</p>
<p>One of the Canadian sightings, for example, took place over an airport at night. Several persons saw a disc-like
  object moving at low altitude over the field at about 60 miles an hour. A searchlight caught the object in its beam
  for a moment, at which point it zipped skyward at an incredible speed. Sightings of this kind, it is believed, are by
  no means rare, but it is precisely because they are dramatic and relatively common that most scientists fear they will
  never be able to present a conventional explanation if publicity is given to them.</p>
