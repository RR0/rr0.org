<p>The mystery of flying saucers is being investigated by Canadian scientists on the grounds of the ionospheric
  observatory of the transport department at Shirley's Bay, 10 miles northwest of Ottawa. Some of the towers are shown
  here. The sighting station is being operated under the direction of W. B. Smith, engineer in charge of the broadcast
  and measurement section of the department. He says "we hope to find something tangible about saucers."</p>
