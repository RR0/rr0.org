<p>En <a href="../../../../../../0/3/index.html">1903</a>, Blondlot, qui était un scientifique français de bonne
  réputation, membre de l'Académie des Sciences, expérimentait les rayons X comme pratiquement tout le monde à cette
  époque. L'effet qu'il observa était quelque chose de ce genre. Je n'en livrerai pas tout ici, je donnerai juste
  quelques points principaux. Il découvrit que si vous avez un fil chaud, un fil de platinum, ou un filament de Nerns ou
  quoi que ce soit qui soit chauffé très fort à l'intérieur d'un tube de fer et que vous aviez une fenêtre découpée
  dedans et que vous avez un morceau d'aluminum épais d'environ 1/8<sup>ème</sup> de pouce dessus, que certains rayons
  sortent par cette fenêtre d'aluminum. Oh, ça peut faire jusqu'à 2 ou 3 pouces d'épaisseur et traverser l'aluminum, ces
  rayons le peuvent, mais pas à travers le fer. Les rayons qui sortent de cette petite fenêtre tombent sur un objet
  faiblement éclairé, de sorte que vous pouvez à peine le voir. Vous devez vous asseoir dans une pièce sombre pendant
  longtemps et il utilise un écran de sulfide de calcium qui peut être illuminé par la lumière et émettre une lueur très
  faible qui pourrait être vue dans une pièce sombre. Ou il utilise une source de lumière d'une lampe brillant à travers
  un trou d'épingle et peut-être à travers un autre trou d'épingle de façon à avoir une faible lumière sur une surface
  blanche qui était à peine visible. </p>
<p>Maintenant il découvre que si vous allumez cette lampe de sorte que les rayons qui sortent de cette petite fente
  d'aluminum tomberaient sur ce morceau de papier que vous cherchez, vous pouvez mieux le voir. Oh, <em>encore</em>
  mieux, et par conséquent vous pourriez dire si les rayons passeraient à travers ou non. Il dit par la suite que cela
  demandait une grande compétence. Il dit que que vous ne deviez jamais regarder la source. Vous ne la regardez pas
  directement. Il dit que ça fatiguerait vos yeux. Regardez au loin d'elle, et il dit que bientôt vous alliez le voi, ou
  que vous le voyiez pas, suivant que les rayons N brillent ou pas sur ce morceau de papier. Ainsi, vous pouvez détecter
  ou non si les rayons N agissent. </p>
<p>Eh bien, il trouva que les rayons N pouvaient être stockés dans des choses. Par exemple, vous pouviez prendre une
  brique. Il trouva que les rayons N passeraient à travers un papier noir et passeraient à travers l'aluminum. Donc il
  prit du papier noir et enveloppa complètement une brique à l'intérieur dehors dans la rue et laissa le soleil briller
  à travers le papier noir puis il trouva que la brique stockait les rayons N et émettait les rayons N même avec le
  papier noir dessus. Il l'amenait au laboratoire et vous teniez alors ça près du morceau de papier que vous regardiez,
  faiblement illuminé, et vous pouviez le voir plus précisément. Mieux encore, si les rayons N sont là, mais pas si
  c'est trop loin. Puis, he would have very faint strips of phosphorescent paint and would let a beam of N-rays from two
  slits come over and he would find exactly where this thing intensified its beam.</p>
<p>Well, you'd think he'd make such experiments as this. To see if with ten bricks you got a stronger effect than you
  did with one. No, not at all. He didn't get any stronger effect. It didn't do any good to increase the intensity of
  the light. You had to depend upon whether you could see it or whether you couldn't see it. And there, the N-rays were
  very important. </p>
<p>Now, a little later, he found that many kinds of things gave off N- rays. A human being gave off N-rays, for
  example. If someone else came into the room, then you probably could see it. He also found that if someone made a loud
  noise that would spoil the effect. You had to be silent. Heat, however, increased the effect, radiant heat. Yet that
  wasn't N-rays itself. N-rays were not heat because heat wouldn't go through aluminum. Now he found a very interesting
  thing about it was that if you take the brick that's giving off N-rays and hold it close to your head it goes (p.5)
  through your skull and it allows you to see the paper better. Or you can hold the brick near the paper, that's all
  right too. </p>
<p>Now he found that there were some other things that were like negative N-rays. He called them N'-rays. The effect of
  the N'-rays is to decrease the visibility of a faintly illuminated slit. That works too, but only if the angle of
  incidence is right. If you look at it tangentially you find that the thing in-creases the intensity when you look at
  it from this point of view. It decreases if you look at it normally and it increases if you look at it tangentially.
  All of which is very interesting. And he published many papers on it. One right after the other and other people did
  too, confirming Blondlot's results. And there were lots of papers published and at one time about half of them that
  were confirming' the results of Blondlot. You see, N-rays ought to be important because x-rays were known to be
  important and alpha rays were, and N-rays were somewhere in between so N-rays must be very important. (Laughter)</p>
<p>Well, R. W. Wood heard about these experiments--everybody did more or less. So R. W. Wood went over there and at
  that time Blondlot had a prism, quite a large prism of aluminum, with a 60o angle and he had a Nernst filament with a
  little slit about 2 mm wide. There were two slits, 2 mm wide each. This beam fell on the prism and was refracted and
  he measured the refractive index to three significant figures. He found that it wasn't monochromatic, that there were
  several different components to the N-rays and he found different refractive indices for each of these components. He
  could measure three or four different refractive indices each to two or three significant figures, and he was
  repeating some of these and showing how accurately they were repeatable, showing it to R. W. Wood in this dark
  room. </p>
<p>Well, after this had gone on for quite a while, and Wood found that he was checking these results very accurately,
  measuring the position of the little piece of paper within a tenth of a millimeter although the slits were 2 mm wide,
  and Wood asked him about that. He said, "How? How could you, from just the optics of the thing, with slits two
  millimeters wide, how do you get a beam so fine that you can detect its position within a tenth of a millimeter?" </p>
<p>Blondlot said, "That's one of the fascinating things about the N-rays. They don't follow the ordinary laws of
  science that you ordinarily think of." He said, "You have to consider these things all by themselves. They are very
  interesting, but you have to discover the laws that govern them." </p>
<p>Well, in the meantime, the room being very dark, Wood asked him to repeat some of these measurements which he was
  only too glad to do. But in the meantime, R. W. Wood put the prism in his pocket and the results checked perfectly
  with what he had before. (Laughter) Well, Wood rather cruelly published that.(6, 7) And that was the end of
  Blondlot. </p>
<p>Nobody accounts for by what methods he could reproduce those results to a tenth of a millimeter. Wood said that he
  seemed to be able to do it but no-body understands that. Nobody understands lots of things. But some of the Germans
  came out later--Pringsheim was one of them--came out with an extremely interesting story. They had tried to repeat
  some of Blondlot's experiments and had found this. One of the experiments was to have a very faint source of light on
  a screen of paper and to make sure that you are seeing the screen of paper you hold your hand up like this and move it
  back and forth. And if you can see your hand move back and forth then you know it ie illuminated. One of the
  experiments that Blondlot made was that the experiment was made much better if you had some N-rays falling on the
  piece of paper. Pringeheim was repeating these in Germany and he found that if you didn't know where the paper was,
  whether it was here or here (in front or behind your hand), it worked just as well. That is, you could see your hand
  just as well if you held it back of the paper as if you held it in front of it. Which is the natural thing, because
  this is a threshold phenomenon. And a threshold phenomenon means that you don't know, <u>you really don't know</u>,
  whether you are seeing it or not. But if you have your hand there, well, of course, you see your hand because you <u>know</u>
  your hand's there, and that's just enough to win you over to where you know that you see it. But you know it just as
  well if the paper happens to be in front of your hand instead of in back of your hand, because you don't know where
  the paper is but you <u>do</u> know where your hand is. (Laughter) <a id="MitoRays"></a></p>
