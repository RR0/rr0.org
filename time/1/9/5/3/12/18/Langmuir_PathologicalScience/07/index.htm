<p> I'm not going to talk about flying saucers very much except just this. A flying saucer is not exactly science,
  although some scientific people have written things about them. I was a member of General Schwartz's (?) Advisory
  Committee after the war, and we held some very secret meetings in Washington in which there was a thing called project
  SIGN. I think it's s-i-g- n. Anyway, it was hushed up. It was hardly even talked about and it was the flying saucer
  stuff, gathering the evidence, and weighing and evaluating the data on flying saucers. And he said, "You know, it's
  very serious, it really looks as though there is something there." Well, I told him afterwards--I told him this story
  here. I said that it seems to me from what I know about flying saucers they look like this sort of thing. Well,
  any-way, it ended up by two men being brought to Schenectady with a boiled down group of about twenty or thirty best
  cases from hundreds and hundreds that they knew all about. I didn't want them all, I said to pick out about thirty or
  forty of the best cases, and bring them to Schenectady, and we'll spend a couple of days going over them, and he
  did. </p>
<p> Most of them were Venus seen in the evening through a murky atmosphere. Venus can be seen in the middle of the day
  if you know where to look for it. Almost any clear bright day especially when Venus is at its brightest, and sometimes
  it's caused almost panic. It has caused traffic congestion in New York City when Venus is seen in the evening near
  some of the buildings around Times Square and people thought it was a comet about to collide with the earth, or
  somebody from Mars, or something of that sort. That was a long time ago. That was thirty or forty years ago. Venus
  still causes flying saucers. </p>
<p> Well, they only had one photograph or two photographs taken by one man. It looked to me like a piece of tar paper
  when I first saw it and the two photographs showed the thing in entirely different shapes. I asked for more details
  about it. What was the weather at the time? Well, they didn't know but they'd look it up. And they got out some papers
  and there it was. It was taken about 'fifteen or twenty minutes after a violent thunderstorm out in Ohio. Well, what'
  s more natural than some piece of tar paper picked up by a little miniature twister and being carried a few thousand
  feet up into the clouds and it was coming <u>down</u>, that's all. So what could it be? " But it was going at an
  enormous speed." Of course the man who saw it didn't have the vaguest idea of how far away it was. That's the trouble.
  If you see something that's up in the sky, a light or any kind of an object, you haven't the vaguest idea of how big
  it is. You can guess anything you like about the speed. You ask people how big the moon is. Some say it is as big as
  your fist, or as big as a baseball Some say as big as a house. Well, how big is it really". You can't tell by
  looking at it. How can you tell how big a flying saucer is? Well, anyway, after I went through these things I didn't
  find a single one that made any sense at all. There was nothing consistent about them. They were all things that
  suffered from these facts. They were all subjective. They were all near a threshold. You don't know what the threshold
  is exactly in detecting the velocity of an object that you see up in the sky, where you don't know whether it's a
  thousand feet or ten thousand feet or a hundred thousand feet up. But they all fitted in with this general pattern,
  namely, that there doesn't seem to be any evidence that there is anything in them. And, anyway, these men were
  convinced and they ended project SIGN. And later the whole thing was de-classified and the thing was written up by the
  Saturday Evening Post about four or five years ago. At any rate, that seemed to be the end of it. But, of course, the
  newspapers wouldn't let a thing like that die. (Laughter) It keeps coming up again, and again, and again, and the old
  story keeps coming back again. It always has. It's probably hundreds of years old anyway. </p>
<p> Well, I think that's about all. If there are any questions, I'd be happy to say more. </p>
