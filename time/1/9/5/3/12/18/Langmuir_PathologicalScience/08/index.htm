<p><strong>W. C. White</strong>: People may want to go now because it's quarter after five though I'm sure Dr. Langmuir
  would be glad to discuss this some more. </p>
<p> I was going to add another one to these characteristics. Isn't the desire for publicity another of the
  characteristics?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Well, it is in Rhine's case. There is no question about that. Rhine, I think,
  ........................... <u> thinks</u> he's honest, but I know perfectly well that he--everything he says, he
  talks about the importance of getting more students, and the importance of having the people in his own university
  understand the importance of this thing and so on. And then the fact that no man in his senses could discard data the
  way he did those things sealed up in the cards. So I don't hold a very high value on his work. Now the other people, I
  don't have the slightest doubt but what these men are really honest. They are sincere. They loved publicity; Allison,
  of course, loved to publish about new elements one after the other. These were published by the American Chemical
  Society; and Latimer liked to publish his little article on tritium, the first (p.11) discovery of tritium. So I think
  that has something to do with it, but I don't think that that's the driving force. I think the driving force is quite
  a normal scientific desire to make discoveries and to understand things. Davis and Barnes were finding things and it
  was wonderful while it lasted.</p>
<p><strong>Q (Liebhafsky):</strong> I just wanted to point out that perhaps the neatest comment on item four was made at
  the University of California when this business was discussed at the Research Conference there in about 1930 or 32.
  Professor Birge said that this effect was just Allison wonderland. (Laughter)</p>
<p> (<strong>Langmuir): </strong>Did you ever hear Latimer talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>(Liebhafsky):</strong> Well, Latimer was pushing it and you've got to allow for Latimer's persuasiveness.
  There were people on the faculty that I'm sure never believed it.</p>
<p><strong>(Langmuir):</strong> But it was funny that G. N. Lewis would believe it.</p>
<p><strong>(Liebhafsky):</strong> Well, you know that there is a very close personal relationship between Latimer and
  Lewis. </p>
<p><strong>(Langmuir):</strong> I understand that Lewis got back his ten dollars. (Laughter) </p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How would an analysis like this apply to religious experiences? </p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Well, the method of approach to religious questions--a lot of people think you don't want to have
  any evidence, you want faith; and if that's your attitude why I don't think this thing applies. But if some religious
  performer of a certain belief tries to argue with me, my reactions would be very much like this. </p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> In setting up these criteria, you may in a way limit the possibilities of scientific
  investigation. It occurred to me that suppose something happened in the heavens--some astronomical event--that nobody
  had ever seen before. Something that happens once in a million years. Really, I mean, supposing that you could tell.
  It would fit the same criterion, wouldn't it? </p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> No, I don't want to depend on any one of these. I've been reading the life of Pasteur. Pasteur
  had the idea of germs. Everybody thought that he was a fool -- thought there couldn't be any sense to the subject. It
  took a long time before germs were believed. People believed in spontaneous generation of new forms of life. They
  happened spontaneously not by the introduction of spares from the outside but spontaneously -- and Pasteur had to
  fight that. The test of time is the thing that ultimately checks this thing. In the end, something is salvaged. You
  can't do that while the thing is growing, while the thing is being discussed, but in the end you do know that the
  Allison effect is gone. It never would be anything. And that's what I mean about these other things. We've waited long
  enough now. This whole pattern of things fits together with the idea that you're at a threshold. You're right at the
  point where things are very difficult to see--that's what I want to bring out. Now, in Pasteur's experiments, when he
  killed anthrax in animals, he got 25 right out of 25. The sheep all died or they didn't die. There was no threshold
  value about it. People who didn't know anything about it might have thought so, but when they saw one experiment they
  were convinced. </p>
<p>One more question - </p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> These criteria that you put down would apply very well to the theory of relativity with
  measurements of very small fractions of a degree of arc in the neighborhood of a bright disk of the sun. </p>
<p><strong>A. </strong> Yes, well now take an example I've often thought of. There are lots of scientific instances.
  They go through the same sort of stage. For instance, in Laue and Bragg's theory of x-rays being electromagnetic
  waves. When the first reports came out you had to keep an absolutely open mind about them. You didn't know but what
  this was just another case of wishful thinking. But how long did it take? Within three or four years they were making
  precision measurements of the wavelengths of x-rays--very, very few years. Now, that's just what <u> doesn't</u>
  happen in these things. So you have to wait a little time for these things to prove themselves but I don't think that
  you will find that there's anything more than a superficial resemblance. Take the first experiments of the wave theory
  of electrons. The first evidence was very poor, and more people had to be brought in, but to me the important thing
  was not how it looked at the time but the quickness with which those results were resolved as contrasted to these
  things that hang fire and hang fire. Now the Davis-Barnes effect and the N-rays were quenched suddenly; but most of
  these other things go on, and on, and on, and on. </p>
<p><strong>(White):</strong> I believe that this is the latest lasting colloquium we've ever had that I remember. It was
  a great privilege to have such a speaker. We thank you, Dr. Langmuir. </p>
