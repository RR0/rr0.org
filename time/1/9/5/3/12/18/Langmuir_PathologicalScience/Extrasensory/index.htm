<p>Well, there's Rhine. I spent a day with Rhine at Duke University at the meeting of the American Chemical Society,
  probably about 1934. Rhine had published a book and I'll just tell you a few things. First of all, I went in and told
  Rhine these things. I told him the whole story. I said these things (Table I) are the characteristics of those things
  that aren't so. They are all characteristics of your thing too. (Laughter) He said, &rdquo;I wish you'd publish that.
  I'd love to have you publish it. That would stir up an awful lot of interest." He said, "I'd have more graduate
  students. We ought to have more graduate students. This thing is so important that we should have more people realize
  its importance. This should be one of the biggest departments in the university." </p>
<p>Well, I won't tell you the whole story with Rhine, because I talked with him all day. He uses cards which you guess
  at by turning over. You have extra-sensory perception. You have 25 cards and you deal them out face down, or one
  person looks at them, and the other person on the other side of the screen looks at them and you read his mind. The
  other thing is for nobody to know what the cards are, in which case they are turned over without anybody looking at
  them. You record them and then you look them up and see if they check and that's telepathy, or clairvoyance rather.
  Telepathy is when you can read another person's mind. </p>
<p>Now a later form of the thing would be for you to decide now and write down what the cards are going (p.9) to be when
  they are shuffled tomorrow. That works too. (Laughter) </p>
<p> All of these things are nice examples where the magnitude of the effect is entirely independent of magnitude of the
  cause. That is, the experiments worked just as well where the shuffling is to be done tomorrow as when it was done
  some time ago. It doesn't make any difference in the results. There is no appreciable difference between clairvoyance
  and telepathy. Although, if you try to think of the mechanisms of the two, it should be quite different. In order to
  get the cards to telegraph you all the information that's in them as to how they are arranged, and so on, when they
  are stacked up on top of each other and to have it given in the right sequence, it is rather difficult to think of a
  mechanism. On the other hand, it is conceivable that there may be some sort of mechanism in the brain that might send
  out some sort of unknown messages that could be picked up by some other brain. That's a different order of magnitude.
  A different order of difficulty. But they were all the same from Rhine's point of view. </p>
<p> Well, now, the little things that I have are these. There are many more I could give you. Rhine said being in quite
  a philosophical mood, "It's funny how the mind tries to trick you." He said, "People don't like these experiments.
  I've had millions of these cases where the average is about 7 out of 25." You'd expect 5 out of 25 to come right by
  chance and on the grand average they come out, oh, out of millions, or hundreds of millions of cases, they average
  around 7. Well, to get 7 out of 25 would be a common enough occurrence but if you take a large number and you get 7,
  well you doubt the statistics or the statistical application or, above all, what I think of and I want to give you
  reasons for thinking, is the rejection of a small percentage of the data. </p>
<p> I'll go first, before I get into what Rhine said, and say this: David Langmuir, a nephew of mine, who was in the
  Atomic Energy Commission, when he was with the Radio Corporation of America a few years ago, he and a group of other
  young men thought they would like to check up Rhine's work so they got some cards and they spent many evenings
  together finding how these cards turned up and they got well above 5. They began to get quite excited about it and
  they kept on, and they kept on, and they were right on the point of writing Rhine about the thing. And they kept on a
  little longer and things began to fall off, and fall off a little more, and they fell off a little more. And after
  many, many, many days, they fell down to an average of five--grand average--so they <u> didn't</u> write to Rhine. Now
  if Rhine had received that information, that this reputable body of men had gone ahead and gotten a value of 8 or 9 or
  10 after so many trials, why he would have put it in his book How much of that sort of thing, when you are fed
  information of that sort by people who are interested--how are you going to weigh the things that are published in the
  book? </p>
<p> Now an illustration of how it works is this. He told me that, "People don't like me,&rdquo; he said "I took a lot of
  cards and sealed them up in envelopes and I put a code number on the outside, and I didn't trust anybody to know that
  code. Nobody!" </p>
<p> (A section of the speech is missing at this point. It evidently described some tests that gave scores below 5. )
  "... the idea of having this thing sealed up in the cards as though I didn't trust them, and therefore to spite me
  they made it purposely low."</p>
<p> "Well," I said, "that's interesting--interesting a lot, because you said that you'd published a summary of <u>
  all</u> of the data that you had. And it comes out to be 7. It is now within your power to take a larger percentage
  including those cards that are sealed up in those envelopes which could bring the whole thing back down to five. Would
  you do that? </p>
<p> "Of course not,&rdquo; he said. "That would be dishonest. " </p>
<p> "Why would it be dishonest?" </p>
<p> "The low scores are just as significant as the high ones, aren't they? They <u> proved</u> that there's something
  there just as much, and therefore it wouldn't be fair. " </p>
<p> I said, "Are you going to count them, are you going to reverse the sign and count them, or count them as
  credits?" </p>
<p> "No, No," he said. </p>
<p> I said, "What have you done with them? Are they in your book?" </p>
<p> "No." </p>
<p> "Why, I thought you said that all your values were in your book. Why haven't you put those in?" </p>
<p> "Well," he said, "I haven't had time to work them up." </p>
<p> "Well, you know all the results, you told me the results. " </p>
<p> "Well," he said, "I don't give the results out until I've had time to digest them." </p>
<p> I said, "How many of these things have you?&rdquo; He showed me filing cabinets--a whole row of them. Maybe hundreds
  of thousands of cards. He has a filing cabinet that contained nothing but these things that were done in sealed up
  envelopes. And they were the ones that gave the average of five. </p>
<p> Well, we'll let it stand at that. A year or so later, he published a new volume of his book. In that, there's a
  chapter on the sealed up cards in the (p.10) envelopes and they all come up to around seven. And nothing is said about
  the fact that for a long time they came down below five. You see, he <u> knows</u> if they come below five, he <u>
    knows</u> that isn't fair to the public to misrepresent this thing by including those things that prove just as much
  a positive result as though they came above. It's just a trick of the mind that these people do to try to spite you
  and of course it wouldn't be fair to publish.(12)</p>
