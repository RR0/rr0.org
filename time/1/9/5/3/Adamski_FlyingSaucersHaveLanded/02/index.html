<p>We shall not go back too far at first. A.D. 1290 is as good a place to begin as any. We have on our right, Ladies and
  Gentlemen, an old manuscript discovered at Ampleforth Abbey in January 1953, which gives a very clear account of a
  flying saucer passing over the startled community of Byland Abbey in Yorkshire.
</p>
<p>‘oves a Wilfredo susceptos die festo sanctissimorum Simonis atque Judae assaverunt. Cum autem Henricus abbas gratias
  redditurus erat, frater quidam Joannes introivit, magnam portentem foris esse referebat. Turn vero omnes
  ecuccurrerunt, et ecce res grandis, circumcircularis argentea, disco quodam hand dissimilis, lente e super eos volans
  atque maximam terrorem exitans. Quo tempore Henricus abbas exclamavit Wilfredum adulteravisse (qua) de causa impius
  esse de .. .’
</p>
<p>A. X. Chumley, who supplied this information, gives the following translation:
</p>
<p>‘Took the sheep from Wilfred and roasted them on the feast of S.S. Simon and Jude. But when Henry the Abbott was
  about to say grace, John, one of the brethren, came in and said there was a great portent outside. Then they all ran
  out, and Lo ! a large round silver thing like a disk flew slowly over them and excited the greatest terror. Whereat
  Henry the Abbot immediately cried that Wilfred was an adulterer, wherefore it was impious to...’ 3
</p>
<p>3/ These seven incidents are reprinted with the kind permission of the Editors of Time and Life International,
  published 5 May 1952, copyright Time Inc., with acknowledgments to H. B. Darrack, jnr., and Robert Ginna.
</p>
<p>There is a remarkable similarity in this report to that sent to the Editor of the London Observer on 23 March 1953 by
  Bruce Angrave, m.s.i.a., who also saw a large round silver thing like a disk pass slowly over Milan Cathedral on 2
  November 1952. And there are several hundred other modern reports that use exactly the same phrase for describing the
  appearance of a flying saucer—’ a large silver round thing.’ And in December of 1952 a photograph of one was taken in
  Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia, that certainly fills the description given by the terrified and sex-scandalised monks of
  Byland in 1290. It is a pity the rest of the manuscript is missing. I long to hear what Brother Wilfred had been up
  to, and what the Abbot thought would be impious.
</p>
<p>What probably happened is that a flying saucer did, in fact, pass over Byland Abbey at the close of the thirteenth
  century and that the astute Abbot Henry seized the opportunity to admonish Wilfred for his carryings-on, and the
  community for their lack of piety. Whenever something inexplicable happens, the zealots of each age take it as a sign
  of celestial umbrage and hasten to warn their erring brethren; just as the Dutch Pastors were swift to declare the
  recent catastrophe a direct retribution for the sins of their sheep. Whereas, had they suggested it could have been
  the inevitable result of nuclear necromancy in another part of the Globe they might have come nearer to the truth.
</p>
<p>Our next exhibit is an old print showing the startled inhabitants of Devon gazing skywards at a neat V-shaped
  formation of dark elliptical objects (rather like tadpoles) with fins or streaming exhausts, that passed over Devon in
  1704. These things are not meteors, ‘Northern Lights’, nor comets. They are shown as dark solid objects, flying in
  formation, in broad daylight.
</p>
<p>And now, please, step into the seventeenth and eighteenth century galleries of the Flying Saucer Museum where we have
  an assembly of space-craft of all different shapes, hues and sizes, few of which can be glibly dismissed as meteors,
  aurora or other natural phenomena.

    Steaml transport is at its zenith. Crawling railways are covering Europ like busy spiders. Speeds of eighty miles an
    hour have been reached on the London-Scotland run. Speeches are made against the monstrousness of this scandalous
    velocity; the human body is not made to withstand such speeds. Fifty years earlier it was said it would disintegrate
    from the pressure of air if it exceeded twenty miles an hour. Meanwhile in Heaven, a huge projectile, super-rocket,
    flying disk or electric thunderbolt makes the journey from Mars to Earth in a matter of seconds. A blazing thing
    leaves the Planet Venus at time of close conjunction, and something tremendous, white and glowing leaves the Moon
    and speeds off into space.

    height, with remarkable dark markings down the centre.’ ‘Mottled appearance’, ‘definite in form, like a torpedo’,
    ‘magnificent luminous mass shaped like a torpedo’, ‘dark nucleus’, ‘definite structure’, ‘appeared to be a definite
    body’, ‘too fast for a cloud, but nothing could be more unlike the rush of a meteor’, say various observers. Seen
    also in Holland and Belgium.
  </p>
  <p>1883 August 12th. Observatory of Zacatecas, Mexico. Astronomer Bonilla sees 143 circular objects with projecting

  </p>
  <p>And that, Ladies and Gentlemen, brings us to the end of the nineteenth century gallery. Before entering the
    ‘Edwardian Hall’ you may sit down and rest your feet while the guide says a few words. Forgive him if he points out
    that all these objects seen tally in every respect with the things we make so much fuss about today and call flying
    saucers. Which brings us to the conclusion that saucers are not a new phenomenon. All that is new is our improved
    method of transmitting news; we get quicker, better reports, and more of them.

  <h3>EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY GALLERY</h3>
  <p>1901 April 4th. Persian Gulf. Revolving luminous wheels seen near the surface by the ship Kilwa.</p>
  <p>1902 May 10th. South Devon. Large number of highly-coloured objects like ‘small suns’, reported by a Colonel
    Markwick.
  </p>
  <p>1904 February 24th. The s.s Supply sighted three luminous disks four times the sun’s area. They flew in accurate
    formation, first below some clouds, estimated at 5,000 feet. Later they rose into the cloud-layer and disappeared.
  </p>
  <p>1905 September 2nd. Llangollen, North Wales. Intensely dark object flying at an estimated height of two miles.
  </p>
  <p>March 29th. Cardiff, Wales. A vertical tube of light appears in the sky ‘like an iron bar heated to an
    orange-coloured glow’, say witnesses.
  </p>
  <p>April 1st. Cherbourg, France. Glowing disk, with corona, seen over the town several nights in succession.</p>
  <p>February 1st. Daily Mail reports brilliant disk over Wales, which hung motionless for a time and later moved off.
  </p>
  <p>1906 June 2nd. Gulf of Oman. Revolving spokes of light seen on water near a ship, reports a Mr. Carnegie, of
    Blackheath, Kent.
  </p>
  <p>1907 March 14th. Malacca Strait. ‘Shafts which seemed to move round a centre like the spokes of a wheel—about three
    hundred yards long’, reports the P. & O. s.s. Orient.
  </p>
  <p>July 2nd. Burlington, Vermont. A huge dark torpedo hovers over the city. From holes down its side issue tongues of
    fire and shooting sparks. It is first seen stationary over College and Church Streets, following a loud report. Then
    the flames brighten and it moves off. A small luminous disk is seen to detach itself from the parent craft and
    disappear.
  </p>
  <p>1908 May 1st. Vittel, France. A luminous disk as large as the moon appears. It has a coronal band round it. After
    some time a black band appears obliquely across the disk.

  <p>May 18th. Caerphilly, Wales. A Cardiff man named Lithbridge says he was walking through the mountains when he came
    across a large cylindrical construction parked beside a lonely road. Inside it he saw two peculiar looking men
    dressed in some kind of fur coats. On seeing him they gabbled excitedly in a foreign language. The next minute the
    machine rose in the air and flew away. It had no wings and made little noise. A depression was found in the grass at
    the place he indicated—the first report in this century of one of these things seen on the ground.
  </p>

    Chattanooga, about noon today. It came from the north, and was travelling south-east... on Wednesday it came south,
    and on Thursday it returned north’. The longest dirigible flight then recorded was from St. Cyr to the Eiffel
    Tower—a few miles.
  </p>
  <p>1912 January 27th. A Dr. Harris observes a dark bird-shaped object, poised over the moon, estimates it to be 250
    miles long, at least.
  </p>

    Elstree, Herts.
  </p>
  <p>October 10th. A black torpedo crosses the sun. Reported as ‘extraordinarily clear cut’. Surrounded by corona or
    halo ‘like a ship throwing up white-foamed waves’.
  </p>
  <p>1915 July 31st. Ballinasloe, Ireland. Large luminous body moving north-west, remaining stationary for forty-five
    minutes, moving off and disappearing five hours after it first appeared. Venus again near to Earth.

    moving in leisurely formation, or singly, in the neighbourhood of the Brown Mountains. Much talk. Official
    investigation draws blank.
  </p>
  <p>1929 August 29th. 400 miles off Virginia Coast. Luminous body travelling at 100 miles per hour, seen by the
    steamship Coldwater. No Atlantic flights at that time. ‘Enough, enough !’
  </p>
  <p>* * * *</p>
  <p>‘Our feet are weary. The museum guide is hoarse. How much farther do you want us to walk ? How many more saucers
    are you going to give us ? Must we continue right up to the present day; till our eyes grow dim from looking at the
    sky ?’
  </p>
  <p>To which I answer:</p>
  <p>‘If you are by now convinced to your own satisfaction (not to mine) that flying saucers have been visiting our
    planet for the past three centuries and that few of them can be explained as weather balloons, secret weapons,
    illusions, meteors, ionised air and the rest, then by all means turn to Chapter Six and read on from there.
  </p>
  <p>But if you believe, like Dr. Donald Menzel, of Harvard Observatory, that all these things can be readily explained
    within our own atmosphere, then I shall drive you ruthlessly on to the bitter end.
  </p>
  <p>However, we shall not bother with Dr. Menzel for the moment, but shall concern ourselves with some other scientists
    who, unlike Menzel, have not written a book to prove that flying saucers are the result of human ignorance in
    misinterpreting ordinary phenomena.
  </p>
  <p>‘Incident 1. At 9.10 p.m. on 25 August 1951 Dr. W. I. Robinson, Professor of Geology at the Texas Technological
    College, stood in the back yard of his home in Lubbock, Texas, and chatted with two colleagues. The other men were
    Dr. A. G. Oberg, a Professor of Chemical Engineering, and Professor W. L. Ducker, Head of the Department of
    Petroleum Engineering. The night was clear and dark. Suddenly all three men saw a number of lights race noiselessly
    across the sky, from horizon to horizon, in a few seconds. They gave the impression of about thirty luminous beads,
    arranged in a crescent shape. A few moments later another similar formation flashed across the night. This time the
    scientists were able to judge that the lights moved through thirty degrees of arc in a second. A check the next day
    with the Air Force showed that no planes had been over the area at the time. This was but the beginning: Professor
    Ducker observed twelve flights of the luminous objects between August and November of last year. Some of his
    colleagues observed as many as ten. Hundreds of non-scientific observers in a wide vicinity around Lubbock have seen
    as many as three flights of the mysterious crescents in one night. On the night of 30 August an attempt to
    photograph the lights was made by eighteen-year-old Carl Hart, Jr. He used a Kodak 35mm. camera, at f.3.5 1/10 of a
    second. Working rapidly, Hart managed to get five exposures of the flights. One of the pictures exhibited by Hart as
    a result of this effort shows eighteen to twenty luminous objects, more intense than the planet Venus, arranged in
    one or a pair of crescents. In several photographs, off to one side of the main flight, a larger luminosity is
    visible—like a mother craft hovering near its aerial brood.’
  </p>
  <p>‘Evaluation. The observations have been too numerous and too similar to be doubted. In addition, the Air Force,
    after the closest examination, has found nothing fraudulent about Hart’s pictures. The lights are much too bright to
    be reflections, and, therefore, must be bodies containing sources of light. Since Professors Ducker, Oberg and
    Robinson could not measure the size and distance of the formations, they could form no precise estimate of their
    speed. However, they calculated that if the lights were flying at an altitude of 5,000 feet they must then have been
    travelling about 1,800 m.p.h. The Professors, along with other scientists, agree that in order to explain the
    silence of the objects it must be assumed that they were at least 50,000 feet in the air; in which case they were
    going not 1,800, but 18,000 m.p.h.’ Similar lines of light were seen in the skies of ancient Persia, usually before
    some national catastrophe, so that they became omens of disaster.
  </p>
  <p>‘Incident 2. On 10 July 1947 at 4.47 p.m. one of the United States’ top astronomers was driving from Clovis to
    Clines Corner, New Mexico. His wife and his teen-aged daughters were also in the car. (For professional reasons he
    had asked Life to withhold identity). It was a bright sunny day, but the whole western half of the sky was a
    "confused cloud sea". All at once, as the car headed towards these clouds, "all four of us almost simultaneously
    became aware of a curious bright object almost motionless " among the clouds. Instantly, from long habit in dealing
    with celestial phenomena, he began to make calculations with what crude materials he had at hand. He held a pencil
    at arm’s length, measured the size of the object against the windshield of the car, measured the distance between
    his eyes and the windshield, etc., etc. His wife and two daughters did the same, each making independent
    calculations.
  </p>
  <p>‘"The object", says the scientist," showed a sharp and firm regular outline, namely one of a smooth elliptical
    character much harder and sharper than the edges of the cloudlets…The hue of the luminous object was somewhat less
    white than the light of Jupiter in a dark sky, not aluminium or, silver-coloured... The object clearly exhibited a
    sort of wobbling motion... This wobbling motion served to set off the object as a rigid, if not solid, body." After
    thirty seconds in plain view, the ellipsoid moved slowly behind a cloud (273° azimuth, elevation 1°), " and we
    thought we had lost it." But approximately five seconds later it reappeared (275° azimuth, elevation 2°).
  </p>
  <p>‘"This remarkably sudden ascent thoroughly convinced me that we were dealing with an absolutely novel airborne
    device." After reappearing, the object moved slowly from south to north across the clouds. "As seen projected
    against these dark clouds, the object gave the strongest impression of self-luminosity." About two-and-a-half
    minutes after it came into view, the thing disappeared finally behind a cloudbank.’
  </p>
  <p>‘Evaluation. The astronomer vouches for the approximate accuracy of his observations and computations. He
    determined that the object was not less than twenty nor more than thirty miles from his viewing point; that it was
    ellipsoidal and rigid; that it was 160 feet long and sixty-five feet thick, if seen at minimum distance, or 245 feet
    long and 100 feet thick if at a maximum; and that its horizontal speed ranged between 120 and 180 m.p.h., and its
    vertical rise between 600 and 900 m.p.h. He also observed that the object moved with a wobble, no sound, and left no
    exhaust or vapour trail. His wife and daughters supported his observations.
  </p>
  <p>The object’s appearance and behaviour answer to that of no known optical or celestial phenomenon. No known or
    projected aircraft, rocket or guided missile can make such a rapid vertical ascent without leaving an exhaust or
    vapour trail.’
  </p>
  <p>‘Incident 3. On 24 April 1949 at 10.20 a.m. a group of five technicians under the general supervision of J. Gordon
    Vaeth, an aeronautical engineer employed by the Office of Naval Research, were preparing to launch a skyhook balloon
    near Arrey, New Mexico. A small balloon was sent up first to check the weather. Charles B. Moore, Jr., an aerologist
    of General Mills Inc. (pioneers in cosmic ray research), was tracing the weather balloon through a theodolite—a
    twenty-five power telescopic instrument which gives degrees of azimuth and elevation (horizontal and vertical
    position) for any object it is sighted on. At 10.30 a.m. Moore leaned back from the theodolite to glance at the
    balloon with his naked eye. Suddenly he saw a whitish elliptical object, apparently much higher than the balloon,
    and moving in the opposite direction. At once he picked the object up in his theodolite at 45° of elevation and 210°
    of azimuth, and tracked it east at the phenomenal rate of 4° of azimuth-change per second as it dropped swiftly to
    an elevation of 25°. The object appeared to be an ellipsoid roughly two-and-a-half times as long as it was wide.
    Suddenly it swung abruptly upward and rushed out of sight in a few seconds. Moore had tracked it for about sixty
    seconds altogether. The other members of his crew confirmed this report. No sound was heard, no vapour trail was
    seen. The object, according to rough estimations by Moore and his colleagues, was about fifty-six miles above the
    earth, 100 feet long and was travelling at seven miles per second.’
  </p>
  <p>‘Evaluation. No known optical or atmospheric phenomenon fits the facts. No natural object travelling at seven miles
    per second has ever been seen to make a sudden upward turn. There is no known or projected source of silent,
    vapour-less power for such a machine. No human being could have borne the tremendous " G " load brought to bear on
    the craft during its abrupt vertical veer.’
  </p>
  <p>‘Incident 4. On 29 May 1951 at 3.48 p.m. three technical writers for the aerophysics department of North American
    Aviation’s plant at Downey, outside Los Angeles, were chatting on the factory grounds. They were Victor Black,
    Werner Eichler and Ed. J. Sullivan. All at once they stared at the sky. Sullivan describes what they saw:
  </p>
  <p>‘“Approximately thirty glowing, meteor-like objects sprayed out of the east at a point about 45° above the horizon,
    executed a right-angle turn and swept across the sky in an undulating vertical formation... that resembled a tuning
    fork on edge. It took each of them about twenty-five seconds to cross 90° of the horizon before performing another
    right-angle turn westward toward downtown Los Angeles.... We estimated their diameter at thirty feet and their speed
    to be 1,700 m.p.h. Each appeared as an intense electric blue light, round and without length. They moved with the
    motion of flat stones skipping across a smooth pond ".’
  </p>
  <p>‘Evaluation. No known natural or optical phenomenon makes the peculiar light, in bright day, attributed to these
    objects by Sullivan and his colleagues; nor can any natural object, hurtling at such speed, execute a right-angle
    turn. As in the Moore theodolite sighting, the execution of such a turn would have crushed any human crew under the
    impact of "G" forces. Finally, of course, no known machine travels at 1,700 m.p.h. without making a sound or leaving
    an exhaust or vapour trail.’
  </p>
  <p>‘Incident 5. On 20 January 1951 at 8.30 p.m. Captain Lawrence W. Vinther, of Mid-Continent Airlines, was ordered by
    the control tower at the Sioux City airport to investigate a " very bright light" above the field. He took off in
    his D.C.3 with his co-pilot, James F. Bachmeier, and followed the light. All at once the light dived at the D.C.3
    almost head on; it passed silently and at great speed about 200 feet above its nose. Both pilots wrenched their
    heads back to see where it had gone, only to discover that the thing had somehow reversed direction in a split
    second, and was now flying parallel to the airliner, about 200 feet away, heading in the same direction. It was a
    clear moonlight night and both men got a good look at the object. It was as big as, or bigger than, a B.29, had a
    cigar-shaped fuselage and a glider-type wing, set well forward, without sweepback and without engine nacelles or jet
    pods. There was no exhaust glow. The white light appeared to be recessed in the bottom of the plane. After a few
    seconds the object lost altitude, passed under the D.C.3 and disappeared. A civilian employee of Air Intelligence
    was a passenger on the flight, saw the object and confirms the description by the pilots.’
  </p>
  <p>‘Evaluation. The conditions for observation were excellent. One fact alone—the astonishing reversal of direction
    performed by the object—suffices to classify it as a device far beyond the known capacities of aeronautical science.
    Although its shape is different, the soundlessness of the object and the absence of observable means of propulsion
    relate it to the saucer class of phenomena.’
  </p>
  <p>‘Incident No. 6. On 29 January 1952 just before midnight a B.29 was on solo mission over Wonsan, North Korea. It
    was flying at a speed somewhat less than 200 m.p.h., at an altitude of somewhat above 20,000 feet. Simultaneously
    the tail gunner and the fire-control man in the waist saw a bright round orange object in the sky near the plane.
    Both said it was about three feet in diameter, flew with a revolving motion on a course parallel to theirs and wore
    a halo of bluish flame. It also appeared to pulsate. The object followed the B.29 for about five minutes, then
    pulled ahead and shot away at a sharp angle. On the same night a similar globe was seen by the tail gunner and waist
    man of another B.29, eighty miles away over Sunchon, but flying at about the same height. The globe followed the
    plane for about a minute, then disappeared.’
  </p>
  <p>‘Evaluation. Theoreticians in the Air Force believe the fireballs were not natural phenomena but propelled objects.
    They bear some similarity to the balls of so-called " fireball fighters " or " foo fighters " which flew wing on
    Allied aircraft over Germany and Japan during 1944-45 and which have never been satisfactorily explained. In the
    Korean incidents the fireballs seem—on the evidence of their sharp acceleration, their blue light and the abrupt,
    angular swerve—to resemble the saucers described earlier.’
  </p>
  <p>‘Incident No. 7. On the night of 2 November 1951 a ball of kelly-green fire, larger than the moon and blazing
    several times more brightly, flashed eastward across the skies of Arizona. It raced, straight as a bullet, parallel
    to the ground, and then exploded in a frightful paroxysm of light—without making a sound. At least 165 people saw
    the incredible thing; hundreds more witnessed the similar flight of countless other fireballs that since December
    1945 have bathed the hills of the southwest in their lunar glare. In the last year they have been seen as far afield
    as Pennsylvania, Maryland and Puerto Rico. Reports came so thick and fast during 1948 that in 1949 the Air Force
    established " Project Twinkle " to investigate them. " Project Twinkle" established a triple photo-theodolite post
    at Vaughn, North Mexico, to obtain scientific data on the fireballs. Day and night, week in, week out, for three
    months, a crew kept vigil. Ironically, while fireballs continued flashing everywhere else in the south-west, they
    saw nothing until the project was transferred to the Holloman Air Force base at Alamgordo, North Mexico. There,
    during another three-month siege, they saw a few but were unable to make satisfactory computations because of the
    fireballs’ great speed. Search parties have had no better luck. They have combed in vain the countryside beneath the
    point of disappearance; not a trace of tell-tale substance has been found on the ground.’
  </p>
  <p>‘Evaluation. The popular south-west belief that a strange meteor shower was underway has been blasted by
    Dr. Lincoln La Paz, mathematician, astronomer and director of the Institute of Meteorites at the University of New
    Mexico. He points out that normal fireballs do not appear green; they fall in the trajectory forced on them by
    gravity, are generally as noisy as a freight train and leave meteorites where they hit. The green New Mexican
    species does none of these things. Neither do the green fireballs appear to be electrostatic phenomena—they move too
    regularly and too fast.
  </p>
  <p>‘If the fireballs are the product of a United States weapons project, as some south-westerns believe, it is a very
    secret one indeed: the Atomic Energy Commission and every other government agency connected with weapons development
    has denied to Life any responsibility for the fireballs. Could they be self-destroying Russian reconnaissance
    devices ? Not likely. While the United States believes the Russians have an intercontinental guided missile, there
    is no intelligence that indicates they have developed silent power plants or objects capable of moving nearly as
    fast as meteors (twelve miles a second). Yet—for whatever it may be worth—the only reports of green fireballs prior
    to 1945 came from the Baltic area.
  </p>
  <p>‘The extreme greenness of the fireballs has impressed most witnesses. When asked to indicate the approximate colour
    on a spectrum chart, most of them have touched the band at 5,200 angstroms—close to the green of burning copper.
    Copper is almost never found in meteorites; the friction of the air oxidises it shortly after he meteor enters the
    upper atmosphere. However, a curious fact has been recorded by aerologists. Concentrations of copper particles are
    now present in the air of Arizona and New Mexico, particularly in "fireball areas ". These were not encountered in
    air samples made before 1948.’ 4

  </p>
  <p>In 1934 I was at school in the south of England and, one November evening after ‘lights out’, our dormitory was
    suddenly lit by a brilliant green glare. With yells of delight we rushed to the windows, in time to see an immense
    green fireball move slowly across the sky and disappear behind the Sussex Downs. It was so bright that all the
    school grounds were lit up in this unearthly green glow. The walls of a white cottage half a mile away reflected the
    light almost as brightly as a green neon sign. Our speculations, however, were interrupted by the appearance of an
    angry master, who had come to investigate the commotion.
  </p>
  <p>Phenomena as reported in these recent incidents are not new. In 1619 Christopher Scherer, Prefect of a Swiss
    Canton, wrote to his friend, Fr. Kircher: 5
  </p>
  <p>5/ De Mirville, Des Esprits, Tome II.</p>
  <p>‘Having remained on the balcony to contemplate the perfect purity of the firmament, I saw a fiery shining dragon
    rise from one of the caves on Mount Pilatus and direct himself rapidly towards Flüelen to the other end of the lake.
    Enormous in size, his tail was longer and his neck stretched out.... In flying he emitted on his way numerous
    sparks.... I thought at first I was seeing a meteor, but soon, looking more attentively, I was convinced by his
    flight... that I saw a veritable dragon.’
  </p>
  <p>Did fiery flying dragons really exist in Switzerland during the seventeenth century, or did the Prefect, while
    contemplating ‘the purity of the firmament’, see something similar to the objects disturbing our skies today ? What
    is the strange attraction of our planet ? Is it a kind of ‘cosmic beauty spot, freak or curiosity—a Solar Niagara
    Falls— that lures tourists and sightseers from all over the Universe, not in ones and twos but in hundreds of
    thousands ? Streams of mysterious objects flowed through space for six days on end. Processions clogged the highways
    round our globe that would make the holiday main roads seem empty by comparison. The nineteenth century was a record
    season for stellar tourists. Millions of extra-terrestrial beings apparently peered, probed, gaped at and recorded
    our planet as they cruised by on their mammoth outings.
  </p>
  <p>In September 1851 a clergyman and amateur astronomer named Read reported that he saw through his telescope a host
    of luminous bodies passing by very high up. Some moved swiftly; others slowly. Most of them moved from east to west,
    while others moved off towards the south. The whole fantastic cascade went on for six hours, flight after flight,
    thousand upon thousand (he calculated several hundred per minute); as if the entire air fleet of another system was
    on manoeuvres in the stratosphere we like to think of as our own.
  </p>
  <p>C. B. Chalmers, f.r.a.s., commenting, said he had seen a similar procession but that the bodies he had seen
    appeared to be oval in shape. This was probably due to the angle at which they had been observed. From directly
    below, a disk would appear circular. From an acute angle they would resemble ellipses.
  </p>
  <p>On 27 April 1863 Henry Waldner saw a similar procession which he reported to Dr. Wolf, of the Zurich Observatory,
    who told him that a similar performance had been witnessed by Signor Capocci, of the Capodimonte Observatory,
    Naples, on 11 May 1845.
  </p>
  <p>1849, 8 August, 3 p.m., Gais, Switzerland. A Mr. Inglis sees thousands of luminous disks stream by for twenty-five
    minutes continuously. His servant, who had better eyesight, said he saw a corona or luminous fuzziness around them.
    Then in India, 17 to 18 October, the sun was being observed by Lieutenant Herschel at Bangalore. Into his field of
    vision came a stream of small dark objects, silhouetted against the sun. When they had moved past the orb they
    appeared as luminous dots, or disks. Herschel tried different focussings with his telescope that suggested the
    objects to be very high up. He thought he saw a corona or fuzziness around them but he could not be sure. One paused
    obligingly for him to inspect it thoroughly. He noticed some kind of exhaust or wispy appendage. Then it shot off
    with a sudden burst of speed. There was nothing very strange about this marathon stream except that it went on and
    on for two whole days !
  </p>
  <p>Across to Mexico—the Observatory of Zacatecas, Mexico, 12 August, 1883. M. Bonilla is taking telescopic photos of
    the sun when the show commences. A large stream of glowing bodies begin to cross the sun’s disk diagonally, taking
    between three to four seconds to complete the transit. M. Bonilla watched them for an hour before clouds hid the
    sun. He looked again the next day, 13 August, and to his amazement the procession was still in progress. When seen
    against the sun the objects appeared as small dark ovals with five ray-like projections. One paused and hovered for
    a few seconds, enabling Bonilla to obtain a photo which is possibly the first photo of a flying saucer ever taken.
  </p>
  <p>I eventually traced a copy of this photo to an attic in Paris and made a special journey to see it. Unfortunately
    it was old and faded, and attempts to reproduce it were unsuccessful.
  </p>
  <p>Bonilla telegraphed the Observatory in Mexico City to have a look. They replied that they could see them but that
    to them they appeared a little way from the sun owing to parallax. Doubtless this enabled them to calculate the
    height by triangulation, but Bonilla says ambiguously that they were ‘relatively near to the Earth’, which he
    qualifies with ‘less than the distance to the moon’. I suppose for astronomers, 240,000 odd miles is relatively
    near.
  </p>
  <p>Signor Ricco, of Palermo Observatory, saw straight lines of similar objects slowly cross the sun on 30 November
    1880 at 8.30 a.m. From the data and calculations given it is evident that these things were flying very high.
  </p>
  <p>One of the best processions took place on 21 September 1910. For three hours without pause, flights of round shiny
    things streamed across New York City. Traffic was held up and people thronged the streets to gaze at them. Possibly
    about a million people saw them on that occasion.
  </p>
  <p>But why, we ask, out of all that host did not one more enterprising than the rest come down and land ?</p>
  <p>We can only conclude that our planet has a bad name in the stellar year books and travel brochures: like those
    signs on the roads running through jungles, which caution tourists not to tarry nor leave the safety of their cars.

  <p>Since the above was written, Boris de Rachewiltz has found this ancient Egyptian saucer among the papers of the
    late Professor Alberto Tulli, former Director of the Egyptian section of the Vatican Museum. It is a fragment from
    the Royal Annals of Thuthmosis III (circa 1504-1450 B.C.) and when translated reads as follows:
  </p>
  <p>‘In the year 22 third month of winter, sixth hour of the day... the scribes of the House of Life found it was a
    circle of fire that was coming in the sky (Though) it had no head, the breadth of its mouth (had) a foul odour. Its
    body one rod ,about 150 feet) long and one rod large. It had no voice.... Now, after some days had passed over these
    things, Lo ! they were more numerous than anything. They were shining in the sky more than the sun to the limits
    of... heaven... Powerful was the position of the fire circles. The army of the king looked on and His Majesty was in
    the midst of it. It was after supper. Thereupon, they (the fire circles) went up higher directed towards the South.’
  </p>
  <p>Many cases of an unusual odour, possibly due to ionisation or to actual waste products of the saucers will be found
    in the later chapter, ‘Waste Products’, Chapter 15. Notice also that the circles ‘had no voice’, i.e. were silent.

    translation.
