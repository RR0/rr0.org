<p>I said earlier that never a day goes by without a saucer, or several saucers, being seen and reported. Let me, then,
  present as final testimony a typical month; in this case April 1952; and some of the flying saucers that brought
  interest to its thirty days.
</p>
<p>For the compiling of this report the credit goes entirely to Mr. Elliot Rockmore, of New York, who edits The Flying
  Saucer Review. Instead of paying for copies, readers may contribute the saucer cuttings and information of which it is
  composed, thereby building up an invaluable library of reference for present and future research workers. Mr. Rockmore
  uses the address of P.O.B. 148, Wall Street Station, New York 3, New York, to which anyone who wishes to help may send
  him clippings.
</p>
<p>Instead of beginning, as I promised, at 1 April, I shall commence at 30 March. Why ? Merely because there was a
  saucer of unusual interest sighted that day at:
</p>
<p>3.0 p.m. Greenfield, Massachusetts. 42.5° Latitude, 72.5° Longitude.</p>
<p>A noise like a wind was heard overhead. Then a bright, silvery object, apparent size, smaller than the moon,
  descended at great speed, and stopped in the air at an approximate altitude of 1,500 feet. It appeared to be a large
  rotating ring, apparent diameter thirty feet, with the sky visible through the centre. After several seconds, it
  turned on edge, and appeared to be composed of two separate four-foot wide rings, five feet apart. It then raced on
  edge across the sky to the south-west, turned over into a flat position, moved toward a nearby mountain, while
  following the earth’s contours. On arrival at the mountain, it banked, hovered for a second, then rose at tremendous
  speed skyward and disappeared.

<p>3. April. Morning. Benson, Arizona. 37° Latitude, 110° Longitude.</p>
<p>Very clear, cloudless blue sky. A very bright, silvery, wingless oval or egg-shaped object, apparent size five times
  greater than a B29 bomber, hovered motionless for an hour. Upon examination from an open cockpit of an airplane at
  14,000 feet, it appeared to be 40,000 feet higher, and did not resemble a balloon, nor any aerial object in the
  pilot’s twenty-five years’ aviation experience.
</p>
<p>Observed by a Marana Air Base owner, one cadet, one flight instructor, and two civilian flight commanders, three of
  whom were veterans of several years of overseas flying in World War II.

<p>4 April. 10.30 p.m. Near Hammond, British Columbia. 49° Latitude, 123° Longitude.</p>
<p>Clear sky, excellent visibility. A shimmering, green light, resembling an airplane light, appeared in southern sky,
  and noiselessly headed northwards towards observer. It slowly turned orange-amber in colour and, when nearly overhead,
  its tail appeared to be _ sparkling. It then turned sharply west, stopped short suddenly, and went directly back along
  the same path, and became reddish, and oval in shape. When it reached the original area of first observation in
  southern sky, it headed for the horizon, turning first amber, then green, and finally a silver white.

<p>9 April. 2.35 p.m. Pensacola, Florida. 30.5° Latitude, 87.25° Longitude.</p>
<p>An object, resembling an airplane trailed by smoke, crossed sky, then another object appeared falling from sky. A
  short time later a heavy explosion was heard. A tremendous explosion in the sky shook the entire city, breaking
  several windows, ceiling plaster in some houses, shook store goods off shelves, and nearly knocked down some workers
  on the city piers. A hot seven-inch cone-shaped piece of metal was found near an oak tree by three children ten
  minutes afterwards, and they thought it might have fallen from the sky. However, examination of the tree and nearby
  area found no scorched or damaged wood or other fragments, and examination by the Navy laboratories found it was a
  sulphur compound to seal joints. It was theorized that it might have fallen from a truck carrying it on a nearby
  street. The Navy stated that no jet planes were in flight at the time, and no aircraft were known to be in danger, or
  missing, and that the Eglin A.F. proving grounds forty miles away were not testing explosives at the time.

<p>Two glowing globular objects appeared hovering together in the sky. Under examination by a 45-power telescope, they
  were two reddish glowing globes with a dark belt around each, moving up and down in the sky without horizontal
  movement. They appeared between Mars and Polaris, but were not stars, since they covered the stars when they moved
  near them. Two photographs were taken, and one showed an irregular twin track in the sky, that might have been caused
  by two luminous objects moving close together. Observed by five people, including an amateur astronomer.

<p>One small, silvery, disk-like object hovered two minutes in the sky, in a horizontal position underneath a cloud. It
  slowly tilted up in a vertical direction, and then slowly moved northward, and apparently disappeared into a cloud. It
  was not luminous, but reflected sunlight when it tilted. It was observed by the associate professor of journalism of
  New Mexico University, who stated it appeared to be in the same area at approximately the same time as a similar
  object he had seen in the summer of 1948.

<p>One huge, disk-like object, surrounded with a silvery-blue or pale green halo, and followed by a silvery or white
  light, noiselessly curved across the sky at a tremendous speed, from south-east to north-west in less than sixty
  seconds. Observed by two persons in two different areas in the city, who called a newspaper and gave separate but very
  similar accounts.

<p>Some brilliant, pale green, nearly square-shaped object fell toward earth for twenty seconds, then very sharply
  curved upwards as it crossed the sky from south-east to northwest, at approximately 1,000 m.p.h. Observed by a
  graduate psychologist of Ottawa University, who stated that he observed it from a side view, and that (a) its turning
  circle was too small for a jet plane, (b) that it could not have been a car searchlight, since the entire countryside
  was dark, and (c) it was definitely not a hallucination, but an actual happening.

<p>An object resembling an extremely bright star, revolved in the south-east sky, as it showed a white light, then a
  green light, and then a red light at intervals. Under examination through binoculars, it was also moving horizontally,
  and finally disappeared behind a house. Examination of the sky located five more similar revolving ‘pinwheel’ objects
  that also appeared to revolve, but these did not move horizontally. Observed by a family of three. Head of family was
  a retired weather forecaster.
