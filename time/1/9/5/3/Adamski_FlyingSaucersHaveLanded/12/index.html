<p>I find three more characteristic shared by Vimanas and flying saucers. Things written thousands of years ago about
  vimanas bear an uncanny resemblance to things written today about saucers. The vimanas were round, sometimes
  boat-shaped. They glowed in the dark. They had twin rows of nozzles along the sides through which the Force could be
  released to control their manœuvres.
</p>
<p>On 22 March 1950 two American airline pilots, Adams and Anderson, saw a peculiar object from their cockpit windows.
  It circled their aircraft with ease, coming near enough for them to observe a double row of bluish lights, the
  weirdest, strongest light they had ever seen, along its great length. They took the lights for brilliantly illuminated
  cabin windows and were surprised that they saw no faces looking out at them. It also struck them as odd that the cabin
  of this monster should be so brightly lit, making observation difficult, if not impossible, from within. Their
  bewilderment is soon explained if what they mistook for portholes were in reality the double row of ‘jets’ known to be
  used in one type of Atlantean vimana.
</p>
<p>Vimanas glowed at night, but not for any decorative purpose. Colour and colour-changes are inseparable from the
  operation of the higher etheric powers. Saucers are usually seen to give out an unearthly green, purple or bluish glow
  changing to a livid red or orange when accelerating rapidly. Apart from the obvious inference, it might be worth the
  while of more advanced students of the Occult to note these colours carefully and relate them to their proper
  correspondences in the different planes, and they will obtain some interesting results. Those who have studied colour
  seriously are now covering ground that will be common scientific knowledge in the next century. Vibration, manifest as
  sound and colour and used conjointly with either, may soon be demonstrated as a more effective power than the greatest
  rocket yet on the drawing board.
</p>
<p>Hope that we are on the threshold of rediscovering this subtle force is given by the Adept known to students as ‘The
  Tibetan’, who, in 1920, wrote:
</p>
<p>‘First, physical plane scientists will be able to speak with authority anent the fourth ether, even though they may
  not recognise it as the lowest of the four etheric grades of substance; its sphere of influence and its utilisation
  will be comprehended, and " Force " as a factor in matter, or the electrical manifestation of energy with indefinite
  limits, will be as well understood as is hydrogen at this time. Indications of this can already be seen in the
  discovery of radium, and the study of radioactive substances and of electronic demonstration. This knowledge will
  revolutionise the life of man; it will put into his hands that which the occultists call "power of the fourth order"
  (on the physical plane). It will enable him to utilise electrical energy for the regulation of his everyday life in a
  way as yet incomprehensible; it will produce new methods of illuminating, and of heating the world at a small cost and
  with practically no initial outlay. Transportation by sea and land will be largely superseded with the utilisation of
  air routes and the transit of large bodies through the air by means of the instantaneous use of the force or energy
  inherent in the ether itself, will take the place of the present methods.’
</p>
<p>‘This will come through the study of the place of the solar system in the universal whole and the effect certain
  constellations have on it.... This will lead to a close investigation of polar conditions in the Earth, of the
  planetary and magnetic currents, and of the electrical intercourse between our Earth, and the Venusian and Martian
  planetary schemes. When this has been accomplished astronomy and esoteric astrology will be revolutionised. This will
  come at the close of the century after a scientific discovery of even greater importance than that as to the nature of
  the atom.’ 50
</p>
<p>50/ A. Bailey, A Treatise on Cosmic Fire.</p>
<p>The ‘unearthly light’ seen by Adams and Anderson was out of time. To their grandchildren it will be as common as the
  electric light is to us. Our grandfathers would have considered a neon sign something out of this world, probably a
  manifestation of the evil one.
</p>
<p>Some of the vimanas travelled in great waves, approaching and receding from the earth. This may or may not have been
  due to their following certain definite magnetic paths now known to surround and interpenetrate the planet. These
  magnetic forces were known to the Atlanteans, as we gather from Stanza XI of Dzyan: ‘The matter of Fohat circulates...
  the wheel that is not glimpsed moves in rapid revolution within the slower outer case (the crust of our planet).’
</p>
<p>I have often wondered whether we do now in fact obtain a glimpse of the ‘wheel that is not glimpsed‘ in those
  ‘snowstorms‘ or streaks which dart across television screens and which relate to the fourth ether of occultism and the
  fourth state of matter of science.
</p>
<p>Concerning his up-and-down motion of some vimanas, read what Donald Keyhoe wrote in his interesting book, The Flying
  Saucers are Real: ‘On the same day about two hours later a sky phenomenon was observed by several watchers over
  Lock-bourne Airbase, Columbia, Ohio. It was described as round, or oval, larger than a C47 and travelling... faster
  than 500 m.p.h. it glowed from white to orange .. it made motions like a lift, and at one time appeared to touch the
  ground.’ (p. 21.)
</p>
<p>And on another occasion, two American officers reported a saucer flying along a valley with a ‘lift-like’ motion. ‘On
  29 May 1951 at 3.48 p.m. three technical writers for the aerophysics department of North American Aviation’s plant at
  Downey, outside Los Angeles, were chatting on the factory grounds. They were Victor Black, Werner Eichler and Ed.
  J. Sullivan. All at once they stared at the sky. Sullivan describes what they saw:
</p>
<p>‘“Approximately thirty glowing, meteor-like objects sprayed out of the east at a point about forty-five degrees above
  the horizon, executed a right-angle turn and swept across the sky in an undulating vertical formation.... They moved
  with the motion of flat stones skipping across a smooth pond ".’ 51
</p>
<p>51/ Life, International. 23 May 1952.</p>
<p>Now the force emitted by the vimanas was sufficient to turn an enemy craft upside down or to bend trees as they
  passed over the great prehistoric forests. Keyhoe writes: ‘24 June 1947. A Portland prospector named Fred Johnson
  working up in the Cascade Mountains spotted five or six disks banking in the sun... then he noticed that the compass
  hand on his special watch was weaving wildly from side to side.’ (p. 24.)
</p>
<p>And two observers at Twin Falls, Idaho, saw a disk fairly low down over a forest Although it was a perfectly calm day
  the trees beneath it were whipping about as if lashed by a furious gale. Yet they thought it was too high up to cause
  such a disturbance by the backwash of an ordinary jet engine. I have heard several other reports of this kind of
  occurrence.
</p>
<p>Vimanas were sometimes made of metal, at other times of layers of thin wood cemented together by a chemical process
  that made them as tough as metal. Did not the De Havilland Aircraft Company produce a process during the recent war
  known as ‘wood lamination‘ which consisted of cementing thin layers of plywood together under great pressure, to
  produce something lighter than metal but equally strong, and with it manufactured those highly successful all-wooden
  warplanes, the Hornet and the Mosquito ? If so, it seems that Sir Geoffrey de Havilland is the first to reintroduce a
  process known and used in Atlantis.
