<p>Cuchulain was a hero of irish mythology. Quite unbelievable were some of his feats in battle. He is to Ireland what
  Siegfried is to Germany, Quetcoatl to South America, Drona to India—a super man of the Golden Age invincible in war,
  unsurpassed in beauty. St. George, in his mild, obscure, and typically British way, fulfils the same function in
  England.
</p>
<p>Most people regard Cuchulain, Siegfried and the other national supermen as attractive myths based on man’s
  subconscious desire for (a) omnipotence or (b) orgiastic wallowing in blood and gore. Certainly the poetic imaginings
  have attributed to Cuchulain the liberation of more blood than Attilla.
</p>
<p>But among all the frills, fripperies, exaggerations and bardic improvements, there stand out certain statements that
  seem to mean much more than mere myth, and to give one the impression that the bards are merely reciting verbatim what
  has been handed down, without any inkling as to what they are really saying.
</p>
<p>Cuchulain had weapons called the ‘Thunder Feat’ of ‘an Hundred, of Five Hundred or of a Thousand’. This means that
  the ‘Thunder Feat’ could be adjusted to slay a hundred, five hundred or a thousand men, as desired, all in one bang,
  and evidently relates to some form of explosive weapon, with variable charges. But to my mind it echoes strongly
  Indra’s Dart and the Brahma Weapon or the Mashmak in a more controllable form.
</p>
<p>Consider for a moment that some of the prehistoric stone hill forts in Ireland and in West Scotland have their stones
  blasted and fused together as if by colossal heat.
</p>
<p>He also had two chariots called the ‘Scythe Chariot’ and the ‘Enchanted Chariot’. The former is described as being a
  great heavy-armoured affair bristling with poisoned spears and scythes, so heavy that only his two magic steeds, the
  ‘Dubhshaoileann‘ and the ‘Liath Macha‘ could move it. It also served as a platform for discharging the ‘Thunder Feat’,
  which suggests a piece of ordnance requiring a pretty strong mounting. It could have been an ordinary primitive cannon
  firing an explosive shell, but more likely it was similar to the ‘circled bow‘ of Indra as mentioned in the Ramayana.
  Whatever it was, whether high-explosive, Mashmak or Agni-Indra, it was bulky and required a heavy strong platform for
  its discharge.
</p>
<p>The pattern is becoming clearer. An early form of tank powered by two unknown engines, mounting a terrible piece of
  ordnance, has left its mark on Irish legend.
</p>
<p>The ‘Enchanted Chariot’ is described as light and airy’. ‘It flew swifter than any bird, and no horse pulled it. All
  the way through, this strange light vehicle is compared with birds in flight and is remarked upon for its wonderful
  lightness. All the ‘Magic chariots‘ of the Celtic heroes were described as being able to mount up into heaven to the
  ‘Palaces of the Gods‘ and to other wonderful lands in the sky. This myth is easily explainable as a race memory of the
  coming and going of vimanas to other planets, as in the ‘Samar‘ which states that by means of these craft men could
  ride up to the stellar regions and heavenly beings could come down to Earth. In turn, the ‘heroes’ and ‘gods’ are
  largely race memories of the elder races of the Solar System. The aerial ships that landed in France at the time of
  Charlemagne were also ‘magic chariots’, vimanas or flying saucers, depending on which name you care to give them.
</p>
<p>When a little more research is done on the ancient sagas of Greece, Egypt, India and the Celtic countries, many
  interesting revelations will come to light concerning inter-planetary flight, and such fantasies as the Asura Maya
  Vimana, which was golden and 12,000 cubits around, my leave the realms of myth and turn out to be merely another
  memory of the vast carrier ships which have been seen many times (see Flying Saucer Museum) both as dark spindles and
  golden cigars, and have been finally photographed by Adamski.
</p>
<p>Now comes a strange thing. After one of Cuchulain’s battles in which the super-weapons were employed, the survivors
  flee, not as one would expect, to Tara, Emania, Dun Dailgan, or any of the Irish strongholds, but to the ‘City of The
  Three Peaks’, a fabulous mountain fortress which figures largely in all South American legends as one of the great
  latter-day Atlantean capitals, and which may be associated with the ‘Triple City’ of the Mahabharata which was
  destroyed by the atomic Bolt or Mashmak or Brahma Weapon. This city not only appears on many of the Maya and Toltec
  inscriptions but its image—the triple mountain—has been found on many ancient coins, dug up on pre-Inca sites. Notice
  also the similarity between ‘Cuchulain‘ and the name of the South American god of war, ‘Kukulkan’, and even the
  Olympus or Holy Mountain of Poseidon which was called ‘Cumhuilan’.
</p>
<p>The more one delves into the doings of Cuchulain the more likely it seems that he is a composite character of Celtic
  and Atlantean origin. His training by a race of Amazons, his magic weapons, above all his Faiery helmet brought to him
  from ‘The Land of Promise‘ (an old name for Atlantis), his counterparts in Mexico, South America and Egypt make it
  appear that he is based on the memory of a great and warlike race who originally inhabited the mother country, and
  came to Ireland bringing their arts and sciences with them. Later Irish heroes and warriors became confused and
  identified with them. Still later, the Celts borrowed feats from the Daytan Wars and overlaid them on their tribal
  squabbles. As the knowledge of the arts declined, names and places from the previous civilisation became identified
  with their own; every old country has its Tower of Babel, and its Mount Olympus. The original Holy Mountain is under
  the sea today, but descending races transplanted and transformed it to their own requirements. Likewise, the South
  American and the Celtic races brought the memory of their lost motherland and fragments of their sciences which became
  overlaid with successive layers of legend and fable, so that to find the original truth (what fragments remain of it)
  one has to dig deep into every quarter of the globe where man has lived for at least 10,000 years.
</p>
<p>So we find in India the ‘car celestials’, the vimanas, the fiery agni-weapons and ‘Indra’s Dart‘ and the appalling
  Brahma Weapon.
</p>
<p>Likewise-, in South America we find the terrible Mashmak and fire that could wipe out an entire army.</p>
<p>So, in Ireland the same principle becomes Cuchulain’s ‘Thunder Feat’, and his two chariots (artillery and aircraft ?)
  Cuchulain is the composite character of a Celtic-Atlantean war lord complete with a fairly well catalogued armoury of
  magic, overlaid by various later heroes of prehistoric Ireland who in fact did raise the great fort at Dundalk where
  Cuchulain is said to have lived, and in early times probably did understand, in part, the Agni lndra and other
  super-weapons, if the fused and vitrified stones on their hill forts are anything to go by. If you prefer these stones
  to have been melted by lightning, well and good. But I have yet to see lightning melt stone. Its effect is usually
  more like high explosive.
</p>
<p>Which is the simpler ?</p>
<p>To believe that all legends of fire weapons and aerial vehicles from all parts of the world owe their remarkable
  similarity to acutely stretched coincidence ? Or to believe that there once existed in dim distant ages, great empires
  whose knowledge of Natural Science was as great, if not greater in some respects than our own ?
</p>
<p>I have said before—and will now say again at the risk of causing boredom-that no true magician believes in ‘magic’.
  There is no such thing. What is superstitiously called ‘magic’ is in reality Natural Science—knowledge of the
  Universal Laws and their application, nothing more. The ancient ‘magician’ controlled these laws largely by sound; the
  modern laboratory ‘magician’ controls them largely through the use of heat; and he concentrates on different aspects.
  The ancient ‘magician’ came to know them through study and psychic intuition; the modern ‘wizard‘ obtains his
  knowledge through an intellectual process based on observations and mathematics. The results are similar.
</p>
<p>Certainly the ‘magic’ weapons of yesterday are no more magical (and mechanically less ingenious) than today’s
  complicated ‘magic’ radar; guided missiles, and ten-ton ‘Thunder Feats‘ dropped from bombers, vimanas, or whatever you
  care to call them.
</p>
<p>More deadly even than the ‘Thunder Feat’ was Balor’s Eye, a huge round ‘eye’ or circular reflecting implement that,
  when directed on the enemy, destroyed them in a flash. An identical weapon appears in ancient India with a similar
  name—Kapilla’s Eye (mentioned on page 106), which could turn 10,000 men to dust in a second, lndra’s Circled Bow or
  the Brahma Weapon seem to be other variations. The power they used was possibly concentrated soundwaves. The ‘Circled
  Bow‘ or the ‘Round Eye‘ was most likely a parabolic reflector, the only shape that could focus supersonic waves to an
  accurate point.
</p>
<p>Against these, the primitive tribes had no fair chance; even the smaller weapons terrified them. The narrative tells
  how frightened they were of ‘the hissing red flames and sparks from Cuchulain’s darts and spears’.
</p>
<p>Do spears and darts emit sparks or flames ? Modern ones do, but we call them rockets and bazookas, names lacking in
  the bardic vocabulary. Very well—supposing Cuchulain did have all these armaments. Where did he get them ? Where did
  he learn the knowledge ? From the Lands of the West, say the narratives; from the Land of Promise, Tir na Oge, the
  Land of Youth, the beautiful Isles which lay across the sea towards the setting sun. America ? South America ?
  Atlantis ?
</p>
<p>He was taught his Natural Science by three wise women of the Amazon tribe; this points to South America. But his
  magic helmet and magic ship were given to him by Mananan the Sea God, who later becomes Neptune-Posseidon. Now
  Posseidon, according to Plato, was King of the great island of the West called Posseidonis—the last great fragment of
  sinking Atlantis
</p>
<p>The magic helmet, like Siegfried’s ‘Tarnhelm’, made the warrior invisible. According to the ‘Samar‘ on page 95 the
  vimanas could also be made invisible, and every ‘magical’ system contains formulas for bending light-waves round a
  person or object so that it cannot be seen. Even with our present knowledge of ‘magic’ (or Natural Science) this seems
  rather far fetched, but not impossible.
</p>
<p>Mananan 61 also lent Cuchulain his ‘magic‘ ship which required no oars or sails. All that was necessary to make it
  move was the correct sound. The bards say that you told it where to go, and it went. In other words, it was controlled
  and guided by soundwaves or vibration. Herodotus mentions a galley that entered the Mediterranean through the Pillars
  of Hercules (Gibraltar) which had neither sails nor oars but was exceedingly swift. Scott Elliott says the ships of
  Atlantis were powered by the ‘etheric engine‘ that also drove the vimanas.
</p>
<p>61/ In Celtic cosmogony, Mananan is the personalised symbol, corresponding to the ‘Verbum’, the ‘Anum‘ the ‘Word of
  Power‘ or Cosmic Sound by which all things are called into being (the very expression ‘called into being‘ has
  significance). The Sound is the essence of every ‘magical’ system in every country in every age and in every religion.
  The sacramental words uttered by anointed priests today have no less power when used in our churches than they had
  when uttered, in different form, in the first sun-temple of Atlantis. Manana came forth from the ‘Bosom of Lir’, which
  represents the boundless All, the Infinite Stillness before the first vibration of a new universe. Lir is Parabrahm
  during the ‘Great Night’ that comes with Pralaya at the end of the Mahamanvantara, ‘enduring for seven eternities’
  until the first thrill of the new manvantaric Dawn. So when Cuchulain is said to have received these gifts from
  Mananan, or when the King of Posseidon is identified with Mananan, it only means that they were both Initiates of the
  ‘Word’, and knew how to wield the powers of Sound, as taught by the Sun-Adepts, the true ‘children of Lir’.
</p>
<p>Once again I feel a connection between Keely’s engine, the ‘Cars celestial’, levitation plates operated by ‘a song’,
  the Hindu engine plans seen by Churchward, the ‘mercury engines’ in the Samar Celtic iron steeds which obeyed words of
  command, and the tremendous objects seen daily in our skies, travelling silently, or musically, at great speeds. And a
  connection also between Indra’s Circled Bow, Kapilla’s Eye, Balor’s Eye, Mashmak and the hill forts of West Scotland
  and Ireland whose stones are fused and vitrified into melted lumps. And a connection between armies who swooned at
  Cuchulain’s weapons, the Indian Avidyastra (missile of illusionary powers), the Prasvapana (missile producing sleep),
  the Arrow of Sleep and the four weapons controlled by sound (Satyakirti, Kamarupaka, Kamaruci, Vajra), and the modern
  experiments in supersonics that have—so far—caused materials to ignite, metals to change their molecule, and houses to
  move off their foundations. There is also a connection between vimanas, flying saucers and the magic chariots of the
  gods, drawn by fiery steeds. (Surely the word ‘magic chariot’ is more descriptive than the ridiculous word ‘flying
  saucers’, coined by a race of tea-bibbers.) It was able to cross the sea or land with equal ease or to soar up in the
  air. It was drawn by ‘magic steeds‘ which bore no resemblance to horses. One of these machines is described as having
  ‘an iron skin and no bones in its body’. Because he had no bones, say the bards, he could not be slain in battle, for
  any weapon that managed to pierce his iron hide found nothing inside to damage.
</p>
<p>Therefore, they admit that this particular steed or power unit was an empty hollow metal chest or cylinder. Now we’re
  getting nearer. A hollow metal cylinder, or a pair of hollow metal cylinders provided the power for the chariot. The
  word chariot only means car or a vehicle. So substitute vehicle for chariot and we get: ‘The Celtic heroes rode in
  vehicles which could cross the land, or sea, with equal ease, powered by a pair of hollow metal cylinders practically
  impervious to enemy fire.’ What hollow metal cylinders ? The Atlantean etheric motor or the ‘jet’ engine described in
  the Samarangana Sutradhara.
</p>
<p>All these little fragments have the same underlying idea— and there is, in the ether, untapped sources of perpetual
  power which our technologists had until recently overlooked in their preoccupation with other forms of energy. 62 It
  is the power that made the ‘car celestial’ course along its airy way with a melodious sound, and made the Celtic
  ‘magic‘ steeds soar over land and sea without tiring and without food (i.e. fuel). The same power that lifted Keely’s
  model metal airship off the ground and made it fly around his laboratory while he plied his bow string.
</p>
<p>62/ This power has been overlooked because it is right under our noses (or feet). It is the same power which silently
  turns the planet round the sun, and the sun round the galaxy and even the tiny atom round its nucleus. Upon its lines
  of force sail the great space ships we call planets, and the tiny artificial planets we call flying saucers As always,
  the answer is right on our own doorstep.
</p>
<p>What the gods do man will always try to copy until he has learned and become a god himself. As long as the Mighty
  Ones go on building suns and planets in which to sow the life-crop, that same life-crop, when it becomes human, will
  start intelligently to mimic its betters, and so run up little planets of its own. Fifty years ago, flight was
  re-discovered (in a new form) by the Wright Brothers. Old lessons learned long ago are swiftly re-learned. In a brief
  half-century we have got as far as the drawing-board stage for an artificial satellite to circle the Earth —the first
  tiny man-made planet. www.universe-people.com www.cosmic-people.com
</p>
<p>One last word before leaving this shining figure of Cuchulain in his Celtic Twilight. When the hero attacked the
  ‘King of Antioch‘ in his Enchanted Chariot he succeeded in splitting open the metal-plated sides of his rival’s
  vehicle, and ‘the two great white jewelled stones within it, large as millstones, fell out and were broken, so that
  the chariot fell to the ground with the noise of thunder, like ramparts falling.’
</p>
<p>Whatever would two great white jewelled stones the size of millstones be doing in a practically constructed ordinary
  war chariot—if it was an ordinary war chariot—and why should their destruction, rather than the rending of the metal
  covering, cause it to fall to the ground, unless the millstones were our old friends the sonic disks, the levitation
  plates, that powered the ancient cars-celestial ? 63
</p>
<p>63/ Many of the present-day ‘primitive ‘peoples have legends of flying saucers. An American professor of ancient
  tongues, George Hunt Williamson, d.sc, spent the closing months of 1952 with some tribes of Minnesotan and Canadian
  Indians, who spoke of them as ‘Earth Rumblers’. The Indians said that they travelled silently but sometimes shook the
  earth. They used to come in over the lakes like great shining whales, always in circular form. In olden days the
  saucer people used to come and give them help and wisdom right up to the time the colonies were being formed. But
  since the coming of white men they did not land any more. They had legends saying that one day they would land again
  but were reluctant to say too much, for ‘It was not good to talk of these things—except in closed circles and to
  oneself’’.
