<p>It was about 12.30 in the noon hour on thursday, 20 November 1952, that I first made personal contact with a man from
  another world. He came to Earth in his space craft, a flying saucer. He called it a Scout Ship.
</p>
<p>This took place on the California desert 10.2 miles from Desert Center toward Parker, Arizona.</p>
<p>During the year of 1952, along with my photographing attempts I had made a number of trips to the desert areas where
  I had been told the flying saucers were seen and were apparently landing. Every trip had been unsuccessful, but I kept
  hoping that one day success would be mine.
</p>
<p>It was late in August 1952 that Mr. and Mrs. A. C. Bailey, of Winslow, Arizona, first came to Palomar Gardens and
  asked to talk with me privately. I had never heard of them prior to that time. During the conversation, they told me
  about Dr. and Mrs. George H. Williamson, of Prescott, Arizona. These four people were as interested in the flying
  saucers as I. They had read everything available on the subject They, too, had seen these strange objects flash
  through the skies, sometimes low, sometimes high. And they, too, had made trips to a number of desert places in the
  hope of seeing one land. Then they heard about me and the Baileys drove up to see me and tell me some of their
  experiences.
</p>
<p>Later, the Baileys and Williamsons came up together. After spending several days at Palomar Gardens as our guests,
  they asked me to telephone them before my next attempt to establish a contact. During their stay we had met a great
  deal and had become better acquainted and they wanted to be with me if things could be so arranged.
</p>
<p>I promised to call them as they requested, but warned them that I seldom planned such trips more than a day or two in
  advance. Thus, on the evening of 18 November I telephoned Dr. Williamson that I was leaving about midnight the next
  night for a destination near Blythe, California, and asked him if they would be able to meet me there early on
  Thursday morning, the 20th.
</p>
<p>They could. So could the Baileys with whom Dr. Williamson kept in contact. Thus the arrangements were made and hopes
  were high, as they always were for these trips.
</p>
<p>It was close to 1 a.m. on the morning of the 20th when at the risk of waking the wild life I left Palomar Gardens and
  rumbled down the mountain road on my way to meet the Baileys and Williamsons on the highway just west of Blythe,
  California. Accompanying me on this trip were Mrs. Alice K. Wells, owner of Palomar Gardens and operator of the cafe
  there, and Mrs. Lucy McKinnis, my secretary. The two women had agreed to take turns driving the long distance, since I
  never drive a car on the highway.
</p>
<p>We reached our destination shortly after 8 a.m. after a two-hour delay caused by picking up a nail in one of our rear
  tyres. We found that we had ruined it by running on it, so finally I had to buy another tyre.
</p>
<p>The four from Arizona were waiting for us just a few miles out from Blythe, and together we all drove into the town
  where we had a leisurely breakfast. Afterwards, we stood on the sidewalk for a few minutes discussing where to go from
  there. Al. Bailey, in whose car the others were riding, was perfectly willing to abide by any of my suggestions. So
  they said they would follow us.
</p>
<p>Finally we decided to turn back on the highway over which we had just driven. There was no particular reason for this
  except that I have developed the habit of following my hunches or feelings and this seemed to be the way to go.
</p>
<p>Perhaps one reason was, that in first driving into Blythe I had noticed what appeared to be a one-time military
  training centre and also a very large airport. These both seemed to have been abandoned. Beyond them I had noticed a
  road which I thought would take us close to the base of a ridge of mountains far in the distance. Only I had not
  noticed how far we had driven past that highway before reaching Blythe, and driving back, looking for it seemed twice
  as far as I remembered.
</p>
<p>When we reached Desert Center, there to the right was the road for which we were looking, the highway leading to
  Parker, Arizona.
</p>
<p>About 11 miles down this Parker Highway I suggested that we stop the cars along the side of the road and get out to
  look around for a while. And I would figure out what to do from thereon.
</p>
<p>The ground here was not as sandy as one usually expects on deserts. Instead, strange and interesting rocks in varying
  small sizes covered the earth. Dr. Williamson said they were volcanic. They were sharp and jagged and varied in their
  shapes.
</p>
<p>Small bushes of silver-white desert Holly, some with their tiny blood-red berries, doted the earth here and there.
  And a few other desert scrub growths with which we were unfamiliar attracted our attention. But all plant life was
  conspicuously sparse in this area.
</p>
<p>It was about 11 a.m. when we arrived at this spot, and for the next half hour we just roamed over the ground noticing
  the interesting rocks; picking up one here and there for closer examination and discussion. A strong gusty wind was
  blowing, and it was quite cold compared with the heat of the sun’s rays when the wind temporarily subsided. We found
  it more comfortable to turn our back to the wind.
</p>
<p>A short distance beyond where the cars were parked we noticed a shallow dry ‘wash’ bed which seemed to come from the
  end of the mountain ridge at its base. This crossed the highway in a ‘dip’ at what I would estimate to be about a 35
  degree angle, and continued to wind its way between risings on the side of the road where we roamed.
</p>
<p>Curiosity overcame Al. Bailey and myself. Leaving the others, we walked across to the base of this ridge to see what
  was on the other side of the mountains and how the ground lay there. As far as we could see it was similar in every
  respect to the land on the side where we were, except for the highway. And it extended thus for many, many miles.
</p>
<p>About half an hour was spent in this manner when someone suggested it would be a good idea to eat. This was heartily
  approved by all.
</p>
<p>Not knowing what we might encounter before the day was over, Alice had brought along a light lunch—hard-boiled eggs,
  sandwiches, cookies, candy and a few bottled drinks, beside a couple of gallon jars of water for drinking. This was
  now unpacked and passed around.
</p>
<p>Some of us sat on the narrow shoulder that skirted the road beside our cars, but the rocks were sharp and sitting was
  not too comfortable. The others stood nearby, shelling their eggs or eating, as we discussed what to do or where to go
  from there.
</p>
<p>The sky was beautiful and clear with little wispy clouds forming here and there, only to float away into nothingness.
  And although we knew most of the mountains in the background were miles away, they appeared quite close in the
  deceptive atmosphere of the desert.
</p>
<p>Each of us was alert, scanning the broad expanse of sky visible in all directions, and hoping steadfastly for a
  bright flash somewhere out there that would indicate the presence of a space craft. At the same time we noticed that
  passing cars invariably slowed their speed to observe what we were doing.
</p>
<p>Then Betty Bailey said, ‘Let’s take some pictures’.</p>
<p>The Baileys had brought a movie camera, which they had rented and with which they were not too familiar, and some
  extra film. The Williamsons had a still camera.
</p>
<p>It was shortly after 12 noon. Both Betty Bailey and Betty Williamson were still taking pictures when the sound of a
  plane’s motors was heard approaching from behind the ridge of mountains across the road from us.
</p>
<p>Although I speak of these mountains being ‘across the road’, the closest part in their base was probably about the
  length of two city blocks beyond the far edge of the highway. Yet in the stillness of the desert air sounds carry far
  and we heard the plane a good minute before it came into sight, crossing low over the mountain ridge. It was a
  conventional two-motor plane and apparently on a routine flight.
</p>
<p>We watched this plane as it passed almost over our heads, continued its line of travel and became a diminishing speck
  in the distance.
</p>
<p>Suddenly and simultaneously we all turned as one, looking again toward the closest mountain ridge where just a few
  minutes before the first plane had crossed. Riding high, and without sound, there was a gigantic cigar-shaped silvery
  ship, without wings or appendages of any kind. Slowly, almost as if it was drifting, it came in our direction; then
  seemed to stop, hovering motionless.
</p>
<p>Excitedly Dr. Williamson exclaimed, ‘Is that a space ship ?’</p>
<p>At first glance it looked like a fuselage of a very large ship with the sun’s rays reflecting brightly from its
  unpainted sides, at an altitude and angle where wings might not be noticeable.
</p>
<p>Schooled in caution against over-excitement and quick conclusions, especially in regard to aircraft, Lucy replied,
  ‘No. George, I don’t believe it is.’
</p>
<p>‘But that baby’s high ! And see how big it is !’ exclaimed Al.</p>
<p>‘And, Lucy ! It doesn’t have wings or any other appendages like our planes do !’ persisted George. And turning to me,
  ‘What do you think, Adamski ?’
</p>
<p>Before I could answer, Lucy interrupted. ‘You’re right, George ! Look ! It’s orange on top—the whole length !’
</p>
<p>Excitement filled the air as the truth was quickly realised, and everybody began talking at once. Alice wanted me to
  get my telescope out of the car and take a picture of this beautiful ship close by. Al. Bailey wanted his Betty to
  take a movie of it while it was hovering. But she was so excited that she could not set the camera correctly. By the
  time she got herself calmed, the ship was already moving again.
</p>
<p>The two pairs of binoculars which had been brought along were being passed rapidly from one to the other so all could
  get a good look. And it was with the binoculars that George noted a black, or dark, marking on the side as though an
  insignia of some kind was there. This marking was entirely different from any he had ever seen before, although he was
  unable to make it out in detail. A member of the Air Force during the last war, Dr. George Williamson is well
  acquainted with the insignias of planes of other nations as well as our own.
</p>
<p>A never-to-be-forgotten sight. It could easily have been seen by any passing motorist. But comparatively few people
  have ever learned to look up. Especially is this true, and rightfully so, of car drivers travelling down an open
  highway. Their attention is focused on the road ahead.
</p>
<p>Had any one of us been pointing upward, as people often do, chances are that some passing car might have stopped, and
  those within it could have seen this gigantic space visitor as easily as we were seeing it. But we were all cautious
  not to attract such attention.
</p>
<p>And in spite of all the excitement, I knew this was not the place; maybe not even the ship with which contact was to
  be made, if that was in the plan. But I did feel this ship had a definite ‘something‘ to do with it all.
</p>
<p>Fully aware of the curiosity created by our party here in the desert where no one would normally picnic, I did not
  want to be more conspicuous by setting up my telescope and camera in such an open spot. Above all else, I didn’t want
  to make the slightest mistake that might prevent a landing and personal contact being made, if such a possibility
  existed. And now I felt certain that it did.
</p>
<p>I said, ‘Someone take me down the road-quick ! That ship has come looking for me and I don’t want to keep them
  waiting ! Maybe the saucer is already up there somewhere-afraid to come down here where too many people would see
  them.’
</p>
<p>Don’t ask me why I said this or how I knew. I have already said that I have a habit of following my feelings, and
  that is the way I felt. But I cannot tell you why. For those who have an understanding of the subtler working of the
  mind, no explanation is necessary. For others, an explanation might necessarily be long and difficult.
</p>
<p>Lucy quickly got into our car and started the motor. Al. asked if he might go too, and climbed in beside her. Telling
  the others to stay where they were and to watch closely all that took place, 1 got into the back seat of the car.
</p>
<p>As Lucy turned the car around and started down the highway, Al. looked up and I looked out the back window and both
  of us saw the big ship turn also, silently moving along with the car, but high in the sky and what looked like about
  half-way between the highway and the mountain ridge. We both watched it closely as we rode along for about half a
  mile.
</p>
<p>Here I asked Lucy if she could safely turn to the right for a short distance to get me closer to a spot I saw and
  felt would be ideal for setting up my telescope.
</p>
<p>There were tracks of some vehicle clearly visible, and it looked as though a road might be on the ground directly
  under the big ship. Al. and I had noticed this apparent road at the base and running the entire length of this
  mountain ridge when we had walked over to the other end of the ridge shortly after our arrival. At the time we
  discussed it, we decided this was an old abandoned target range and this road had been worn there by jeeps at one
  time.
</p>
<p>The rocks here were small but extremely sharp and hard on tyres. Then there had been bottles broken and glass strewn
  around, so I questioned the wisdom of driving across it. But much time and effort could be saved if we could drive
  instead of having to carry all my equipment by hand to the spot I had chosen, a good half mile in from the highway at
  the base of a flat-top, low, hill-like formation.
</p>
<p>My equipment consisted of my six-inch telescope, a tripod and a cardboard case box containing the camera and
  attachments for the telescope, the film holders, seven in all, loaded with super-fast film, and a Kodak Brownie.
</p>
<p>We decided to try driving in closer and succeeded in making it safely, stopping within about 200 feet of my chosen
  spot. Here the large ship appeared to be almost directly over the car, and as the car stopped, it stopped !
</p>
<p>Al. helped me unload my equipment, set up the tripod and fasten the telescope on it as firmly as possible.</p>
<p>This was difficult since the gusts of wind were blowing quite strong and in spite of all we could do it would shake
  the telescope. And an unfirm foundation is never conducive to good picture taking.
</p>
<p>But I did not want to waste too much time with these preparations because I did not know how much time I was being
  given. I felt a definite need for haste, but as I think back over my experiences, I am not sure whether this feeling
  was coming from those in the big ship, or being created by my own excitement.
</p>
<p>I told Al. and Lucy to get back to the others as quickly as possible and for all of them to watch closely for
  anything that might take place.
</p>
<p>As I have said before, I had many times entertained dreams of actually meeting the personnel of some of the craft I
  had been clicking my camera at for several years. I have expressed myself a number of times as being not only willing
  but decidedly anxious to take a trip in a saucer. This, despite the fact that I have heard a number of rumours of
  people disappearing, with the only explanation seeming to be that they were taken up in a space craft of some kind.
  Most of such rumours seemed well founded as the facts were given to me, and none of these ‘kidnapped‘ persons had, to
  my knowledge, returned.
</p>
<p>Faced with the fact that if there were a landing at this time, and if I were permitted a personal contact with the
  crew that landed, there was also a possibility that I, too, might be privileged to take a trip somewhere with them,
  even to the place from wherever ‘they’ came. Consequently, I wanted to be sure that those with me should witness my
  going.
</p>
<p>That was why I had cautioned all of my companions to watch very carefully to see whatever it might be possible for
  them to see at the distance they were from me. This distance was something between half a mile and a mile.
</p>
<p>Asked how long they should wait before returning for me, yet to be sure their presence would not interrupt anything
  that might be going on, I told Lucy to return for me in an hour, unless I signalled to them before that time. I
  explained that when the saucer left, if one did come in as I was hoping, I would walk to the highway and wave my hat.
  But in all cases, to return at the end of an hour because I was certain everything would be finished by that time.
</p>
<p>As the car was turned to obey my instructions, the big space ship turned its nose in the opposite direction.
  Silently, but quickly, it crossed above the crest of the mountains and was lost to my sight, but not before a number
  of our planes roared overhead in an apparent effort to circle this gigantic stranger.
</p>
<p>Al. and Lucy were able to keep it in sight longer than I because on the highway they were farther from the mountains.
  Not until they had joined the others did it disappear from their sight as it turned its nose upward and shot out into
  space, leaving our planes circling—nothing.
</p>
<p>Alone with my telescope and my thoughts, I busied myself attaching the camera to the telescope and making adjustments
  with the eyepiece. This adjustment had become slightly distorted in the moving and setting up. All the time thoughts
  kept racing through my mind, possibilities of what could take place; fears that nothing would; wondering if the big
  ship would return, or if the planes had chased it away for good; if a strange craft did come close, would I get the
  kind of picture I wanted— one which would be convincing beyond all question to the general public—and a thousand other
  thoughts along this same line.
</p>
<p>And while I had long hoped for a personal contact with a man from a flying saucer, expectation that such would
  actually take place at this time was far from my mind, I was hoping for a good picture, a possible closeup of some
  space craft that would show more detail than I had ever before succeeded in getting. But from previous experiences, I
  would not have been too disappointed if nothing further had occurred.
</p>
<p>Not more than five minutes had elapsed after the car had left me when my attention was attracted by a flash in the
  sky and almost instantly a beautiful small craft appeared to be drifting through a saddle between two of the mountain
  peaks and settling silently into one of the coves about half a mile from me. It did now lower itself entirely below
  the crest of the mountain. Only the lowest portion settled below the crest, while the upper, or dome section, remained
  above the crest and in full sight of the rest of my party who were back there watching. Yet it was in such a position
  that I could see the entire ship as it hovered in the cove ahead of me. At the same time, many miles of the highway
  and surrounding terrain were in full view of the crew within the saucer.
</p>
<p>Quickly I spotted it in the finder on my telescope, and as rapidly as possible I snapped the seven loaded films,
  without taking time to focus through the ground glass in the back of the camera. But I was hoping and praying all of
  the time that Lady Luck was with me and that the pictures would turn out well.
</p>
<p>As I removed each film holder with its exposed negative from the camera—an old Hagee-Dresden Grafles type—I put it in
  the right-hand pocket of the jacket I was wearing. Here, I was sure, these films would be safe from any accident.
</p>
<p>I took the camera off and replaced it in the box in which I had brought it. I then decided to see what I could get
  with the Brownie. As I snapped the first picture I noticed the saucer flash brightly as it moved away and disappeared
  over the same saddle through which it had first come, just as a couple more of our planes roared overhead.
</p>
<p>I stood watching them as they circled a couple of times and then continued on their way. I was sure the saucer had
  again evaded them and was on its way to its mother ship.
</p>
<p>Then I decided to take a couple more pictures with the Brownie just to show the general terrain in this section in
  case my space craft pictures turned out well. I still questioned whether or not they would. But this is always the
  case and I never know until the finishing work is completed. I have never grown to the state of complete assurance of
  having a good picture, as expert photographers usually have when they take one.
</p>
<p>After taking three pictures with the Brownie, I just stood there for a few minutes looking around and with the Kodak
  still in my hand. I was somewhat awed by being so close to a saucer and I wondered if whatever or whoever was in it
  knew I was photographing it. I had a feeling that they did. I only wished I could have seen the one who was operating
  that beautiful craft and could have had a chance to talk with him.... Maybe he would let me look inside.
</p>
<p>Suddenly my reverie was broken as my attention was called to a man standing at the entrance of a ravine between two
  low hills, about a quarter of a mile away. He was motioning to me to come to him, and I wondered who he was and where
  he had come from. I was sure he had not been there before. Nor had he walked past me from the road. He could not have
  come from the side of the mountains on which we were. And I wondered how he had crossed over and descended any part of
  them without me having noticed him.
</p>
<p>A prospector perhaps ? Or someone living among these mountains ? I had thought no one would be within miles of this
  spot when I chose it. Or could he be a rock hound, stranded way out here ? But why was he motioning to me unless he
  needed help ? So I started toward him, mentally questioning in a minor way, but still feeling the exaltation of my
  recent experience.
</p>
<p>As I approached him a strange feeling came upon me and I became cautious. At the same time I looked round to reassure
  myself that we were both in full sight of my companions. Outwardly there was no reason for this feeling, for the man
  looked like any other man, and I could see he was somewhat smaller than I and considerably younger. There were only
  two outstanding differences that I noticed as I neared him.
</p>
<p>1. His trousers were not like mine. They were in style, much like ski trousers and with a passing thought I wondered
  why he wore such out here on the desert.
</p>
<p>2. His hair was long; reaching to his shoulders, and was blowing in the wind as was mine. But this was not too
  strange for I have seen a number of men who wore their hair almost that long.
</p>
<p>Although I did not understand the strange feeling that persisted, it was however a friendly feeling toward the
  smiling young man standing there waiting for me to reach him. And I continued walking toward him without the slightest
  fear.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, as though a veil was removed from my mind, the feeling of caution left me so completely that I was no
  longer aware of my friends or whether they were observing me as they had been told to do. By this time we were quite
  close. He took four steps toward me, bringing us within arm’s length of each other.
</p>
<p>Now, for the first time I fully realised that I was in the presence of a man from space—A HUMAN BEING FROM ANOTHER
  WORLD ! I had not seen his ship as I was walking toward him, nor did I look round for it now. I did not even think of
  his ship, and I was so stunned by this sudden realisation that I was speechless. My mind seemed to temporarily stop
  functioning.
</p>
<p>The beauty of his form surpassed anything I had ever seen. And the pleasantness of his face freed me of all thought
  of my personal self.
</p>
<p>I felt like a little child in the presence of one with great wisdom and much love, and I became very humble within
  myself... for from him was radiating a feeling of infinite understanding and kindness, with supreme humility.
</p>
<p>To break this spell that had so overtaken me—and I am sure he recognised it for what it was—he extended his hand in a
  gesture toward shaking hands.
</p>
<p>I responded in our customary manner.</p>
<p>But he rejected this with a smile and a slight shake of his head. Instead of grasping hands as we on Earth do, he
  placed the palm of his hand against the palm of my hand, just touching it but not too firmly. I took this to be the
  sign of friendship.
</p>
<p>The flesh of his hand to the touch of mine was like a baby’s, very delicate in texture, but firm and warm. His hands
  were slender, with long tapering fingers like the beautiful hands of an artistic woman. In fact, in different clothing
  he could easily have passed for an unusually beautiful woman; yet he definitely was a man.
</p>
<p>He was about five feet, six inches in height and weighed— according to our standards—about 135 pounds. 77 And I would
  estimate him to be about 28 years of age, although he could have been much older.
</p>
<p>77/ As Venusian gravity is less than ours, a Venusian would ‘weigh’ more when on our planet.</p>
<p>He was round faced with an extremely high forehead; large, but calm, grey-green eyes, slightly aslant at the outer
  corners; with slightly higher cheek bones than an Occidental, but not so high as an Indian or an Oriental; a finely
  chiselled nose, not conspicuously large; and an average size mouth with beautiful white teeth that shone when he
  smiled or spoke.
</p>
<p>As nearly as I can describe his skin the colouring would be an even, medium-coloured suntan. And it did not look to
  me as though he had ever had to shave, for there was no more hair on his face than on a child’s.
</p>
<p>His hair was sandy in colour and hung in beautiful waves to his shoulders, glistening more beautifully than any
  woman’s I have ever seen. And I remember a passing thought of how Earth women would enjoy having such beautiful hair
  as this man had. As I said before, he wore no protection over it and it was being blown by the winds.
</p>
<p>His clothing was a one-piece garment which I had a feeling was a uniform worn by spacemen as they travel, like Earth
  men in various types of work wear uniforms to indicate their occupations.
</p>
<p>Its colour was chocolate brown and it was made with a rather full blouse, close-fitting high collar much like a
  turtle neck, only it did not turn down. The sleeves were long, slightly full and similar to a Raglan sleeve, with
  close-fitting bands around the wrists.
</p>
<p>A band about eight inches in width circled his waist. And the only break in colouring of the entire garment was a
  strip about an inch and a half in width at the top and bottom of this waistband. This was brighter and more of a
  golden brown.
</p>
<p>The trousers were rather full and held in at the ankles with bands like those on the sleeves at the wrists, in style
  much like a ski pant.
</p>
<p>Actually it is very difficult to describe this garment in colouring for I know of no descriptive word in our language
  that would suit it perfectly.
</p>
<p>It was definitely a woven material, very fine, and the weave was different from any of our materials. There was a
  sheen about the whole garment, but I could not tell whether or not this was due to a finishing process or whether it
  might be the kind of substance of which its thread was made. It was not like our satin, silk, or rayon, for it had
  more of a radiance than a sheen.
</p>
<p>I saw no zippers, buttons, buckles, fasteners or pockets of any kind, nor did I notice seams as our garments show. It
  is still a mystery to me how this garment was made.
</p>
<p>He wore no ring, watch, or other ornament of any kind. And I saw nothing to indicate, nor did I have a feeling, that
  he had a weapon of any kind on his person.
</p>
<p>His shoes were ox-blood in colour. They too were made of some apparently woven material but different from his suit
  because these looked much like leather. It was soft and flexible because I could see the movement of his feet within
  them as we stood talking.
</p>
<p>High like a man’s oxford, they fitted closely around his feet, which I would say were about size 9 or 9.5 However,
  the opening was on the outer side about half way back on the heel between the arch and the back of the heel. Two
  narrow straps were here, but I saw no buckles or fasteners, and I reasoned that these straps must have the quality of
  stretching similar to the woven inserts in some women’s shoes.
</p>
<p>The heels were slightly lower than on Earth men’s shoes, and the toes were blunt. I noticed his shoes particularly
  because during our conversation he made it very plain to me that his shoe prints were most important. But more about
  that later.
</p>
<p>Suddenly realising that time was passing and I was getting no information by just looking at him, I asked him where
  he came from.
</p>
<p>He did not seem to understand my words, so I asked him again.</p>
<p>But his only response was a slight shake of the head and an almost apologetic expression on his face, which indicated
  to me that he was not understanding either my words or the meaning behind them.
</p>
<p>I am a firm believer that people who desire to convey messages to one another can do so, even though they neither
  speak nor understand the other’s language. This can be done through feelings, signs, and above all, by means of
  telepathy. I had been teaching this as fact for 30 years and now I concluded I would have to use this method if
  information of any kind was to pass between us. And there were a lot of things I wanted to know, if I could only think
  of them.
</p>
<p>So, to convey the meaning of my first question to him, I began forming, to the best of my ability, a picture of a
  planet in my mind. At the same time I pointed to the sun, high in the sky.
</p>
<p>He understood this, and his expression so indicated.</p>
<p>Then I circled the sun with my finger, indicating the orbit of the planet closest to the sun, and said, ‘Mercury’. I
  circled it again for the second orbit, and said, ‘Venus’. The third circle I spoke, ‘Earth,’ and indicated the earth
  upon which we were standing.
</p>
<p>I repeated this procedure a second time, all the while keeping as clear a picture of a planet in my mind as I was
  able to perceive, and this time pointing to myself as belonging to the Earth. Then I indicated him, with a question in
  my eyes and my mind.
</p>
<p>Now he understood perfectly, and smiling broadly he pointed to the sun; made one orbit, made the second, then
  touching himself with his left hand, he gestured several times with his right index finger toward the second orbit.
</p>
<p>I took this to mean that the second planet was his home, so I asked, ‘You mean you come from Venus ?’</p>
<p>This was the third time I had spoken the word ‘Venus ‘in relation to the second planet, and he nodded his head in the
  affirmative. Then he, too, spoke the word ‘Venus’.
</p>
<p>His voice was slightly higher pitched than an adult man’s. Its tonal quality was more that of a young man before his
  voice completes the change from childhood to maturity. And although he had spoken but one word, there was music in his
  voice and I wanted to hear more of it.
</p>
<p>Next I asked, ‘Why are you coming to Earth ?’</p>
<p>This question too was accompanied with gestures and facial expressions as well as mental pictures, as were all the
  questions I asked of him. I repeated each question at least twice to be sure that he understood the meaning of the
  words I was speaking. The expressions of his face and his eyes told me clearly when he understood, or when there was
  still any uncertainty in his mind as to what I was trying to ask. I also repeated the answers he gave me to be sure
  that I was understanding him correctly.
</p>
<p>He made me understand that their coming was friendly. Also, as he gestured, that they were concerned with radiations
  going out from Earth.
</p>
<p>This I got clearly since there was a considerable amount of radiation of heat waves rising from the desert, as is
  often the case. Such as the waves that are often seen rising from pavements, and highways on hot days.
</p>
<p>He pointed to them and then gestured through space.</p>
<p>I asked if this concern was due to the explosions of our bombs with their resultant vast radio-active clouds ?
</p>
<p>He understood this readily and nodded his head in the affirmative.</p>
<p>My next question was whether this was dangerous, and I pictured in my mind a scene of destruction.</p>
<p>To this, too, he nodded his head in the affirmative, but on his face there was no trace of resentment or judgment.
  His expression was one of understanding, and great compassion; as one would have toward a much loved child who had
  erred through ignorance and lack of understanding. This feeling appeared to remain with him during the rest of my
  questions on this subject.
</p>
<p>I wanted to know if this was affecting outer space ?</p>
<p>Again a nod of affirmation.</p>
<p>In this respect let me say here, it has long been known by scientists of Earth that the cosmic ray, as it is called,
  is more powerful in outer space than it is in the Earth’s atmosphere. And if this be true, is it not just as logical
  to assume that the radioactive force from the bombs being tested by nations of Earth could also become more powerful
  in space, once leaving the Earth’s atmosphere ? Logical deduction supports the statement of this space man.
</p>
<p>But I persisted and wanted to know if it was dangerous to us on Earth as well as affecting things in space ?</p>
<p>He made me understand—by gesturing with his hands to indicate cloud formations from explosions—that after too many
  such explosions. Yes ! His affirmative nod of the head was very positive and he even spoke the word ‘Yes’ in this
  instance. The cloud formations were easy to imply with the movement of his hands and arms, but to express the
  explosions he said, ‘Boom ! Boom !’ Then, further to explain himself, he touched me, then as a little weed growing
  close by, and next pointed to the Earth itself, and with ,a wide sweep of his hands and other gestures that too many
  ‘Booms !’ would destroy all of this.
</p>
<p>This seemed sufficiently clear, so I changed the subject and asked him if he had come directly from Venus in the ship
  I had photographed ?
</p>
<p>Here he turned around and pointed up behind the nearby low hill.</p>
<p>There, hovering just above the Earth, was the saucer I had seen earlier and thought had left. I had been so engrossed
  in the man that I had failed to look beyond him into the recesses of the cove to where the small craft had apparently
  returned and remained hovering all this time.
</p>
<p>He was amused at my surprise and laughed a most hearty laugh. But I didn’t feel that he was laughing at me, and
  consequently I felt no embarrassment,
</p>
<p>I laughed with him, and then asked if he had come directly from Venus to Earth in that ?</p>
<p>He shook his head in the negative and made me understand that this craft had been brought into Earth’s atmosphere in
  a larger ship.
</p>
<p>Recalling to mind the large ship we had first seen, I asked if that was the one ?</p>
<p>A nod of affirmation was his reply.</p>
<p>Now in my mind’s picture I put a number of smaller craft— like this one at which I was looking—inside the big ship. I
  could tell by his expression that he was receiving my mental pictures, and I compared this big craft with our own
  naval plane carriers.
</p>
<p>A nod of his head told me this was right.</p>
<p>So I asked if the large craft might be called a ‘Mother‘ ship ?</p>
<p>He seemed to understand the word ‘mother ‘for now his nod of affirmation was accompanied by an understanding smile.
</p>
<p>Next I asked if our ships which had appeared around the ‘Mother’ ship, and those that came down close and observed me
  as I was photographing his smaller craft had bothered them any ?
</p>
<p>To this he answered ‘yes‘ with a nod of his head.</p>
<p>Then I asked, ‘How does your ship operate ? By what power ?’</p>
<p>Although he was very expert in mental telepathy, I had some difficulty in getting a picture of this question in my
  mind. Even though I gestured with my hands as well as I could, it took me several minutes before I succeeded in
  getting him to understand the meaning of my question. But I did finally succeed.
</p>
<p>He made me understand that it was being operated by the law of attraction and repulsion, by picking up a little
  pebble or rock and dropping it; then picking it up again and then showing motion.
</p>
<p>I in turn, to make sure I understood, picked up two pebbles and placed them close to each other as though one was
  magnetic, pulling on the other, illustrating it that way as I spoke the word ‘magnetic’. After a short time of doing
  this, he answered me; even repeating the word ‘magnetic’ which I had already spoken a number of times.
</p>
<p>Then he replied ‘yes’.</p>
<p>Here I remembered about the little disks that had so often been reported. This was easy, for I indicated with my
  hands a small circle, then I pointed to his hovering craft and to him, while in my mind I was wondering if these
  little disks were piloted.
</p>
<p>He quickly understood and shook his head in the negative. Then also making a small circle with his two hands, he
  raised it to his eyes and then pointed to his ship, followed by a gesture toward space, and I received his thought of
  the big ship.
</p>
<p>I understood this to mean that the little disks often reported sighted were really eyes of larger craft—either the
  saucers or the mother ships—remotely controlled and not piloted. As I reviewed this in my mind, he assured me J was
  right.
</p>
<p>Then in my mind I saw an explosion in space with a bright flash.</p>
<p>As this picture formed in my mind, he laughed and made me understand that in such cases something had gone wrong with
  the little disks so they could not be brought back to the ship that had sent them out. Then the control had caused a
  crosscurrent, or short circuit, to take place. And an explosion resulted. But he assured me that this was always done
  out far enough so that there was no danger to men on Earth.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pic. 9</p>
<p>The affidavits vouching for Adamski's meeting with the Venusian, November 20, 1952</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suddenly the thought came to me to ask if he believed in God ?</p>
<p>This he did not understand, for he was not familiar with the word ‘God’. But I finally succeeded in getting the
  thought in my mind—he was watching me closely—of creating something, and then with the motion of my hand, symbolising
  the vast sky, the earth and all, and speaking the words ‘Creator of All’.
</p>
<p>After a few repetitions of this he understood my thoughts, for I am sure my gestures were not too good.</p>
<p>And he said, ‘yes’.</p>
<p>I realised fully that he naturally wouldn’t understand our names for things and to him God probably would be
  represented by some other word or name.
</p>
<p>But he made me understand, by elaborating a little longer with his gestures and mental pictures, that we on Earth
  really know very little about this Creator. In other words, our understanding is shallow. Theirs is much broader, and
  they adhere to the Laws of the Creator instead of laws of materialism as Earth men do. Pointing to himself, then up
  into space—which I understood meant the planet on which he lived—he conveyed the thought to me that there they live
  according to the Will of the Creator, not by their own personal will, as we do here on Earth.
</p>
<p>I then asked if there were any more landings forthcoming like this one.</p>
<p>He answered me, saying there had been many landings before, and there will be many more.</p>
<p>Are space people coming only from Venus ? Or are there other planets or systems from which they come ? I asked, and
  here again I had a little difficulty in conveying my thoughts. But I finally succeeded.
</p>
<p>To this he made me understand that people are coming Earthwards from other planets in our system, and from planets of
  other systems beyond ours. I had suspected this for a long time, so his reply was no surprise to me. But now I wanted
  to know, ‘Is space travelling a common practice with the people of other worlds ? And is it easy ?’
</p>
<p>He spoke the word ‘yes’ in answer to both of these questions.</p>
<p>I remembered reports of men being found dead in some saucers that have been found on Earth—saucers that had
  apparently crashed. So I asked if any of their men had ever died on coming to Earth ?
</p>
<p>He nodded his head in the affirmative, and made me understand that things had on occasion gone wrong within their
  ships.
</p>
<p>I could understand this because I knew that both the big ship We had all seen first and the smaller one I had
  photographed were mechanical craft. And things can go wrong with any mechanical device.
</p>
<p>But I wasn’t satisfied. I had a feeling that he was trying to save my feelings, but I wanted the whole truth. So I
  persisted, and asked whether men of this world had been responsible for any of these deaths ?
</p>
<p>His reply to this was ‘yes’, and by holding up his hands several times, as well as with other gestures, he tried to
  tell me how many.
</p>
<p>But I could not get the numbers. I could not be sure whether he was indicating actual numbers, or whether his
  indications should be multiplied by tens or hundreds, or by what number according to our method of counting.
</p>
<p>Remembering a question that had often been asked of me by people with whom I had talked, I asked why they never land
  in populated places ?
</p>
<p>To this he made me understand that there would be a tremendous amount of fear on the part of the people, and probably
  the visitors would be torn to pieces by the Earth people, if such public landings were attempted.
</p>
<p>I understood how right he was, and within my mind wondered if there ever would be a time when such a landing would be
  safe. I was wondering, too, if such a time ever arrived, would they then attempt public landings.
</p>
<p>He read my thoughts as they were passing through my mind, and assured me that such a time would arrive. And when it
  did, they would make landings in populated territories. But he made me understand clearly that it would not be soon.
</p>
<p>In the beginning of our conversation, when I realised that I would have to use my hands for gestures to get this man
  from Venus to understand my questions, I had set my Kodak on the ground. Now I picked it up and asked him if I could
  take a picture of him ?
</p>
<p>I am sure that he understood my desire, since he was so good at reading my mind. Also I am positive that he knew I
  would do him no harm because he showed no signs of fear when I picked up the Kodak. Nevertheless, he did object to
  having his picture taken, and I did not insist.
</p>
<p>I have heard many times that men from other worlds are walking the streets of Earth. And if this be true, I could
  easily understand his desire not to be photographed, because there were a few distinguishing points about his facial
  features. Normally these would not be noticed. But in a photograph they would be conspicuous and serve as points of
  identification for his brothers who have come to Earth. However, I respected his desires and felt it unwise to
  question further on this subject.
</p>
<p>But I did ask him if any Earth people had been taken away in space craft.</p>
<p>He smiled broadly, and in half-way manner nodded his head in the affirmative, although I felt that he was not too
  willing to give that information.
</p>
<p>One more question persisted—that of a particular case I knew.</p>
<p>He answered this question for me, but warned me not to mention it further. In fact, I might add right here that he
  told me a number of things which I must not reveal at this time.
</p>
<p>So, changing the subject again, I asked how many other planets are inhabited ?</p>
<p>He indicated that large numbers of them throughout the universe are inhabited by human beings like us.</p>
<p>Then more specifically, I inquired how many in our system ?</p>
<p>He made a large circle with his hand and covered it with a sweeping motion, as if meaning that all of them were.
</p>
<p>I wondered whether I understood him correctly, and he made me realise quite firmly that I did.</p>
<p>Naturally my next attempt was to learn if people everywhere are all of the same form as we on Earth.</p>
<p>His response to this question was emphatic, as if he knew exactly what he was talking about, and I understood clearly
  that the form is very much universal. He tried to explain further, but I could not understand too clearly whether they
  vary in size, colouring and flesh textures on various planets, or whether there is a mixture on each planet as on
  Earth. Logical analysis would indicate the likelihood of the latter.
</p>
<p>Despite the conclusions of most ‘orthodox‘ scientists it has always seemed to me a fallacy to believe that other
  planets are not the home of intelligent beings even as is our Earth.
</p>
<p>All planets are apparently made out of similar substances. All revolve in the same space. Some are larger, some
  smaller than others, and all are in varying degrees of development—changing ceaselessly. This is true of all forms,
  whatever they are, wherever they be.
</p>
<p>Reflecting telescopes will never give the full answer. For just as they reflect the light from a planet, they reflect
  also the particles moving in our atmosphere, and throughout space, and in the atmosphere surrounding the body they are
  studying.
</p>
<p>Until finer devices are developed to filter out all the reflections from the countless moving particles everywhere
  present, a correct reading of any other body in space will be impossible with a reflecting telescope.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if and when the much-talked-of space platform becomes a reality, I believe actual facts about
  space will be revealed to our ever-searching scientists, and this will cause the reversal of many theories that today
  are accepted as facts.
</p>
<p>Presence of space craft in our atmosphere, and personal contacts such as the one I have made, prove the old
  astronomical theories to be wrong. As completely wrong as man’s sailing around the world proved the ancient theory of
  the Earth being square to be incorrect.
</p>
<p>Since there are people on other planets, I wanted to know if they die, as Earth men die ?</p>
<p>He smiled, and remembered a question I had asked earlier, if any of his people had died in coming to Earth ?</p>
<p>So to clear the subject for me, he pointed to his body and nodded in the affirmative—that bodies do die. But pointing
  to his head, which I assumed to mean his mind, or intelligence, he shook his head in negation, this does not die. And
  with a motion of his hand, he gave me the impression that this—the intelligence—goes on evolving. Then pointing to
  himself, he indicated that once he lived here on this Earth: then pointing up into space—but now he is living out
  there.
</p>
<p>I tried to learn the time involved in this type of transition but did not succeed in getting an answer from him. I
  did receive an impression but cannot say definitely that it is correct since so many thoughts were going through my
  mind. I could have allowed a slight confusion to enter.
</p>
<p>An awareness of time began pressing upon me and there were so many questions I still had not asked him. I was trying
  to remember them and decide which ones were most important.
</p>
<p>One question I wanted very much to ask him was, ‘Is the moon inhabited ?’ I believe it is, and that the people of
  other planets who indulge in inter-planetary travelling have bases there. My theory about other planets and the
  atmosphere surrounding them includes the moon. 76
</p>
<p>76/ Professor Shapley at Harvard announced the presence of lunar atmosphere in March, 1953.</p>
<p>But I forgot this one. Should I ever get another chance to talk with an inter-planetary traveller, I hope I remember
  to ask this question.
</p>
<p>Nor did I ask him his name. But in a time like this, names and personalities are entirely forgotten. They mean so
  little and are very unimportant. Perhaps, if I should be privileged to meet him a number of times in the future I
  might remember to ask his name. Nor would I ask the name of any other inter-planetary traveller I should ever be
  permitted to contact, if it was in any way similar to this contact. In fact, I didn’t even think of this point until
  someone later asked me about it.
</p>
<p>He, too, must have received an impression that our visit was drawing to a close and that he must return to his
  waiting ship. For he kept pointing to his feet and talking in a language I surely had never before heard. It sounded
  like a mixture of Chinese with a tongue that I felt could have sounded like one of the ancient languages spoken here
  on Earth. I have no way of knowing this as fact. It was only my reaction as I listened, and his voice was indeed
  musical to listen to.
</p>
<p>From his talk and his pointing to his feet, I felt there must be something very important there for me. And as he
  stepped to one side from the spot where he had been standing, I noticed strange markings from the print of his shoe
  left in the earth. He looked intently at me to see that I was understanding what he wanted me to do. And as I
  indicated that I did, and would comply, he stepped carefully on to another and another spot. Thus he made three sets
  of deep and distinct footmarkings. I believe his shoes must have been especially made for this trip and the markings
  heavily embossed on the soles to leave such deep imprints.
</p>
<p>Then motioning for me to come with him, we turned and walked side-by-side toward the waiting ship.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful small craft, shaped more like a heavy glass bell than a saucer. Yet I could not see through it any
  more than one can see through the glass bricks that are popular in some of the newer office buildings and homes, which
  permit more light to enter than would solid walls.
</p>
<p>It was translucent and of exquisite colour.</p>
<p>As we approached it, I suddenly became aware of a shadowy form moving within the ship, but there were no definite
  outlines and I could not say whether it was a man or a woman.
</p>
<p>However, that no mistake may be given here, let me say that I definitely do not believe this ship was made of glass
  such as we know it. It was a specially processed metal. Let me explain it in this way.
</p>
<p>Carbon is a soft, opaque, elementary substance. Diamond is a clear, hard stone which radiates prismatic colours in
  the presence of light—and is almost indestructible. Yet basically a diamond is carbon. Through natural processes of
  heat and pressure, Nature has transmuted the soft carbon into the hard diamond.
</p>
<p>Earth scientists are working with this same principle and are having success to a limited degree.</p>
<p>It is my belief that the men on other planets—more versed in universal laws—have learned and are using these laws for
  practical purposes. I believe they know how to bring their primary elements from the opaque stage to a translucent
  stage, yet practically indestructible in hardness, as is the diamond. And it was of such a material that this space
  craft was made.
</p>
<p>And after being so close to one of their small craft as I was to this Scout Ship, it is my firm conviction that it is
  this quality that makes them so elusive to our eyes and even to cameras, yet showing them on radar screens which
  require a density of some kind to show up. For I am told by radar operators that lights alone, or light reflections on
  clouds, do not show on radar screens. Neither do clouds, with the exception of rain clouds and ionised clouds.
</p>
<p>Also it is this translucent quality, along with the power they use, that makes them often appear as different
  coloured lights without definite form.
</p>
<p>The ship was hovering above the ground, about a foot or two at the far side from me, and very near to the bank of the
  hill. But the slope of the hill was such that the front, or that part of it closest to me, was a good six feet above
  the earth. The three-ball landing gear was half lowered below the edge of the flange that covered them, and I had a
  feeling this was a precautionary act just in case they had definitely to land. Some of the gusts of wind were pretty
  strong and caused the ship to wobble at times. When this took place, the sun reflecting on the surface of the ship
  caused beautiful prismatic rays of light to reflect out from it, as from a smoky diamond.
</p>
<p>This was observed, too, by the six others who maintained a steady watch from a distance.</p>
<p>The splendour as it flashed its prismatic colours in the sunlight surpassed every idea I had ever had about space
  craft. A beautiful vision in actuality. The answer to many questions. A long-cherished hope realised... for here
  before me, silent in the desert stillness and hovering as if poised for flight, this ship of unearthly construction
  waited our approach !
</p>
<p>The very realisation of the experience I was having overwhelmed me... and I found myself speechless. No longer was I
  concerned with Earth alone. Rather, it was more like living in two worlds at the same time, and though I should live
  to be a hundred years of age, or more, I shall never forget the joy and the thrill of my first close approach to a
  Scout Ship from planet Venus—a sister to Earth.
</p>
<p>Nearing the ship, I noticed a round ball at the very top that looked like a heavy lens of some kind. And it glowed. I
  wondered if this could be used as one end of a magnetic pole to draw their power from space as they were moving
  through it. In the photographs this ball looks like a large ring, and I have been asked if it was used to hold the
  smaller craft in place in the mother ship. I doubt this, unless it is suspended in its place in the larger ship
  through the force of magnetism. This could easily be.
</p>
<p>The top of the craft was dome shaped, with a ring of gears or heavy coil built into and encircling the side wall at
  the base of this domed top. This, too, glowed as though power was going through it.
</p>
<p>There were round portholes in the side wall, but not all the way round, because immediately above one of the balls of
  landing gear I noticed that the wall was solid. Whether this was true over the other two balls I cannot say because I
  did not walk around the ship. The covered portholes must have been made of a different quality or thickness of
  material for they were clear and transparent.
</p>
<p>And once, for a fleeting second, I saw a beautiful face appear and look out. I felt that whoever was inside was
  looking for the one who was still out with me, but no word was spoken. The face disappeared so quickly that I caught
  only a glimpse of it, but I did notice that this person, too, had long hair like the man I had been talking with.
</p>
<p>The lower outside portion of the saucer was made like a flange, very shiny yet not smooth as a single piece of metal
  would appear. It seemed to have layers of a fashion, but they couldn’t be used as steps because they were in reverse
  to what steps should be. I have no idea of the reason for such construction, but it must have had a purpose.
</p>
<p>I was absorbed in observing every detail of this strange and beautiful craft as we neared it, and I wondered just how
  they were managing to keep it in the hovering state as I saw it.
</p>
<p>My space-man companion warned me not to get too close to it and he himself stopped a good foot away from it. But I
  must have stepped just a little closer than he, for as I turned to speak to him, my right shoulder came slightly under
  the outer edge of the flange and instantly my arm was jerked up, and almost at the same instant thrown back down
  against my body. The force was so strong that, although I could still move the arm, I had no feeling in it as I
  stepped clear of the ship.
</p>
<p>My companion was quite distressed about this accident, but he had warned me and I alone was to blame. However, he did
  assure me that in time it would be all right. Three months later, his words have been proved true for feeling has
  returned and only an occasional shooting pain as of a deeply-bruised bone returns to remind me of the incident. 78
</p>
<p>78/ When Adamski hurt his arm the visitor tried to grab it to save him. In so doing he slightly grazed his own hand
  on the flange and drew blood—red blood like our own, which seems to discredit any idea that he may have had a
  different organic system to that of earth men.
</p>
<p>At the time I was not so concerned about my arm as I was about the exposed negatives still in the pocket of my jacket
  on that side. Immediately I reached in and removed them to put them in my other pocket.
</p>
<p>As I held them in my hand, this visitor from Venus reached out and indicated that he would like one. Whether or not
  he realised that the power from his ship might have neutralised the film to a certain extent, I have no way of
  knowing.
</p>
<p>However, at his request, I held the entire stack out to him and he took the top one. This he placed in the front of
  his blouse, but I still didn’t see any opening or pocket of any kind.
</p>
<p>As he did this, he made me understand that he would return the holder to me, but I did not understand how, when, or
  where.
</p>
<p>I asked him if I could take a ride in his ship ?</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>Then I asked if I could just go inside to see what it looked like in there.</p>
<p>But, smiling very cordially, he made me understand that would be impossible at this time for he must be going.
</p>
<p>I was a little disappointed, but at the same time it gave me, hope that there would be another time and another
  opportunity.
</p>
<p>Since I was not permitted inside the ship I cannot answer all the questions I have been asked about its construction,
  air conditioning, etc. However, it is my theory that they have solved their space craft construction problems as we
  have learned to build submarines for underwater travel. I believe space problems and water problems are very similar
  in respect to travelling through them. Both are fluid. Water is but gases in liquid form. Space is composed of gases
  in free state.
</p>
<p>With a few graceful steps he reached the bank at the back of the ship and stepped up on to the flange. At least that
  is the way it looked to me. Where the entrance was, or how he went into the ship, I do not know for sure, but as it
  silently rose and moved away, it turned a little and I saw a small opening about the centre of the flange being closed
  by what looked like a sliding door.
</p>
<p>Also I heard the two occupants talking together, and their voices were as music, but their words I could not
  understand.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pic. 13</p>
<p>One of the witnesses, Alice Wells, made this sketch of the visitor while watching the interview through binoculars.
  It conveys the broad features of his appearance but is far short of doing him justice.
</p>
<p>As the ship started moving, I noticed two rings under the flange and a third around the centre disk, this inner ring
  and the outer one appeared to be revolving clockwise, while the ring between these two moved in a counter clockwise
  motion.
</p>
<p>As I stood in this mountainous recess—a solitary man watching the beautiful Scout Ship glide silently over the crest
  of the mountains and disappear into space—I felt that a part of me was going with it. For, strange as it may sound,
  the presence of this inhabitant of Venus was like the warm embrace of great love and understanding wisdom, and with
  his departure I felt an absence of this warm embrace.
</p>
<p>There was an emptiness such as can be compared only with the feelings experienced when a very dear one departs; yet a
  longing remains for his presence. And to this very day I feel the same emptiness and longing whenever I think of this
  visitor from another world.
</p>
<p>Yet there was and is an inexpressible joy for the privilege I had been given of glimpsing friends from a world beyond
  this Earth—and the ecstacy of a visit with one of them.
</p>
<p>After this small craft had completely disappeared from sight, I hurriedly returned to the footprints my friend had
  impressed so strongly upon my mind.
</p>
<p>As I was walking back to them I noticed that both his footprints and mine were visible as we had walked together
  toward the hovering ship. But his were deeper in every instance than mine. 77 When I reached the place where he had so
  deliberately impressed the markings, I picked up some rocks and laid a border around the prints until I could call the
  others to come and see them, and Dr. Williamson could make casts of them.
</p>
<p>77/ As Venusian gravity is less than ours, a Venusian would ‘weigh’ more when on our planet.</p>
<p>I knew he could do this because, being an anthropologist, he was well experienced in such things. And on this trip we
  had tried to be prepared for any eventuality, even to having along a small package of plaster of Paris.
</p>
<p>On my way to the highway to signal the others as we had agreed, I paused momentarily by my telescope to put the Kodak
  Brownie in the box with the camera belonging to the telescope.
</p>
<p>All of them, as they were watching, had seen the small craft as it flashed through the sky on its take-off. But if
  they had not they would have known something had taken place because of the number of planes circling over the
  vicinity. And one large B-36 had appeared right over the scene. The noise of these planes was much in contrast to the
  silent movement of the two types of space craft which we had all just seen.79
</p>
<p>79/ The first recorded instance of one of the big mother ships being seen to discharge a formation of ‘Scout Ships‘
  was just over two centuries ago at Augermannland, when glowing disks, or balls, or saucers were seen to emerge from a
  bright tube, or cigar-shaped object high in the sky.
</p>
<p>And M. Trecul of L’Academic Francaise observed a small saucer, with a long fiery wake, leave a huge ‘aerial cigar
  with pointed ends‘ on 20 August 1880.
</p>
<p>‘The Disks having been launched from a huge mother ship’. So reads a two-page headline in a lengthy article entitled
  ‘Flying Saucers from Outer Space’ in look magazine of the first week in October 1953, describing how saucer launchings
  from the big cigar ships have been clearly observed by radar.
</p>
<p>‘At the same time (5.31 a.m., December 6 1952, on a B29 crossing the Gulf of Mexico) Harter caught sight of a huge
  blip—a half-inch spot on the scope. Amazed, he saw the most fantastic thing of all. Still moving at more that 5,000
  miles an hour, the smaller craft merged with the larger machine. Instantly the huge blip began to accelerate. It
  flashed acrossed Harter’s scope and was gone. The meaning of what they had seen was inescapable. The disks had been
  launched from a huge mother ship for some type of reconnaissance mission. After the B29 was sighted, one group had
  been’ diverted for a brief observation. Then, flying at 5,000 m.p.h., they had been taken back aboard the mother ship.
  It was almost unbelievable. But the radar set had been working perfectly, and the visual confirmation, as Bailey and
  Ferris saw the machines flash by, was final, absolute proof. Three separate times, saucers had been seen visually
  where the three radarscopes showed them.’
</p>
<p>Excitedly checking their watches, my friends were preparing to start on their way to me when they saw me waving my
  hat in the prearranged signal. It had been exactly 60 minutes from the time we had separated. And I had told them to
  wait one hour before coming after me, whether they saw me signalling or not.
</p>
<p>Waiting by the roadside until they reached me, I suggested they leave the cars there instead of again driving over
  those sharp rocks.
</p>
<p>I was so excited—although I had not realised it—that I could scarcely talk. They, too, were excited and all began
  asking questions at the same time. I told them I had talked with the man and he had left footprints. ‘Come on—look at
  them !’ And that was all I needed to say.
</p>
<p>George took the plaster of Paris, a couple of mixing pans and a gallon jug of water out of the car, and together we
  all walked back up to the footmarkings.
</p>
<p>In spite of the rough walking, questions were fired at me from all sides, but I seemed to be in another world. I felt
  as though I was only moving bodily here on Earth, and my answers to the questions were given in a daze. This feeling
  of being in two worlds at the same time continued with me for a couple of weeks, and even now when a strong memory of
  the experience overtakes me, this feeling returns.
</p>
<p>Arriving at the spot where the visitor and I had stood talking, and where the footprints were purposely embedded in
  the earth, everybody gathered around, with various exclamations as all noted the strange markings. Truly, here was a
  message that would take much work to interpret.
</p>
<p>Both the Bettys took photographs of the prints, while Alice, a splendid artist, sketched them, for each print
  contained different markings. After photographing them, Betty Bailey also made quick sketches of them. To my
  knowledge, none of these photographs turned out good enough to show anything distinctly.
</p>
<p>There was not sufficient plaster of Paris to make casts of all of the prints—there were more than a dozen good ones
  of the visitor’s steps as he walked from the ship to where we stood talking, and then returned to his ship. So George
  was able to make only good complete set and two partial sets.
</p>
<p>The one good set he took home with him for preservation treatment and careful study. One of the other sets he gave to
  me, and the third set he took home with him in the hope that some of the symbols would show up plainer in the partial
  casts, and together he could get more detailed symbols to study.
</p>
<p>Since then he has done excellent work on interpreting these symbols from astronomical charts and ancient symbology.
  So we now have a partial message.
</p>
<p>Others, too, have worked independently in an effort to learn the message of the symbols. And while much has been
  learned, there is still a great deal of work to be done before the full message is known.
</p>
<p>I have been asked in this connection, how symbols of another planet could be interpreted here on Earth. The reasoning
  on which these people have worked has been twofold:
</p>
<p>1. That ancient civilisations have lived on Earth whose development and understanding of the Universe in which they
  lived was far superior to that of man today. Thus their symbols—records of their wisdom—would be of a Universal
  nature. If, through careful comparison, the symbols in the foot-markings were found to be like those left on Earth by
  ancient civilisations, a comprehensible message could be worked out.
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Pic. 14</p>
<p>Left Foot. Right Foot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Astronomy has its symbols. If any of these were found in the footmarkings, they could be understood as guide posts
  in space, presently being used by men of other worlds in interplanetary travel. And thus a helpful hand is extended to
  Earth-men as they turn their thoughts and efforts outwardly toward space travelling.
</p>
<p>During all the while the footprints were being photographed, sketched and casts made of them, planes were circling
  overhead as if trying to see what was going on down there on the ground, narrowing their circling, widening it, and
  banking as they turned.
</p>
<p>I was aware of their presence because their motors resounded in the still desert air, and sometimes a shadow crossed
  the ground. But I was not interested enough to try to keep count of how many there were at any one time, or during the
  entire time. My thoughts were more with my recent visitor and his craft.
</p>
<p>Several hours were consumed before the excitement had subsided a little and the casts were made and sufficiently
  dried to wrap and pack for carrying without danger of crumbling or breaking.
</p>
<p>George and Al. asked permission to give a report to an Arizona paper and I granted it. They decided to drive to
  Phoenix since that was the closest large city whose papers would probably have the greatest coverage. They asked me a
  number of questions to help them in their report, one of which was— ‘How large was the saucer ?’
</p>
<p>I answered ‘about 20 feet’ but I was still in that ‘daze’ and did not recall actually noticing how large it was. I
  had noted the details and not the overall. But to substantiate their report, I gave them a couple of the holders with
  exposed film in them for the paper to finish and use, if they so desired.
</p>
<p>We carried the telescope and other equipment to the highway and packed everything safely in the cars.</p>
<p>After everything was packed and checked for safe riding, and while we were all taking a last long look around this,
  to us, historical spot, Al. made a marker of rocks and an empty bottle to locate the place again if anyane wanted to
  come out in the near future to investigate and see the footprints. I made a different type of marking in a bush
  nearby.
</p>
<p>Then we drove to Desert Center for dinner. Probably we appeared as a detached and ‘big-eyed’ group in the little
  restaurant that evening as we tried to associate such a mundane thing as bodily nourishment with the veritable
  ‘other-worldly’ experience from which we had just come.
</p>
<p>Al. took the speedometer reading on his car and it was exactly 10.2 miles from the place on the highway to the
  intersection at Desert Center. This was the only accurate mileage reading made that day. Other distances and times
  were approximations, with two exceptions—the time the large cigar-shaped ship was first sighted, and the sixty minutes
  I was away from the others, taking photographs and talking with the man from space.
</p>
<p>On 24 November the Phoenix Gazette published the report of my contact with the Venusian, along with photographs of
  the four witnesses who had given them the story. A picture of sketches made of the footmarkings and a very poor
  photograph of the saucer—the best of those taken at the time and which were in my pocket when I was caught in the
  power of the craft —accompanied the story.
</p>
<p>That report published was true fact, with two exceptions. I am not associated with the staff of the big observatory
  on top of Mt. Palomar, nor do I own the business at Palomar Gardens. These mistakes have been made many times in the
  past and I am doing my best to correct them.
</p>
<p>Since there were a number of good footprints left in the ground when we left, the two men, Al. and George, suggested
  that the reporters drive out with them to see the prints for themselves.
</p>
<p>This was not done, because the story was accepted as given, and the sketches were proof of their reality. However,
  let me say here, according to the report given me, the newspaper men did not accept the story as a matter of course.
  They were first incredulous and tried in every way to break it down and to get some of the witnesses to change their
  story. One man reminded the women folks of the dangers they were all submitting themselves to if their story was false
  But all four remained firm on what they had personally seen and the facts as I had told them.
</p>
<p>Then excitement gripped the newspaper folks (although caution remained uppermost), and fear that a competitor might
  get a scoop on them resulted in a truncated version of the story being accepted and published in the Gazette.
</p>
<p>Readers were so interested in the story of this contact that every copy of that issue of the paper was quickly
  snapped up and for some time afterwards the Phoenix Gazette had to turn down requests from people all over the
  country, who had their money refunded to them.
</p>
<p>At home I told a few people of my contact just to get their reaction, but since the photographs I had taken had not
  turned out well, I had nothing tangible with which to support myself, because I did not want to risk displaying the
  casts and having them broken. But since I have a number of earlier pictures, and since I have been talking and
  lecturing on this subject for more than three years, most of the people with whom I discussed the episode did believe
  my report of this personal contact.
</p>
<p>Some expressed fear, some dismay, and others wanted to know when another contact might take place so they could be
  present and maybe be taken for a trip. These still remain the reactions of the people as I tell them of my experience,
  even though now I have good photographs and good drawings of the footmarkings with several preliminary but far from
  complete interpretations of the message contained therein.
</p>
<p>Also a story of the contact with pictures of the ship was carried in series by the Oceanside, California, Blade
  Tribune, a daily paper. This story was written by one of their reporters who made a special trip up to see and
  interview me. This paper also quickly ran out of all copies of the issue carrying the story.
</p>
<p>* * * * * *</p>
<p>Certain students of this subject have asked me if I thought saucers and their occupants might normally be ‘etheric’
  in nature or texture, but be able to ‘condense’ and so take on ‘solidarity’ and ‘visibility‘ in Earth’s environment.
</p>
<p>This is an involved subject. There are, of course, more things in heaven and earth than we have dreamed of and it
  never pays to be too arbitrary about those things which as yet we ‘see through a glass darkly’. But for now I am
  confining myself to a factual accounting of what I actually saw and heard on that memorable 20 November and the
  texture and substance of both this man and his ship were far from being anything through which you could stick your
  finger. It was ‘solid’ in the way anything else is solid in our three-dimension world.
</p>
<p>‘And if they can live and breathe in our atmosphere, how do they maintain existence in space ?’</p>
<p>These are things they have worked out, just as our own interplanetary societies are now endeavouring to work them
  out. I believe that later on all these things will be made plain to us. Their mother ships could naturally be the
  answer to much of this problem, but further comments, discussion and opinion on this technical phase of the phenomena
  will be reserved for a later and forthcoming book.
