  <h2>Flying saucers have landed</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If Adamski and the six companions who swore an affidavit to his Space Man encounter are not trying to pull off a
      gigantic hoax, then this is quite possibly the greatest story ever.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That was what the Daily Sketch wrote about" Flying Saucers Have Landed." For, in the second part of this book,
    Adamski swears that he saw a space ship land in the desert in California and that he made contact with one of its
    occupants. More, he provides considerable testimony to support his claims.
  </p>
  <p>Desmond Leslie, who contributes the first part of the book, goes even further, asserting that flying saucers have
    been landing on earth for thousands of years, and gives records of their arrivals

  <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
  <p class="exergue">I wish to thank Michael Juste, Robert Roberts, b.sc., Harold Chibbett, Oswald Frewen and Herbert
    Jones, who in various ways have provided me with invaluable assistance in the preparation of Book One. I also wish
    to thank the Editors of Time and Life for their kind permission to reprint the seven incidents from Life mentioned
    in Chapter 2; Elliott Rockmore for kindly supplying the Flying Saucer Review, referred to in Chapter 4; Theosophical
    Publishing House for allowing liberal quotations from the works of Besant, Leadbeater and Sinnett; Lucis Press for
    the quotations from The Tibetan; Andrew Dakers Ltd for the extract from More Things In Heaven, and the various
    Saucer Research Groups throughout the world who have furnished material. Also to Hutchinson & Co. (Publishers) Ltd,
    for permission to quote from The Flying Saucers Are Real, by Donald Keyhoe. No acknowledgment would be complete
    without a most grateful thought cast in the direction of the shade of the late Charles Fort, whose researches have
    literally saved me years of labour. <span class="source">DESMOND LESLIE</span>
  </p>
  <p class="exergue">With grateful thanks I acknowledge the sincere co-operation and untiring efforts of those who have
    helped me make this book possible. And without the editing and helpful encouragement of C.L.J. this book in its
    present form and at this time would have been impossible. <span class="source">GEORGE ADAMSKI</span></p>

  <h2>Foreword</h2>
  <p>About eighteen million years ago, say the strange and ancient legends of our little planet, at a time when Mars,
    Venus and Earth were in close conjunction, along a magnetic path so formed came a huge, shining, radiant vessel of
    dazzling power and beauty, bringing to earth ‘thrice thirty-five’ human beings, of perfection beyond our highest
    ideals; gods rather than men; divine kings of archaic memory, under whose benign world-government a shambling,
    hermaphrodite monster was evolved into thinking, sexual man. 1
  </p>
  <p>1/ See: The Tibetan and A. Bailey, A Treatise on Cosmic Fire; Annie Besant, The Pedigree of Man; H. P. Blavatsky,
    The Secret Doctrine, Vols. I and III; A. E. Powell, The Solar System; C. W. Leadbeater and Annie Besant, Man, Where,
    Whence and Whither.
  </p>
  <p>The arts by which these elder members of the Solar Family propelled their vessels, raised great weights, and
    ordered their dominion over natural elements (say the legends) were imparted to our early forefathers who, later,
    built shining vessels of their own, and with colossal intuition explored the upper spaces, and sought out the
    secrets of the inner depths. They understood and wielded states of matter whose existence modern science barely
    suspects, and constructed forms outside the crippling limitations of tangible matter.
  </p>
  <p>From then until the present day, earthly constructions, and constructions from a myriad of other worlds, have been
    seen and recorded in our sky.
  </p>
  <p>When press and radio came, enabling man to fill the whole world with his chatter, hitherto restricted by the
    effective range of his lungs, a luminous body seen over London or an aerial phenomenon seen in Western America would
    cause speculation in Australia and wonder in India all on the same day—thanks to the modern improvements.
  </p>
  <p>That is why, on 24 June 1947, when Kenneth Arnold saw a fleet of ten shining circular disks whizzing along at a
    thousand miles per hour, darting in and out of the peaks around Mount Rainier, State of Washington, the news flashed
    round the world with the speed of light waves, and started the commotion we call flying saucers.
  </p>
  <p>Arnold certainly started something (revived would be more accurate), and from then on a steady stream of reports
    came in, mainly from trustworthy, observant citizens who had noticed that an early form of locomotion was once more
    active in the air. In spite of constant denials and quite unbelievable explanations, the governments of the world
    have gradually been forced to give their attention to the matter and to create secret departments for investigation.
    Today, the American Government has dropped its original attitude of disbelief and admitted that it has over eighteen
    hundred authentic cases on its files. The British Air Ministry is more cautious, but grudgingly admits that it also
    has a secret department to deal with or to discourage questions.
  </p>
  <p>The American Government, however, on 25 September 1952 dropped the alarming hint that it accepts these phenomena
    but hints that it is not in the public interest for it to publish all it knows.
  </p>
  <p>Now such a remark is disquieting, not only to those old ladies who nightly peer beneath their beds for burglars,
    but also to the general public, down whose communal spine a slightly chilling sensation is apt to pass. Thus it is
    the purpose of this book to find out just what that something could be the authorities do not wish us to know. And
    the result of this Pandora-like curiosity is to land ourselves with a splash in Stygian waters, well out of our
    depth, and out of the depth, too, we think, of the authorities, governmental and scientific, who would be loath to
    consider such possibilities. Nor is it really their business to do so, for when governments start plumbing the river
    Styx, the results are not always beneficial to the governed.
  </p>
  <p>However, having wet ourselves in its alluring waters we have, undaunted, dropped our little plumbline, and in the
    course of our survey made some quite unexpected soundings, usually in places where the few existing charts say: ‘No
    bottom’; and at others, where the depth is confidently given, the line has practically run out of our hands into
    some unfathomable abyss. The following chapters will present the findings as they came.
  </p>
  <p>A word in passing, and a warning. This book is neither intended for, nor humbly dedicated to, the statistician, nor
    anyone else who mistakes figures for facts, nor does it aim to please the followers of what is called Popular
    Science. A proponent of the latter once took considerable pains explaining to G. K. Chesterton that the diamond was
    exactly the same as a lump of coal. At the end of it all Chesterton replied: ‘Any fool can see it isn’t !’
  </p>
  <p>It is to this sort of fool; to the lonely heretic who likes to walk alone down strange untrodden paths; to him who
    believes that all things are possible, particularly those things held by other men to be impossible; to him who
    leaves no stone unturned, and to him who gives a second chance to ‘the stone rejected by the builders’, that this
    book is dedicated.
  </p>
  <p>To these I offer some very curious stones for the turning; taking no responsibility whatsoever for anything they
    may find beneath.
