<p>Before the eyes of Milton's Satan peering into Chaos appeared a new expanse, another vast illimitable ocean without
  bounds--the distances of interstellar space; and for a moment Satan was appalled by Chaos and by space. So it is with
  modern man as he discovers new worlds like his own in the heavens about him . . . .</p>
<p>The world has not let the theme of cosmic voyage willingly die, whether in poetry and fantasy, in satire or
  seriousness, in the pulps or in the comics. There has been the growing realization of the possibility of other
  universes than ours, a <em>plurality</em> of worlds, even an <em>infinity</em> of worlds. We have become more fully
  aware of the insignificance of both our satellite, the Moon, and this rather small planet, the Earth. Man began to
  think that if Life possibly did not exist on other planets in this system perhaps it would be found in other
  universes.</p>
<p>The idea that earthbound man may someday journey into the heavens to discover other men and women, like or unlike
  himself, seems to be a conception the world persists in entertaining. From the time of Lucian it has existed in
  European literature. Why the appeal of this perennial theme? Is it curiosity? Is it humility? Is it perhaps a result
  of the essential loneliness of man? Is it because within man's soul lies the truth--that mortals exist on other
  spheres?</p>
<p>From a fanciful vision of other worlds where all is beautiful and good and just, we come back in somber mood to Earth
  which seems indeed a sad and silent planet. Man on Earth knows in his heart that other worlds are also inhabited, but
  he is reluctant to admit even to himself that Earth is only one small house of the many mansions in the Father's
  House; and worse, that she is a fallen house; a disobedient house; a wayward house.</p>
<p>In 1867, Matthew Arnold described the Earth well when he said: ". . . a darkling plain, swept with con-fused alarms
  of struggle and flight, where ignorant armies clash by night."</p>
<p>The people of Earth today are either confused, amused, or simply terrified by the reports of Unidentified Flying
  Objects and various types of extraterrestrial space craft seen in the skies and detected under the seas. If they
  accept the theory that life exists on other worlds besides our own, they cannot believe anything but stories of
  monsters, robots, sinister vegetables, or armies of evil, invading, mechanical Frankensteins.</p>
<p>Many people today are asking: "If spacemen are here, why don't they land and contact our leaders? Why don't they
  explain their mission?" Did these same individuals ever stop to think that no sane Earthman would descend into a pit
  of crawling rattlesnakes? With all Earth's strife, with bloody wars that carry thousands of men, women and children to
  slaughter worse than any Circus of Nero or Medieval Inquisition, is it any wonder that spacemen have not landed
  here?</p>
<p>However, these brothers from outer space <em>have</em> landed here, and they <em>have</em> contacted those whom they
  knew would receive them in the spirit of brotherly love and truth. It is now reliably reported that over one-hundred
  personal contacts have been made between Earthmen and Saucer occupants. They sought and seek those who have been
  looking for them. This is what they mean when they say: "We do not choose you; you choose us!"</p>
<p>Would these highly developed beings care to contact those who have held the people in slavery for centuries? No,
  because their coming to Earth will eliminate all forms of greed and selfishness. The actual "owners" of the Earth are
  on the side of the negative-dark forces, while the "Sons of Light" of the Space Confederation are of a <em>higher
    authority</em>. And being of a higher authority, they seek out those who love TRUTH and Truth alone. Like Diogenes,
  they search long and unceasingly, but unlike Diogenes, they find a man here and a man there; not many, but some.</p>
<p>The people of Earth like to picture themselves as Lords of Creation. One well-known anthropologist believes that
  far-off worlds may contain "gelatinous masses that control diabolic machines", but of men elsewhere, he positively
  states: "Never!" Those who do accept life as existing on other worlds believe this life will be much as it is on
  Earth: vain, full of pride, lust, greed; life that is warlike and aggressive as it is here.</p>
<p>While one hand turns thumbs-down on the idea of other planets being inhabited, the other hand writes on and on about
  the inhabitation of other worlds beyond Earth. People have been brought up on Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Superman, and
  many other fictional heroes of outer space. They have lived in a world of fantasy and make-believe for so long they
  don't recognize the truth when it is presented to them. Yet, our world of fantasy has its purpose.</p>
<p>Many gaze at the starry heavens and ask: "Is it all part of some gigantic scheme; is there really a Creator? Or have
  we evolved from a single cell that originally developed because of a freak accident in nature? Are we alone in the
  Universe?" Reason tells them that out of billions and quadrillions of worlds life must exist on many of them. And
  those who have complete faith in their Creator realize He wouldn't <a
      href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/ufo/otof/errata.htm#0">create</a> Man and place him on one planet alone. They
  know He wouldn't create other worlds to be merely floating balls of poisonous gas or vapor. First came inhabitable
  worlds, then came Man!</p>
<p>Men on Earth are afraid that if suddenly other men on other worlds are made known to them, they will face awful
  retribution; that their horrible crimes against humanity and the Creator's Laws will not go unpunished. And like
  naughty children, they are reluctant to give up their dangerous toys and their destructive ways. So, now that their
  brothers from outer space are here, they are going to hide in a "closet" until these older brothers go home. Then they
  can come out and start their foul play all over again. One word of acceptance on the part of Earth-men and these
  brothers are liable to step in and teach them something, and children never like to go to school--especially if they
  have to be obedient and good.</p>
<p>Yes, there are brothers of ours in the skies over-head. They are not to be worshipped as gods; but they are to be
  listened to as one listens to an older brother who has traveled much and who knows the pitfalls of life and who has
  knowledge tempered with love of fellowman and the Creator. This brother of ours is attainable for he is here on Earth
  today! Will the men of Earth accept him? Whether they do or not, it is their right to decide.</p>
<p>Since man on Earth has arrived at a place where only Truth will be able to survive, it is necessary to reaffirm and
  establish three truths. Namely:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Science and religion are one and the same thing. "God Provided--Man Divided". There is no religion higher than
    Truth and truth cannot contradict truth.</li>
  <li>The entire Omniverse is magnetic in nature and even <em>culture</em> is influenced by the laws of magnetism.</li>
  <li>Space visitors, coming to Earth in space craft, are mentioned in the Holy Bible, ancient mythology, and in other
    documents thousands of years old. These visitors have been coming to Earth for several million years! They are now
    making themselves known to the world as a whole to lead mankind thereby into a New Age as the Earth enters the more
    intense vibrations of Aquarius.</li>
</ol>
<p>During the nineteenth century on Earth there was a <em>Great Influx</em> of Universal Truth. Many fine writings
  appeared, especially in the late 1800's. These scattered reports and ideas have a definite relationship to each other
  and tie into the pattern of present day happenings. Although these various writers use different terminology, they are
  essentially saying the same thing. They are telling Man that he is truly a god in his own right! This knowledge came
  to a selected few so that they could open the way for the world to awaken to a New Age--an Air Age to replace the
  ancient Fish or Water Age. What is the grand goal of it all? There is no goal, for we are heading for All Perfection
  but we will never get there. It is ever moving ahead of us as we progress. What then is the purpose of all our
  pleasure-pain experiences? We are to know perpetual <em>expanding grandeur</em>; thereby Spirit will come to know
  itself!</p>
<p>In this book, many references and quotations are given from the latest, authentic reports on the Saucer phenomena.
  Because many believe that there are contradictions in some of the reported happenings it has been necessary to show
  that there is a <em>great story</em> and a <em>purpose</em> behind all of these experiences. These same things have
  been taking place for eons! Some may wonder why I refer to the Holy Bible so often in this book. It is true that the
  Bible is inaccurate; but not totally so. For the most part it is the true history of a particular time and people. In
  order to get an accurate picture of the Saucer phenomena <em>every</em> possible avenue of investigation into the past
  and present must be utilized.</p>
<p>The author wishes to acknowledge the kind help and encouragement of others, for without them, this book would never
  been written.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Thomas M. Cornelia for suggestions pertaining to <em>Magnetism: The Universal 'I Am'</em>; to Neva
  Dell Hunter for ideas about <em>The Remnant</em>; to George H. Lark for library research on certain sections of the
  Divine Tetrad; to Lillian Laughead for her contribution of the Lemurian interpretation of the tracks on the desert; to
  Dr. Robert T. Lustig for ideas on the electro-chemistry of the blood; to Winchester Mac Dowell for the two
  illustrations of the electronic motion in the atom; to my wife, Betty J. Williamson, for research on the
  microcosm-macrocosm, and <em>Magnetism: The Universal 'I Am'</em>; to Frank A. Wing for his ideas about <em>The
    Prophets</em>; and sincere thanks to many others.</p>
<p>This book you are about to read is not an ultimate . . . no book is. It merely points the path, a signpost along the
  <em>Great Way</em> that leads to our Infinite Father. This work is dedicated to all men everywhere, with the hope that
  they shall know the TRUTH and the Truth shall make them free. Through <em>Other Tongues--Other Flesh</em>, may we
  learn to pray: "Father of us all, give us eyes to see, ears to hear, and hearts to understand!"</p>
<p>In brotherly love, I humbly submit this work to you.</p>
