<p>In the Universe of infinite entities and infinite variety, Man is found manifesting in many degrees from Microcosm to
  Macrocosm. In the theory of Paracelsus, the Microcosm was man, as if combining in himself all the elements of the
  Macrocosm or great world. This theory in turn reminds us of Swedenborg who spoke and wrote so often about the Creator
  as <em>The Grand Man</em> of the Omniverse containing all the elements of the Microcosmic world. From the smallest
  unit of Creation to the most gigantic, there is a spiraling, circular progression. Early explorers went West to get
  East; and so in the Microcosmic world lies the answer to what the Macrocosmos is like.</p>
<p>Darwin said: "An organic being is a Microcosm, a little Universe, formed of a host of self-propagating organisms,
  inconceivably minute and numerous as the stars in heaven."</p>
<p>A. Bronson Alcott, in 1877 said: "Matter in particle and planet, mind and macrocosm, is quick with spirit."</p>
<p>So, we find matter manifesting and vibrating from minute to the monumental in various degrees, but SPIRIT permeates
  through all! In the great world of the Macrocosmos is it not logical and entirely possible that there may exist worlds
  so large in comparison with ours that their individual total masses may be millions upon millions of times that of
  Earth? And, if we grant that, is it not reasonable to say that in the small world of the Microcosmos we will find the
  direct opposite? In other words, atomic worlds containing real intelligent beings who live, work and love even as
  we?</p>
<p>For some time now scientists have been well aware of the fact that there is a Universal pattern of form in the minute
  that is duplicated exactly in the colossal of Creation!</p>
<p>Space visitors have said: "It is not right that man should destroy his brother by utilizing the powerful forces of
  atomic energy, but the destruction you witness is minor, indeed, compared to the enormity of <a
      href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/ufo/otof/errata.htm#6">chaos</a> created in the Microcosmos by the release of
  such energy!" When an atomic bomb is detonated, literal Microcosmic worlds containing created life are destroyed. Of
  course, these worlds are in other dimensions of time and space: what we think of as a minute may be the passing of a
  million years to the Microcosmic citizen.</p>
<p>Infinity covers a lot of "territory", and we can easily have worlds and life so minute that we aver-age five-foot
  eighters cannot possibly see them with our organs of sight. If we accept this fact, we must also agree that there must
  be bigger worlds and bigger life forms. In fact, these forms could be so large that we couldn't possibly see them . .
  . and that brings us back to the Microcosmos.</p>
<p>In considering the present space visitations to Earth, we encounter Saucer occupants similar to ourselves in size and
  form. We do not find spacemen coming into Earth's atmosphere landing their craft on a pin head or Saucer pilots so
  large that they displace all the water in the Atlantic Ocean if they decide to take a dip. The reason certain space
  people are here and not other inhabitants of the Cosmos is because our Infinite Father has sent those brothers to us
  who are most nearly like ourselves in appearance and bodily size. After all, contact is difficult enough in a
  corporeal world without adding to the problem by sending a highly developed being who would have to announce the
  Universal doctrine to us from that pin-head or lovingly lead us like a Swift in <a
      href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/ufo/otof/errata.htm#7">Lilliput</a>! The space friends here now may be far
  ahead of us in spiritual development, but they are probably more nearly like us than other dwellers in the Cosmos.</p>
<p>Before the consideration of similarities existing between matter and energy from the sub-atomic (microcosmic) through
  the astronomical (macro-cosmic) levels is discussed, it is important to conceive of what matter and energy are. Very
  recently, it was taught in our universities that most of the atom as well as most of the starry Universe was
  <em>empty</em> space. Now, finally, physicists are uncovering the facts that show matter and energy to be the same
  thing, though they cannot really understand how such a situation can exist. Their facts confuse their theories and
  they find themselves forced into retaining theories they now know to be inconsistent with the facts, for lack of any
  better theories.</p>
<p><em>Empty space</em> is a dead concept, for where is there no starlight? Yes, even starlight is matter and exerts
  pressure. Science has discovered that the famous little particle called an <em>electron</em> sometimes exhibits itself
  more as a particle and sometimes more as a wave. This is true also of the other so-called particles of the atom and of
  the Universe.</p>
<p>A particle can be an electron, other atomic particles, an atom, a moon, a planet, a sun, a solar system, a galaxy, a
  super-galaxy, and so on, ad infinitum. All creations (particles) in the Universe are similar because:</p>
<ol>
  <li>All of them discharge energy. This might be considered as reference to fields of force; emission of rays; waves;
    frequencies; vibrations and forces. Briefly then, how can one picture something having both <em>particle</em> and
    <em>wave</em> properties at the same time? It is done by thinking of them as shells within shells. Some of these
    shells are visible to the eye as the Earth's crust, the layers of an onion, the skin of the body, or the "wheels
    within wheels" of Saucers. Some are visible with instruments which have determined the wave nature of electrons and
    other particles which emit quanta of energy. Some are detected by special photography as the four known fields of
    vibration around the human body and the atomic and molecular structures of various crystalline bodies as obtained by
    the British physicist, W. L. Bragg. The kind of motion that these shells exhibit, determines what the effect of that
    energy is to be. Heat, for example, is a wave pattern made up of a series of particles given off in quanta by an
    electron. It might be called pure energy moving with a <em>peculiar</em> kind of motion. The nature of the motion
    determines the effect produced, which can be any of the following: Nonvisible light; visible light measured as heat,
    or cold light. Remember that visibility and invisibility and the sensations of heat and cold are only sensations of
    the physical structure. Thus the real meaning of the term light is far beyond what is visible to the eyes. The term
    light is used to designate the wave nature of all matter, its energy and its motion.</li>
  <li>In order for bodies continually to discharge energy they must continually absorb a new supply of energy. Thus the
    Universe consists of constant interchange of energy resulting in:</li>
  <li>A perpetual rhythmic expansion and contraction. For example, it is only possible for comets to travel at their
    terrific speeds for long periods of time because they are constantly replenishing their energy through their tail,
    and this energy is from a sun.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let us consider the tremendous likenesses exhibited by primary bodies beginning with the smallest we can detect,
  the sub-atomic:</p>
<p>Sub-atomic particles (and when we say particle, we must think of particle-wave for the two concepts are inseparable
  in speaking of basic structure) are to be considered in this discussion as particles that science can know only
  indirectly by their behavior Thus, heat energy given off by an electron might be comparable to satellites of the
  electron. Thus the electron gives off electro-magnetic radiation, which produces effects on varying portions of the
  spectrum depending on the kind of motion.</p>
<p>Perhaps these particles are those quanta of electromagnetic radiation which have been called photons and/or gamma
  rays. These rays, like X-rays, are without an electrical charge and are therefore not deflected in electric or
  magnetic fields. Gamma rays are electro-magnetic radiation of <em>very short</em> wave length, and high energy.
  Photons or energy vary in their velocity and thus energy according to the kind of radiation to which the matter
  emitting the photons is subjected.</p>
<p>If the radiation is in the high frequency end of the spectrum, then the photons will have a higher energy. In other
  words, the energy of the photons emitted by an electron subjected to electromagnetic radiation is related to the
  energy of the radiation, but the energy <em>is</em> emitted in distinct quanta. Photons are too small to detect
  experimentally in the high frequency portion of the spectrum. They are only detected in that part of the spectrum
  below visible light.</p>
<p>Photons or gamma rays by interaction with atomic nuclei have been converted into pairs of electrons and positrons
  (positively charged electrons). This materialization is a good example of the equivalence of matter (mass) and
  energy.</p>
<p>Scientists have divided the sub-atomic particles into two classes. The first class consists of particles which <em>cannot</em>
  occupy the same shell or energy level. These include the proton, electron, positron, neutron, neutrino and mu mesons.
  The second class consists of particles which <em>can</em> occupy the same energy level. Photons, gravitons, and pi
  mesons be-long to this class. The graviton is the unit of gravitational energy. According to the Unified Field Theory,
  gravity is just another aspect of electromagnetism like light, radio waves and other forms of electro-magnetic
  radiation.</p>
<p>Professor Vaclav Hlavaty of Indiana University Graduate Institute of Applied Mathematics recently achieved solutions
  to mathematical equations in Einstein's latest Unified Field Theory that revolutionize our concepts of energy, motion
  and matter.</p>
<p>Dr. Hlavaty's solutions to the Einstein equations reveal that electro-magnetism is the basis of the Universe . . .
  which goes beyond Einstein's attempt to unify gravitation and electro-magnetism . . . the twin forces in which he
  believes the Universe manifests itself. If Dr. Hlavaty's solution is correct, the basis of all cosmic
  forces--gravitation as well as matter and energy--is built up of an all-pervading, all-embracing mathematical
  field.</p>
<p>These theories will lead to the discovery of cosmic forces not even suspected today. <a
    href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/ufo/otof/errata.htm#8">Gravitation</a> is not the basis of everything, but
  electro-magnetism is. Everything, including man, owes its existence to its electro-magnetic force field.</p>
<p>So-called gravity is created by the vortex of the particle itself and is related to the density and also the size of
  the vortex or electro-magnetic field. Thus the gravity exhibited by a sub-atomic particle may be greater than
  suspected at the present time. It is present as pressure toward the center of the field. Therefore, one might think of
  gravity as acting <em>inward</em> at right angles to the energy levels or shells. And to make a broader statement, we
  might say that all of the particles of the second class are acting at right angles to the spherical energy levels or
  shells, but the photons act <em>outward</em> and are given off as various forms of electro-magnetic energy. Both
  photons and gravitons modify the motion of their respective nuclear body in its role as a satellite to some larger
  body.</p>
<p>As electrons revolve about atomic nuclei in energy levels, so photons revolve around electronic nuclei, and when they
  are subjected to energy they are emitted as electro-magnetic energy in waves, the effect of which depends of their
  motion. For the possible effects glance at a chart of the electro-magnetic spectrum. The effects may be anywhere from
  heat on the far left, through radio waves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, and X-rays, to the high energy gamma
  rays just before the section of the spectrum designated secondary cosmic rays.</p>
<p>Gravitons are "particles" acting inward pulling from the center due to the pressure therein resulting from the
  expansion and contraction of the magnetic field which is a field of electrically charged motion. Due to the particular
  kind of motion of the electron in the magnetic field, no sensation of electricity is felt. The latter results when the
  negatively charged electrons move through the positively charged solution called <em>atmosphere</em> with a frictional
  motion. <em>Atmosphere</em> as used here, refers to the electro-magnetic field, not just "air".</p>
<p>". . . The particles that go to make up the ethers can be thought of . . . as sub-sub-atomic matter . . . and as you
  'sub' lower than that we go out of existence as far as the world of matter measurable is concerned . . ." (B.S.R.A.
  Special Report, 10-C-53).</p>
<p>Now let us consider atomic structure!</p>
<p>Although we could probably be more nearly correct if we regarded all the so-called particles as motion rather than
  substance, we retain the physicists terminology in order that those who are acquainted somewhat with atomic physics
  can judge for themselves what is stated.</p>
<p>The old classical idea of an atom consisting simply of a positive nucleus with negative point-like electrons
  revolving rapidly around it is now found to be quite inadequate. Also, we are not so certain that there is a
  tremendous amount of <em>empty space</em> between these entities. For sub-sub-atomic matter would indicate satellites
  of satellites to a micro-infinity separated by the Infinite Light of the Creator, known to the Qabbalists as <em>Ain
    Soph Aur</em>, the Limitless Light.</p>
<p>The newer theory of wave mechanics envisions the electron as a standing wave undulating to and fro. When the electron
  emits energy its energy level or shell is contracted accordingly. When it absorbs energy the shell is expanded. The
  apparent mass depends on its speed. Since the electron rotates, we must now conceive of this undulating more or less
  spherical shell rotating or spinning. This rotation is brought about by the effect of flux set up by the charged
  solution in which the electron is found. The rotation brings about polarity, magnetism, gravity, electricity, etc.</p>
<p>Now, before we leave this discussion of what an electron is, let's include in our concept what would give rise to
  this more or less circular standing wave undulating to and fro. This can also be thought of as a manifestation of the
  vortex or electro-magnetic field. This effect can be pictured by imagining the wave effect of two series of vertical
  rows of fish passing uniformly between each other at a ninety-degree angle and then backing up. Would not this motion
  in rhythm give the effect of a spherical undulating wave? In the case of the atom these waves are produced by parallel
  lines of force passing between each other at right angles with a rhythmic "breathing" resulting from the
  positive-negative strain. The positive lines of force are composed of positively charged particles, and the negative
  lines of force of negative particles intersect them at right angles forming a flux effect. This intersection, when the
  lines are of equal density and vibration, forms an atom consisting of protons and electrons and an electro-magnetic
  field. It is because these two kinds of lines of force have different speeds that scientists have recently discovered
  that the speed of light is not constant at 186,000 miles per second.</p>
<p>Several months ago, a naval research engineer said he and four associates photographed a spot of light moving across
  a cathode ray tube at 202,000 miles per second, faster than the recognized speed of light.</p>
<p>Perpendicular to these intersecting lines of force are other parallel lines of force which extend infinitely
  throughout all space. These have an extremely high rate of vibration but no motion as to direction. This is what is
  meant by space intelligences when they say: "Light does not travel . . . light IS!" These lines of force establish
  polarity and the resulting effects. They are the creative causation force of the Creative Intelligence, and the
  insulating force between successive electron shells. They make possible creation of new particles and add to the
  rotation of particles already existing by spiral induction and partial penetration.</p>
<p>It is this force which condenses and escapes invisibly as a "neutrino" when an atom is "split". It is the part of the
  atom which undergoes a "resurrection." Physicists discovered the neutrino (which they believe to have a mass of less
  than one two-thousandth of the mass of an electron) from the fact that in the nuclear process of a neutron being
  converted into a proton and an electron there was some missing spin energy. The neutrino was postulated as the carrier
  of this energy.</p>
<p>It carries no electric charge, but an idea of its character might be more easily grasped by realizing that a beam of
  neutrinos would travel through lead of almost infinite thickness with no decrease in intensity. Indeed, the neutrino,
  which physicists can't see as they have seen tracks of other nuclear particles on photographic film, appears to be the
  creative light force of the Infinite Father. The Limitless Light . . . the <em>Light</em> that IS! It is the balancing
  force of the Omniverse.</p>
<p>In regard to the nucleus of the atom, physicists are considering various theories, trying to understand what holds
  its protons and neutrons together in the nucleus since electrically like forces repel. A qualitative answer is given
  by certain of the mesons, but quantitative measurements await further development, because the forces acting between a
  meson and proton or neutron are said to be approximately one thousand times stronger than the forces acting between an
  electron and electric field.</p>
<p>However, in keeping with the differences in the speed of phenomena within the atom, could we not say that the
  vortical currents were sufficiently strong to keep the nuclear matter concentrated in a comparatively small area
  regardless of its apparent mass relationships? In other words, if gravity is recognized as a force acting inward as a
  result of vortical currents of the atom, the weights and measures developed in the vortical currents of the Earth have
  no intrinsic value of themselves when referring to the atom. Information received by the B.S.R.A. states if one atom
  were ever truly smashed, your whole system would be turned into a super solar . . . nothing but light radiation . . .
  many millions of times brighter than your sun." No wonder space visitors are concerned over our atomic
  experiments!</p>
<p>Before we leave the subject of atomic structure, let's glance at the idea of the <em>inverted</em> atom. Physicists
  have found short-lived particles in all cases that are the electrical opposites of the prevalent particles in our
  atomic structure. Some of these, including the newly found anti-proton have been found in cosmic rays. These are
  evidently the particles that form atoms built with negative nuclei and positive satellites. Substances constructed of
  such atoms would be identical except that they would be <em>invisible</em> to our physical senses, which were
  constructed to recognize substance formed of atoms having positive nuclei and negative satellites. Physical vision is
  sensitive only to positive light reflecting from negative substance on a negative planet. Inner perceptions see colors
  resulting from negative light. Neither reflections from negative substance or reflections from positive substance <em>are
    reality</em>, and neither are they visions . . . they are only <em>reflections from reality</em>.</p>
<p>Now let us consider molecular structure:</p>
<p>The structure of a molecule is dependent on the structure of the atoms of which it is composed. Science has recently
  found that in order for two atoms of hydrogen to associate themselves as a molecule, their respective single electrons
  must have opposite directions of rotation or spin. Thus we see the positive-negative association into oneness
  reflected even in the molecule.</p>
<p>Like planets, some molecules possess rotational energy and others, such as the diatomic symmetrical molecules of
  hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, do not.</p>
<p>When atoms or molecules are arranged in perfect order, the result is known as a crystal. Irregularity of atomic or
  molecular order results in a fluid. A true solid state is always in a definite crystalline form. Crystals of pure
  metals have recently been studied and it has been found that different crystal faces of a metal behave as if they were
  entirely different metals. Evidently, the crystalline geometrical forms determined by the electro-magnetic field of
  the atoms produce a differing field on each face.</p>
<p>Crystals which do not have identical characteristics in all directions (not cubic) are called anisotropic crystals.
  When a ray of light enters an anisotropic crystal it is split into two components which travel with different
  velocities and follow different paths. Perhaps the crystal is here dividing the positive and negative light lines of
  force.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact of molecular structure that has recently been revealed is that the thousands of atoms in
  fibrous protein molecules such as those composing hair, horn, fingernail, muscle and porcupine quill, are arranged in
  the form of a helix. This form results when asymmetric objects (the amino acids) are joined together in such a way
  that each one has the same geometrical relationship to its neighbors. Some of these molecules then form a compound
  helix or a coil of coils, etc. Thus science is discovering the linking forms between the atom and the biological
  structures.</p>
<p>An electron micrograph of a bacterial flagellum has shown a three-strand cable which by its diameter suggests it is a
  seven-strand cable of seven-strand cables.</p>
<p>The space people have said that the forms of crystals within the blood are the source of energy for man's every
  motion. The crystals in the blood, by diffusing, refracting and reflecting the positive and negative light lines of
  force, and by opposing polarized conditions, bring about the flow of the blood by light energy and as a result, the
  functioning of the heart.</p>
<p>The fact that there are crystals within the blood stream is significant in relation to the use of the crystalline
  form in the Type 2 "fireball". For more information on them see <em>The Harvesters</em> in this book in the section
  called: <em>Other Flesh</em>.</p>
<p>Man, intermediate between the Microcosm and the Macrocosm, shows similarity to the atomic structure in the expansion
  and contraction of his muscles, in his rhythmic breathing to sustain life, and his shell-like fields of vibration
  surrounding the visible body.</p>
<p>Dr. Cecil Bowiby of Los Angeles, California, recently reported that he has succeeded in photographing four distinct
  fields of vibration around the human body which are in various colors invisible to the naked eye. They are,
  respectively, about one-half inch; six inches; three feet; and nine feet and over from the skin. He believes the
  fourth field is the strongest, that is, most extensive when persons radiate strong feelings, especially those of love
  and peace.</p>
<p>Now let us consider our own Solar System:</p>
<p>In <em>One Two Three . . . Infinity</em>, Dr. George Gamow says: "The picture of an atom began to look more like a
  miniature solar system with an atomic nucleus for the sun, and electrons for planets. The analogy with the planetary
  system can be further strengthened by these facts: the atomic nucleus contains 99.97 per cent of the total atomic mass
  as compared with 99.87 per cent of the solar system concentrated in the sun, and the distances between the planetary
  electrons exceed their diameters by about the same factor (several thousand times) which we find when comparing
  interplanetary distances with the diameters of the planets. The more important analogy lies, however, in the fact that
  the electric attraction-forces between the atomic nucleus and the electrons obey the same mathematical law of inverse
  square (that is, the forces are inversely proportionate to the square of the distance between two bodies) as the
  gravity forces acting between the sun and the planets. This makes the electrons describe the circular and elliptic
  trajectories around the nucleus, similar to those along which the planets and comets move in the solar system."</p>
<p>However, physicists have stressed the fact that "an atom differs from the solar system by the fact that it is not
  gravitation that makes electrons go round the nucleus, but electricity." (H. N. Russell). But what difference does it
  make, since gravity and electricity are both manifestations of electromagnetism! This is an example of scientists
  calling <em>effect</em>, cause . . . if they looked beyond gravitational and electrical phenomena they would find the
  <em>cause</em> of both, which is electro-magnetism.</p>
<p>Another difference was also discovered. An electron in an atom, on absorbing the energy of a photon (light), jumps to
  another orbit, and again to another when it emits light and releases the energy of a photon. Because of this
  phenomenon, comparison with the solar system did not seem valid. A critic said: "We do not read in the morning
  newspapers that Mars leaped to the orbit of Saturn, or Saturn to the orbit of Mars." This is true, we do not read it
  in the newspapers, but the atom with its system of electrons rotating around the central nucleus resembles the
  planetary system. In considering the atom, the jumping of electrons from one orbit to another, when hit by the energy
  of a photon, takes place many times a second, whereas in accord with the vastness of the solar system, a <a
      href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/ufo/otof/errata.htm#9">similar</a> phenomenon occurs there once in thousands of
  years. Our own Solar System has experienced displacements in its planetary members over the centuries and this is
  similar to the "orbit jumping" of an electron.</p>
<p>The circular motion of an electron around the nucleus of an atom, or a planet around the sun of a solar system, gives
  rise to an intensive electro-magnetic radiation, and in this action they are <em>identical</em>. The circular motion
  referred to is an <em>effect</em> of intersecting lines of force.</p>
<p>Now let us consider the Galactic System:</p>
<p>Toward the center of the Galactic System is found the nuclear region which corresponds to the sun of a solar system
  and the nucleus of an atom. The many solar systems revolving about the nucleus region of a galaxy correspond to
  planets revolving about a sun and electrons revolving about an atomic nucleus.</p>
<p>At present astronomers are wondering whether magnetic fields exist in the galaxy. Cosmic radiation suggests an
  answer. The intensity of cosmic radiation is almost the same anywhere on the globe. This indicates that magnetic
  fields are bringing about a random distribution of cosmic rays in space. Cosmic ray evidence is considered the
  strongest argument for the existence of these fields. If an atom and a solar system operate in an electromagnetic
  field, we would expect to find a galaxy also operating in such a field. The rotation at the edges of a spiral galaxy
  is slower than near the center, just as the outer planets in the solar system travel slower than those near the
  sun.</p>
<p>The new word in astronomy is "magneto-hydrodynamics." Scientists say that interstellar space is now known to be <a
    href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/ufo/otof/errata.htm#10">pervaded</a> by magnetic fields. Presumably they are
  produced by electric currents circulating in space, say the astronomers. Modern theory begins to visualize a galaxy as
  a tremendous electro-magnet, with currents of electrons flowing not through wires but through the viscous, turbulent
  eddies of gas swirling about its center. Electromagnetic forces seem competent to do what turbulence alone cannot do:
  they might form discrete arms and even lead to the formation of stars and clusters of stars. The modern theory of a
  galaxy, according to astronomers, promises to be as intricate as the now richly observed structural details. Ten years
  ago in their hypotheses of cosmic evolution they were thinking in terms of gravitation and light pressure. Only
  yesterday they realized they may contemplate a galaxy that is essentially a gravitating, turbulent electro-magnet.</p>
<p>Now let us consider the Supergalaxy:</p>
<p>Recent evidence obtained by photographic and radio astronomy indicates that our disk-shaped galaxy we call the Milky
  Way is itself a member of a disk-shaped galaxy or supergalaxy. The supergalaxy of which we are a member may have a
  population of tens of thousands of galaxies. Its nucleus is marked by the cluster of galaxies in the constellation
  Virgo. Radio waves are picked up from the super-galaxy just as they are picked up from near galaxies and the Milky
  Way. From study of the radial velocities of galaxies, the indication is that the "inner metagalaxy" (that is the
  nearest regions of extra-galactic space) is rotating. This rotation is believed to be a property of the local
  supergalaxy. Several other supergalaxies have been found indicating the possibility or rather probability of a
  hierarchy of systems of ever greater size <em>ad infinitum</em>. Also, scientists have come to the conclusion that the
  Universe has been expanding since about five billion years ago before which it was contracting. Even the Universe is
  "breathing" as do the lines of force that bring about the atom.</p>
<p>Space intelligences have said: "Progression is only recorded by change and one who understands even his present
  environment is indeed a master."</p>
<p>In 1888, S. Harris said: "Suns and planets and cosmic forces are the words in which His thoughts are written."</p>
