<p>Will everyone be contacted by space visitors? This question is often asked, as well as: "Why are some people
  contacted by the Saucer occupants and others not?"</p>
<p>These are good questions and deserve serious attention. Certain individuals are acting as Agents for space visitors,
  and may well have volunteered for this duty before taking up their present incarnation!</p>
<p>However, these <em>Agents</em> are not <em>Wanderers</em>. The latter belong to other worlds, whereas the Agents
  belong to Earth. The Wanderers bring the message of their people--the space people; the Agents carry the message of
  their people--the Earth people.</p>
<p>People of other worlds live among us and work among us unknown, but certain inhabitants of Earth are being contacted
  by Saucers--therefore, what is their mission? I remember what a radio operator who made contact via radiotelegraphy
  said: "Why should spacemen be interested in me; I'm a nobody, why don't they contact our great scientists and
  government heads?" I answered him by saying: "How do you know the so-called great haven't been contacted?"</p>
<p>This radio operator forgets that the space intelligences know more about him than he knows about himself. They have
  access to his complete record. And that means they know his attainments, his failures, his desires, his love and hate,
  his tenderness and cruelty. They know what they can and cannot expect of him. The individuals we call "great" in our
  present civilization may not be "great" at all in the light of their eternal record.</p>
<p>Space friends have said that high military rank; material wealth; talent; good-looks; social prestige, etc. are not
  prerequisites to being contacted by them. Some individuals who are considered by society to be "sinners" are not seen
  in that light at all by space visitors. "Sins" are offenses of social dictation and what may be a "sin" today may not
  be considered a "sin" tomorrow. If space visitors were here to contact only those who were "pure of heart" or those
  who diligently went to vespers or followed one-hundred percent the dictates of the church, they wouldn't find many
  people ready!</p>
<p>They say that the important thing is that we desire Light itself; and as we stand in that Light, drawing it to us, we
  attract these space friends. They will contact those who choose them only; and <em>The Agents</em> will be used to
  bridge the gap between the two divisions of outer space and the Earth. If one is more desirous of helping suffering
  humanity than of worldly fame or gain, then one is a good candidate for space intelligence contact.</p>
<p>It matters not if a man gets up from the lowest depths of human degradation and decides to follow the Great Path to
  Truth. He may not be as advanced as other souls, but <em>that first step</em> is the important step! He has decided to
  put on the Mantle of Seeking, and although he will suffer and die many times for the lesson, he does not hesitate in
  his decision--he has made that <em>first</em> step!</p>
<p>The space people who represent a higher authority have very well made plans and eventually every man, woman and child
  will have an opportunity to meet the visitors.</p>
<p>If we went to another planet we would first monitor the radio <a
    href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/ufo/otof/errata.htm#46">broadcasts</a> if the people had advanced that far, and
  we would learn the language and code systems. Later, if we deemed it wise, we would contact individuals of that planet
  who were concerned with communications. A close friend of mine who is in the field of radio broadcasting, and at the
  present time employed by a well-known western radio station, wrote to me recently. Here is a significant part of his
  letter:</p>
<p>"I am doing a shift Saturday afternoons and nights, and Sunday mornings. I naturally open up and I am alone in the
  studio until about eleven in the morning. Well, last Sunday, I signed on at eight o'clock. After identification, with
  good mornings, etc., I logged a program called "Music For Sunday" from 8:05 a.m. After my opening theme on a 78 RPM
  disk, a short introduction, I faded out the theme and on another turn-table faded in a 12" 33&#8531; RPM of
  Mantovani's Victor Herbert Concert. I still had my head-phones on because I was busy logging meter readings, etc.</p>
<p>"At about 8:15 a.m., over the music, faintly, I heard the following: 'All is well, all is well, all is well . . .
  soon, soon, soon, brother, brother . . . all is well, all is well.' Needless to say, I was at first startled. I left
  the control room and started searching the entire studio to see if there was an open mike or if there was somebody
  around, checked to see if one of the several radios around the station was feeding back some other program, even went
  to the door to see if my car radio was playing. Everything checked out, and I returned to the control room and
  listened to the head-phones and again, faintly, I heard: "All is well . . . brother, brother, soon.'</p>
<p>"I thought maybe I was crazy, so I called several friends on the phone that I knew were listening to their radios and
  asked them if they had heard anything unusual along with the music. They all said, 'No!' Then I quickly grabbed the
  tape recorder and set it up in another studio, checked to make sure I had it hooked up O.K., and recorded the
  following: 'I am ------ ----------, today is Sunday, January 24, 1954, I am at the studio on duty, Radio Station
  ----------. During the program (see our log) I heard a voice over my head-phone-set at approximately 8:15 a.m. and
  again at 8:21 a.m. It did not go over the air to other listeners. I checked all possible sources for feed backs and
  there were none; no other person within one-half mile of me. I will attempt to record the voice I just heard after
  station break and the start of the next, a recorded,</p>
<p>"I then went back to the control room and made the station break, introduced and announced a fifteen-minute newscast,
  and at 8:45 a.m. started another fifteen-minute transcription which was a musical program. With an extension running
  from the control board, I took the head-phones to the other studio where I had the recorder set up. Then I listened to
  the program with the head-phones. At 8:50 a.m. I could hear the voice very faintly again and I brought the head-phones
  directly to the mike on the recorder and kept it there until 8:57 a.m.</p>
<p>"The rest of the morning I heard no more voices over the head-set. At my first opportunity, I played back the tape
  that I had made--and I got the whole thing! But, a half hour later when I went to play it again--only my voice was
  heard! The other voice simply didn't come through; and get this: <em>Neither did the music!</em></p>
<p>"Now . . . before I left the studio at 1:30 p.m., I made a tape of commentary on world events to be played over the
  air at 3:00 p.m. the same day. It's a fifteen-minute commentary, mostly features that come over the AP teletype, which
  I edit and announce. On this tape, I talked for about five minutes on world affairs and then I related my experiences
  of that morning with the voices; this took up the next three minutes. Then I finished if off with Washington news.</p>
<p>"After making this tape, I took it to our auditioning studio and played it back for a check--and it was all there.
  However, and get this, when the tape came on the air at 3:00 p.m., my glorious voice came out with the world affairs,
  then there was about <em>three minutes of absolute silence</em>, followed by my Washington news! The rest of the gang
  saved that tape for me and I played it again the next morning. It was <em>complete</em> excepting my full account of
  Sunday morning's experience with the voices. Three minutes and twenty seconds of total silence in the middle of that
  tape!</p>
<p>"At first, I thought it might be some electronic error, that I was maybe picking up some 'ham' or something else; but
  after that series of strange happenings, I am of the firm belief that it was no 'ham' nor was it coincidence! What do
  you think?"</p>
<p>This young man is very interested in the Saucer phenomena. He and his good wife, only a few months ago, were "social
  climbers"; they thought the main goal in life was to own a "Cad", a diamond as big as an ice-cube, and eat caviar and
  hob-nob with the "best people". Lately, they have changed their minds. They realize that to help their fellowman means
  more than those material items. They have earnestly desired to have contact in some way with space intelligences. The
  answer to my friend's question, "What do you think?" is obvious.</p>
<p><em>The Agents</em> are found in all walks of life and in all age groups. Sometimes they can be detected by the
  strange, far-away, glassy look in their eyes. Sometimes a muscle in their neck "throbs" or "jumps" spasmodically. This
  indicates that the individual is "under control" by space intelligences and at that time will be issued telepathic
  instructions. Some may say that this "control" takes away the free will of a man. However, this is not the case, since
  <em>The Agents</em> had free will before they volunteered for this duty. Once having volunteered, they set the course
  of their future; they were willing to be used as an instrument, and used they are. It is their duty to introduce
  certain people to each other, to be at certain lectures or meetings, to ask leading questions, to gather small groups
  around them, to give needed addresses, books, reports, etc. to those requiring them, etc.</p>
<p><em>The Agents</em> are contacted through car radios, FM-radio, "ham" sets, AM-radio, portable radios, and, of
  course, by telepathy. And some are contacted by visual observation of spacecraft. Space friends have said: "Show us
  when you are ready to venture." An Agent merely has to show his desire to venture daringly into the New Order of
  things and his duties will begin at once!</p>
<p>Sanctilean University is speaking of <em>Agents</em> in <em>The Impending Golden Age</em>, when it says: "Many
  persons who regret the evil conditions now prevailing throughout the world, and their inability to do anything about
  them, have been placed in physical embodiment at this time as selected Students of Life."</p>
<p><em>The Agents</em> serve the needy when they cry out; the poor also; and those who have no helper. They serve, for
  they are the helpers of the fatherless. Their prayer is: "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that
  we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need." (Hebrews 4:16).</p>
<p>The prayer of the people of Earth should be that of David the <a
    href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/ufo/otof/errata.htm#47">Psalmist</a>: "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills,
  from whence cometh my help." The help is from the sky and from the Earth.</p>
