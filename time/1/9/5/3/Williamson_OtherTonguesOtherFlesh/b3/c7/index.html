<p>To give a numerical estimate I would say that rather more than a million stars in the Milky Way possess planets on
  which you might live without undue discomfort. If you were suddenly transported to one of them you would no doubt find
  many important changes, but the changes would not be as remarkable as the similarities. I think that all our present
  guesses are likely to prove but a very pale shadow of the real thing." From <em>The Nature of the Universe</em>, by
  Fred Hoyle, English astronomer.</p>
<p>Scientists of today claim that the Earth's neighborhood of nearby planets is rather slummy. Of course, they still
  like to think that the planet Earth is the center of the Universe: here the Creator placed his greatest creation, Man!
  The other worlds are "slummy", created only for man's amusement and entertainment.</p>
<p>They are dreaming (and what dreams!) of a satellite space station that will dominate the world. Every two hours it
  would circle the Earth, and as the Earth turns below it, every part of its surface would come into view. This station
  would be useful for launching atom-armed guided missiles. Once a great supply of such missiles had been put on the
  station, potential aggressors below would be forced to keep the global peace. However, it doesn't seem likely that the
  first government placing a space station in our skies will be working for "global peace". It will control the entire
  world for its own benefit. Besides, "peace is not for the strong"; we will never have peace through "force".</p>
<p>The space station would have little military value, say some scientists like Dr. Milton Rosen of the Naval Research
  Laboratory in Washington, D. C. Equipping it to make observations would be exceedingly difficult, and any missiles it
  might drop would be lucky to hit the right country. Space travel will have to wait until the scientists have made some
  basic discovery equal in novelty to Faraday's discovery of electro-magnetism. They say a beam of high speed particles
  pushed at close to the so-called speed of light by nuclear energy might do the trick. No one yet has the foggiest idea
  about how to do it. Men like Dr. Rosen realize what is necessary before space travel is a reality on Earth. "A basic
  discovery equal in novelty to Faraday's discovery of electro-magnetism" would be the utilization of the Fourth Great
  Primary Force, or the RMF. The Earth is under what we might call a "Divine Quarantine". A rocket or nuclear driven
  space ship will go from the Earth to the Moon, but it will never go through the cleavage layer of the Earth's
  Resonating Electro-Magnetic Field. This cleavage layer is called "chinvat" in <em>Oahspe</em>. It divides the Earth's
  rotating field (which contains the Earth and the Moon) from the ether, or outer spaces. We will not be able to leave
  the RMF of the Earth until we have discovered the secret of magnetic propulsion, and we aren't going to discover that
  until we accept higher metaphysical principles. In other words, man on Earth simply can't go to other worlds until he
  advances spiritually--his own ignorance of the eternal verities has him "quarantined".</p>
<p>Dr. Wehrner von Braun, Germany's rocket expert in World War II, says: "What the United States needs is a daring,
  inspiring program (probably the same thing he told Hitler) that has a real chance of controlling the world. Atom bombs
  carried by air-planes are nearly worn out as war preventers. Guided missiles are important weapons, but the Russians
  are working on them too. A satellite station would put the U. S. far ahead in the <em>race for power</em>. Even a
  small satellite could be made to shine at dusk. It could inflate a plastic balloon which would gleam as brightly in
  the sunlight as a first-magnitude star. This 'American Star', rising in the west, should make a powerful impression on
  the peoples of Asia. A special commission should be set up to study the whole matter, of course. The public will not
  be told the decision of such a commission. To announce even its yes or no would reveal the summation of many military
  secrets. If the decision is yes, the first news for the public may be an 'American Star', rising in the west and
  sweeping swiftly across the sky."</p>
<p>This happened before when the first news the American public had regarding Atomic Bombs was after the first one had
  been exploded over Japan, ushering in the "Atomic Age" that was born in New Mexico. The people were not consulted on
  this matter, either. There was a chance that a chain reaction might have been set off and the entire world destroyed.
  The chance was a slim one, but nevertheless, a definite chance. Should so much power and authority to decide these
  grave matters rest in the hands of a few? Who is making these decisions? Are the same "black magicians" who destroyed
  other great civilizations back in life today? Are they the "mad scientists" of our time?</p>
<p>Men steeped in militarism, dedicated to war and its results, are the men who control atomic power! Few military men
  can be "Doves of Peace" when their very occupation depends on war. Without war there is no longer any need for the
  military, the manufacturer of ammunition, tanks, weapons, guided missiles, aircraft, etc. War certainly is not the joy
  of grieving mothers, widowed wives, or orphaned children. Every nation on Earth is controlled by men who are lovers of
  themselves only, full of vanity and pride, seekers of material wealth and glory, not performing their duties in a
  humble fashion as servants of the people, but indulging in madness that would bring complete destruction to all
  civilization on Earth. But this will not be allowed to happen!</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin once said: "Gentlemen, we give you a Republic; now try and keep it." The question is: Have we kept
  it?</p>
<p>The militarists and the international bankers cry out: "Peace is for the strong! Unite, build bigger bombs, better
  missiles, make monsters of hate out of the young men, kill and destroy . . ." The voice from the pulpit cries out: "To
  live by the sword is to die by the sword!" The measure to use in determining whether any nation is truly Christian or
  not is whether that nation follows the Christ.</p>
<p>"But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the
  other also." (St. Matthew 5:39).</p>
<p>"He that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword." (Revelation 13:10).</p>
<p>Did America "turn the other cheek"? We rained terror and desolation upon the heads of our enemies resulting in the
  worst holocaust in the history of mankind. The strong will not rule in the New Age.</p>
<p>"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth." (St. Matthew 5:5).</p>
<p>History proves that every nation and empire that ever existed fell when it thought it would surely be eternal because
  of its particular brand of strength. The Third Reich was to last one-thousand years--it lasted less than two decades.
  People of the world must open their blinded eyes: we are not on the road to peace! Those who wish to enslave us belong
  to the "hidden empire" and control us without our knowledge. They give us "darkness for light". Theirs is the path of
  destruction and annihilation.</p>
<p>America does not need a space station and she does not need to control the world. America needs God! The impression
  we need to make on the peoples of Asia is the impression of brotherly love, not that we possess bigger and better
  weapons!</p>
<p>Why haven't the "powers that be" announced what they know about the Flying Saucers? If they acknowledge
  extraterrestrial origin, it would mean that they must acknowledge extraterrestrial allegiance as well. There would be
  extraterrestrial interference with established government, and no world power would welcome such a situation. If
  Universal truth came to the people of Earth, their schemes and plans for mankind would crumble. No longer could they
  exploit the masses. They would be caught "with their pants down"; their veil of "security" would be lifted and the
  picture would not be a pretty one that appeared to the eyes of the people.</p>
<p>Who among us likes to feed the pigs? Or give to selfish people representing powerful selfish interests, even though
  their representatives come riding in Cadillacs and dressed in striped pants with top hat and carnation? Space
  intelligences see through all selfishness; smell it as we smell intoxication corning down the street. They prefer to
  deal with men who have a bare minimum of previous obligation to this or that cause and a maximum of obligation to all
  the Universe. Who will fulfill these obligations faithfully and efficiently?</p>
<p>Firecrackers are appropriate for children; revolvers and machineguns for so-called responsible men; but atomic powers
  require atomic men for their good and long continued use. New and greater powers generate new and greater
  responsibilities which require wisdom, intelligence, and character commensurate with them.</p>
<p>There is a "<em>race for power</em>"--who will get to the moon first? What half of the world will enslave man's
  thoughts in the future? Does it matter to the people whether they are dominated from the Earth or the Moon? The fact
  remains that they are not given information; they are not consulted on important issues that might mean life or death;
  and they are led to war like steers to slaughter. Does America wish to be a "Columbus" to the unknown worlds? To lead
  peoples to their conquest? To add another name to those of the forty-eight states that comprise the Union? Take
  possession of the other worlds in the name of the United States? To colonize them? To cultivate them? To people them?
  To transport thither all the prodigies of art, of science, and industry; and to constitute them a republic, if they
  are not already one? I fear for the natives of these unknown worlds considering our own history. The so-called
  "primitive people" of our own planet have undergone brutality at the hands of their earthly brothers. Their lands have
  been stolen outright; their ways of life destroyed. Would people of other planets be treated even as kindly? Man's
  inhumanity to man--when will it cease?</p>
<p>The idea of extending our own violence into outer space is at this moment circulating all over the planet Earth. The
  same pulp magazines that are influenced by creative space intelligences print monstrous tales inspired by the
  opposite, or negative forces. Scientific articles published in leading journals add to the power of confusion. If man
  on Earth can conquer space, then he will extend his miseries to the Universe. Humanity, now having sufficiently
  corrupted this planet wishes to spread its poisons to larger areas. The vast astronomical distances which are God's
  "quarantine" regulations must somehow be overcome.</p>
<p>A wild dream that planet after planet, system after system, and in the end, galaxy after galaxy can be forced to come
  under the dominion of the planet Earth. The destruction or enslavement of other men in the Universe: this is the
  "noble" goal. First they say other worlds are uninhabited "balls of gas"; yet, they plan to travel to such "worthless"
  worlds. What good would it do to go there in the first place if this were true?</p>
<p>If men on Earth make it to Mars, there will undoubtedly be a West Mars and an East Mars. The American and British
  Zones and the Russian Sector, of course! What a dither the United Nations would be in! Who is going to own which
  planet? Will Russia try to take Jupiter by force?</p>
<p>In <em>Collier's</em> magazine for March 22, 1953, there was an article called: <em>Who Owns The Universe?</em> by
  Oscar Schachter, Deputy Director, Legal Department, United Nations. He said: "Now that scientists have shown that man
  can conquer space and that new worlds lie within his reach, the question of 'owning' the moon and the planets no
  longer seems to be so much of a joke. Today, the question is not at all far-fetched and, in fact, it may well have
  important consequences for all of us.</p>
<p>"Will governments claim 'ownership' (or, more correctly sovereignty) of the moon and other celestial bodies, just as
  claims today are being made to the barren wastes of the Antarctic? Will there be national rivalry to plant the 'Stars
  and Stripes', the 'Union Jack' and the 'Hammer and Sickle' far off in space, so that the governments can then assert
  exclusive control and keep others away? A conflict may arise when the first rocket ships reach the moon and other
  celestial bodies. The old story of territorial rivalry; but this time extended into the heavens themselves.</p>
<p>"Although we have been talking about outer space, we have said nothing about where outer space begins; or to put it
  in another way, how far up does the territory of a country extend? Whenever a country could prevent or interfere with
  the movement of a rocket ship or space station it would have the legal right to do so. Would this not, in effect,
  simply be a rule that 'might makes right'? And would it not place rocket ships and space stations at the mercy of
  those national states which would be able to interfere with their free passage? Beyond the airspace we would have to
  apply a system similar to that followed on the high seas."</p>
<p>The above quotation is ludicrous in the extreme! In answer to the question: "To what tribunal would questions of
  space law be referred?" Mr. Schachter says: "A dispute in space that involved two or more governments could be
  submitted to the International Court of Justice at the Hague, just as international disputes are today."</p>
<p>What a surprise is in store for those who would put their "brand" on the Universe--a much higher authority exists in
  outer space!</p>
<p>On Sunday, September 27, 1953, the Los Angeles Examiner ran an article called: <em>Mars . . . Target For
  Tomorrow</em>. It said, in part: "Man is almost ready to leave his home of a million years . . . the Earth . . . and
  venture restlessly to other worlds . . . into space, to the Moon . . . and then to Mars."</p>
<p>First of all, the Earth hasn't been "home" to man for a short million years--millions would be more like it. More
  <em>guessing</em> without a shred of evidence to back it up. Yes, man "ventures restlessly" to conquer all space, to
  spread his disease, his war, his greed, to other worlds. Dr. von Braun, creator of the German V-2, and now director of
  the United States Army's guided missiles development project, says: "Man <em>wasn't</em> built to leave the Earth!" He
  is quite right; man wasn't built to leave the Earth in space ships that will "blast off" for this or that celestial
  body. Everything man creates on Earth is created through force. He hammers, he tears, he rivets, he pounds; now he's
  going to "blast off" to other worlds. He thinks by the use of brute force he's going to be Lord of Creation. When he
  learns to use natural forces and not fight them he will have found the key to space travel, indeed, a "key" to many
  things. The rock on which many scientists have wrecked their ships is materialism. In their studies they have
  eliminated forces and their workings, saying: "A force is the result of atomic movements." This is true; all forces
  are--except the Force which <em>first</em> starts atomic movement.</p>
<p>In 1950, a book was published called: <em>The Conquest Of Space</em>, by Chesley Bonestell and Willy Ley. Ley also
  wrote, <em>Bombs and Bombing</em>, and <em>Shells and Shooting</em>. Therefore, he should be an expert on "Conquest Of
  Space".</p>
<p>Ley says: "The high temperature of the moon-day increases the velocity of the hydrogen molecule to above the moon's
  escape velocity."</p>
<p>If this hydrogen escapes into space, where does it go? Since the escape velocity from the moon is the same for a
  space ship or for hydrogen, if a ship which reaches the "dividing line" or neutral point between the Earth and the
  Moon falls Moonward after crossing that line, and the Moon's gravitational force takes over, the same would apply to
  the hydrogen atoms escaping from the Moon, and they would be drawn to the Earth. Or, do they fall back and orbit as a
  band around the moon?</p>
<p>Ley says the modern astronomer, or rather his helper from the field of physics, also knows why the Moon is airless,
  in fact he can prove that it was "always" without air. The realization that the Moon must have lost its atmosphere
  quickly (although it presumably had a gaseous envelop for some time during the early days of its career) led to Simon
  Newcomb's famous statement that the Moon is a world without weather on which nothing ever happens. Newcomb may not
  have meant it literally, and it is not literally true. There is a strange kind of "weather" on the Moon, caused by the
  same factors which removed the weather we know, the weather caused by air and moisture.</p>
<p>How could the Moon have "always" been with-out air if it at one time during its career had air and moisture? <em>The
  Guessers</em> are so contradictory.</p>
<p>Ley says the temperature range on the Moon, from lunar midday to lunar midnight, amounts to almost four-hundred
  degrees Fahrenheit. Rocks exposed to such temperature changes at regular two-week intervals will crack. Their <em>crystalline
    structure</em> will give way under repeated expansion and contraction and the surface will flake off. Incidentally,
  the brightness of the Moon and a few other factors, support the assumption that the Sun's light is reflected by
  pulverized basalt or similar rocks.</p>
<p>If their assumption is correct, that the Sun's light is reflected from the Moon, by basalt or similar crystalline
  rocks, then the natural disintegration of those rocks will release tremendous quantities of hydrogen and oxygen. This
  also proves that the Moon has an atmosphere! Any mineralogist will confirm the fact that all crystalline structure
  contains hydrogen and, or oxygen.</p>
<p>Ley says sunrise over the large crater of Plato is just like sunrise over any other crater. But as the dividing line
  between darkness and light, the terminator, advances, the floor of Plato grows darker. At high noon it looks like an
  inkspot. What happens in the crater of Plato? Evaporation of moisture forming a light-absorbing mist? Or just melting
  ice? Or crystals with freakish optical qualities?</p>
<p>Professor William H. Pickering thinks he saw a snowstorm on Mount Pico. And he repeatedly observed grayish spots
  moving around inside the crater. Cloud formations betraying the presence of moisture? Or vegetation springing up and
  being killed off by the heat of the Sun in a rapid cycle?</p>
<p>Once again, here is an obvious contradiction.</p>
<p>How can you have thermal erosion and not have an atmosphere?</p>
<p>Ley says the first era of astronomy was naked-eye observation, the second era is telescopic observation, and the
  third era will be spaceship exploration. Astronomy, he says, confirms first-era knowledge by optical instruments, but
  it is less definite in its conclusions regarding the questions poised by the telescope--mostly concerning the surface
  conditions of planets. This is an admission that they know very little. Ley says several times: "We will know such and
  such when we get there." Until then, Mr. Ley, you are a <em>guesser</em>.</p>
<p>Ley says: "Oh, we are sure about a number of things. Take Venus, for example. It is almost a second Earth as far as
  size goes. Its diameter is only two-hundred miles less than that of Earth. The mass is eighty per cent of that of our
  rather massive home planet. The albedo is fifty-nine per cent, the highest albedo in the Solar System. Venus most
  decidedly has an atmosphere. The Venus year is 224.7 of our days long, a fact easily explained by the tighter orbit
  and higher orbital velocity. Venus' orbit is the most clearly circular one in the whole Solar System and the disk of
  Venus the most nearly perfect circle; it does not show any traces of an equatorial bulge."</p>
<p>That short paragraph contains the sum total of the definite knowledge science has about the planet which approaches
  us more closely than any other! You are "sure" about some things, Mr. Ley? A <em>guesser</em> is never "sure" of
  anything.</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at the instruments used for modern astronomical observation. There are four of these; all based
  on variations on the principle of the human eye. (1) Telescope; (2) camera; (3) thermocouple; (4) spectroscope.</p>
<p>The spectroscope is an instrument that measures the wave-lengths of the chemical elements when they are heated to a
  gaseous state and observed through a set of prisms.</p>
<p>Many scientists have used spectroscopic analysis as proof of the other planets being unable to support life. To what
  degree can spectroscopic analysis be relied upon?</p>
<p>The following examples are given to show the contradictory nature of findings:</p>
<p>According to Belopolsky, Venus rotates in about twenty-four hours, as determined by the spectroscope. However,
  according to Dr. Slipher, Venus rotates in about two-hundred twenty-four days, as determined by the spectroscope.</p>
<p>According to observations too numerous to mention, the seeming motions of stars, occulted by the Moon, show that the
  Moon has an atmosphere. According to the spectroscope, there is no atmosphere on the Moon.</p>
<p>The ring of light around Venus, during the transits of 1874 and 1882, indicated that Venus has atmosphere. Most
  astronomers say that Venus has an atmosphere of extreme density, obscuring the features of the planet. According to
  spectrum analysis, by Sir William Huggins, Venus has no atmosphere.</p>
<p>Spectroscopic examinations of Mars, by Dr. Campbell, Director of Lick Observatory, showed that there is no oxygen,
  and that there is no water vapor on Mars. Spectroscopic examination of Mars by Huggins shows abundance of oxygen and
  water vapor--the same as the planet Earth.</p>
<p>Most astronomers agree, however, that there is water on Mars and that it has an atmosphere. Yet they have had no
  success in using the spectroscope and only a few vacuum thermocouple readings have produced heat measurements.
  Astronomers are even in disagreement with each other on the topography of Mars even though it is the most easily
  viewed of all planets from the Earth. Guesses and more guesses!</p>
<p>Charles Fort, who showed up the spectroscope for what is really is, said: "When anything new appears, for which there
  is no convention, the bewilderment of the astronomers is made apparent, and the worthlessness of spectroscopy in
  astronomy is shown to all except those who do not want to be shown."</p>
<p>Ley says: "The hard work in spectroscopy is the proper application of the principle. At first, most of the hard work
  consisted of finding out by experiment which element, what lines, and where; and what the gases of the atmosphere
  through which light passed did to the lines originally contained, and so forth. And now the hard work consists mostly
  in untangling lines. Only a very few elements produce just a few lines; most of them cause whole sets. And one of the
  lines of element A is only too likely to obscure a line of element B, which in turn and in wonderful collaboration
  with element A, may blot out the lines of element C and D."</p>
<p>Since there are many elements in our atmosphere, how are we to be sure that the spectroscope is giving us a true
  picture? Might not the hydrogen we see on the Sun be in our own atmosphere?</p>
<p>Those who say that astronomy, physics and mathematics are "true and pure" science need to investigate the situation
  more thoroughly. An English astronomer, John Robinson, is not afraid to come to grips with the most modern theories
  and searchingly analyze them. For example, he strikes a blow to the theory that the planet Venus may be a dust-bowl
  instead of a cloud-enshrouded planet. The Dust Bowl theory is based on the spectroscopic examination of the upper
  atmosphere of Venus which reveals no water-vapor and quantities of carbon-monoxide at that level. Robinson points out
  that at seventy miles above the surface of the Earth the atmosphere contains no oxygen or water vapor at all, and that
  the atmosphere is almost one-hundred per cent hydrogen, an entirely unbreathable and highly inflammable gas. The Earth
  nevertheless teems with life despite the fact that there is no oxygen and water-vapor in the outer four-hundred miles
  of its atmosphere. All oxygen, water-vapor, and hence life exist only within a few miles of the surface. Robinson
  says: "It is the bottom layers of atmosphere rather than the top ones which decide the habitability of a planet.
  Living creatures live and breathe in the lowermost layers of atmosphere next to the solid surface. It is the
  composition of these strata that counts and not the composition of those ten or a hundred miles up." Robinson's book,
  <em>The Universe We Live In</em>, should be read by everyone for it proves that science is not "pure" anything except
  <em>guesswork</em>.</p>
<p>Dr. William A. Baum of the Mount Wilson and Palomar Observatories and Dr. A. D. Code of the Washburn Observatory,
  Madison, Wisconsin, recently announced that Jupiter's atmosphere is made up largely of hydrogen and helium, not <a
    href="/science/discipline/hard/nature/matter/chemistry/mol/methane">methane</a> and ammonia as was previously
  thought.
  However, these scientists believe because of the discovery of hydrogen and helium on Jupiter, the heavier gases, such
  as nitrogen and oxygen that make up the Earth's atmosphere are nearly absent on Jupiter. But Robinson has shown us
  that at seventy miles above the surface of the Earth there is neither nitrogen nor oxygen and the atmosphere is nearly
  pure hydrogen. Therefore, Jupiter is similar to the Earth and we can expect to find living creatures close to the
  planet's surface as we do here.</p>
<p>Once the "true and pure" science said <a
  href="/science/discipline/hard/nature/matter/chemistry/mol/methane">methane</a>, now
  they say hydrogen. <em>True and pure?</em> By whose criteria?</p>
<p>James Rainwater and Val Fitch of Columbia University say that the nucleus of the atom is some fifteen to twenty per
  cent smaller in diameter and about twice as dense as had been supposed. Since a fifteen per cent reduction of the
  diameter of a sphere reduces its volume almost by half, the nuclear particles must be crammed into about half the
  space they had been thought to occupy. The "true" science of physics admits to one-hundred per cent error!</p>
<p>University of California and Australian astronomers now believe the Universe is <em>double</em> the formerly accepted
  size. Another one-hundred per cent error! However, such inconsistencies are phenomena of all transitions from the old
  to the new. And shortly "all things shall be made new."</p>
<p><em>The Guessers</em> dedicated to experimentation in nuclear energy are not bringing us "peace in our time", but are
  trying to pass off their mass murders as war. Their boast is that this year they can kill more people in one second
  than all the rest of Earth's scientists put together in one year, or all the years of Earth's history. Atomic war has
  no remedy--that is why <em>The Harvesters</em> are here!</p>
<p>On March 10, 1922, at the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Prof. Francis William Aston warned mankind
  in a lecture against what he called "tinkering with the angry atoms". Aston was the famous British Nobel-prize-winning
  chemist. His words on that occasion have a strange prophetic ring: "Should the research worker of the future discover
  some means of releasing this energy from hydrogen in a form which could be employed the human race will have at its
  command powers beyond the dreams of scientific fiction, but the remote possibility must always be considered that the
  energy, once liberated, will be completely uncontrollable and by its violence detonate a neighboring substance. If
  this happens, all of the hydrogen on Earth might be transformed into helium at once, and this most successful
  experiment might be published to the rest of the Universe in the form of a new 'star' of extraordinary brilliance, as
  the Earth blew up in one vast explosion."</p>
<p>Other well-known scientists have said that here is a power to return the Earth to its lifeless state of billions of
  years ago. Dr. Albert Einstein said: "The hydrogen bomb appears on the public horizon as a probably attainable goal
  (now reality). If successful, radioactive poisoning of the atmosphere, and hence annihilation of any life on Earth,
  has been brought within the range of technical possibilities." This has also been explained by such eminent physicists
  as Dr. Bethe, Dr. Leo Szilard, Dr. Edward Teller, and others.</p>
<p>Radioactive material is carried by winds, taking it thousands of miles, carrying death to distant places. Dr. David
  Bradley says: "I have emerged with the firm conviction that if life as we know it is to continue, man must understand
  and deal with the menacing aspects of atomic energy. It is perfectly clear that nature had no intention that any of
  her children should be monkeying around with radioactive elements, else she would have provided us with some sixth
  sense to protect us from running headlong into dangerous amounts of radiation. No, she evidently expected us to take
  our daily dose of cosmic and Earth's radiation as we take the cuts and bruises of ordinary living. The idea of getting
  them out in the form of concentrated extracts was man's."</p>
<p>In <em>The Hell Bomb</em>, William L. Laurence says: "No matter how one looks at it, the advent of the H-Bomb
  constitutes the greatest threat to the survival of the human race since the Black Death. Peace, step by step, appears
  to be the only alternative to possible catastrophe."</p>
<p>A message received months ago at Giant Rock, California, said: "The increase in the explosive power of nuclear
  devices has reached a critical limit. Every explosion brings about interruption of the lines of force maintaining
  equilibrium of your planet.</p>
<p>Every explosion charges your breathable atmosphere with radioactive particles that will not lose their penetrating
  qualities for several thousand years."</p>
<p>Government scientists are discovering that atomic explosions at sea make eating tuna and other large ocean fish very
  dangerous. Also, atomic detonations are mussing up the radioactive dating of the recent past. The Type 1 "fireball"
  has nullified much of the deadly radiation in our atmosphere, but there is still enough to cause strange changes
  around the world. Although hydrogen detonation will never be allowed, atomic war would mean the world would emerge
  from its darkness and terror and in the gray light the wretched survivors would look upon the battered wreckage of a
  civilization that has crumbled to ruin in a matter of a very short time--self destruction that wise men had warned the
  world against since the days of Nagasaki and Hiroshima.</p>
<p>Those who are "experts" and "authorities" of guesswork hold the fate of the Earth in their hands. But assistance has
  come from outer space, and no longer will they be allowed to function as the self-appointed guardians of mankind.</p>
<p>In Proverbs 24:2, we read: "For their heart studieth destruction and their lips talk of mischief." These are <em>The
  Guessers!</em></p>
