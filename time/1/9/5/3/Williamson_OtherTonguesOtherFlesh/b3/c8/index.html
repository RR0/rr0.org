<p>"His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled." (Psalms 97: 4).</p>
<p>The "lightnings" of the Creator have been observed for thousands of years and at last, in the Aquarian Age, Man is
  beginning to respond to their message.</p>
<p>Theological dogma has enslaved mankind as it pictures "heaven" as a place where those who have been true to church
  tenets will be led by the hand of the Master into shaded groves and there left for eternity to rest and meditate on
  the harp-playing "angels" singing praises unto the Father.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is not the case when we consider the reality of "heaven". However, it is natural for man to
  picture the after-life in this manner, for he constantly hopes to be rid of the materialistic pursuit of lucre and
  fame. Love for money there is, but only as a means of his attaining freedom to do what he wants when he wants it. But
  man is never satisfied with "inactivity"; men who retire almost invariably get active again in some way. And when we
  think of an eternity of "idleness", it becomes ridiculous to say the least.</p>
<p>To picture the "many mansions" our Infinite Father has prepared for us as rest homes where men lie about in a state
  of morbid drowsiness or lethargy, is both childish and an insult to our Creator. People who really think, will never
  entertain such thoughts for a moment.</p>
<p>The Aquarian Age then, is not going to see a decline of inventive activity or pursuit; the Master is not going to
  abolish everything except a picnic-society that drives the Father to distraction with all-sung hymns!</p>
<p>The Father's "mansions" are bee-hives of activity, where each individual is working out his destiny and serving his
  fellowman to the best of his ability. Our "heavenly" reward in the Golden Times will be the opportunity for more and
  more expressive labor in order to better serve ourselves and others. Harp-playing forever? I'm afraid not. That would
  soon become "hell", as anyone knows who has been forced to practice music lessons day in and day out. Man needs
  intense activity and the opportunity to expand his consciousness. Working at something you despise in order to eat, of
  course, is something else; and living to work, or working to live will cease as such. Every person has something
  wonderful to contribute to society, and many times in our present setup these persons never get a chance to present
  their talents to the world because of the faulty economic practices of today.</p>
<p>The New Age will see a great theological upheaval. Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick said: "A religious reformation is afoot,
  and at heart it is the endeavor to recover for our modern life the religion of <span class="people">Jesus</span> as
  against the vast, intricate, largely inadequate and often positively false religion about <span
      class="people">Jesus</span>. Christianity today has largely left the religion which He preached, taught and lived,
  and has substituted another kind of religion altogether. If <span class="people">Jesus</span> should come
  back to earth now, hear the mythologies built up around him, see the creedalism, denominationalism, sacramentalism,
  carried on in His name, he would certainly say, 'If this is Christianity, I am not a Christian.'"</p>
<p>In 1945, a minister in Wisconsin: "For years I have seen it coming: a new world system. I have watched as one by one
  my visions became visible in the affairs of the world. A complete turn about; a whole new setup. There will be a new
  world religion modeled upon a basic formula, and people will respond willingly, for it will be a soul religion as well
  as an intellectual one. The dry and parched souls of the people will be drawn into the peace and freedom, and blossom
  as the rose. No one shall hurt his neighbor, but man will feel deeply that he is his brother's keeper. The new
  religion will fill the need of every living soul, and as a result of the freedom from fear of the unknown, health will
  come to all as a divine heritage and man will adore his Creator. But before the new Earth is established and in
  working order 'all hell will break loose'. Thousands of people will drop in their tracks. America will not escape, as
  she must pay for her sins too. There shall be 'wailing and gnashing of teeth'. Most of this will be caused by the
  die-hards, those who cling to the old order of things. The young will take it in their stride as will those who have
  the vision of the new heaven and Earth in their hearts. The 'me and mine' complex will be destroyed. Those who cling
  to the old methods and beliefs will go down with the old order. Now is the uncovering period. All the deceit and
  trickery and selfishness of human kind will be aired, as it has been enacted through the ages. Be surprised at
  nothing, for <em>evil</em>, which is <em>live</em> spelled backward, must be uncovered to be destroyed. Within a few
  years the whole world will learn that a false economic system, invented and fostered by a few greed crazed lusters
  after gold has caused every war on the face of the globe. Now they will learn that breaking the laws of Mother Nature
  and Father Creator has made disease ridden bodies. Nothing has broken out in all its fury yet. This will come within
  the next decade (1955). After that mankind will be on the upward grade and the whole world will reflect it."</p>
<p>What people on Earth will survive to inherit the New Age? The world population will be reduced greatly. Where there
  are now thousands there will be tens. But it is not tragic if one loses his physical equipment on Earth. Certain souls
  have evolved to the place where the old Earth can no longer teach them anything, therefore, either they or the Earth
  must graduate to a higher level. Shortly, the entire Earth will be made new in the new vibratory rate and the advanced
  souls, or <em>The Remnant</em>, will inherit the kingdom of God on Earth. The other souls, who refused to give up the
  old order of things, will be taken out of flesh life and will be re-settled on other worlds that can give them the
  lessons they need. So only the good and beautiful is to come to all men; there is no retrogression, for all are
  advancing toward the Father.</p>
<p>The Holy Bible speaks of <em>The Remnant</em> many times, and <em>The Prophets</em> were those who led and guided
  "those who were to remain" in ages past.</p>
<p>"Lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left." (II Kings 19:4).</p>
<p>"Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have
  been like unto Gomorrah." (Isaiah 1:9).</p>
<p>"And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to re-cover the
  remnant of his people, which shall be left." (Isaiah 11:11).</p>
<p>". . . the remnant shall be very small and feeble." (Isaiah 16:14).</p>
<p>"And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to
  give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage."
  (Ezra 9:8).</p>
<p>"And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the Lord. Yet will I leave a remnant, that
  ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries."
  (Ezekiel 6:7-8).</p>
<p>"I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together
  as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the
  multitude of men." (Micah 2:12).</p>
<p>"And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again
  to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase." (Jeremiah 23:3).</p>
<p>"Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace." (Romans 11:5).</p>
<p>"And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were
  slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven." (Revelation
  11:13).</p>
<p>Even when a nation as a whole deserted the faith of their fathers in ancient times, there always remained a "remnant"
  whose faithfulness prevailed. The outstanding example of this is, of course, the "righteous remnant" who returned from
  the exile.</p>
<p>Space intelligences said that they were separating "black from white".</p>
<p>"And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth
  his sheep from the goats: And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the King
  say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
  foundation of the world." (St. Matthew 25:32-34).</p>
<p>"For many are called, but few are chosen." (St. Matthew 22:14).</p>
<p><em>The Remnant</em> constitutes the "sheep", the "white", the "wheat". For them the days will be shortened, but
  there shall be great tribulation on Earth, as it is written.</p>
<p>Only the "beginning of sorrows" is here now. Reports from Canada say that two very strange things are taking place
  there. The <a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/ufo/otof/errata.htm#50">gauges</a> on automobiles are going wild.
  When they are taken in for repairs to a garage nothing seems to be wrong with them. When they are back out on the
  highway they go "wild" once more.</p>
<p>The other happening is even stranger. Radios that are shut completely off have been turning themselves on for no
  apparent reason. This is the beginning of the "Great Telling" space friends have told about in the past.</p>
<p>Perhaps the rash of weird phone calls of late is also connected with this phenomena. The phone will ring, and when
  answered it is discovered that no one is on the line. The line is open, but no one speaks! Space visitors are checking
  "frequencies", pulling "tests" for the big event of speaking to the world through all devices capable of reception. On
  the day of the "Great Telling" millions of citizens of the civilized parts of the world will know beyond the shadow of
  a doubt the fact that space visitors are here and they will know why they are here.</p>
<p>Every week I receive several letters that tell of strange happenings. A lady in Kentucky wrote: "My phone rang; I
  answered it. There was absolute silence so I hung up. Ten minutes later the phone rang again. And once again I
  answered it. Silence. Ten minutes later the phone rang again. Silence. By this time I was getting angry, so I quietly
  but firmly said, 'I don't know who you are, nor why you are doing this, but please, please stop it. It is not pleasant
  to be annoyed in this manner. Please stop it.' I started to hang up when a very soft spoken voice in perfect English
  said, 'Please be calm, we are checking on those whose auras are the right color.' Since that most unusual phone call I
  have observed three Saucers."</p>
<p>Telephone engineers have told me that very strange things are happening to telephones since they have had many
  complaints from telephone users, especially in the mid-west. Television and radio engineers have experienced weird
  happenings while on duty. Tape recorded programs have been mysteriously erased or garbled and they have heard unknown
  code coming out of the air from apparently nowhere. These engineers are not given to vivid imaginations since their
  profession calls for men of a practical and methodical mind.</p>
<p>The following cases are excerpts from letters I have received:</p>
<p>A lady in London, England wrote: "Lately at night time I have been hearing strange notes and rhythms which have been
  quite outside ordinary wireless experience. I worked in wireless stations and know Morse code exceptionally well, but
  this is not any code we know; it is very different."</p>
<p>A lady in Cincinnati, Ohio, wrote: "One day in the latter part of May, 1954, I was awakened about three in the
  morning. I heard the sound of code in my room. It was similar to Morse code, pitched rather low, and seemed to be just
  in my room. I listened to it for about ten minutes and fell asleep with it still going. There was a sense of peace
  connected with it, and I felt there was nothing to fear. I knew it was strange for code to be heard without a receiver
  but somehow it didn't bother me. In June, I heard it again for a few minutes."</p>
<p>A housewife in Medford, Oregon wrote: "One night the strangest noise suddenly came over our radio which was off at
  the time. I asked my husband what it was. I wish now that I had turned the set on, because we may have heard voices,
  but the sound was so loud and I was so surprised I couldn't think of anything. The sound was similar to Morse code but
  had a musical note to it. Later we learned that two Saucers had been observed in the area at the same time we received
  the signals on our radio."</p>
<p>A woman in New Castle, Pennsylvania wrote: "Several times lately our television set has gone absolutely crazy. We
  heard strange code-like sounds and even voices. We called our neighbors but they were receiving nothing like that on
  their sets. We have a brand new GE model and it's in perfect condition--we know, because we've had it checked."</p>
<p>A lady in Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/ufo/otof/errata.htm#51">California</a> wrote: "My
  husband and I have an old television set in our den. This set has been out of order for weeks. On the night of August
  31, 1954, I went to bed in the front bedroom about 12:30, my husband turned in shortly thereafter. About one in the
  morning he called me and asked if I had turned on the TV set. I told him I hadn't turned it on, and besides, it wasn't
  working. He said the set was making a strange, buzzing sound, and he could see the tubes from the back of the set and
  they were all on, even the viewing tube which hasn't been working for weeks! My husband turned up the volume to see if
  he could hear anything and a beautiful voice came out strong and loud, saying: 'Strange waters shall gush forth out of
  the rocks.' My husband turned off the volume and I asked him what the man's voice was. He believed it was some
  minister talking. I asked him how the set got on, and why did it work at all. We checked it and found the set was only
  a little bit warm, so it wasn't on for long. Our television set had turned itself on some way! The next morning we
  checked the TV programs in the paper to see what had been on the channel the night before. We had been tuned to
  Channel 5-KTLA-TV. We learned that this channel is off the air entirely after 11:30 every night and the voice came on
  after one in the morning. It certainly was unusual for a TV set that is out of order to suddenly turn itself on, and
  produce a voice from a channel that has been off the air for over an hour and a half! The set is still in the den, and
  still doesn't work."</p>
<p>Recently four people tried to contact space visitors by telepathy in Los Angeles, California. They asked for a signal
  of some kind after they thought they were getting a reception. They wanted to know for sure whether it was really
  coming from space friends or if it was from their own minds. Suddenly a TV set that hadn't been on for over four hours
  started showing a "blip" similar to radar blips. This moved around on the TV screen. They pulled the plug out of the
  wall and moved the set into the middle of the room, but the blip still kept coming in! No power of any kind was being
  received by the set; as far as anyone in the room was concerned it was a dead set.</p>
<p>A lady in Ingleside, Illinois wrote: "During June, 1954, my TV set suddenly operated automatically. For some
  unexplained reason, a picture became visible, just as plain as could be, with the set switch off. However, there was
  only a picture, no sound. A picture of people remained clear and undistorted for about forty-five minutes. I switched
  the set off and on, but it had no effect other than to include sound. I called my next door neighbor to view this
  unusual happening, and he was equally startled. Later, my TV set operated normally."</p>
<p>The mystery of KLEE-TV hit the headlines in the Spring of 1954. At 3:30 p.m., British Summer Time, September 14,
  1953, Charles W. Bratley, of London, picked up the call letters KLEE-TV on his television set. Later that month, and
  several times since, they have been seen by engineers at Atlantic Electronics, Ltd., Lancaster, England. The call
  letters KLEE-TV have not been transmitted since July, 1950, when the Houston, Texas station changed its letters to
  KPRC-TV. A check of the world's television stations confirms the fact that there is not now and never has been another
  KLEE-TV. Paul Huhndorff, chief engineer of KPRC-TV, to whom the Britishers sent their report, has no explanation. He
  says that members of the old <a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/ufo/otof/errata.htm#52">KLEE-TV</a> staff have
  identified the pictures of the signals as looking like the standard call-letter slide they used. Engineer Huhndorff
  offered three theories. The first two he discounts as being nearly impossible. The third is that some intelligence in
  outer space has received the signal and has transmitted it in the hope of communicating with the planet Earth.</p>
<p>Everyone remembers the <a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/ufo/otof/errata.htm#53">strange</a> case of the face on
  the TV-screen, and the same phenomenon happened again on September 12, 1954 in Indianapolis, India. John and Virginia
  Mackey said the image appeared to be that of George R. Shots, Mrs. Mackey's grandfather who died April 28, 1954 at the
  age of seventy-four. Mrs. Mackey said she first saw the face while watching a network show. When the image became more
  intense, whether the set was tuned to an Indianapolis station or to a blank channel, police were called. A parade of
  officers saw the face for themselves. Mrs. Marie Johnson, Mrs. Mackey's mother, also identified the face as that of
  her father, as did a number of other relatives.</p>
<p>There have been countless reports of strange things happening to anything that will act as a receiver. On October 3,
  1952, Van Tassel at Giant Rock, California, received the following: "I greet you in love and peace. I am Ashtar. Those
  individual beings from Schare now on your planet are being instructed to transmit certain carrier frequencies that
  will cause a variety of conditions to be apparent in your many types of electronic receivers."</p>
<p>Besides the above happenings, many strange things have been falling from the sky. Charles Fort world be in his glory
  if he were alive today! Ashes come from the sky; ice bombs; large chunks of foul-smelling jelly; molten metal; white,
  filmy substance like cotton candy; and fragments of this and that. Added to this is the great mystery of the
  pockmarked wind-shields. Reports on the latter have come in from Canada, England, France, and from many parts of the
  United States. Tar-like substance, or ash-like material, has been found on cars and some of it is magnetic. On the
  evening of April 22, 1954, radio station WIND in Chicago reported that a strange blue mist had settled on a car, and
  while its occupants watched intently, the glass in the automobile shattered to pieces. Other witnesses said a blue
  dust sediment imbedded in their glass after shattering took place. In England, observers saw weird, yellow flames
  strike their windshields. This is one of the phenomena of the New Age; more will be seen in the future and the "glass"
  sickness will spread to objects made of metal. What would happen to civilization if steel was so affected? The answer
  is obvious.</p>
<p>These new vibrations are not only changing things in the physical world, but they are responsible for the change in
  man's thinking--and they will change him spiritually, as well.</p>
<p>Many years ago a woman in Santa Fe, New Mexico, had an unusual experience where she saw seven beings sitting in
  council around a table. These beings said: "We shall communicate with your planet Earth soon. There are those
  spiritually minded enough to hear our communications and listen." This sounds like the Council of the Seven Lights
  mentioned by Van Tassel, or the Council-Circle 7 mentioned in <em>The Saucers Speak!</em></p>
<p>Many more startling discoveries will be announced in the near future. A leading aviation company is reliably reported
  to be conducting experiments in interplanetary radio communication at the present time, and the government continues
  its investigation through Project NQ-707. We have experienced some mighty peculiar things in the past few years and in
  the months ahead these things will become even more peculiar!</p>
<p>Aquarius has its ominous side too, for astrologers equate it with cold, rainstorms, floods, and dark. We know that
  for some time the world has been experiencing a fantastic number of disasters from tidal waves to dust storms. But
  these catastrophic events have been prophesied for centuries and the New Age under the dominant influence of Uranus
  will first see all old conditions upset, for Uranus is the disrupter or smasher. What we are prone to call death and
  destruction is usually the prelude to something better and finer--what is the death of the old year, but the birth of
  the new one?</p>
<p>We would expect space visitation in the new Air Age. Man on Earth will sail through interstellar space himself in the
  new world of the future. He will know Truth, for the Light of Aquarius will not permit falsity to exist in any
  form.</p>
<p>When Ganymedes (Aquarius) is raised to heaven (or above the horizon of the North Pole) Virgo or Astraea, who is
  Lucifer, descends head downward below the horizon of the South Pole, or the pit; which pit, or the pole, is also the
  Great Dragon or the Flood. From this we can see that in the New Age (Aquarius) all falsity and evil (Lucifer) will be
  done away with on Earth and submerged forever (the pit).</p>
<p>There is a striking similarity between the pure water rushing forth from the jar of Aquarius and the words of St.
  John in Revelation: "He shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God
  and of the Lamb." And remember the words spoken over the TV set that wasn't supposed to work: "Strange waters shall
  gush forth out of the rocks."</p>
<p>Set your heart upon God and not upon things, upon Cause and not upon manifestation, upon Principle and not upon form.
  As the old landmarks disappear one by one beneath the rising tide of the new life, go boldly on, knowing that the best
  is yet to be, and that "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man that things
  that God hath prepared for them that love Him. Greet the unknown with a cheer".</p>
<p>Remember the following quotations from <em>The Saucers Speak!</em></p>
<p>"By your year of 1956 there must be a new Saras."</p>
<p>"Show us when you are ready to venture."</p>
<p>"Watch all nature for signs of catastrophe. These signs, such as tornados, earthquakes, floods, and so on will come
  to Saras soon and will get worse as time goes on."</p>
<p>"Some will not see it, except from elsewhere--from outside."</p>
<p>"More detonations soon, more disasters on Saras."</p>
<p>"The cosmic dust cloud will come. And it will darken the Sun and Moon. Strange things will happen in your world.
  Great meteors shall be seen in the skies."</p>
<p>"Never fear for the aged, they can help again when they are brought to life."</p>
<p>In Iowa, a research group received the following by radiotelegraphy: "We find few now ready."</p>
<p>Many of the above statements have come to pass already, and others will shortly come to pass. <em>The Remnant</em>
  will be small, for "few are now ready". Show the space visitors if you are "ready to venture"; if you belong to those
  who shall remain, you will see chaos from "elsewhere--from outside."</p>
<p>The following message was received by Van Tassel:</p>
<p>"The Bible again explains to Earth people our purpose here. In St. Matthew 24:39-42, it reads: 'And knew not until
  the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. Then shall two be in the field;
  the one shall be taken, and the other left. Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.' We have
  registered in our records the names and locations of those who have lived with right intent. These are the ones who
  shall be taken up in our ships while the Earth goes through cataclysmic upheavals. Those who have contributed to and
  lived by destruction shall be left to the agonies of the effects they have helped to cause."</p>
<p>Later, <em>The Remnant</em>, will be returned to the surface of Earth where they will be the new race in a new world.
</p>
<p>In Colville, Washington, an elderly lady received the following:</p>
<p>"By a seeming miracle shall men's eyes be opened to the wonders of a world now unperceived by them. Not a miracle but
  a perfectly natural action of an ever existent law will bring this phenomenon to pass. As hath been told thee
  aforetimes, there be a change rapidly metamorphosing much of the material world through the introduction of Cosmic
  Energy into the very atomic structure of all material objects. When ye consider all material forms (whether animate or
  what ye do term inanimate) as the result of a certain specified rate of vibratory action, it will be the easier for
  thee to comprehend the action of a vastly accelerated rate of vibration upon all manner of objective manifestations.
  At the appointed time, this influx of Cosmic Energy, vibrating at an inconceivably increased speed, will cause changes
  marvelous to behold. Lo, the wonders of the now invisible realms of enchanting beauty will be revealed to Man, if so
  be he hath previously attuned himself to his own highest concept of beauty. Of material beauty there shall be no end,
  but far greater than any mere physical demonstration shall be the revelation of that spiritual fullness of life which
  alone can satisfy Man's inmost yearning for true and lasting happiness."</p>
<p>The Cosmic Energy now bombarding the Earth and her inhabitants will actually change man's thinking. Recent findings
  by Dr. Seymour Kety and his associates at the National Institute of Mental and Nervous Diseases indicate that the
  physical brain is not a "thinking" machine, but at best can be compared to a radio set! Dr. Kety's conclusions are
  based on studies of blood circulation through the brain. These studies carried out at the Institute showed the
  following results:</p>
<p>(1) The average-size human brain requires about three-fourths of a quart of blood a minute; (2) It consumes about an
  ounce and a half of oxygen, brought to it by the red blood cells; (3) It uses only about a teaspoonful of sugar, the
  "fuel" of the body, per hour. The most surprising discovery in Dr. Kety's experiments is that these three requirements
  are the same, regardless of what the brain is doing. These findings are somewhat disturbing to various theories
  expounded in the past, one of which stated that intelligence varied with the richness of the brain's blood supply. The
  other theory propounded before the National Academy of Sciences, was that thinking required a definite amount of
  "fuel".</p>
<p>Therefore, if man's brain is nothing but a receiving and transmitting instrument similar to a radio set, he must be
  able to receive and interpret the "music of the spheres" or the Great Cosmic Intelligence that forever is permeating
  all space; man merely must "tune in" to it. Those who refuse to receive the new vibrations mentally, will lose their
  physical equipment on Earth and thereby give up their "radio sets" that will not accept the new lessons. They will go
  elsewhere and acquire new "sets" that will allow them to learn and progress as they must.</p>
<p>Other parts of the human body are affected by the new vibrations also. The pineal gland and the solar plexus becomes
  radioactive under the influence of the cosmic rays. The body is in continual touch with the whole existence. The skin
  is no border of the body as we sometimes imagine; there is continuous mutual meeting and mingling of the single human
  body and the whole of the cosmos which also includes other human bodies. In the human body there are said to be
  six-hundred million psychic centers. By psychic is meant the extensional apertures. Many more centers exist, of
  course, in the known cosmos. As the single human being comes in contact with the great influx of Cosmic Energy, he
  will realize that he possesses some very strange abilities and powers. The rays will actually stimulate the pineal
  gland and the third eye of the human will be opened once again.</p>
<p>Those individuals who refuse to accept the higher vibrations mentally, allowing for great spiritual growth and
  advancement, will experience a definite physiological reaction. In the study of the electrochemistry of the blood, the
  answer to what will take place is found.</p>
<p>The blood stream of man is composed of the serum and the cellular constituents, plus colloids. The countless millions
  of cells in the circulating blood must maintain their ability to remain free of all other elements in the stream.
  Research is revealing the importance of electro-chemistry. All blood cells carry a charge, the charge is of the same
  de-nomination. Like charges repel, and so the cells as well as the colloids repel each other resulting in the <a
      href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/ufo/otof/errata.htm#54">existence</a> of electrical cushions capable of
  preventing the cells from touching one another. When thrombosis (clotting) occurs, it is precipitated by the discharge
  of cell or colloid charges which allows for the agglutination or formation of the clots.</p>
<p>Each human blood cell is surrounded by a Resonating Electro-Magnetic Field; if a person refuses to accept the new
  Universal lessons presented to him for his use, he sets up an action within his body that causes the RMF to collapse.
  Clotting occurs and he is said to have died of a "heart attack". The only reason heart attacks are on the increase is
  because of the new vibrations and man's inability to cope with them, accept them, and understand them. Therefore, no
  "god of wrath" destroys man; man eliminates himself by his thoughts!</p>
<p>What are some of the promises of the New World and its Remnant?</p>
<p>"Then cometh the end (of the Age), when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall
  have put down all rule and all authority and power." (I Corinthians 15:24).</p>
<p>There shall be no governments or dictatorships or monarchies as such in the New Age; and death will be no more.</p>
<p>"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death." (I Corinthians 15:26).</p>
<p>"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying,
  neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. Behold, I make all things new."
  (Revelation 21:4-5).</p>
<p>"That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which
  are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: In whom also we have obtained an inheritance." (Ephesians
  1:10-11).</p>
<p>"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one
  in Christ <span class="people">Jesus</span>." (Galatians 3:28).</p>
<p>"Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the
  world." (I John 4:4).</p>
<p><em>The Remnant</em> can truly say: "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be
  called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of
  God, and it cloth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for
  we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure." (I John
  3:1-3).</p>
<p>"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and
  everlasting contempt." (Daniel (12.2). <em>The Remnant</em> shall know "everlasting life", but <em>The Outcasts</em>
  shall not exist in the New World.</p>
<p>In Daniel 12:3, we read:</p>
<p>"And they that be wise (teachers) shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to
  righteousness as the stars for ever and ever." These are <em>The Remnant!</em></p>
