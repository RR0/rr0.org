    </tr></table><p>In a tiny building only 12 feet square at Shirley's Bay, 10 miles north of Ottawa, is housed one
    of<span lang="en-us"> the most   unusual collection of instruments ever crammed into so small a space. It is the   world's first flying saucer observatory.</span>
  </p>
    <p>The sighting station went into operation with little fanfare. At first Canadian Government officials<span
        lang="en-us"> were inclined   to dismiss the very existence of the station as a figment of the imagination. On   the day before it opened, Dr. C.M. Solandt, chairman of the Defense Research   Board, professed complete ignorance of the project. "Nothing to do with the   Defense Research Board," he said. True enough, it turned out. The station was   constructed by the National Research Council and officially announced by the   Hon. Lionel Chevrier, Minister of Transport. Mr Chevrier did not explain the   denial of the project by Dr. Solandt, who was quick to modify his statement,   explaining only that his board was not involved in the project.</span>
    </p>
    <p>"However, we are continuing to study new reports (of flying saucers)," he admitted, "and<span lang="en-us"> are alert to the   possibilities of discoveries of that nature." </span>
    </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, reports of new saucer sightings have been coming in from all over Canada.</p>
    <p>In North Bay, Ont., the <em>Daily Nugget</em> has a file of 16 persons who have reported<span lang="en-us"> sighting orange-colored   discs. The newspaper says that all the accounts check closely in size, color,   speed and flying behavior. </span>
    </p>
    <p>One North Bay citizen late in October told of a dozen night sightings of a "funny orange<span lang="en-us"> globe" which came out of   the northeastern skies, wandered back and forth across the horizon, then   vanished.</span>
    </p>
    <p>In the fall of 1951, three persons reported a day-time sighting over Lake Nipissing.<span lang="en-us"> Each saw it from a different   shore and did not know of the other reports. And each reported a silver,   round-shaped star going through strange maneuvers.</span>
    </p>
    <p>Orange-re<span lang="en-us">d</span> discs have appeared <span lang="en-us">over</span> the Royal Canadian Air
      Force Jet Base on <span lang="en-us">North Bay several times. Once such an object circled, dived   and zig-zagged over the field for eight minutes. Another time a disc approached   from the southwest, stopped, hovered over the field, reversed direction, and   disappeared in a climbing turn.</span>
    </p>
    <p>It is dozens of such reports that have resulted in <span lang="en-us">the </span>creation of Canada's flying
      saucer<span lang="en-us"> observatory - some call it a "dish watching" station. Management of the station   is under the Canadian saucer project, called "Project Magnet." Project Magnet   was given formal recognition three years ago by the Department of Transport on   an understanding that it be confined to the broadcast and measurement section of   the telecommunications division of the department and that no appropriation of   public funds be required for its support. Actually, Project Magnet was created   to investigate the possibility of discs powered by magnetic propulsion. </span>
    </p>
    <p>Tremendously complex and expensive equipment has gone into the tiny building<span lang="en-us"> at Shirley's Bay. The equipment is   designed to detect gamma rays, magnetic fluctuations, radio noises and gravity   or mass changes in the atmosphere.</span>
    </p>
    <p>Installed in the little structure is an ionospheric reactor to determine the height, pattern<span lang="en-us"> and conduct of the   ionized layer of gases several hundred miles in the atmosphere. </span>
    </p>
    <p>There is a new type instrument called a gravometer, imported from Sweden, to measure<span lang="en-us"> the earth's gravity; a   magnetometer, to record the variations in the earth's magnetic field; a radio   set running full volume at 530 kilocycles to pick up any radio noises, and a   counter to detect cosmic rays from the outer atmosphere.</span>
    </p>
    <p>Peter Dempson of the <em>Telegraph</em> staff reports that all the instruments are connected<span lang="en-us"> with a control panel   filled with lights, dials and other instruments which record the individual   findings on paper.</span>
    </p>
    <p>The station is not manned, but is connected directly by an alarm bell system with<span lang="en-us"> the nearby ionosphere station at   Shirley's Bay where a staff of telecommunications experts are on a 24 hour duty.</span>
    </p>
    <p>Eventually, relays will carry the information recorded by the instruments in the<span lang="en-us"> sighting station to the main   building. Any unusual variation in the information they provide will trigger the   ionosphere recorder - an instrument which transmits a radio signal 250 miles   into the sky. The signal bounces off the heavy layers in the ionosphere and is   reflected back to be picked up by a radar-like instrument. Officials believe   that it would record any flying saucer in the area. "If anything should happen,   the findings of this recorder prove very valuable," one official said. </span>
    </p>
    <p>The effective range of the other instruments is limited to about 50 miles.<span lang="en-us"> Wilbert B. Smith, engineer in charge of   the project, believes on the basis of past reports there is a 90 to 95 percent   probability that the sighted phenomena which the station is set up to observe   actually do exist. Mr. Smith's official position is engineer in charge of the   telecommunications division of the Canadian Department of Transport. He and   members of his staff have conducted saucer investigations for five years as a   hobby and Project Magnet now represents the Canadian Government's official seal   of approval on their efforts. Smith himself believes that there is a 60 percent   probability that flying saucers are "alien vehicles."</span>
    </p>
    <p>Top Canadian scientists, including Dr. C. J. MacKenzie, former head of the National<span lang="en-us"> Research Council and the Canadian   Atomic Energy Project, have consistently refused to ridicule saucer reports.</span>
    </p>
    <p>"My own opinion is that the reports are valid," Smith told Gerald Waring, Canadian<span lang="en-us"> news writer. "The optical   illusion explanation is lovely, but in every sighting there is always some   factor which rules it out. So we've decided to learn just what flying saucers   are."</span>
    </p>
    <p>Because of the comparatively large number of saucer sightings in Canada, and despite<span lang="en-us"> the fact that most of his   instruments have only a 50 mile range, Smith predicts that his instruments will   report at least one saucer within a year.</span>
    </p>
    <p>He points out a fact that may or may not be significant &ndash; that saucer sightings increase<span lang="en-us"> when planet Mars is nearest   the Earth. These close approaches occur every 26 months. Next summer Mars will   come within 40 million miles of Earth, and in 1956 it will come within 35   million miles.</span>
    </p>
    <p>Others aiding engineer Smith include Dr. James Watt, theoretical physicist with the<span lang="en-us"> Research Board; John H.   Thompson, technical information expert on telecommunications; Prof. J. T. Wilson   of the University of Toronto, and Dr. G. D. Garland, gravity specialist with the   Dominion Observatory.</span>
    </p>
    <p>The Shirley's Bay observatory had its first major test in January, just two months after<span lang="en-us"> it was established. A ball   of fire flashed across Ontario, Quebec, and New York state in the early dawn and   may have fallen into Georgian Bay. Startled residents of Ontario and Quebec   called police and radio stations for an explanation. From Parry Sound came   reports of an explosion "like a bomb."</span>
    </p>
    <p>The observatory was able to report that it was a meteor. Director Smith said that the<span lang="en-us"> object was noted at the   flying saucer station but failed to register on the delicate instruments,   indicating that it definitely was not a saucer.</span>
    </p>
    <p>"Not a squiggle on our electronic devices," Smith said. "If it had been a saucer,<span lang="en-us"> our recorder would have shown it."   Smith pointed out that his station's electronic devices would not detect meteors   unless they were of "great mass" and passed very close.</span>
    </p>
    <p>This leaves no doubt whatever that the little building on Shirley's Bay is a<span lang="en-us"> flying saucer station only.</span>
