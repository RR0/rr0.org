<p class="abstract">A FORMER pupil of the Royal Liberty School, Romford, <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span>
  whose parents live at 12, Hazel-rise, Romford, was in the BOAC air liner travelling from New York to London on
  Wednesday when passengers and crew saw flying saucers in the air over Labrador. </p>
<p>"It sounds crazy," said Mr. <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXX</span> to the "Recorder," "but I can assure you it's a
  fact. There were six or seven little satellites round a flying saucer, but all disappeared almost as soon as they were
  seen. The captain of the BOAC air liner called our attention to the objects and we all saw them."</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXX</span> who is in the employ of BOAC in New York, was on his way home to join his
  wife who was spending a holiday with her parents at Thameshill-ave., Collier Row. They will return to New York on
  Monday.</p>
<p><span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> lived in New York for two years.</p>
<p>The air liner was travelling at 19,000ft. when the objects were sighted. The pilot Capt. James Howard, said: "They
  were obviously not aircraft as we know them. All appeared black. I'll swear they were solid."</p>
<p>For 18 minutes the seven objects flew parallel with the plane on its eastbound flight.</p>
<p>They disappeared only when the pilot of an American fighter, called up by Capt. Howard, radioed that he was 20 miles
  away and closing in. </p>
