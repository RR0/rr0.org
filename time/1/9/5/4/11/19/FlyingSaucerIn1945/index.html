<p class="abstract">GERMAN'S ACCOUNT OF EXPERIMENTS</p>
<p>FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT</p>
<p>GENEVA, Nov, 18</p>
<p>The Zürich newspaper <em>Tages-Anzeiger </em>10-days published an account of an interview with a German
  engineer, Herr Klein, who was employed in Speer's Ministry of Munitions during the Third Reich, and in the capacity
  was concerned with the production of Hitler's "secret weapons." One of them, according to Herr Klein (who now lives at
  Zürich), was of type of "flying saucer."</p>
<p>He states that he was present when a "flying saucer" was released from Prague in <time>1945</time>. It soared to a
  height of 30,700ft. in three minutes. The construction of the piloteless, ray-guided disc was begun in
  <time>1942</time>, and within less than two years it was possible to make the first experimental flight. It was one of
  these discs, Herr Klein claims, which was released at Stettin and <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Spitzbergen/index.html">crashed on Spitsbergen</a>. The model was build
  at Peenemünde, where the V1 and the <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/missile/v2">V2</a> were also produced.</p>
<p>According to Herr Klein, two types of flying disks are being produced to-day—one with a diameter of about 52ft,
  and the other with a diameter of about 138ft. Nor did he disbelieves stories that "flying saucers" had been seen both
  to remain stationary and to turn at an angle of 90deg. Stability, he said, was attained with a device on the principle
  of the gyroscope. </p>
