<p>During the past few years, several dozen accounts have been given concerning alleged landings on this Planet by space
  ships, i.e., <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/FlyingSaucers.html">flying saucers</a>, from other worlds. It is my
  intention in the following article to consider in detail the most widely publicized of these stories, namely, the one
  told by Mr. <span class="people">George Adamski</span>. This tale is given in detail in <em>Flying Saucers Have
    Landed</em> (British Book Center, published <time>1953</time>). It is probable that most <em>Nexus</em> readers have
  read this book, which is co-authored by Mr. <span class="people">Adamski</span> and one <span class="people">Desmond Leslie</span>;
  but for the benefit of <em>Nexus</em> subscribers who are not familiar with the book, a brief resume of Adamski's
  portion of it is given below:
</p>
<section>
  <h2>George Adamski's Story</h2>
  <p>Mr. <span class="people">Adamski</span> begins his section of the book by stating that he is a <q>philosopher,
    teacher, student, and saucer researcher</q>. Also, for several years he has been an amateur astronomer, and has in
    his possession two small telescopes: one, a 15-incher, housed under a dome, and the other, a 6-incher. Though he
    lives on the slopes of Mt. Palomar, where the giant 200-inch telescope is located,
    <span class="people">Adamski</span> concedes that he has no connection with
    <span class="place">Palomar Observatory</span>.
  </p>
  <p><span class="people">Adamski</span> has long been interested in the possibility of life on other planets, but his
    first attempts at photographing <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/FlyingSaucers.html">flying saucers</a> came only when,
    in late <time>1949</time>, he was visited by 2 men — J. P. Maxfield and G. L. Bloom — of the Point Loma Navy
    Electronics Laboratory near <span class="place">San Diego</span>. These men assured
    <span class="people">Adamski</span> that <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/FlyingSaucers.html">flying saucers</a> are
    probably interplanetary, because no Earth government is making them. They also asked his co-operation in trying to
    get photographs of these strange craft, on the assumption that <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s 6-inch
    telescope could maneuver more easily than the large telescopes at the Observatory; They told <span class="people">Adamski</span>
    that they planned to make a similar request for photographs from the Observatory itself. On a subsequent visit to
    Palomar Gardens, Mr. Bloom confirmed a radio report of a <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/FlyingSaucers.html">flying
      saucer</a> said to have landed in <span class="place">Mexico City</span>.
  </p>
  <p>Thus, having been asked by <q>the military</q> to co-operate with them by taking saucer photographs,
    <span class="people">Adamski</span> proceeded to but more photographic equipment. To quote the book: <q>Since then,
      winter and summer, day and night, through heat and cold, winds, rains, and flog, I have spent every moment
      possible outdoors watching the skies for space craft... Night after night I stayed outdoors watching the
      heavens... The cold winds wrapped me round and seemed to penetrate the very marrow of my bones. And steaming hot
      coffee was incapable of warming me. Once I caught such a cold that it took me many weeks to recover, but still I
      persisted.</q>
  </p>
  <p>Even though <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s liaison with the Point Loma technicians soon fell through, he
    continued his efforts at saucer photography, and gradually his efforts were rewarded by an increasing number of good
    photos, though most of this pictures did not turn out well enough to prove anything. All through this period,
    <span class="people">Adamski</span> hoped that some day the time would come when he could make a personal contact
    with a man from another world. Many times he wandered out onto the desert in hopes of such a contact, but it was not
    until <time>1952-11-20</time>, that he succeeded in making this wish a reality.
  </p>
  <p>In <time>1952-08</time> <span class="people">Adamski</span> became acquainted with Mr. and Mrs. Al Bailey of
    <span class="place">Winslow, Arizona</span> <span class="note">Bailey and Williamson have since published a book of their own called <em>The Saucers Speak</em>, based on alleged radio and ouija board conact with space men.</span>.
    The Baileys and Williamsons were at interested in making a contact as was <span class="people">Adamski</span>, and
    they asked to be invited along the next time he made a trip into the desert. Accordingly, <span class="people">Adamski</span>
    phoned Williamson on <time>1952-11-20</time>. Accompanying <span class="people">Adamski</span> to the rendezvous
    were Alice Wells, owner of the <span class="place" title="Oak Knoll Campgrounds">Palomar Gardens Cafe</span>, and
    Lucy McGinnis, <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s private secretary.
  </p>
  <p>These 7 people met on schedule, and proceeded to a point on the highway about
    <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">11</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="SMI">miles</span></span> from
    <span class="place" title="Desert Center, 92239 Californie">Desert Center</span>. The Baileys brought a movie
    camera, the Williamsons bought a still camera, and <span class="people">Adamski</span> brought his 6-inch telescope,
    binoculars, and a case containing his still camera and gadgets for attaching the camera onto the telescope; also,
    seven film holders and a cheap Brownie camera. Thus, the party was quite well prepared in case they should see a
    saucer or a space man.
  </p>
  <p>The first unusual occurrence was the sight of a large "mother ship" type of saucer, which appeared at hight
    altitude and was seen by the whole party. As the group was camped right next to the highway when they made this
    sighting, the "mother ship" could have been seen by any passing motorist, says <span class="people">Adamski</span>.
  </p>
  <p>But <span class="people">Adamski</span> had a feeling that this would not be the spot where he would make contact
    with a space man. Accordingly, he had Lucy drive him to a place a half mile or so from the highway; He requested
    that Lucy return and wait with the others for a period of one hour, after which time he would rejoin the group.
    Thus, for one hour <span class="people">Adamski</span> remained alone on the desert, while the other members of the
    party watched his activities as best they could from a distance of between
    <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">0.5</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="SMI">mile</span></span> and
    <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">1</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="SMI">mile</span></span>.
  </p>
  <p><span class="people">Adamski</span> set up his telescope and other equipment, and within <time>P5M</time> was
    rewarded by the sight of a small <q>scout ship</q> (i.e. saucer) some distance away from him. He took 7 photos of
    this <q>scout ship</q>, though as he notes further along in the story, none of these pictures turned out well for
    some reason. Not long thereafter, <span class="people">Adamski</span> saw a man approaching him. As
    <span class="people">Adamski</span> walked up to the man and took a good look at him, he realized that he was
    looking at a human being from another world. The Visitor looked basically similar to an earth-man, though different
    in many details of his clothes and personal appearance. But the thing that made it obvious to <span class="people">Adamski</span>
    that this stranger was indeed from Space, was the beautiful feeling that the sight of the man caused him. To quote
    the book: <q>The beauty of this form surpassed anything I had ever seen... I felt like a little child in the
      presence of one with great wisdom and much love, and I became very humble within myself, for from him was
      radiating a feeling of infinite understanding and kindness, with supreme humility.</q>
  </p>
  <p>The meeting lasted exactly long enough to use up the remainder of the hour <span class="people">Adamski</span> had
    alloted himself, and during this time <span class="people">Adamski</span> learned, by using mental telepathy and
    gestures (as the stranger could speak no English), that the man was from
    <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus">Venus</a>, and that his visit here on
    <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre">Earth</a> was due in part to concern over our use of atomic weapons.
    To express the idea of atomic explosions, the Visitor said <q>Boom! Boom!</q> — Unfortunately, the man would not
    allow <span class="people">Adamski</span> to take a photograph of him.
  </p>
  <p>Toward the end of the interview, the Venusian made a point of calling attention to his own footprints. It developed
    that the soles of the Visitor's shoes were inscribed with significant markings. After the Venusian returned to his
    "scout ship' and departed, <span class="people">Adamski</span> rejoined his friends. Dr. Williamson happened to have
    with him a small package of plaster of paris, as <q>on this trip we tried to be prepared for any eventuality</q>.
    Plaster casts were therefore made of some of the footprints, and over the subsequent months attempts have been made
    to interpret the strange symbols thereupon.
  </p>
  <p>In the course of his talk with <span class="people">Adamski</span>, the Venusian has asked permission to take one
    of <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s film packs, with the promise that it would be returned to him before long.
    Sure enough, on <time>1952-12-13</time> (i.e. about 3 weeks later), the same scout ship flew over the vicinity of
    Palomar Gardens and <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s space friend dropped the film pack out the window. When
    the film was developed, more strange symbols were found, and they too are being interpreted by <span class="people">Adamski</span>
    and his co-workers. On <time>1952-12-13</time> <span class="people">Adamski</span> succeeded in getting several good
    photos of the "scout ship"; These are reproduced in the book, and one of them is also shown at the beginning of this
    article. <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s account also states: <q>It (the "scout ship") was seen and
      photographed by others</q>. Though these "others" are not named in the text, one of them must be Jerrold Baker,
    for a blurred close-up shot of a "scout ship" is given in the photographic section of the book, with the following
    caption: <q>Flying Saucer Passing Low Over Trees: This photo, taken a few moments later (i.e., a few moments after
      <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s series of <time>1952-12-13</time>) was made by Sgt. Jerrold E. Baker with a
      Brownie Kodak camera as the saucer flew away and passed rapidly over the low hill on which he was standing. The
      blurred effect is due to the rapide speed at which the craft was moving?</q>
  </p>
  <p>As if this were not confirmation enough, <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s account is further strengthened by
    the inclusion in the book of sworn statements by each of the 6 people (other than himself) who were present at the
    <time>1952-11-20</time> contact. These affidavits read as follows: <q>I/we the undersigned, do solemnly state that
      I/we have read the account herein of the personal contact between <span class="people">George Adamski</span> and a
      man from another world, brought here in his Flying Saucer "Scout Ship", and that I/we was/were a party to and
      witness to the event as herein recounted.</q>
  </p>
  <p><span class="people">Adamski</span>'s portion of <em>Flying Saucers Have Landed</em> concludes with an appendix,
    which describes a meeting held on <time>1953-06-01</time>, at which flying saucers were discussed by several
    qualified men. The most noteworthy features of this appendix are some remarks attributed to
    <span class="people" title="Albert M. Chop">Al Chop</span>, former Public Information Officer at the
    <a href="/org/us/dod/Pentagone.html">Pentagon</a>, and the following statement attributed to Pev Marley, a cameraman
    for Warner Brothers Studio in Hollywood. Mr. Marley is quoted as having said that
    <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s pictures, if faked, were the cleverest he had ever seen, rivaling a Houdini.
    Marley pointed out that the shadows on these saucers, and also on the ground, correspond to such a remarkable degree
    that they could not be faked, and to fake such pictures would require costly equipment which <span class="people">Adamski</span>
    obviously does not presses and which, even then, would not assure such a result.

  <h2>Some of the Flaws</h2>
  <p>I have done my best to relate the above account without sarcasm or prejudice of any kind, though in view of the
    detailed study I have made of this story. I must admit that I find it difficult to present it without editorializing
    a little here and there. However, if I have made my account too brief to suit those of you who have not yet read
    <em>Flying Saucers Have Landed</em>, it is merely because of limitations of space; and if I have seemed to emphasize
    some phases of the narrative more than others, it is because I now intend to raise an objection to nearly every
    portion of the story as I have presented it above.
  </p>
  <p>There are others besides myself who have studied the <span class="people">Adamski</span> story, and their
    conclusions vary according to their own particular "bent" and also according to how thoroughly and how open-mindedly
    they have studied the evidence. To two of these fellow researchers — namely Mr. Jerrold Baker and Mr. John Pitt of
    Surrey, England — I am deeply indebted to other informants whom I am not at liberty to name. But in all due modesty,
    I must say that to the best of my knowledge very few researchers have made as complete a survey of the
    <span class="people">Adamski</span> tale as I have. I have traveled personally through Arizona and California,
    interviewing all the principals mentioned in the story (with the exception of Mrs. Bailey), and through interviews
    and lengthly correspondence I have made it my business to obtain all possible details concerning the "inside story"
    of <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s portion of <em>Flying Saucers Have Landed</em>. Therefore, I now proceed to
    give you — not opinions — but to the best of my knowledege and ability, <em>facts</em>, fully mindful of the libel
    laws which compel me not to deviate from the truth.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Taking these points more or less in the order of their occurrence in the narrative, the first objection I raise
      is that Mr. Bloom, of the Point Loma Navy Laboratory, stated to me on the phone when I was in San Diego that he
      has been grossly misquoted in <em>Flying Saucers Have Landed</em>. In particular, he claimed to have no knowledge
      whatsover of a saucer landing in Mexico City.
    </li>
    <li>In the book (but omitted in my summary above), is the following statement by <span class="people">Adamski</span>:
      <q>If these (saucers) were secret experimental military devices, I would not be allowed to copyright my
        photographs and send them so publicly through the mails. And I sent a set of them to
        <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB">Wright-Patternson Air Force Base</a>. In the interests of national security
        they would have stopped me, if I was photographing our own secret craft. They never have.</q> This statement is,
      in all probability, true; but the same arguments would apply if <span class="people">Adamski</span> was
      photographing extra-terrestrial craft, if e are to assume that there <em>are</em> extra-terrestrial aircraft in
      our atmosphere, and that the <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> does not want details or proof in regard to
      these objects to be given out to the public. The obvious conclusion is that <span class="people">Adamski</span> is
      not photographing any sort of craft at all, that the <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> knows this, and
      therefore does not bother him <span class="note"><span class="people">Adamski</span> has run into difficulty with "officialdom" only once, as far as I know, and that was for circulating among a group of "intimates" a ridiculous letter purporting to show that certain military officials back up the authenticity of his story and photos</span>.
    </li>
    <li>When I first read <em>Flying Saucers Have Landed</em>, I was impressed by the fact that <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s
      story was backed up by 4 people (the Bailyes and the Williamsons) whom <span class="people">Adamski</span> knew
      only slightly. Although the text does not explicitly say so, I came to the conclusion (as many other readers did,
      no doubt), that these four were impartial, reasonably conservative, well educated people, not prone to indulge in
      hoaxes or to be easily swayed by a hoax perpetrated upon themselves. I learned, however, from my own
      investigations, that all 4 were already ardent "believers" before they made the <time>1952-11-20</time> contact,
      and that none had any particular educational advantages that would qualify them as expert and/or impartial
      observers. In particular, Williamson, though a pleasant enough young man, admits that he has no degree entitling
      himself to be called <q>doctor</q>, even though he allows himself to be called <q>Dr. Williamson</q> throughout
      the book — just as <span class="people">Adamski</span>, among his friends and admirers (though not in the book),
      is known affectionately as <q>professor</q>, without benefit of any degree. Put together, I think these facts add
      up to an entirely new picture of <span class="people">Adamski</span> and his 6 witnesses. When we remember that 2
      of <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s witnesses were close personal friends (one the owner of the property
      where he lives and the other his secretary), and when we find that none of the other 4 can be called either
      impartial or objective, then, I believe, a new light is thrown on the whole situation.
    </li>
    <li>The photographs: This subject has already been partly covered in the discussion at the top of Page 7.
      Incidentally, it is the photo on the right that is the "phony", and the one on the left that is the "genuine"
      "scout ship" photographed by Mr. <span class="people">Adamski</span>. Additional remarks the "genuine" "scout
      ship" photographed by Mr. <span class="people">Adamski</span>. Additional remarks will be made further along
      concerning the photograph bearing Jerrold Baker's name; and indeed, a veritable volume could be written concerning
      the other photographs, some of which appear as "scout ships", others as "mother ships", and still others as mere
      spots of light without any definite form. But perhaps it will suffice here to quote a few of the remarks made by
      <span class="people">Arthur C. Clarke</span> in the <em>Journal of the British Interplanetary Society</em>, <time>1954-03</time>:
      <blockquote>
        <p>Mr. <span class="people">Adamski</span> hobby is photographing flying saucers, and he is undoubtedly the most
          succesful at this interesting art... There are (in the book) several close-ups of space ships, leaving no
          doubt that they are artifacts. The uncanny resemblance (of the "scout ships") to electric light fittings with
          table tennis balls fixed underneath them has already been pointed out... To us, the perspective is all wrong,
          and though this is a qualitative impression perhaps not susceptible to rigorous proof, the pictures seem to be
          of small objects photographed from very close up and not of a large object seen through a telescope. Many
          people, including, we people, Mr. <span class="people">Adamski</span>, do not realize that a large object seen
          through a telescope bringing it to within
          <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">20</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">feet</span></span> away...
        </p>
        <p>We have much more serious comment, however, to make on photograph #3, which purports to show a fleet of
          saucers taking off from the <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/lune">moon</a>. Alas, something has
          gone wrong here. We would kike Mr. <span class="people">Adamski</span> to account for the fact that one of his
          saucers appears to be <em>inside the telescope</em>. This would not be apparent to anyone who was unacquainted
          with lunar geography, but an inspection of the background shows that the line of saucers is not clear of the
          <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/lune">Moon</a>'s edge — as appears at first sight, but extends
          <em>off the field of view on the lens together</em>. Is is odd to say the least that Mr. <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s
          discriminating telescope is able to see a saucer and to ignore the
          <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/lune">Moon</a> shining around it.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Getting back to the "scout ships", I was told by an eminent rocker engineer in Los Angeles that he had
        discovered the letters <q>G.E.</q> for <em>General Electric</em> on the "landing gear" of the "scout ship"
        pictured on page 7. These letters were found by blowing an original print of the photo to several times its
        normal size, and examining it carefully with a magnifying glass. I have every confidence in the integrity of the
        scientist who gave me this information, but it seems to me, on second thought, that even <span class="people">Adamski</span>
        would not make such a crude mistake as this evidence would indicate. I therefore am inclined to believe that the
        "landing gear" are actually ping pong balls rather than light bulbs, though there is room for argument here.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>Disagreement among witnesses: At least one of <span class="people">Adamski</span> of <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s
      6 sworn witnesses no longer upholds the account as presented in the book. Mr. Al Bailey, who is a railroad worker
      in Winslow, Arizona, told me in a personal interview that he did <em>not</em> see the space man with whom
      <span class="people">Adamski</span> allegedly talked, nor did he see the "scout ship" that allegedly landed on the
      desert. He did see the "mother ship", and some flashes of light in the direction where <span class="people">Adamski</span>
      was supposed to be during the contact. To the best of his knowledge, no one else present saw any more than he did.
      Furthermore, a drawing in the book, supposedly made by Alice Wells while watching
      <span class="people">Adamski</span> and the Visitor through binoculars, could not in Bailey's opinion have been
      made from that distance (i.e., about
      <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">1</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="SMI">mile</span></span>), nor <em>was</em> it made that day as far as he
      knows. Although Bailey admits that <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s account is not true in all details, he
      feels that <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s contact may actually have taken place, though he himself cannot
      vouch for it. I therefore feel that, if a hoax was involved, Mr. Bailey was duped rather than being in on it, for
      he further states that he believes that the advance text of the book sent him by
      <span class="people">Adamski</span>, and on the basis of which he made his sworn statement, was not the same text
      actually used in <em>Flying Saucers Have Landed</em>.
      <p>These points are further borne out by a letter from Bailey to Mr. Baker, dated <time>1954-06-01</time>, from
        which I now quote: <q>I am well aware of the placement and disposition of all members of the party that day
          (<time>1952-11-20</time>). <em>I also feel sure that no one saw any more than I did.</em> (italics mine) —
          There is a possible exception and it is this: at the time of returning to the spot where the alleged
          footprints were. Just what transpired then, I have no way of knowing nor did I make any inquiries at the
          time... There is a remote chance that during this interval he too saw the space man... I will no longer place
          myself on record to back up or refute anyone in such a contraversial escapade again with no better proof than
          was mine at that time.</q>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>Mr. <span class="people" title="Albert M. Chop">Al Chop</span>, who, it has been noted, is quoted at length in
      the appendix of the book, told me in personal interview that he is misquoted, and that he has considered suing Mr.
      <span class="people">Adamski</span> because of this fact. Similarly, in a phone conversation with me, Pev Marley
      denied the rumor, circulated by <span class="people">Adamski</span> and a few of his admirers, that Marley had
      blown upon one of <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s "scout ship" photos and found, in the blow-up, the head of
      a man looking out of one of the "portholes".
    </li>
    <li>Burning questions left unanswered by the book: How did the Venusian's footprint turn out so well on desert sand,
      in an area in which, according to a West Coast informant, there had been no rain for several months?
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>In the book (but not in my summary) <span class="people">Adamski</span> says that American aircraft were seen
    overhead on several occasions during the <time>1952-11-20</time> contact. These planes were apparently trying to
    catch the "mother ship" and the "scout ship". Why, therefore, were the saucers not reported by the pilots of these
    aircraft? (If such confirmatory evidence were available, <span class="people">Adamski</span> would have it; and the
    fact that he does not have it, seems to indicate that there were <em>no</em> airplanes overhead that day).
  </p>
  <p>If the space man was indeed from <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus">Venus</a>, how was he able to defy
    every scientific principal by existing so easily and confortably in the
    <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre">Earth</a>'s atmosphere, since it is a well known fact that the
    atmosphere, etc., on <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus">Venus</a> is entirely different than ours? And
    how was the Venusian able to defy every law of probability by looking so similar to earth men?
  </p>
  <p>Why did <em>no one</em> succeed in taking any movies or decent still pictures of the saucers seen during the <time>1952-11-20</time>
    contact?
  </p>
  <p>And last but not least, <em>what</em> was the necessity of <span class="people">Adamski</span> having his
    companions remain at such a great distance during his contact? Could this have been to make it make it easier to
    perpetrate a hoax on some of his friends (those who were not co-conspirators)?

  <h2>The Evidence Presented by Mr. Jerrold Baker</h2>
  <p>Jerrold Baker is a young saucer researcher who, after his discharge from the Army a few years ago, became
    personally acquainted with <span class="people">Frank Scully</span> (author of <em>Behind the Flying Saucers</em>)
    and <span class="people">George Adamski</span>. From <time>1952-11-12/1953-01-12</time>, Baker lived and worked as a
    secretary, chauffeur, and general handyman. Thus, Baker was present during the critical period covered by <em>Flying
      Saucers Have Landed</em> (the reader will recall that <time>1952-11-20</time> and <time>1952-12-13</time> are the
    two important dates in <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s narrative).
  </p>
  <p>I met Jerrold Baker at <span class="people">Scully</span>'s home some time ago, but did not know then of Baker's
    intimate knowledge of the details of the <span class="people">Adamski</span> story. Now, in a letter date <time>1954-09-11</time>,
    Baker writes me the following startling facts:
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>I did <em>not</em> take the Brownie snapshot accredited to me;</li>
      <li>This was <em>not</em> the only Brownie picture taken;</li>
      <li><span class="people">George Adamski</span> was the photographer and the other Brownie pictures were destroyed
        at his request by Lucy McGinnis;
      </li>
      <li>The photograph was not taken on the date indicated (i.e., not on <time>1952-12-13</time>);</li>
      <li>The desert contact was pre-planned and <span class="people">Adamski</span> related the details to me of what
        was to take place there previous to venture;...
      </li>
      <li>Lucy (McGinnis) purchased the plaster of paris in <span class="place">Escondito (California</span>) with me,
        and it was <span class="people">Adamski</span> who carried it (on <time>1952-11-20</time>), not Williamson.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  </p>
  <p>At this point I wish to state that whereas I do not know Mr. Baker well, and therefore cannot be absolutely certain
    of his motives in coming forward at this time, I nevertheless do know this:
  <ol>
    <li>That I have offered Baker no money or other inducement;</li>
    <li>That by admitting that he was duped (as will be noted further along) he is gaining nothing, as far as I can see,
      except the knowledge that through his efforts and mine, the truth on the <span class="people">Adamski</span>
      matter is at last coming to light;
    </li>
    <li>That much of his evidence corresponds with information I have received from other reliable sources, and which I
      therefore readily accept as true;
    </li>
    <li>That no one, other than <span class="people">Adamski</span> and his 6 witnesses, has as agreat a first-hand
      knowledge of the incidents described in <em>Flying Saucers Have Landed</em> as does Mr. Baker.
    </li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <p>Baker's information is contained in a number of letters and other documents that he has kindly lent me. Therefore,
    rather than run the risk of coloring Baker's information by putting it into my own words, I will tell his story
    mainly by quoting from these various documents.
  </p>
  <p>First, here, in part, is a sworn statement made by Mr. Baker on <time>1954-06-24</time>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>To whom it may concern: In a recent book... <em>Flying Saucers Have Landed</em>, an alleged photograph of a
      flying saucer was credited to Sergeant Jerrold E. Baker. I, the undersigned, am the said party... I make this
      statement in hopes of separating facts from fiction, deceit from lies, and the real from the unreal. I did not
      take the alleged photograph accredited to me. The alleged photograph was taken with the Brownie camera along with
      3 or 4 similar photos by Mr. <span class="people">George Adamski</span> on the morning of <time>1952-12-12</time>,
      as indicated (in the book).
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In a letter to me dated <time>1954-11-18</time>, Baker states:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Shortly after beginning work at Palomar Gardens, I had a long discussion with
      <span class="people">George Adamski</span>, in which I tried to point out his slipshod manner of publishing what
      saucer photographs he had taken in the 5 years previous. In the discussion, I suggested that he not be the only
      photographer present during a flight of saucers over Mount Palomar... It was my suggestion that he be located at
      one spot with his telescope and camera while I or any other individual be located at another spot on the property
      with a different type of camera... Much to my amazement, within a week after the suggestion, <span class="people">George Adamski</span>
      early one morning disclosed the fact that he had taken pictures with the Brownie camera, adjacent to his cabin.
      The date of the photography was <time>1952-12-12</time>. I chauffeured Alice Wells to Escondito to purchase the
      week's supply of restaurant articles. On our return, there was a fire on the slopes of Mount Palomar, and we
      stopped at the ranger station to ascertain its location... I insert this to perhaps give you some means of
      substantiating my whereabouts. Alice Wells liked me very much and if anyone would reveal the truth, she would be
      the one, but her admiration for <span class="people">George Adamski</span> proves the greater and I feel she would
      be likely to protect him.
    </p>
    <p>However, there are 2 other people who can provide you with the necessary proof of my claims regarding the
      photographs. They are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Mr. Detwiler (the professional photographer who processed <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s work), who
        must fully recall the dates on which the photographs were presented to him. Secondly, he also developed the
        additional negatives to substantiate the erroneous fact of merely one Brownie photo.
      </li>
      <li>Mr. Hal Nelson, who was and is presently an investigator for the United States Civil Service... Hal was
        present the morning Mr. Detwiler and his wife delivered the said photographs to Palomar Gardens, and can verify
        seeing more than one Brownie snapshot.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here I must interrupt Baker's account for a moment, to state that although I met Mr. Detwiler while I was in
    California, I did not yet know of the contraversy over the Brownie photo, and therefore did not ask him about it.
    However, I did ask Detwiler what he thought, in general, of <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s photographs, and
    his answer was as follows: The he (Detwiler) does no "fakery" in the processing of the photographs, and that he
    receives genuine negatives from <span class="people">Adamski</span>. He went on to day that if <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s
    pictures are not genuine, then the "fakery" in the processing of the photographs, and the he receives genuine
    negatives from <span class="people">Adamski</span>. He went on to say that if <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s
    pictures are not genuine, then the "fakery" on <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s part does not consist of
    retouched negatives, but rather, it consists of the use of models. Detwiler says that he has no way of knowing
    whether <span class="people">Adamski</span> uses models, or whether the photographs are of genuine saucers.
  </p>
  <p>Now back to Baker's account: This time, I quote from a letter from Baker to
    <span class="people">Frank Scully</span>, dated <time>1954-01-31</time>:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <ol type="A">
      <li>He (<span class="people">Adamski</span>) has taken hundreds of photographs. Here are the most astounding...
        photographs obtained this far on the elusive saucers. This man claims he has spent untold hours watching and
        waiting, both day and night, to obtain the pictures (see page 8, seconde paragraph). This is not true. I know
        that he knows exactly when a (space) ship is coming, and is there at the precise instant to snap a picture. It
        is a planned, purposeful action, not the mere chance which he implies. Why the necessity of the deception? Is it
        as he claims? Perhaps yes; but more likely, NO.
      </li>
      <li>Contact with space man on the Desert: Here again, misleading, untrue stories are concocted to have the public
        accept what is supposed to be a fact... It is too purposeful, planned, and with peculiar motives. I was with
        Lucy when the plaster of paris was bought prior to the trip. I purchased the photographic plates myself. And, I
        accidentally heard a tape recorded account of what was to transpire on the desert, who was to go, etc., several
        days before the party left Palomar Gardens. Though this recording was a <q>communication through psychic
          means</q>, the account as presented (in the book) is entirely untrue. Regardless of the reasons presented to
        you or me, the witnesses, or the reading public, its manner of presentation to the public has been misleading
        and false. <span class="note">In another letter, Baker expands on this point: <q>The tape recording I heard was a metaphysical discourse received through Professor Adamski approximately 1 week before the desert contact.
        I had heard one <time>P10M</time> of the tape-recorded talk when Lucy came to the office and advised me not to play the tape recorder.
      From this brief behind-the-scenes listening, I was able to determine that the desert contact was not a mere stab in the dark or a picnic on the desert, but a planned operation.</q></span>
      </li>
      <li>The Brownie Snapshot: You are presently familiar with this episode so I will not have to go into it again.
        However, in talking with this man (Adamski) when we met in town last week, he urged me to continue using my name
        on the picture because <q>You have to enter the back door sometimes to get the truth across.</q> What kind of a
        fool does he think we are, Frank? And actually, what kind of imbiciles are we to pledge our support to such
        stories? Is not all this a corruption of the truth? I say it is! I will not condone it or support it any longer.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The above letter was written on <time>1954-01-31</time>. On <time>1953-11-02</time>,
    <span class="people">Adamski</span>, in an obvious effort to induce Baker to "stay in line", had written to Baker as
    follows:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Now you know that the picture connected with your name is in the book, too, — the one taken by the well with the
      Brownie. And with people knowing that you are interested in flying saucers as you have been and buying the book as
      they are... you could do yourself a lot of good. For you have plenty of knowledge about these things (i.e.
      saucers), whereby you could give lectures in the evenings. There is a demand for this! And you could support
      yourself by the picture in the book with your name. For remember, you are as much publicized in the book as I am,
      as far as the picture is concerned. And having the knowledge you have of these things, you have your break right
      here.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Notice that <span class="people">Adamski</span> does not say <q>the picture in the book which you took</q>, but
    rather <q>the picture in the book with your name</q>. Has not Baker <em>proved</em> his contention right here?
    Furthermore, if the blurred effect in the "Baker photo" is due to the saucer being <em>out of focus</em> rather
    than, as <span class="people">Adamski</span> claims, in motion — then the "saucer" must be <em>less than
      <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">10</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">feet</span></span> from the camera</em>, as anything beyond
    <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">10</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">feet</span></span> is in focus with a Brownie!
  </p>
  <p>Yes, <span class="people">Adamski</span> attempted to bring Baker "back into line", as noted above, but the present
    state of the contraversy can be summarized by the following letter from Baker to
    <span class="people">Desmond Leslie</span> (co-author of <em>Flying Saucers Have Landed</em>), dated <time>1954-08-04</time>.
    After reiterating that he did not take the Brownie photograph, Baker states:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I am fully cognizant that words and accusations which prove unfounded are vain. So, with such an awareness and
      knowledge, I am proceeding to take whatever action I deem congruent with the nature of the <span class="people">Adamski</span>
      fabrications, being confident that sufficient evidence to substantiate my claims is in my possession at this time.
      I readily admit that I fell victim of a hoax. I sustained the blow, and condoned the erroneous stories. But I have
      not supported them in any way, shape, or form. And presently, under existing conditions, I will no longer continue
      to condone the erroneous stories or fabrications of any party connected with flying saucers...
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Finally, here is one more extract from a personal letter written by Baker to a friend of his:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Shortly before his disappearance, Karl Hunrath called a number of people <span class="note">The disappearance of Karl Hunrath and Jack Wilkinson is another interesting story, but outside the scope of the present article.</span>.
      Among these were <span class="people">Frank Scully</span>, Manon Darlaine, and Mrs. Wilkinson... He denied
      <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s pictures as being real. He even told Mrs. Darlaine he saw the model. This I
      cannot confirm or deny. However, I can truthfully state that both Karl and I did see something one morning on our
      way down the (Palomar Gardens) Cafe from our cabin, that closely resembled a skeleton for a saucer mock-up. I was
      a piece of wooden frame in a circular shape with strips of copper, about one inch in width, strung in circles on
      this wooden frame... We both questioned <span class="people">George Adamski</span> about this paraphernalia behind
      his cabin, <em>at which he grew somewhat uneasy</em> (italics mine), and assured us that what we saw was his own
      television antenna. I cannot say one way or the other, that it was or that it wasn't. But it is interesting and
      important considering the mathematical analysis of many astronomers who claim the photos couldn't be of anything
      but a small model.
    </p>

  <p>This same information has been conveyed to me by other reliable informants.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The parade of evidence in regard to <em>Flying Saucers Have Landed</em> could go on almost indefinitely. Although
    admittedly I have used my most sensational material in this article, were it not for limitations of space, I could
    give dozens of other examples, from Baker's files as well as my own, which would show other small and large matters
    of fact on which Mr. <span class="people">Adamski</span> has <q>slipped up</q>. If there is sufficient reader
    demand, I may give some of this additional information in a future issue of <em>Nexus</em>.
  </p>
  <p>In the meanwhile, let us remember that I am not saying — nor is Mr. Baker — that <span class="people">George Adamski</span>'s
    account is entirely untrue. In the final analysis, the true story may be known in its entirety only to
    <span class="people">Adamski</span> himself. All any outsider can do, in regard to what another man claims to have
    seen and done, is to point out flaws in that man's account. However, I do believe that
    <span class="people">Adamski</span>'s narrative contains enough flaws to place in very serious doubt both his
    veracity and his sincerity. Furthermore, I am hoping, in the light of all the previously unpublished facts contained
    in this article, that the reader will be moved to make for himself a careful re-evaluation of the worth of the
    <span class="people">Adamski</span> book.
  </p>
  <p>One final note: On my own part, at least, I am moved by no personal antagonism of any kind toward either
    <span class="people">George Adamski</span>, <span class="people">Desmond Leslie</span>, or any of the other
    principals in this narrative. Ever since my meeting with <span class="people">Adamski</span> about a year ago, I
    have been convinced that he is a kindly man who would do harm to no one. If he has written a fraudulent book, I
    believe that he did so, not so much for his own personal profit, but to put accross, in dramatic form, philosophical
    principles in which he sincerely believes. In any case, his book has entertained thousands, and injured no one. But
    I sincerely feel that if the truth concerning these mysterious flying saucers is ever to be arrived at, someone must
    now and then perform the rather thankless task of sifting away the "saucer fiction" from the "saucer facts". And it
    is with this goal in mind, and no other, that I have written the above account.
