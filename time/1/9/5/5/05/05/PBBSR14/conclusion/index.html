<p>It can never be absolutely proven that "flying saucers" do not exist. This would be true if the data obtained were to
  include complete scientific measurements of the attributes of each sighting, as well as complete and detailed
  descriptions of the objects sighted. It might be possible to demonstrate the existence of "flying saucers" with data
  of this type, IF_ they were to exist.</p>
<p>Although the reports considered in this study usually did not contain scientific measurements of the attributes of
  each sighting, it was possible to establish certain valid conclusions by the application of statistical methods in the
  treatment of the data. Scientifically evaluated and arranged, the data as a whole did not show any marked patterns or
  trends. The inaccuracies inherent in this type of data, in addition to the incompleteness of a large proportion,of the
  reports, may have obscured any patterns or trends that otherwise would have been evident. This absence of indicative
  relationships necessitated an exhaustive study of selected facets of the data in order to draw any valid
  conclusions.</p>
<p>A critical examination of the distributions of the important characteristics of sightings, plus an intensive study of
  the sightings evaluated as UNKNOWN, led to the conclusion that a combination of factors, principally the reported
  maneuvers of the objects and the unavailability of supplemental data such as aircraft flight plans or
  balloon-launching records, resulted in the failure to identify as KNOWNS most of the reports of objects classified as
  UNKNOWNS.</p>
<p>An intensive study, aimed at finding a verified example of a "flying saucer" or at deriving a verified model or
  models of "flying saucers" (as defined on Page 1), led to the conclusion that neither goal could be attained using the
  present data.</p>
<p>It is emphasized that there was a complete lack of any valid evidence consisting of physical matter in any case of a
  reported unidentified aerial object.</p>
<p>Thus, the probability that any of the UNKNOWNS considered in this study are "flying saucers" is concluded to be
  extremely small, since the most complete and reliable reports from the present data, when isolated and studied,
  conclusively failed to reveal even a rough model, and since the data as a whole failed to reveal any marked patterns
  or trends.</p>
<p>Therefore, on the basis of this evaluation of the information, it is considered to be highly improbable that any of
  the reports of unidentified aerial objects examined in this study represent observations of technologi- cal
  developments outside the range of present-day scientific knowledge.</p>
