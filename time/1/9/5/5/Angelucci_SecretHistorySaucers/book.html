<p>Many persons have asked me why the space visitors should have chosen me for contact rather than some other individual
  they considered eminently qualified for such a contact than myself. Why, have they infer, should the space visitors
  have picked so insignificant a non-entity as I for their revelations? <br> In all humility I tell you that I too have
  asked both the space visitors and myself that very question many times. And it is only within recent months that I
  have begun to understand fully just why I was chosen. After you have finished the book, however, you will have the
  answer. It is up to you then to decide weather or not you agree with the saucer beings with their choice of contact.
  <br> Thus I shall begin by telling you something of my early life and the space visitors first contact with me back in
  the year 1946, when I was totally unaware that I first came under observation. <br> My childhood was the usual happy,
  carefree childhood of most American boys. I joined in the less strenuous games, attended school and was fairly good in
  my studies, although I was always frail and in poor health. Fortunately, my family was in fairly comfortable
  circumstances and they and my two indulgent uncles saw to it that I always had the best medical attention available.
  <br> My youthful trouble was diagnosed as "constitutional inadequacy" and its symptoms were great physical weakness,
  lassitude, lack of appetite and malnutrition. Hence I tired very easily and the slightest physical effort often left
  me weak and exhausted. I suffered from severe migraine headaches and as I grew older it seemed at times that every
  nerve and muscle in my body ached with excruciating pain. <br> When I was in the ninth grade the doctors advised that
  I discontinue school and continue my studies at home. This arrangement was highly satisfactory with me, for I have
  always been intensely interested in all branches of science. Ay home I was able to devote my entire time to the study
  of these subjects. <br> With plenty of rest and on a weight-building diet I gained strength and within a year the
  doctors believed I was well enough to return to school. But as my family suffered the financial reverses in the
  meantime, it was decided that it would be best if I went to work for awhile. I heartily approved. My first job was
  with my uncle's flooring and stucco company. He hired me as an estimator salesman as I was not equal to any heavy
  work. I liked the work and enjoyed getting and meeting people. All in all I got along pretty well even though I was
  considered just a kid. In my spare time I continued to study all of the books I could get ahold of on scientific
  subjects. <br> In 1936 I met Mabel Borgianini, an attractive Italian girl who is a direct descendant of the famous
  Borgias. From the first, both of us knew we were meant for each other. Her happy, cheerful disposition helped me to
  keep from brooding over my health and physical inability to accomplish all of the things that I longed to do. It was
  the happiest day of my life when we were married. About a year later our first son, Raymond, was born. and our cup of
  happiness was full. <br> A little later I suffered a complete physical breakdown and was forced to give up my job. My
  weight fell alarmingly from 150 to 103 pounds and I was so weak that I could scarcely sit up. After a number of
  medical examinations and complicated tests, the doctors decided I was suffering from a neurovascular disturbance. They
  prescribed complete rest and continuous medical attention. <br> Thus I entered a new world, a white world of doctors,
  nurses and hospital beds. For eighteen long months I was confined to bed. For my body was racked with excruciating
  pains and I was so utterly exhausted that I could not even read. Medical science was doing everything possible for me,
  but I knew that my doctors didn't believe that I would ever pull through. Frankly, I didn't much care whether I lived
  or died. Life was no longer desirable. To lie day after day on a white hospital cot with a body flayed with pain and
  too exhausted even to think is indeed a living hell. Death, I felt could mean release from pain. Especially was the
  confinement difficult to bear as I had always loved the outdoors, the sparkle of the sunshine, the whisper of the
  leaves in the woods, and the music of the woodland streams. Sometimes I prayed that I might die and escape the pain
  and awful weariness that ached in my muscles. <br> <br> But weeks lengthened into months months and gradually I began
  to improve. Finally I was able too sit up again and then to walk. It was like being reborn. I even began to take an
  interest in my science books once more. At last the joyous day when I was able to leave the hospital and return home.
  All through those long months of confinement the faith and encouragement of my wife and family never failed. Mabel was
  with me through it all and if it hadn't been for her love and understanding I doubt if I would have made it. <br> My
  body was still wracked with pain, but I had to bear that. The good thing was the terrible exhaustion and trembling
  weekness was gone so that I was able to be up and about. Although my family tried to dissuade me, I insisted upon
  going back to work on my old job almost immediately. I had been inactive so long that I wanted more than anything just
  to be busy again. <br> After I returned to work, I took up courses in night school. The old insatiable hunger for
  knowledge was gnawing at my very soul. I realized that science had discovered much, but there were still so many
  things to be learned; so many of nature's secrets yet to be revealed. I was obsessed with learning the true nature of
  the atom; discovering the cure for virus diseases and especially for polio, that most ghastly of all crippling
  diseases. I felt that a satisfactory explanation for the creation and operation of the entire universe was yet to be
  worked out. What was the great mystery of the creation of matter, or the actual orgin of the atom? These and other
  similar enigmas echoed in my brain night day. <br> The field of electricity and electro-magnetic phenomena interested
  me in particular. Probably because from earliest childhood I had an acute fear or phobia about lightning. During an
  electrical storm I suffered not only actual bodily pain, but mental perturbation and distress. Thus I became well
  versed in atmospheric static electricity. <br> I conducted some simple experiments on my own. I noticed that all fowl
  and especially chickens are nervous and apprehensive during an impending thunderstorm. It was obvious from my own
  reactions that they to experienced definite physical symptoms because of atmospheric conditions. Also, I discovered
  chickens are subject to a "range paralysis" which in every respect parallels infantile paralysis in human beings. From
  my studies and experiments in this field I believed I had discovered certain facts that might be highly significant in
  the treatments of polio. In my enthusiasm, I wrote a long detailed letter on the subject to President Franklin
  Roosevelt, who was then in the White House. <br> <br> Returning to my studies and home experiments, I became
  interested in fungi and the atmospheric conditions affecting them. I studied the wild mushrooms and the particular
  atmospheric conditions which resulted in their sudden, erratic growth. From the mushrooms I turned to molds. It was my
  belief that molds are a negative form of life which leech on living matter by an illusive, subtle process of mutation
  . <br> At that time we were well into World War II. Penicillin had been discovered, but it was yet only a magic word
  and a deep mystery to the public. No books or reports were available on the subject. But by then I was familiar with
  the characteristics of fungi. In my experiments I discovered that one of the most common molds could be made to
  produce chemicals indefinitely if kept in proper nutrition and temperature. It was then I decided to see what
  structural changes would occur in the mold aspergillus clavatus in the upper atmosphere. <br> On August 4, 1946 I took
  cultures of the mold in three stages of growth: embryonic, half mature and mature. I placed the molds in baskets and
  attached the baskets to eighteen Navy-type balloons and prepared to send them aloft. But through an unfortunate
  accident the balloons broke away prematurely, carrying the baskets with the molds aloft with no means of retrieving
  them. My long months of strenuous effort and careful planning were hopelessly lost. <br> Heartsick, I sighed heavily
  as I watched the balloons and my precious molds ascending higher and higher into the clear blue sky. I was a perfect
  day, just the kind of weather I had longed for to make my test, but now everything was irreparably lost. <br> My
  family and a number of friends and neighbors were with me watching the experiment. Also, on hand were a reporter and a
  photographer from the Trentonian, the Trenton daily newspaper. Everyone was silent staring into the heavens watching
  the balloons growing smaller as they gained altitude. Everyone there and especially Mabel and my father-in-law knew
  how keenly disappointed I was. Mabel put her arm comfortingly about my shoulders and murmured: "It's all right, Orfeo.
  You can try again." <br> It was then that my father-in-law, Alfred Borgianini, noticed a craft in the sky and called
  out: "Look! There's an airplane, Orfeo. Maybe it will follow your balloons." <br> Everyone there saw the object and it
  was the consensus that it had been attracted to the spot by the group of ascending balloons. But as it hovered and
  circled overhead, we were all soon aware that it was no ordinary airplane. In the first place it maneuvered in an
  amazingly graceful and effortless manner. Then as we gained a clearer view of it, we were startled to see that it did
  not have the familiar outline of any known type of aircraft. It was definitely circular in appearance and glistened in
  the sunshine. We looked at each other in surprise and bewilderment and the photographer tried to get some shots of the
  thing. Mabel exclaimed: "Why, I never saw such an airplane before! It's round and it doesn't have any wings!" <br>
  Everyone agreed and we continued to stare as it gained altitude and appeared to follow after the balloons until it too
  vanished from our sight. For several days afterward we discussed the strange object, but as in the case of most
  mysteries, we forgot all about it within a week or two. Today, however, any one of those persons who were with me that
  day will vouch for the authenticity of that strange craft. <br> Since then I have learned that the occasion of the
  launching of the balloons was the first time I came under direct observation of the extra-terrestrials. Although I
  never then dreamed of the significance of the event, that was their first contact with me. From that moment on for the
  next five years and nine months I remained under constant observation by beings from another world, although I was
  wholly unaware of it. <br> The state police force was appealed to and requested to be on the lookout for the eighteen
  lost balloons and their strange cargo. Also, local radio stations and newspapers publicized the loss of the balloons
  and requested anyone finding or sighting them to report to authorities. But nothing was ever heard about them and to
  all intents the eighteen balloons and the mold cultures vanished. <br> Several days after the loss of the balloons I
  stopped in at the Palmer Physics Laboratory at Princeton University to visit Dr. Dan Davis, head of the Cosmic Ray
  Department. Dr. Davis had always been most friendly toward me and was never too busy to take time out to help me with
  some of the technical problems that were always troubling me. <br> I told Dr. Davis and one of his aides about the
  experimental molds and their loss in the accident with the balloons. Dr. Davis regretted that I had not told him about
  my experiments beforehand, for he said that the laboratory would have been glad to supply the hydrogen gas for the
  experiment and otherwise help to reduce expenses. Also, he said he would have arranged to have the balloons traced by
  the chain of radar stations in the eastern section. <br> Princeto and its environs were literally heaven-on-earth to
  me, for it was one of the important homes of my beloved science. In the vicinity were such great institutions a
  Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the R.C.A. Laboratories, the American Telephone and Telegraph Co.; the
  Institute for Advance Study; the Heyden Chemical Corporation, producers of penicillin. And nearby were Rutgers
  University, E. R. Squibb and Co., Merck and Son and many others. Yes, I loved every inch of New Jersey with its
  marvelous institutions of learning and scientific research. But my love for the state was offset by my uncontrollable
  apprehensions of and physical anguish during the rather violent thunderstorms there. Thus when Mabel began to talk of
  moving to the West Coast where I'd heard there were few, if any, thunderstorms, I was easily persuaded to go along
  with her plans. <br> In November of 1947 my family, consisting of Mabel and I and my two boys, Raymond and Richard,
  started by automobile for Los Angeles. On the trip we stopped at Rochester, Minnesota where I had an appointment at
  the famous Mayo Clinic with Dr. Walter C. Alvarez, the modern Hippocrates of diagnostic medicine. I sincerely
  appreciated my tremendous good fortune at being granted time by this authority in the field of medicine, for many more
  deserving than I have been unable to see this busy man. <br> Despite his fame and his importance in the medical world,
  I found him extremely modest and kindly. After a thorough examination he concluded that my condition was caused by an
  inherent constitutional inadequacy in an extreme degree. It was his opinion that the condition had been induced by a
  childhood attack of trichinosis from eating contaminated, under-cooked pork. He said I was fortunate to have survived
  the acute attack. He advised me to get as much rest as possible and never to engage in work that was not of my choice
  and liking in order to minimize the burden on my weakened constitution and nervous system. <br> At last we arrived in
  the Golden State on the West Coast. Southern California was a delightful new experience for both my family and myself.
  I decided it was paradise indeed when I discovered that it actually was practically free from electrical storms. And
  my boys and Mabel were thrilled with stretches of golden sand at the seashores, the mountains and the continuous
  semi-spring that prevails there at all seasons of the year. <br> We spent five months in California sight-seeing and
  enjoying the sunshine and the wonders of its scenery. At the end of that time we had to return to Trenton, as I had
  some unfinished business to attend to there. But I had purchased a lot in Los Angeles and we planned to return and
  make our permanent home there as soon as possible. <br> For some years I had been working on a thesis titled, "The
  Nature of Infinite Entities" which included chapters on such subjects as Atomic Evolution, Suspension, and Involution;
  Origin of the Cosmic Rays; Velocity of the Universe, etc. While I was in Trenton I had the thesis published entirely
  at my own expense and mailed copies to various universities and individual scientists working on fundamental research.
  Of course I realized at the time it was presumptuous of me, but I was completely carried away with my tremendous
  enthusiasm for ideas which I believed I understood but could not properly formulate because of lack of technical
  training. <br> It was my deep and abiding hope that some one of the scientists might understand what I was driving at
  and work out the technical and mathematical angles. Some of the men were interested, but none as far as I know ever
  exerted the effort on the theories that I had hoped they might. But at least I was satisfied that I had done my best
  considering the limited circumstances of my education. I was content to let the matter rest. It was obvious science
  had no need of me, a rank and presumptuous amateur. I must remain mute, an orphan of science! <br> We were all happy
  to return to Los Angeles and settle down in our new home. There I went into business with my father. But from the
  first we encountered vicissitudes on every side. For three long, difficult years we struggled along trying to make a
  go of it, but monopolies and stiff competition made the going so rough that we were finally forced to close down the
  business. <br> The temptation was great to return to the security of Trenton where material comfort and a small
  fortune awaited us if we would make our home there. But Mabel and the boys loved Southern California. As far as I am
  concerned, security has never been of great importance in my world of the atom, the electron and the photon. Also,
  there were still those electric storms to reckon with. To an electrophobe like myself, this aspect is always of
  primary consideration. So we decided to forget security and gamble on keeping our home and making a go of it in Los
  Angeles where we were all content. <br> This was in the year 1948and the flying saucers were then making headlines
  from time to time. But I was completely disinterested in the phenomenon. Like many other persons, I thought the
  saucers were some new type of aircraft being secretly developed here in the United States. I figured the information
  would come out in good time. <br> For several months I worked as manager of the Los Feliz Club House. In my spare time
  I endeavored to write a motion picture script. I was more of a hobby than anything else. I didn't really expect the
  script to be accepted as I'd had no writing experience. As the idea of space travel was quite popular in the films
  then, I concentrated on a story about an imaginary trip to the moon. Several studios were interested in the finished
  manuscript, but it was never made into a motion picture. <br> When the club house where I was employed was finally
  leased to a large organization, I made application for work at the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation plant at Burbank,
  California. The application was approved and I went to work for Lockheed on April 2, 1952, in the metal fabrication
  department. <br> After about six weeks in Metal Fabrication I was transferred to the Plastics Unit at Lockheed. Since
  plastics had always interested me, I was pleased with the change. I was one of a three-man crew working on radomes, or
  plastic and glass housings for the radar units of the F-94C and F-94B Starfire jet aircraft. I liked my fellow
  workers, Dave Donnegan and Richard Butterfield. Both were honest sincere, hardworking typical young Americans. They
  had their feet firmly on the ground and although interested on new ideas and scientific developments, they were
  strictly on the material plane and not interested in abstractions. <br> I was fortunate indeed to have two such men to
  cushion the shock of the fantastic chain of events in which I was so soon and unexpectedly to be involved. As I look
  back now it appears that an occult power of some sort had neatly arranged every smallest detail in advance including
  the particular type of job I was in as well as the two men who were to be closest to me through all of my incredible
  experiences. urs was the swing shift. The unusual hours appealed to me as well as the excitement of the new work and
  the motley assortment of people at the plant. But I did not know then what infinitely strange destiny gate held in
  store for me. <br> <br> Chapter I <br> THE DISK FROM ANOTHER WORLD <br> <br> Friday, May 23, 1952, was an ordinary day
  in Burbank, California insofar as I was concerned. I got up at my usual time, worked around the yard for a few hours
  and later stopped in at the Drive-In snack bar. After several cups of coffee and an exchange of good-natured banter
  with some of the customers, I left and went to my job at the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation plant. <br> Things went
  along well enough during the earlier part of the evening, but about 11 o'clock I began to feel ill. An odd prickling
  sensation was running through my hands and arms and up into the back of my neck. I had a slight heart palpitation and
  my nerves were on edge. I felt just as I always do before a bad electrical storm. As the familiar symptoms increased I
  went outside expecting to find heavy threatening clouds, but the night was exceptionally clear and the stars were
  bright. <br> Puzzled, I went to work wondering what was wrong with me. By 12:30 A.M., when the quitting whistle
  sounded, I was so exhausted I could scarcely stand; it would be a relief to get home and into bed. I took my car from
  the Lockheed parking lot and headed southeast on Victory Boulevard toward home. <br> I became increasingly conscious
  of nervous tension as I drove. I sensed a force of some kind about me. Never in all of my similar illnesses had I
  experienced such peculiar symptoms There was no pain, yet I felt as though I might die at any moment. The prickling
  sensation had increased and spread to my arms, legs and up into my scalp. <br> Frightened, I wondered if an old
  illness was returning upon me. Was I going to be confined to my bed again with the terrible debility and excruciating
  pain of the "constitutional inadequacy" of my schoolboy days? The dread symptoms were certainly there. <br> At Alameda
  Boulevard I stopped for a traffic signal. It was then I noticed that my eyesight was glazed and the sounds of traffic
  were oddly muffled and far-away as though my hearing was also affected. I decided that I had better stop at one of the
  all-night cafes and have a cup of coffee. But at the thought all of my alarming symptoms increased. I forgot the idea
  of a cup of coffee. My sole and overwhelming desire was to get home as fast as I could. <br> I continued on Victory
  Boulevard toward home. I had the illusion that the night was growing brighter as though enveloped in a soft golden
  haze. Directly ahead and slightly above my line of vision I saw a faintly red-glowing oval-shaped object. At first it
  was so dim I had to stare at it to be certain it was really there. But gradually it increased in brilliance. It was
  about five times as large as the red portion of a traffic light. Nervously I rubbed my eyes; something was wrong with
  my vision! But the thing remained there; not sharp and clearly defined, but fuzzily luminous, definitely oval-shaped
  and deep red in color. <br> I continued on Riverside Drive directly toward the object, but it appeared to be receding
  from me so that I remained relatively the same distance from it. As it was almost one o'clock in the morning there was
  little traffic on the road. Apparently no one else had noticed the object as I saw no cars stopped to investigate. I
  wondered if I also would have missed it above the glare of the headlights if my strange symptoms had not drawn my eyes
  to it. <br> I drove across the bridge over the Los Angeles River with the object still in view. Just the other side of
  the bridge, to the right of the highway, is a lonely, deserted stretch of road called Forest Lawn Drive. The object
  stopped and hovered over the intersection. As I drew near, it gained in brilliance and its red color grew deeper and
  more glowing. Simultaneously, the physical symptoms I was experiencing became more acute. I was aware of a tingling
  sensation of pain and numbness in my arms and legs that reminded me of contact with an electrical current. <br> Now
  the disk veered sharply to the right off the highway and began moving slowly along Forest Lawn Drive. For the first
  time it occurred to me that the fantastic thing could be one of those flying saucers I had read about. I turned my car
  onto Forest Lawn Drive and followed the object. <br> About a mile further along the disk swerved to the right, away
  from the road, and hung motionless over an unfenced field some distance below the road level. I drove off the pavement
  about thirty feet to the edge of the declivity. From there the glowing red dick was directly in front of me and only a
  shoret distance away. As I watched it in bewilderment it pulsated violently; then shot off into the sky at a 30- or
  40-degree angle and at very great speed. High in the sky to the west it decelerated abruptly, hung for a moment; then
  accelerated and disappeared like a meteor. <br> But just before the glowing red orb vanished, two smaller objects came
  from it. These objects were definitely circular in shape and of a soft, fluorescent green color. They streaked down
  directly in front of my car and hovered only a few feet away. I judged each to be about three feet in diameter.
  Hanging silently in the air like iridescent bubbles their green light fluctuated rhythmically in intensity. <br> Then,
  apparently coming from between those two eerie balls of green fire, I heard a masculine voice in strong,
  well-modulated tones and speaking perfect English. <br> Because of the nervous tension I was under at that moment,
  amounting almost to a state of shock, it is impossible for me to give a verbatim account of the conversation which
  followed. The invisible speaker obviously was endeavoring to choose words and phrases which I could understand, but
  there were several things which even now are not clear to me. I can only make a poor approximation of the gist of his
  words. <br> I do, however, remember the first words spoken which were: "Don't be afraid, Orfeo, we are friends!" Then
  the voice requested that I get out of my car and "Come out here." Mechanically, I pushed open the car door and got
  out. I didn't feel fear, but I was so weak and shaky that I could scarcely stand. I leaned against the front fender of
  my car and looked at the twin pulsating circular objects hovering a shor distance in front of me. <br> The glowing
  disks created a soft illumination, but I could see no person anywhere. I remember vaguely that the voice spoke again
  calling me by my full name in words of greeting. It further stated that the small green disks were instruments of
  transmission and reception comparable to nothing developed on earth. Then the voice added that through the disks I was
  in direct communication with friends from another world. <br> There was a pause and I dimly remember thinking that I
  should say something, but I was stunned into utter silence. I could only stare in fascination at those fantastic balls
  of green fire and wonder if I had lost my mind. <br> When the voice spoke again I heard these startling words: "Do you
  remember your eighteen balloons and the mold cultures that you lost in the skies back in New Jersey, Orfeo? <br> I was
  astounded to hear the strange voice recalling an incident out of the past which had happened so long ago that I had
  almost forgotten it. "Yes.... yes sir, I do!" <br> "Do you also remember the strange, wingless craft that appeared to
  be observing your activities?" <br> Suddenly the entire scene came back to me crystal clear in memory. I remember
  Mabel, my wife, my father-in-law and our friends and neighbors with me as we stared at that strange, disk-shaped
  object in the sky. I recalled how the object had appeared to follow the balloons bearing my precious cultures a
  Aspergillus Clavatus mold. I had been quite an experimenter in those days. It was then it dawned upon me that the
  fluorescent disks were similar in shape and behaved in the same erratic manner as had that mysterious craft back in
  New Jersey. The only difference was that I had seen the craft in daylight when it glistened like metal whereas the
  disks glowed in the darkness. <br> "You do remember us, Orfeo," the golden voice stated. "We were observing your
  efforts that day as we have watched you since then." <br> All traces of fear left me at these words, but I could not
  help but wonder what it all meant. Suddenly I realized that I was feeling very thirsty. <br> As though in response to
  my thought, the voice said: "Drink from the crystal cup you will find on the fender of your car, Orfeo." <br>
  Astonished at his words, I glanced down and saw a kind of goblet on the car fender. It glistened in the soft light.
  Hesitantly I lifted it to my lips and tasted the drink. It was the most delicious beverage I had ever tasted. I
  drained the cup. Even as I was drinking a feeling of strength and well-being swept over me and all of my unpleasant
  symptoms vanished. <br> "Oh thank you , sir," I said as I placed the empty cup back on the fender of my car only to
  see it disappear. <br> At that moment another incredible phenomenon began to occur. The twin disks were spaced about
  three feet apart. Now the area between them began to glow with a soft green light which gradually formed into a
  luminous three-dimensional screen as the disks themselves faded perceptibly. <br> Within the luminous screen there
  appeared images of the heads and shoulders of two persons, as though in a cinema close-up. One was the image of a man
  and the other of a woman. I say man and woman only because their outlines and features were generally similar to men
  and women. But those two figures struck me as being the ultimate of perfection. There was an impressive nobility about
  them; their eyes were larger and much more expressive and they emanated a seeming radiance that filled me with wonder.
  Even more confusing was the troubling thought somewhere in the back of my mind that they were oddly familiar.
  Strangely enough, the projected images of the two beings appeared to be observing me. For they looked directly at me
  and smiled; then their eyes looked about as though taking in the entire scene. <br> <br> I had the uncomfortable
  feeling as they studied me that they knew every thought in my mind; everything I'd ever done and a vast amount about
  me that I didn't even know myself. Intuitively, I sensed that I stood in a kind of spiritual nakedness before them.
  Also, I seemed to be in telepathic communication with them, for thoughts, understandings and new comprehension's that
  would have required hours of conversation to transmit, flashed through my consciousness. <br> Before those two
  incredible Beings I felt that I was only a shadow of the shining reality I sensed them to be. It is difficult to
  express my feelings in words, for my understanding of them was gained primarily through intuitive perception. <br>
  After several moments the two figures faded and the luminous screen vanished. Again the two disks flamed into
  brilliant green fire. <br> Trembling violently from weakness and cold perspiration, I was on the point of blacking out
  when I heard the voice again. It was more kindly than ever as it said something about my being understandably
  confused; but it assured me I would understand everything that had happened later on. Also, I remember these words:
  "The road will open, Orfeo." <br> I didn't understand. Instead the thought flashed through my mind: "Why have they
  contacted me; a humble aircraft worker-a nobody?" <br> The voice replied: "We see the individuals of Earth as each one
  really is, Orfeo, and not as perceived by the limited senses of man. The people of your planet have been under
  observation for centuries, but have only recently been re-surveyed. Every point of progress in your society is
  registered with us. We know you as you do not know yourselves. Every man, woman and child is recorded in vital
  statistics by means of our recording crystal disks. Each of you is infinitely more important to us than to your fellow
  Earthlings because you are not aware of the true mystery of your being." <br> "From among you we singled out three
  individuals who, from the standpoint of our higher vibrational perception, are best fitted for establishing contact.
  All three are simple, humble and presently unknown persons. Of the other two, one is living in Rome and the other in
  India. But for our first contact with the people of Earth, Orfeo, we have chosen you." <br> "We feel a deep sense of
  brotherhood toward Earth's inhabitants because of an ancient kinship of our planet with Earth. In you we can look far
  back in time and recreate certain aspects of our former world. With deep compassion and understanding we have watched
  your world going through its 'growing pains'. We ask that you look upon us simply as older brothers." <br> The voice
  continued, speaking rather rapidly. It stated that they were well aware that the flying saucers had been treated
  humorously by most people - as it was meant they should be. In this way they wanted the people of Earth to become only
  gradually aware of them and grow accustomed to the idea of space visitors. It was best that we receive them lightly at
  first for the sake of our own stability! <br> The voice stated that the disks were powered and controlled by tapping
  into universal magnetic forces; thus their activated molecules received and converted energy inherent in all the
  universe. It further explained that the complexities of the apparently simple structure of their disks were so great
  that to an Earthing a saucer would be considered as having "synthetic brains", although each one is to a degree under
  the remote control of a Mother Ship. Also, most of the saucers, as well as the space craft of other planetary
  evolutions, are of a circular shape and vary in size from a few inches to hundreds of feet in diameter. <br> A disk,
  the voice continued, is able not only to relay whatever is transmitted to it from a Mother Ship, but also it records
  precisely all visual, auditory and telepathic impressions that come within the scope of the disk. These impressions
  are relayed to the Mother Ship where they are permanently recorded upon what Earthlings would popularly term
  "synthetic crystal brains". Thus for centuries had been recorded a detailed account of Earth's civilization and the
  spiritual evolution of individual persons. <br> The voice also stated that in addition to the remotely controlled
  saucers there also existed space ships, some of which had been seen by Earthlings. It was further explained that the
  Etheric entities in reality had no need of space-craft of any type and when they were employed by them it was only for
  purposes of material manifestation to men. <br> I distinctly remember the voice making some such statement as this:
  "Interplanetary ships and saucers of various material densities can approximate the speed of light. This seems
  impossible to you only because of a natural principle which has not yet been discovered by your scientists. Also, the
  Speed of Light is the Speed of Truth. This statement is presently unintelligible to Earth's peoples, but is a basic
  cosmic axiom. <br> "Approaching the speed of light, the Time dimension, as known upon Earth, becomes non-existent;
  hence in this comparatively new dimension there are incredibly rapid means of space travel which are beyond man's
  comprehension. Also, within the Records of Light are to be found a complete history of Earth and of every entity which
  has incarnated upon it. <br> Many of the saucers - of highly attenuated densities of matter - were invisible to
  Earthly eyes and could only be detected by radar. Also, any of the saucers could be rendered invisible at any time, or
  could be disintegrated by either explosion or implosion. Thus Earthlings had seen some apparently burst in a blue or
  white flash while others seemed simply to vanish in the air. <br> I remember wondering about Captain Mantell and
  several others who believed they had contacted the saucers. In reply to my thought I heard these words: "Captain
  Mantell was not pursuing the planet Venus. He was endeavoring to overtake and capture one of the remotely controlled
  disks. His death was absolutely unavoidable! <br> "We wish to tell Earth's people that visitors from other planets
  occasionally visit Earth's dense, heavy, gaseous atmosphere. All are of kindly intent and none will harm man. All
  intelligence's capable of space travel can read thoughts and see emotions. <br> Man believes himself civilized, but
  often his thoughts are barbaric and his emotions lethal. We do not say this as criticism, but state it only as fact.
  Thus it is best to approach all planetary visitors with friendly, welcoming thoughts!" <br> As I listened to his words
  I wondered why these incredible beings hadn't landed several space ships at one of our large airports and thus
  convinced the world simply and quickly of their reality. <br> In answer, I heard these words: "That would be the way
  of the entities of your Earth, Orfeo, but it is not our way. Primarily because we function in dimensions unknown to
  man and hence interpret all things differently. Also, because there are planetary and cosmic laws as implacable as the
  natural laws of Earth. <br> "Cosmic law actively prevents one planet from interfering with the evolution of any other
  planet. In other words, Orfeo, Earth must work out its own destiny! We will do everything in our power to aid the
  people of Earth, but we are definitely and greatly limited by cosmic law. It is because the life evolution in its
  present stage of material advancement upon Earth is endangered that we have made our re-appearance in the atmosphere
  of your planet. The danger is far greater that Earth's people realize. The 'enemy' prepares in vast numbers and in
  secret." <br> For a moment the voice was still and then it said gently: "Among the countless other worlds in the
  cosmos, Orfeo, the children of Earth are as babes, ultimate of knowledge. Among the worlds of the universe are many
  types of spiritual and physical evolutions. Each form of intelligent life adapts itself to the physical conditions
  prevalent upon its home planet. Most of these evolutions exist in more highly attenuated forms of matter than upon
  Earth. But the majority are rather similar to man in appearance. There is a definite reason for this being so. In
  reality, we are Earth's older brothers and thus we will aid Earth's people insofar as they, through free will, will
  permit us to do so." <br> As I listened to that kind, gentle voice I began to feel a warm, glowing wave of love enfold
  me; so powerful that it seemed as a tangible soft, golden light. For a wonderful moment I felt infinitely greater,
  finer and stronger than I knew myself to be. It was as though momentarily I had transcended mortality and was somehow
  related to these superior beings. <br> "We'll contact you again, Orfeo, the voice said. "But for now, friend, it is
  goodnight." <br> The two shimmering green disks faded almost out: then I heard a low hum as they flamed brilliantly
  into glowing green fire and shot up into the sky in the direction taken earlier by the larger red disk. In an
  incredibly short time they too had vanished, leaving me standing alone by my car. <br> Bewilderment, incredulity,
  shock and stark fear flooded over me - sudden conviction that I had lost my mind and gone raving mad. What I had
  witnessed, I felt, just couldn't have happened. <br> I raised my numbed hand and it was trembling violently. I saw by
  my watch that it was almost two o'clock in the morning. I climbed shakily into my car and kicked the starter. Panic
  was mounting in me. I twisted the steering wheel, gunned the engine and made a sharp, fast U turn to get back onto the
  road. The tires screamed and the car lurched. <br> I wanted to get home quickly. I wanted to get back to the world of
  sane reality. I wanted someone to assure me I wasn't going mad. <br> I drove with only a single objective in my mind -
  to get home! When finally I made the turn onto Glendale Boulevard and saw the lights of my apartment I breathed a
  heavy sigh of relief; no place had ever looked so good to me! <br> I left the car in the driveway and ran into the
  house. My wife was waiting up, worried and anxious because I was so late. <br> "Orfeo, what's the matter? What's
  wrong? You're white as a sheet!" <br> I stood staring at her, unable to speak. <br> She came to me and grasped my
  hand. "Orfeo, you're sick! I'm going to call a doctor." <br> I put my arms around her. I wanted only to feel her close
  to me and for the moment to try not to think of what I had been through. <br> She pleaded with me to tell her what had
  happened. <br> "Tomorrow - maybe tomorrow, Mae, I can tell you...." <br> Finally we got to bed, but it was almost dawn
  before I drifted into a troubled half sleep. <br> <br> Chapter II <br> I TRAVEL IN A FLYING SAUCER <br> <br> I spent
  nearly all day Saturday in bed. The shock of my fantastic experience was so great that I found it difficult to get
  back to actualities. I kept having the feeling that the world I knew was a phantom world inhabited only by shadows.
  <br> It was not until Sunday that I could bring myself to tell my wife what had happened to me. I was afraid she would
  think I had lost my mind. Thus it was with relief I heard her say: "If you say it happened like that, Orfeo, I believe
  you. You've always told me the truth. But this thing is so strange and frightening - and you looked so deathly white
  when you came in." <br> I could only put my arms around her as I replied: "It scares me too, Mabel - I don't know what
  to think!" <br> Sunday afternoon I took my twelve year old son Richard and drove back to the spot on Forest Lawn Drive
  where I had seen the disks. There in the loose dirt I found the deep skid marks the tires of my car had made Friday
  night. <br> Richard looked at me curiously and asked what I was looking for. I pointed to the skid marks and told him
  that was the spot where I had seen what could only have been a flying saucer. Richard stared incredulously. But dad, I
  thought you always laughed at people who believed in those things." <br> "You"re right, son," I replied. "But that was
  only because I didn't know any better. Friday night I saw three of the saucers from this very spot." <br> Richard's
  eyes widened with interest. Then he began shooting questions at me so fast that I had to ask him to slow down. But I
  was glad he did not doubt my word. <br> Seeing those skid marks where I had gunned my car in panic to get away from
  the eerie spot assured me of the reality of my experience. I was convinced that I had been in contact with beings from
  another world. <br> Monday night I went back to my swing-shift job at Lockheed. It felt good to be back at work again!
  The friendly banter, laughter and jokes of my co-workers were just what I needed. <br> Beyond my family I told no one
  of that first experience, as I knew I would be ridiculed. In fact even at home very little was said about the saucers
  or my experience, for the subject invariably upset my wife and filled her with such apprehension that even the boys
  refrained from talking much about it. <br> But when I was alone I thought long and often about those incredible beings
  from that other world. The voice had promised: "We'll contact you again, Orfeo." I wondered when they would get in
  touch with me again and how? Had they meant soon - or would it be months or even years? These and hundreds of similar
  questions clamored in my mind. <br> I wondered if I was under constant observation by them. If so, I thought that
  through telepathy I could signal them to return. ne night I went back to that lonely spot on Forest Lawn Drive and
  tried to establish telepathic communication. But it was useless! No glowing red disk appeared - only the night and the
  empty skies that gave back no answer. <br> Weeks passed and still no further sign from them. Doubts began to trouble
  me. Time dulled the memory of that night and I began to wonder if my experience had actually been real after all. <br>
  Then early in July there began a fresh flood of well-authenticated sightings of saucers in the skies over Southern
  California. Local newspapers carried banner headlines announcing FLYING SAUCERS OVER LOS ANGELES! Some people were
  convinced we had interplanetary visitors and looked for mass landings at any moment. <br> Later in the month
  additional sensational sightings were reported from many other States. It seemed the skies were filled with the
  baffling mystery objects that defied all natural laws and behaved more like phantoms than material realities. As I
  avidly read each new account I became convinced anew that I knew the secret of the flying saucers. But I longed for
  more knowledge. I hoped and prayed for another contact with those incredible beings I had seen so briefly that Friday
  night. <br> July 23, 1952 I didn't go to work. I wasn't feeling well and believed I was coming down with the flu. I
  was in bed all day, but in the evening I felt a little better and thought a walk in the fresh air would be good for
  me. <br> I walked down to the snack-bar at the Los Feliz Drove-In theatre, several blocks from the eleven unit
  apartment-court where we live. The small cafe has a warm, friendly atmosphere and it gave my spirits a big lift to
  listen to the small talk and friendly ribbing. Because of the many recent newspaper reports, the talk turned to flying
  saucers. <br> Ann, one of the waitresses laughingly remarked that she couldn't get enough sleep as her husband
  insisted upon staying up most of the night watching the sky with binoculars trying to get a glimpse of a saucer. This
  brought on a round of flying saucer jokes and everyone was laughing, including myself. The fact that I could laugh
  indicates that I had pretty well gotten over the shock of my experience. <br> When I'd finished my coffee I left the
  snack-bar and started home. It was a little after ten O'clock. Beyond the theatre is a lonely stretch of vacant lots.
  The place is eerie and forbidding at night, for huge concrete buttresses rise from it supporting the Hyperion Avenue
  Freeway Bridge several hundred feet overhead. The bridge cast dense, oblique shadows down below making it a shadowed
  no-man's land. <br> As I crossed the vacant lots in the deep shadows of the bridge a peculiar feeling came over me.
  Instantly I remembered that sensation - the tingling in my arms and legs! I looked nervously overhead but saw nothing.
  The feeling became more intense and with it came the dulling of consciousness I had noted on that other occasion. <br>
  Between me and the bridge I noticed a misty obstruction. I couldn't make out what it was. It looked like an Eskimo
  igloo - or the phantom of an igloo. It seemed like a luminous shadow without substance. I stared hard at the object.
  It was absolutely incredible - like a huge, misty soap bubble squatting on the ground emitting a fuzzy, pale glow.
  <br> The object appeared to be about thirty feet high and about equally wide at the base, so it wasn't a sphere. As I
  watched, it seemed to gain substance and to darken perceptibly on the outside. Then I noticed it had an aperture, or
  entrance like the door to an igloo, and the inside was brilliantly lighted. <br> I walked toward the thing. I had
  absolutely no sense of fear; rather a pleasant feeling of well-being. At the entrance I could see a large circular
  room inside. Hesitating only an instant I stepped into the object. <br> I found myself in a circular, domed room about
  eighteen feet in diameter. The interior was made of an ethereal mother-of-pearl stuff, iridescent with exquisite
  colors that gave off light. There was a reclining chair directly across from the entrance. It was made of that same
  translucent, shimmering substance - a stuff so evanescent that it didn't appear to be material reality as we know it.
  <br> No voice spoke, but I received the strong impression that I was to sit in the chair. In fact, a force seemed to
  be impelling me directly toward it. As I sat down I marveled at the texture of the material. Seated therein, I felt
  suspended in air, for the substance of that chair molded itself to fit every surface or movement of my body. <br> As I
  leaned back and relaxed, that feeling of peace and well-being intensified. Then a movement drew my attention toward
  the entrance. I saw the walls appeared to be noiselessly moving to close the aperture to the outside. In a few seconds
  the door had vanished, with no indication that there had ever been an entrance. <br> The closing of that door cut me
  off entirely from the outside world. For an uncomfortable moment I felt utterly alone - lost to my family and friends.
  But almost immediately a pleasant warmth passed over me giving me once more that feeling of peace and security. I
  breathed deeply and found the air cool and fresh. Vaguely I wondered what was going to happen next. <br> Then I
  thought I heard a humming sound. At first it was almost inaudible, but it grew to a steady, low-pitched rhythm that
  was more like a vibration than a hum. <br> Next I was aware that my body seemed to be sinking more deeply into the
  soft substance of the chair. I felt as though a gentle force was pushing perculiarly pleasant sensation that put me
  into a kind of semi-dream state. <br> While the humming sound increased I noticed that the room was darkening as
  though a heavy shadow was engulfing the room in twilight. As the light diminshed I began to grow apprehensive. I had
  the realization of how alone and helpless I actually was. For a bad moment I was on the edge of panic in the tightly
  sealed, darkening room. <br> Then... I heard music! It seemed to be coming from the walls. I couldn't believe my ears
  when I recognized the melody as my favorite song, "Fools Rush In". The panic within me subsided for I realized how
  safe I was with them - thy who knew my every thought, dream and cherished hope! <br> Reassured, I settled back to
  enjoy the music. In a few seconds the interior of the room began to grow light again. Soon it was more brilliantly
  lighted than ever. It was at that moment that I noticed a glittering piece of metal on the floor of the craft. It was
  the shape and about the size of a quarter. I reached down and picked it up. It was different from any kind of metal I
  had ever seen, for it seemed almost to be alive in my hand. It quivered and began to glow almost like a live coal; yet
  it remained at the same ytemperature as my body. Now I noticed that the piece of metal was diminishing in size. It was
  as though some mysterious kind of sublimation or degeneration was taking place before my eyes. Could it be that
  contact with my hand was causing the substance to dissipate in the air? I placed it back upon the floor of the craft.
  There it ceased to quiver and the odd glow was no longer apparent. <br> I leaned back in the chair and noticed my
  soiled, faded work clothes which I had worn when I went to the snack-bar. The coarse fabric appeared crude and
  glaringly out of place in the exquisite, shimmering mother-of-pearl room. <br> "Where are they taking me?" I wondered,
  as I half listened to the music. For I was certain the the craft I was in must be moving. Were they taking me to their
  world, or was I going to spend eternity lost in space in that pearly igloo? <br> While I was still pondering these
  questions I felt the push against the surface of by body lessen, then cease altogether. The music stopped playing and
  humming vibration in the floor died away too. I was certain that whatever type of motive power was used was housed
  somewhere below the floor as the faint vibratory hum definitlely came from there. <br> Then smoothly and noiselessly
  the chair made a quarter turn toward the wall. Even as much as I trusted my unseen friends I was a little frightened
  at this. Tensely I waited, gripping the arms of the chair. Directly in front of me a circular opening appeared in the
  wall about six feet in diameter, but everything appeared hazy through it. <br> As I stared, the lights inside
  darkened. Then either the entire craft or the seat turned slightly more to the left and the strange window widened
  about three more feet. I saw a huge globe surrounded with a shimmering rainbow. I trembled as I realized I was
  actually looking upon a planet from somewhere out in space. The planet itself was of a deep, twilight-blue intensity
  and the irridescent rainbow surrounding it made it appear like a dream vision. I couldn't see it all, for a portion at
  the bottom of the sphere was cut off by the floor line. <br> Now I heard that voice I remembered so well. "Orfeo, you
  are looking upon Earth - your home! From here, over a thousand miles away in space, it appears as the most beautiful
  planet in the heavens and a haven of peace and tranquillity. But you and your Earthly brothers know the true
  conditions there. <br> As I listened to the tender, gentle intonations of that wonderful voice and overwhelming sense
  of sadness came over me. I felt tears in my eyes - I who had not know the relief of tears since I was a small boy. My
  heart was so full of emotion that tears were the only possible expression. They flowed unheeded down my cheeks. I was
  not ashamed for the tears seemed somehow to cleanse and purify me and to break down the hard, unfeeling, crystalized
  shell of The Reasoner that I had come to pride myself upon being. <br> The voice said softly: "Weep, Orfeo. Let tears
  unblind your eyes. For at this moment we weep with you for Earth and her Children. For all of its apparent beauty
  Earth is a purgatorial world among the plants evolving intelligent life. Hate, selfishness and cruelty rise from many
  parts of it like a dark mist. <br> The words brought fresh tears to my eyes as I thought of conditions on Earth and
  how they must appear to these perfected, compassionate beings who had extra-dimensional sight. <br> There was wsilence
  for a moment. Then I noticed that the room was apparently revolving away from Earth. Gradually the heavens came into
  view - an awesome, breathtaking sight from that tiny craft. All space appeared intensely black and the stars
  incrediably brilliant, set like jewels against black velvet - large, small; single and clustered. I felt lost in a
  strangely beautiful, ethereal world of celestial wonder. <br> All was brooding silence, order and indescribable
  beauty. A deep feeling of reverence possed me. I had never been an actively religious man, but in that moment I knew
  God as a tangible, immutable Force that reached to the furthest depths of Time and Eternity. And I felt assurance that
  the beings in whose care I was at that moment were close to the Infinite Power. <br> For a moment there was deep
  silence. Then as I wiped away the tears I saw a fantastic object coming slowly into view through the "window". It
  resembled a dirigible except that it was definitely flattened at the bottom.. It emerged gradually into view from the
  right. <br> I studied it closely, wondering at its composition. It did not appear to be metallic like an airplane, but
  was definitely crystalling and give it illusion of transparency. Its light properties definitely suggested perfect
  crystal alloyed throughout. I surmised it might be some sort of crystal-metal-plastic combination. When the entire
  ship was in view it appeared to be at least 1000 feet long and about 90 feet thick, but it could have been a great
  deal larger for there was no way to judge how close I was to it. <br> I stared fascinated at the half-ethereal "ship",
  scarcely conscious that I was again hearing music. But as my ears caught a startling, unfamiliar, strain, I listened
  intently to music such as I had never heard or could imagine. It is beyond description, for it was not music as we
  know it, nor was it played to our musical scale. It was strange, haunting drifts of melody that brought visions of
  star galaxies and planets spinning in notes of perfect harmony. <br> The voice spoke again: "Brother of Earth, each
  entity of your planet is divinely created and immortal. Upon your world the mortal shadows of those entities are
  working out their salvation from the plane of darkness. Every person upon Earth and its adjoining planes of
  manifestation are definitely arrayed upon either the positive side of progression toward good, or on the negative side
  of regression toward greater evil. We know where you stand, rfeo; but are you going to be content to drift as you have
  been?" <br> "No....oh, no!" I replied impulsively. "I want to work constructively. Only grant me strong physical
  health and there isn't anything I shan't be able to accomplish." <br> The voice replied gently. "That wish we cannot
  grant you, Orfeo, as much as we might like to. It is only because your physical body is weakened and your spiritual
  perceptions thereby keener that we have been able to contact you. Had you been physically in robust health with your
  mortal body and mind perfectly attuned to the sluggish lowered vibrations of Earth, we could not have manifested to
  you." <br> "Sickness, ill-health and all mortal afflictions are transient and unreal. They, along with pain, sorrow,
  suffering and conflict make up mankind's lessons in the school of the world where wisdom and spiritual evolution are
  gained primarily through suffering. An explanation of this terrible enigma will be given to you later. But tonight we
  tell you that you can rise above the inadequacies of your physical body, Orfeo, as may all other Earthlings. Remember
  always that we love you and your brothers of Earth. We will do everything within our power for the children of Earth
  that they will permit us to do, through free will." <br> With these words, the huge ship I was observing began moving
  upward and toward the left. One large"porthole" after another opened in rapid succession as the ship ascended until
  what appeared to be three decks were visible and I could catch fleeting glimpses of the interior of the gigantic sky
  ship. The inside appeared to be of the same luminous mother-of-pearl substance as the interior of the craft I was in.
  But I saw nothing more, no sign of life, no furnishings or equipment such as we on Earth know. <br> As I watched the
  ship I realized that the voice as well as the ethereal music had actually originated in the great sky ship. It came to
  me then that this must be a mother ship and that beings in it had remote control over the movements of the saucers
  that skimmed and skipped through our atmosphere. It awed me to realize what a high degree of intelligence and what
  expert hands were behind the saucer phenomena. I felt ashamed of having pleaded for a healthy body, who had already
  been granted so much. <br> As the craft moved further out into space I noticed what appeared to be a rotor at each end
  of the ship. I say rotor, but actually the things appeared to be vortices of flame. <br> With my limited knowledge I
  judged these incredible disks of fire to be tremendously powerful power plants whose terrific energy could be diverted
  to almost any purpose. The disks I had first seen were used as radio transmitters and receivers; then as a huge
  three-dimensional television screen on which, through some method of telepathic contact, it was possible both to see
  and to hear. Now I saw those same disks apparently propelling the vast sky ship. It was my guess that just such a
  power plant had shot the very craft I was in a thousand miles out into space in a mere matter of minutes and without
  any discomfort to me. It was clearly evident that all of the bewildering and insurmountable problems of space travel
  that baffled our engineers and scientists had been overcome by these people to such an extent that the entire trip
  into outer space was as simple as a ride in an elevator. <br> I wondered if they had discovered the secret of
  resisting gravity with its counter-force; if not, then by what other means had they conquered or neutralized gravity?
  I remembered that Earth's scientists believed that a man in a space ship would be absolutely weightless and apt to
  float about. I lifted my hand and let it drop to the arm of the chair. It behaved precisely as it would have on Earth.
  There must be an artificial gravity induced in the floor of the craft. <br> I wondered too how they had overcome the
  menace of lethal cosmic rays, meteors, sky debris, etc. Surely my ship carried no tons of lead shielding scientists
  declared necessary for adequate protection from cosmic rays. Also, I wondered in what way they had mastered the
  terrific pressure and temperature changes so that I was never conscious at any time of variations in either? And their
  motive power; what was the fantastic secret of those green fireballs? Possibly they were vortices of magnetic power
  which operated almost silently and with astounding efficiency. What a wonder world their planet must be, I thought, as
  I gazed in awe at the crystalline dream-ship passing from my line of vision. <br> Slowly then the room turned back
  toward the left and the Earth appeared once more with its shimmering rainbow halo. Dimly I could make out the faint
  outlines of the Western Hemisphere in varying shades of misty blue. Also I could see faint puffs of light scattered
  here and there which I judged to be the larger cities of the North American continent. <br> Two flying saucers darted
  into view and sped downward toward Earth. Just as abruptly they decelerated and hung suspended in space as pinpoints
  of light. As I was wondering about them I heard the voice say that one was over Washington, D.C. and the other over
  Los Angeles. Los Angeles - the word echoed in my consciousness as I gazed at the faint brush of light that was a great
  sprawling city. I tried to remember that Los Angeles was my home, but it seemed only vaguely familiar; a place
  remembered somewhere in Time. <br> "Tonight, Orfeo," the voice continued, "you have explored a minute distance into
  the limitless highways of the universe. Through your own efforts the road may later be widened for you. Tonight you,
  an entity of Earth, have come close to the Infinite Entities. For the present you are our emissary, Orfeo, and you
  must act! Even though people of Earth laugh derisively and mock you as a lunatic, tell them about us!" <br> "I
  will....I will..." I whispered haltingly knowing that everything I said was heard by them even as all my thoughts were
  known to them. <br> "We know you will, Orfeo," the voice replied. "Thus tonight a special privilege has been yours. We
  love the Children of Earth and it is our desire to help them as the hour of crisis approaches. But only through such
  harmless ones as you can we work. <br> "The aggressive men of Earth want our scientific advancements. For these they
  would shoot our crafts from the skies - if they could. But additional scientific knowledge we cannot give to Earth
  except as we are now doing in a manner perfectly in accord and harmony with cosmic law. Already man's material
  knowledge has far outstripped the growth of brotherly love and spiritual understanding in his heart. Therein lies the
  present danger. To add to the destructive phase of man's scientific knowledge is not permitted. We are working now to
  turn that knowledge to constructive purposes upon Earth. Also we hope to give men a deeper knowledge and understanding
  of their own true nature and a greater awareness of the evolutionary crisis facing them. At present we are working
  along all constructive lines of human endeavor and especially in the fields of medicine and healing. Surely you cannot
  fail to see the tremendous advances which have been made in this direction within the last few years. Even greater
  'discoveries' are at hand including success in the fight against cancer. Thus shall we continue to work with and
  through men." <br> I listened to the compassionate voice, trying to imprint every word on my consciousness. But I have
  forgotten much and these words are only a poor attempt to recall all that I heard. The voice continued speaking: <br>
  "We know your mind is filled with questions. One question in particular troubles you an it concerns the entity the
  world knows as Jesus Christ. May we set your mind at rest. In allegorical language Christ is indeed the Son of God.
  The star that burned over Bethlehem is a cosmic fact. It announced the birth on your planet of an entity not of
  Earth's evolution. He is Lord of the Flame - an infinite entity of the sun. Out of compassion for mankind's suffering
  He became flesh and blood and entered the hell of ignorance, woe and evil. As the Sun Spirit who sacrificed Himself
  for the children of woe he has become a part of the oversoul of mankind and the world spirit. In this He differs from
  all other world teachers. <br> "Each person upon Eart has a spiritual, or unknown, self which transcends the material
  world and consciousness and dwells eternally out of the Time dimension in spiritual perfection within the unity of the
  oversoul. <br> "In the illusion of Time is written man's choice through free will whereby he set in motion the cause
  of error which inevitably resulted in effect, in which mankind entered mortal consciousness or the living death of his
  present existence. Thus was he separated from his eternal and perfect self. His one purpose upon Earth now is to
  attain reunion with is immortal consciousness. When this is accomplished he is resurrected from the kingdom of death
  and becomes his real immortal self made in the image and likeness of God Your Teacher has told you, God is love, and
  in these simple words may be found the secrets of all the mysteries of Earth and the worlds beyond." <br> Tears
  coursed down my cheeks. Under the spiritual scrutiny of that great, compassionate consciousness I felt like a crawling
  worm - unclean, filled with error and sin. Yes, I say sin, but not in the ordinary sense men use that word. Rather sin
  as sin really is. And basically sin is hypocrisy, falsity, the living lie! It is looking at your fellow man with a
  friendly smile upon your face with treacherous, malicious, or mocking thoughts in your heart. Sin is any and all
  deviations from absolute truth, perfect love, absolute honesty and righteous motives. Thus actual sin has little to do
  with Earthly standards of sin. <br> As these realizations filled my consciousness I wanted to fling myself down upon
  the floor and hide my head in shame for humanity. And of all men I at that moment felt the lowliest, the least worthy
  to be where I was. I wondered how those great beings could love such a one as I or any of mankind. We with our bloody
  wars, our intense hatreds, our cheap, shoddy intolerances, our greed and avarice and our cruel inhumanity to our
  fellowmen. I hid my head in my hands and wept bitter tears for a creature so full of error and hypocrisy and yet so
  puffed up with egotistical pride over our little material knowledge. <br> At that moment, as in a dream, I heard the
  strains of the "Lord's Prayer", played as though by thousands of violins. As I crouched in the chair fresh tears
  poured from my eyes. My heart was filled with humility, contrition and with gratitude - gratitude that these Great
  Ones had even considered our miserable selfish existence. <br> Above the exquisite strains of melody, the voice said:
  "Beloved friend of Earth, we baptize you now in the true light of the worlds eternal." <br> A blinding white beam
  flashed from the dome of the craft. Momentarily I seemed partially to lose consciousness. Everything expanded into a
  great shimmering white light. I seemed to be projected beyond Time and Space and was conscious only of light, Light,
  LIGHT! Orfeo, Earth, the past were as nothing, a dark dream of a moment. And that dream unfolded before my eyes in
  swift panorama. Every event of my life upon Earth was crystal clear to me - and then memory of all of my previous
  lives upon Earth returned. IN THAT SUBLIME MOMENT I KNEW THE MYSTERY OF LIFE! Also, I realized with a terrible
  certainty that we are all - each one of us - TRAPPED IN ETERNITY and ALLOTTED ONLY ONE BRIEF AWARENESS AT A TIME! <br>
  I am dying, I thought. I have been through this death before in other earthly lives. This is death! Only now I am in
  ETERNITY, WITHOUT BEGINNING AND WITHOUT END. Then slowly everything resolved into radiant light, peace and
  indescribable beauty. Free of all falsity of mortality I drifted in a timeless sea of bliss. <br> At last, as from a
  vivid dream, I regained consciousness. Dazedly, I looked about the interior of the craft. Everything was the same, but
  it seemed ten thousand years had passed in what must have been only a few moments. I was half conscious of a burning
  sensation on my left side just below the heart, but I thought nothing of it then. <br> Ethereal drifts of music were
  in the air. Far away, I could feel, more than hear, a pulsing vibration beneath the floor of the craft. Also, I was
  again aware of the gentle push of my body against the cushioned chair. I realized I was being taken back to Earth.
  <br> In an incredibly short time the wall opened and I saw the familiar surroundings. Yes, I knew I was home again.
  But I also realized a little sadly that Earth could never again really be my home. In the spiritual evolution of
  mankind, I had been expendable in this life. Thus had I passed through death and attained infinite life. <br> As I got
  up from the comfortable chair, I reached down and picked up the strange, shining bit of metal and carried it in my
  hand as I left the craft. In a kind of daze I walked away from the ship; then curiously turned to look at it from the
  outside once more. But it was gone! I looked up and there it was high in the sky, faintly visible as a fuzzy luminous
  bubble. Then suddenly it was not there at all; but high in the northeastern sky I saw a red, glowing disk which
  changed to green and vanished. <br> I glanced down at the round bit of strange metal in my hand. I was glowing and
  livid again and appeared almost to be alive as it quivered in contact with my flesh. Also, it was rapidly diminishing
  in size. By the time I had reached home it had dissipated into nothingness. <br> As I was undressing to go to bed, I
  remembered again the burning sensation I had felt on my left side while I was undergoing the profound "initiation" in
  the saucer. I glanced down and saw what appeared to be a circular "burn" about the size of a quarter on my left side
  directly below my heart. The outer rim of the circle was red, inflamed and slightly raised as also was a small dot in
  the center of the circle - the symbol of the hydrogen atom. I realized they had impressed that mark upon by body to
  convince me beyond all doubt of the reality of my experiences in the cold light of the coming days. <br> <br> Chapter
  III <br> MY MEETING WITH NEPTUNE <br> <br> Following the emotional shock of that profound and bewildering trip in the
  saucer, I went about in a veritable daze for weeks. I continued on the job at Lockheed and resumed the routine of my
  daily affairs; but I was like an automaton - a dweller in two worlds and at home in neither. It is almost impossible
  to explain my state of mind But the great spiritual illumination I had received in the saucer left me something of a
  stranger to my own planet, Earth. <br> I longed to tell the world, to blazen out the truths of my discoveries; yet I
  knew that for the greater part I must forever remain silent. Among other glimpses of reality, I attained the
  realization that TIME IS NON-EXISTENT. What we call Time exists only in the physical worlds and is an illusion of the
  senses. Also, I know now that our concept of space is entirely erroneous. But who could I convince of these and other
  truths - who would believe me? <br> But because THEY had requested that I tell Earthlings of my experiences, I told
  many persons about my trip in the flying saucer. Nearly everyone laughed and ridiculed me. I was the butt of numerous
  jokes. Someone was always wise-cracking; Are your saucer pals going to show up tonight, Orfeo?" Or: "Tell one of the
  saucers to land over at the Drive-In theatre, Angie, and then we'll all believe it!" Such remarks invariably brought
  forth gales of laughter at my expense. But I no longer cared - I KNEW, and that was enough! <br> As my story got
  around, several newspapers printed derisive accounts of "The Saucer Man". It cut deeply to see the embarrassment and
  humiliation it all caused my two sons. They knew people were saying their father was a "screwball". They didn't want
  to go to school because their companions laughed at them. I knew it all hurt Mabel too. Mabel pleaded with me to
  forget my experiences. I tried to explain to her why I had to tell about them, and we had some bitter
  misunderstandings on the subject. <br> I wanted so much to do something constructive, but I didn't know how to go
  about it. I began calling various military and defense offices. The personnel of several of the smaller ones laughed
  openly and passed me off, I know, as a crackpot. But it was with tremendous relief I found the really important
  offices referred me to men who were genuinely interested. They questioned and cross-questioned me concerning the
  information I gave them. <br> A little later I began giving weekly talks to small groups of interested people about
  space visitors. At first these meetings were held in private homes and then as the attendance increased we met in the
  Los Feliz Club House. <br> In what little spare time I had I began writing down my experiences and planned to publish
  them in a small newssheet, for I believed I could reach more people that way. <br> But as the days and weeks passed
  following my fantastic trip in the saucer and nothing more happened, I began to feel a little uncertain. The constant
  ridicule and laughter created even more doubts. My insistence upon the absolute truth of my experiences finally
  appeared to be definitely alienating my friends and even my family. My story was unbelieved upon Earth and the
  mysterious visitors were doing nothing to aid me. I actually began to doubt my own sanity, to wonder if the bizarre
  experiences had been an illusion or hallucination of some sort. And yet an inner tribunal of Truth assured me that
  such was not the case for WITH THEM I HAD SEEN AND KNOWN REALITY - and I could never forget that. <br> On the night of
  August 2nd I and Mabel were helping out at the Los Feliz Drive-In theatre snack bar. About 11 o'clock I went outside
  for a breath of fresh air. Over the hills to the west I noticed a fuzzy green light apparently hanging suspended in
  the sky. I watched it for several moments, then went inside and called Mabel and seven or eight others to come out and
  see it. All of them saw the mysterious light hanging motionless in the sky over the hill. Unable to explain it, some
  of them declared it must be a helicopter hovering in the air. Others thought it might be a high street lamp of some
  sort. <br> But when after three or four minutes the "street lamp" climbed slowly and silently into the heavens and
  suddenly vanished, no one had much to say. But for some perverse reason none of them wanted to admit that it was
  actually a flying saucer. <br> As they trouped back into the cafe laughing about "Orfeo and his flying saucers", a
  depressing wave of discouragement passed over me. It was useless - absolutely useless - to talk to anyone about the
  saucers or my experiences. Feeling greatly disheartened and very much alone, I decided to leave and walk home. <br> As
  I cut across the vacant lots the Hyperion Avenue Freeway Bridge loomed huge and dark ahead of me. The sky was overcast
  and the dense, oblique shadows from the vast concrete structure were heavier and more eerie than usual. Yet in the
  shadows of the dark archways of the bridge I had come to feel a kind of warmth and welcome, a spiritual communion with
  a vastly greater and more kindly world. For it was in the shadows of the huge bridge that I had come upon the saucer
  which had carried me out of this world. <br> I was thinking of these things when I suddenly became aware of someone
  approaching from out of the darkness. I was startled for I'd never before met anyone taking the short-cut beneath the
  bridge so late at night. I was about to call out a word of greeting when it dawned upon me that the stranger was
  coming from the dead end of the bridge. My first thought was that someone was lying in wait for me, possibly to rob
  me. But before I could become alarmed, I heard the stranger call: "Greetings, Orfeo!" <br> My heart almost stopped
  beating, for immediately I recognized the vibrant, beautiful voice of the being who had spoken to me in the saucer.
  <br> I stopped in my tracks, utterly speechless, and stared at the approaching figure. But then a wave of joy and
  gratitude flooded over me, and I finally replied falteringly: "Greetings...to you..." <br> He laughed pleasantly. "I
  know that in your mind you have given me a name - I who have remained nameless to you, " he said gently. "You may call
  me by that name, Orfeo - it is as good as any other and has more inner significance to you than any name I might give
  you." <br> "Neptune..." I spoke the name slowly and reverently. For it was indeed the name I had given to this great
  and mysterious being. Then I added: "At last you have come to give me strength and faith." <br> He was near enough
  then for me to see that he was several inches taller than I and similar in outline to a well-built man. But the
  shadows were so heavy that I couldn't make out the details of his figure. But just to be in his presence once more was
  to sense again a tremendous uplifting wave of strength, harmony, joy and serenity. <br> "Come, Orfeo," he said gently,
  continuing on past me. "We have many things to discuss tonight." <br> I followed him as he strode ahead of me through
  the dense shadows. I could hear his solid footsteps upon the graveled path which convinced me beyond the shadow of a
  doubt that he was no phantom or illusion. <br> He led me to a better lighted area near the bend of Glendale Boulevard
  where it goes up and over the bridge. I was actually trembling in anticipation of my first actual look at the
  mysterious visitor from another world. <br> When he turned I saw his face, the same wonderful, expressive countenance
  I had seen on the luminous screen. I again noticed especially his extremely large dark and expressive eyes and
  nobility and beauty of his features which actually seemed to radiate warmth and kindliness. <br> Then I noticed that
  he was wearing a kind of uniform, bluish in color, perfectly tailored and tightly fitted to the outlines of his body.
  But it was apparently without seams, buttons, pockets, trimmings or design of any sort. In fact it fitted so perfectly
  that it was almost like a part of his body. <br> But as I studied him I became aware of an astonishing phenomenon: I
  could see his uniform and figure clearly, but it wavered occasionally, as though I were viewing it through rippling
  water. And the color did not remain solid and uniform, but varied and changed in spots, which reminded me of an
  imperfectly tuned television set. Only his face and hands remained immobile and stable as though not partially
  obscured by a film of rippling water. <br> Headlights from approaching automobiles fell upon us from time to time and
  I remember wondering what manner of being my companion appeared to be to those in the passing cars. Did they see him
  at all? If so, did he appear as solid and substantial as myself? <br> He moved forward again, motioning for me to
  follow him. Without speaking he led me down the sharp concrete declivity into the bed of the dry Los Angeles River.
  There he sat down upon a large stone and motioned for me to do likewise. <br> For a time he was silent and I was
  acutely conscious of a tremendous vibrational field about him; a tangible emanation of serenity, brotherly love, and
  ineffable joy. <br> At last he said: "You sense and understand intuitively many things I cannot say directly to you,
  Orfeo. you have just fully realized that we are not like earthmen in that we function in dimensions unknown to your
  world. Earth is a three-dimensional world and because of this it is preponderantly false. I may tell you that to the
  entities of certain other worlds Earth is regarded as 'the accursed planet', the 'home of the reprobate, fallen ones'.
  Others call your Earth 'the home of sorrows'. For Earth's evolution is evolution through pain, sorrow, sin, suffering
  and the illusion of physical death. Believe me, all evolutions are not similar to Earth's, despite the present beliefs
  of your scientists." <br> As I heard these strange words, my heart and mind cried out: "But why must it be so? Why
  should Earth's people know pain, suffering and death?" <br> He looked up into the heavens and in the soft light I saw
  deep compassion in his face as he said slowly: "The answer to that question is one of the mysteries of the illusion of
  Time. But I can tell you this: such conditions did not always prevail among the entities who now inhabit Earth. Once
  there was another planet in your solar system, the fairest and most radiant of all the planets. That planet was the
  original home of Earthlings. In their native home they knew no pain, sorrow, suffering, sickness or death. But in the
  glory and wonder of their world they grew proud and arrogant. They made war among themselves and finally turned
  against the Great Giver of Life. Ultimately they destroyed their own planet which today exists only as a sterile and
  barren ring of asteroids and debris in the solar system. In order that those entities might gain understanding,
  compassion and brotherly love they were born into the animalistic, material evolution of a lesser planet, Earth.
  Suffering, sorrow, frustration and death became their teacher. Their symbol became the Man-Beast. Each man must work
  out his own destiny and salvation. In the illusion of Time and through repeated births and deaths each entity slowly
  and painfully evolves spiritually toward its former glorified state of divinity. Eventually all the entities of Earth
  will again attain their lost heritage. They will have learned understanding, compassion and true love for God and
  their fellows." <br> I pondered his strange words thoughtfully, thinking as I did so that what he had said explained
  many apparent mysteries about man and his lot upon Earth. But soon my attention was distracted once more as I saw the
  figure of Neptune strangely "waver" again. Suddenly the question was in my mind: "Was he really there in the truest
  physical sense, or was he an immaterial projection into the physical world from another dimension? Did I see him in
  his true form and ordinary state of being, or merely a projected approximation of a man's appearance?" These strange
  thoughts frightened me a little and carried me into too deep waters. <br> A reassuring smile lighted his face. "Don't
  be alarmed, Orfeo. The answer to the troublesome question in your mind is both yes and no. On Earth form, color,
  individuality and the material aspect of things is all-important. In our world these illusions are of practically no
  importance at all. Suffice to say that for you I am an approximation of myself as I really am. I can't make it any
  clearer in three-dimensional terms." <br> I thought about my own troubled fellows of Earth. Impetuously, I asked:
  "What about Earth now? On the surface all seems fairly calm, but I know we are only drifting on dangerous and
  treacherous waters. In their hearts many people are troubled and afraid. There is the ever-constant fear of the H-bomb
  and of other horribly destructive weapons being developed in the laboratories. Also there is the creeping menace of
  Communism that is threatening the world, and so many other things..." <br> When Neptune spoke his voice was calm and
  dispassionate: "Communism, Earth's present fundamental enemy, masks beneath its banner the spearhead of the united
  forces of evil. Along with good all men have evil in their hearts to a degree. But some are much more evil than
  others. Communism is a necessary evil and now exists upon Earth as do venomous creatures, famines, blights, tyrannies,
  cataclysms - all are negative forces which awaken the positive forces of good in man and cause them to act. Thus are
  they combatted, understood and ultimately their unreality becomes apparent. For evil is always eventually
  self-destroyed." <br> He paused and once more I noticed his "uniform" darkening and lightening in spots, as though it
  were made of restless pale bluish clouds and patches of moonlight. Then I held my breath as he continued: "Yes, war
  will come again to your Earth. We are powerless to prevent it. Millions in your land will fight to the end for their
  cherished ideals and freedom of the human mind, with only a minimum on their side for victory. The hour of travail
  which in future history shall be known as 'The Great Accident' is nearer than any man dreams. And already the clouds
  of war are on the horizon, dark and ominous; but overhead beams the rainbow, infinite and eternal. Mankind will
  survive Armageddon and awake to a new more glorious day of fellowship and honest brotherly love. In the dawning great
  New Age of Earth all will forget their bitter hurts and build constructively together upon the solid foundation of the
  Brotherhood of Man." <br> He stopped speaking and turned his radiant eyes full upon me. In the half-light his
  countenance was truly resplendent. <br> "There is not much more I can tell you now, Orfeo," he said. "Since the first
  publicized modern sighting of our disks in the year 1947, thousands upon Earth have come to believe in us. Many have
  actually seen our disks. Some have seen us clairvoyantly. Others have communicated with us clairaudiently. Still
  others recognize the truth of our existence and greater scope of our being, through intuitive perception. But as far
  as official proof of ourselves, for which so many clamor, we cannot offer that. Official proof of the existence of our
  disks will come. But for us to attempt physically to contact mankind through any so-called authoritative source would
  be only useless and possibly disastrous for them. Nearly all three-dimensional beings have no concept of, nor could
  they possibly understand, extra-dimensional beings. Tonight in visiting you I have broken a code - the code of 'hands
  off', as regards any interference in the affairs of Earth. Active cosmic law will see the necessary amends made. <br>
  He looked at me; his strange eyes suddenly saddened. For a moment I had the uncanny feeling that in his greater vision
  I appeared to him only as a fleeting, insubstantial shadow, utterly without reality as he knew it. In that revealing
  instant I knew that we of Earth are as far removed from their nature as Earth is from the Sun. <br> After a while he
  said: "I would shake your hand in token of our momentous meeting here tonight. But I cannot. I have gone too far
  already. For my transgression we must now recede an equal degree from you. The immutable law of cause and effect upon
  Earth will govern accordingly. As a result, but few will believe or even hear your account of our meeting. In the
  over-all picture your story will in no way change conditions upon Earth. Neither will any actual Earthly event be
  either hastened or retarded because of our meeting. At most your story will give only greater faith and inner
  conviction to the few - but it is an important few! The ways of God are immutable and apparent only to those who have
  spiritual discernment. In the illusion of Time all things will be fulfilled in their proper hour." <br> I found that I
  was trembling and my nerves fairly quivering. Whether from sheer emotion or actually from being within the vibratory
  range of Neptune, I don't know. I longed to thank him, to express the great feeling of gratitude in my heart; but I
  didn't know quite how. I said: "From the bottom of my heart I thank you, Neptune. I pledge my very life to you and the
  beings of your world, that greater understandings may come to mankind." <br> "We know you will not fail us, Orfeo," he
  replied. "No other contact may be made at this time. But have no further doubts about the reality of your experiences.
  The road is open now; walk it as you will. Your failure will be my own. But I smile upon you for the increased numbers
  who will come to know us in a truer aspect and to believe in us because of you. Strength and encouragement will be
  given to the millions who will rise courageously to meet the fiery trials ahead. I tell you this: the 'Great Accident'
  is very close and the fury of the next war will break when it is least expected; when men are talking of peace. I
  cannot say more." <br> With these prophetic words, Neptune extended his hand to me. But recalling his words, I did not
  grasp it. <br> He smiled and his face actually seemed to radiate light. "Orfeo, my brother!" he said with genuine
  affection. "For my sake you refused to break the code. My trust is forever in you, Orfeo. In your simple action you
  have cleansed me from my contact with this ground." <br> He paused; then added: "Soon we shall recede from Earth,
  Orfeo - and yet in reality we shall never be far away. Later, we shall return, but not to you, beloved friend. You
  will understand the meanings of these words later on." <br> When I made no reply, he said: "I'm thirsty, Orfeo.
  Perhaps you know where we might get a drink of water?" <br> "Oh yes....yes sir," I answered eagerly, getting quickly
  to my feet. I remembered a small nearby store that remained open all night. "Please wait here; I'll be right back." I
  left him and clambered up the embankment. <br> As I hurried toward the store, I turned and looked back at the Hyperion
  Bridge. Beneath the high center arch I made out the hazy outline of a kind of ghostly "igloo" which I immediately
  recognized as a saucer similar to the one in which I had ridden. <br> At the store I bought two bottles of lemon soda
  and hastened back. But as I approached I was disappointed to see that the ghostly saucer was no longer beneath the
  arch of the bridge. Quickening my pace, I almost ran to the spot where I had left Neptune; but he was no longer there.
  I wasn't too surprised for I'd had a premonition he wouldn't be there when I returned. <br> I tossed the sodas away
  and sank down upon the ground. The place was appallingly desolate without him. I felt so acutely alone, so helpless
  and deserted - like a child left alone in a dark room when the light is suddenly extinguished. I looked upward and my
  eyes hopefully searched the skies. High in the western heavens I saw a soft, fuzzy green light which hung for a
  moment, then shot away and vanished. <br> "Farewell, Neptune," I said softly as I felt my eyes grow moist. "I know now
  Earth is not yet ready for a meeting with the beings from your world. But in the dawning of Earth's great New Age,
  that day will come, friend. When we have learned the meaning of true brotherly love; when we have overcome to a
  greater degree the evil inherent in our selfish hearts, then perhaps we will be worthy to meet the infinitely wiser
  and gentler brothers of your world. In those days your fellows will visit us openly and joyfully. No longer will Earth
  be 'the accursed planet - home of sorrows'." <br> <br> Chapter IV <br> "WE CAN APPEAR AND FUNCTION AS EARTHMEN,
  ORFEO!" <br> <br> At first I told no one of my strange meeting with Neptune, for I knew only too well that my new
  story would meet with even greater disbelief and ridicule. But I immediately set to work writing down my further
  experiences. I had already placed my first experiences with the saucers in manuscript form and planned to publish it
  as the first edition of a small personal newspaper, The Twentieth Century Times; but I had experienced difficulty in
  finding a publisher. Now I was glad the paper was not yet in print, for I could include my most recent experience with
  Neptune. <br> <br> I worked hard on the manuscript in my spare time. But the emotional and physical strain I was under
  began to tell on my health and I felt the return of many of my old symptoms of extreme weakness and fatigue. In
  October of 1952 I applied for a leave of absence from my job at Lockheed. This was granted and by an odd coincidence
  the first day of my leave started on the day the first strike in the history of Lockheed was called. I had the feeling
  that I had been saved from additional nervous stress and strain. Fortunately, the strike ended well and work resumed
  at the plant within a few weeks. <br> <br> With time off from work, I was soon able to complete the manuscript. Also,
  with the additional rest, my health rapidly improved so that I was strong enough to return to work within a month.
  <br> <br> The fellows at the plant knew of my interest in the saucers and many of them also knew of my first two
  experiences. I was in for a lot of ribbing from them. But on the whole it was good natured, friendly ribbing so I
  didn't mind. Several of those with whom I worked most closely frequently asked me for some kind of proof of the
  reality of my experiences. I told them of the shiny piece of strange metal I had picked up on the floor of the craft
  and explained how within a matter of minutes it disintegrated into nothingness. Also I told them of the burn I had
  received during my "initiation" in the saucer which had resulted in a mark on the left side of my chest. Some of them
  looked at the mark in the form of the symbol of the hydrogen atom. But these things were not sufficient proof for
  them. <br> <br> One night at work several of them had been kidding me about my experiences. Al Sarradar quipped: "Just
  what kinda liquor you drinkin', Angie, that sends you outa this world?" Walter Seveicki chimed in: "Yeah, tell us so
  we can take a ride in a saucer too!" <br> <br> We had just rolled out a heavy die. Al and I were removing the finished
  radome from it when suddenly there was a loud crackling sound as though a wooden plank had snapped. At the same
  instant I felt a shock in my right hand and a stinging sensation in my index finger. <br> <br> The boys were startled.
  Al yelled: "What happened, Angie?" <br> <br> I didn't reply, but held out my index finger for all of them to see. Five
  of them watched as a round welt appeared on my finger. The welt was not red like a burn, but appeared gray. It was
  about the size of a dime, a perfectly round circle with a dark dot in the center - again the symbol of the hydrogen
  atom. <br> <br> Somebody said something about static electricity, but all of them were deeply puzzled, or nothing like
  that had ever happened before. Al advised me to get medical attention at the plant hospital. I told him it would not
  be necessary; there was no pain whatsoever.l I reminded him that the same thing had happened to me in the saucer when
  I had received a considerably larger similar mark on my left side below the heart. <br> <br> They laughed at my
  explanation and refused to believe that extra-terrestrials had anything to do with the sudden unaccountable phenomenon
  which had produced the strange mark on my finger. Yet they were mystified and today any one of them will testify to
  the authenticity of the experience. The odd mark remained on my index finger for some months as a constant reminder of
  the proximity of unseen visitors. <br> <br> The latter part of October Mabe made a trip back to New Jersey to visit
  our folks. When she returned several weeks later my mother and father accompanied her, as they wanted to spend a month
  or two in California. Mabel wired me to meet them at the Greyhound bus depot. <br> <br> I was eager to see Mabel again
  and looking forward to a reunion with my Dad and Mother. I drove downtown the night they were to arrive, as thrilled
  as a kid. It was around six o'clock and the streets heavy with traffic Parking my car, I walked toward the bus
  terminal. It too was bustling with activity. In all of the excitement, flying saucers and space visitors were the
  farthest things from my mind. But as I entered the front door of the bus terminal I stopped in my tracks and stared,
  unable to believe my eyes. Directly in front of me and facing the newstand was a familiar face. I knew I couldn't be
  mistaken - it was Neptune! <br> <br> He glanced up and his dark eyes told me that he was expecting me. He was dressed
  in an ordinary dark business suit and carried a brief case under his arm. A dark blue felt hat with snap brim shaded
  his eyes. And he appeared as real as any person in the depot! After the sudden shock of surprise I started forward to
  greet him, but a strong telepathic command stopped me. I stood hesitant looking at him.. He stood up, facing me and I
  could not help noticing how tall, extremety handsome and distinguished he appeared in the hurrying throngs of people.
  He was not smiling; in fact, his face was almost stern as though he might be angry. I wondered what I had done wrong.
  I completely forgot Mabel and the folks waiting for me. <br> <br> His intent gaze never left me. Stalling for time I
  walked over to the newsstand and picked up a magazine and thumbed through it. I had received the definite telepathic
  impression not to approach him; thus I waited for him to speak to me. But he did not. Staring blankly at a page in the
  magazine I waited for further telepathic communication. It came! The gist of the message was: "The last time you saw
  me, Orfeo, I was in a less objectified projection in your three-dimensional world. The purpose being to give you some
  idea of our true aspect. But now tonight you see me fully objectified. If you did not know who I am, you could not
  tell me from one of your fellows. Tonight I am no half-phantom, but can move among men as an Earthman. It is not
  necessary for you to speak to me; you have gained the understanding. You know now that we can appear and function as
  human beings." <br> <br> I looked gratefully into his eyes and as in my previous encounter with him, I felt again a
  unity of being as though I were momentarily released from the bonds of individuality. <br> <br> Just then Mabel and
  the folks spied me. As in a dream I heard them call to me as they came rushing over to me. Like an automaton I kissed
  Mabel and hugged Mom and Pop. All the while they were talking and holding my hands. I was going through the motions of
  greeting them, but I was still so stunned that I scarcely knew what was happening. <br> <br> Together we all walked
  toward the exit and I noticed that Neptune was following a short distance behind us. When we reached the door I was
  about to open it when Neptune reached out and pushed it open for us. I was more astounded than ever, for it meant that
  he could function in the physical world as easily as any Earthling. <br> <br> Outside he walked a few places to the
  left and stopped. There he opened his briefcase and removed a pack of cigarettes. He removed a cigarette from the pack
  and put the package back in the briefcase. Then without lighting the cigarette he tossed it into the gutter. <br> <br>
  I was smoking a cigarette too. Following Neptune's action, I tossed my cigarette away. Mabel noticed my preoccupation
  and odd behavior. She looked at Neptune and then at me and asked: "Who is that man and why is he staring at us so
  intently?" <br> <br> I didn't reply to her question as I was too confused to get involved in explanations. I said:
  "Come on Mae, let's get the suitcases into the car." <br> <br> She knew something was wrong and I was aware of the
  three faces studying me with perplexity. I made fumbling excuses for my odd behavior. But on the drive home I was able
  to begin to snap out of it and to show them the warm welcome I felt in my heart. <br> <br> Chapter V <br> THE PAST IS
  NEVER DEAD! <br> <br> The Christmas holidays arrived with their gay, festive spirit and usual bustling excitement. By
  then things had settled back to normal and I had experienced no further contacts. Flying saucers seemed to have
  vanished from the skies; practically no accounts of sightings appeared in the newspapers. Although I had completed the
  manuscript for The Twentieth Century Times, I couldn't get up the courage to have it published. <br> <br> Mabel kept
  saying: "Orfie, if you publish that, people will think you are completely crazy. Why don't you just forget it! Nothing
  good can ever come of it. Everything is going along so smoothly now; we're both working and the boys are happy - let's
  just leave it that way." <br> "But, Mae..." I'd remonstrate. "Don't you understand; these things really happened to
  me! It is my duty to tell what I know!" <br> "And just what thanks will you get for it? Do you want to be ridiculed,
  laughed at and considered a crackpot or a psycho? Think back! Remember how everybody talked when you first told that
  wild story about a trip in a flying saucer. What did it get you but ridicule! Even if it did happen, Orfie, forget it!
  Just forget the whole thing for your family's sake. Let's be happy and enjoy life." <br> Thus although I felt I was
  betraying Neptune, I let things drift and made no effort to get my story published. In fact on New Year's Day, 1953
  our lives were going along so smoothly and pleasantly that I had decided to forget it all insofar as the world was
  concerned and let those incredible experiences become a part of the dead past of 1952. <br> But the events of 1952
  would not rest. During the latter part of January, 1953 the front pages of the newspapers were carrying sensational
  new saucer stories. The Air Force released reports that flying disks and strange clusters of lights were numerous over
  Korea. F-94 Starfires had encountered several of the saucers and one of their pilots had gotten a radar magnetic lock
  on one of them. Northern Japan too had many sightings. <br> The reports made me restless. At night I frequently went
  outside and scanned the heavens. Frequently I saw the disks overhead as roving lights. Any casual observer would not
  give a second glance, but simply pass the lights off as ordinary airplane lights. And since our apartment was close to
  several large airports, there were usually airplanes visible at all times. I should never have been able to
  distinguish saucer lights from those of aircraft were it not for the peculiar sensitivity of my nervous system to the
  electro-magnetic effect of the saucers. <br> Then I began to be ashamed of myself for having failed so completely the
  trust that Neptune had placed in me. He had said: "The road will open, Orfeo; travel it as you will." I realized that
  thus far I had refused to travel the road and except for the few talks I had made to small groups I had done nothing
  to help people understand the strange visitors. More and more every day I realized how selfish I was in thinking first
  of my family and myself. Finally I knew there was no alternative for me. Come what may, I had to go ahead with
  publication of the facts of my experiences. It was the only constructive thing I could think of to do. <br> Without
  discussing the matter any further with Mabel, I took the manuscript for The Twentieth Century Times to several local
  publishers. None of them were encouraging. Far from it! The first one I approached was highly amused and a little
  contemptuous as he said: "You'd better send this thing to a science-fiction mag, old boy, unless you want to land in a
  strait-jacket." <br> The next publisher I tried told me how rambling and incoherently the thing was written. "You
  forget I'm not a writer," I replied. "I've done the best I can and all of the facts are there." <br> He laughed. "You
  say the facts are here - but are they? You start off by saying these experiences are true and yet before the narrative
  is completed you have inferred several times that they could be imaginary. In fact, right here on the front page you
  make the statement: "This story is either a yarn or it is real!" What kind of facts are those? And how can you expect
  people to accept the paper as actual fact?" <br> "I've thought of all that," I replied. "Frankly, it was my idea to
  break the news gently. In other words, to let the readers feel uncertain at first as to the absolute authenticity of
  the facts. To tell this entire thing at first as fact is too much of a shock for an unstable world. As you yourself
  say, I might be hustled off to a mental institution. Let the truth of what I have to say develop gradually." <br>
  After considerably more talk along these same lines, he agreed to publish it, but only as I would permit him to edit
  it and delete major portions of the story. I flatly refused and he in turn refused to have anything to do with
  publication of the manuscript. <br> And so it went. I tried publisher after publisher with the same discouraging
  results. At last, however, I found a small publishing house that was willing to print the piece word for word as
  written if I would pay all publishing costs and take all of the papers myself. I agreed to do this. But as we parted
  he shook his head and said: "Pardon me for saying this, Mr. Angelucci, but I honestly think you are making a grave
  mistake. Not only are you throwing your money away, but you are liable to make yourself a public laughing stock." <br>
  "I'll have to risk all that," I answered. "There is no alternative for me; I must publish that paper." <br> Thus on
  February 19, 1953, the one and only issue of The Twentieth Century Times came off the press, an eight-page,
  tabloid-type newspaper which carried word for word an account of all my experiences I felt it was wise for me to
  release. I breathed a huge sigh of relief when I saw the paper, for I felt that I had satisfied a debt. <br> When I
  walked into our apartment with an armful of the papers Mabel took one horrified look at one of the sheets and sank
  down in a chair. "Oh Orfie, you didn't do it! You didn't! This thing is dynamite. It can wreck us. Wreck your job, my
  job and the boys' schooling. This can finish everything we've built up here." <br> "I'm sorry, Mae," I replied
  doggedly. "Believe me, there is no other way out for me. I've got to live with myself; so I had to do it. I hope
  you'll try to understand." <br> But I knew Mae didn't understand. And as copies of the paper got around, many of her
  predicted reactions occurred. People began ridiculing me outright and several papers published sarcastic news items
  about me and my experiences, subtly inferring that I "wasn't all there". Believe me, it wasn't easy to bear, and
  especially did I suffer for my family. The boys were ribbed unmercifully at school and at her job at the snack bar,
  Mabel was the constant target for the sharp barbs of wit aimed at me. <br> But the response was not entirely negative.
  Some persons became genuinely interested. About that time I resumed my weekly talks at the Club House and thus I was
  able to distribute the papers at the meetings. As more and more persons became interested and ceased to take my
  Twentieth Century Times as a joke, I began to feel that all might not be lost. And more important, I could face my
  reflection in the mirror again, happy in the thought that I had not entirely failed the space visitors. <br> <br>
  Chapter VI <br> <br> AIRPLANES DO DISAPPEAR! <br> <br> Not long after my publication of the paper a new aspect of my
  experiences with the saucers developed. On the afternoon of March 3, 1953 I was sitting alone in the kitchen, reading.
  I was dully aware of the steady drone of an airplane which continued for some time. The sound apparently was coming
  form the west. Gradually it dawned upon me that the sound was too steady and too unwavering for an ordinary aircraft.
  <br> Curiously, I got up and looked out the door. Coming from the north I saw what appeared to be an ordinary small
  aluminum airplane. From where I was standing in the doorway there was nothing unusual in the sound of the craft as it
  assumed the normal crescendo of direct approach. I stepped out of doors and watched it fly directly overhead until it
  was fairly in the face of the sun - when suddenly and astoundingly the plane was no longer there! Just as mysteriously
  the sound of its motor ceased abruptly too. I never saw the plane again. Confused, I went back into the house.
  Obviously the craft was not a flying disk, but a conventional type aircraft, for I had not experienced any of the
  unpleasant physical symptoms that a flying disk invariably produces in my body. <br> Four days later about five
  o'clock in the afternoon I was accompanying Jane Vanderlick, a neighbor who is employed at the Los Feliz Theatre cafe.
  We were walking to the cafe where Jane was going to open it half an hour early that day. We were laughing and talking
  when Jane noticed an airplane nearby in the sky, flying south. It seemed just an ordinary airplane of the most common
  type: "Maybe that's a flying saucer, Orfeo!" <br> I thought she was kidding me and replied: "Not you too, Jane!" <br>
  But her eyes were serious. "I mean it, Orfeo. There's something peculiar about that airplane." <br> For the first time
  I scrutinized the craft carefully. After a moment I had to admit there was something unusual about it. It appeared
  extremely dull and flat-surfaced and did not reflect any of the rays of the setting sun as it ordinarily should have
  done. <br> While we were both staring at it the airplane suddenly vanished right before our eyes in a clear and
  cloudless sky! The sound of its motor ceased just as abruptly. Both of us stood in our tracks. Jane stared at me.
  "What happened to that airplane, Orfeo?" <br> I shook my head and then replied slowly: "I wasn't going to mention it
  to anyone, Jane, but I saw the same thing happen four days ago. I don't know what it means!" <br> We stood there for
  some minutes our eyes vainly searching the skies for some trace of the vanished plane. I requested Jane to remember
  every detail of the strange incident. She promised that she would. If you ask her about it today, she will verify the
  experience just as I have related it to you. <br> Several days later I was with a group of employees sitting around
  the Lockheed Plant. It was about five minutes before four in the afternoon. We were waiting for the shifts to change
  preparatory to going on duty. My good friend, but most confirmed skeptic, Richard Butterfield, was with us. While we
  were talkingidly, an apparently ordinary two-engine airplane came into view over the hills. <br> Butterfield's
  attention was attracted to the craft. He arose from the bench and stared up at it as though he was spellbound. His
  behavior reminded me immediately of Jane Vanderlick's actions a few days previously. Her eyes had been attracted to
  that particular plane just as Butterfield's eyes were now drawn to this one. Yet neither of the planes had any effect
  upon me. The crowd all noticed Butterfield's deep absorption in the small plane. Some of them started laughing and
  began ribbing him. I remember someone shouting: "Look! He ain't never seen an airplane before!" But Butterfield paid
  no attention. Finally, almost as though talking to himself, he said: "What is that?" <br> Several voices helpfully
  jibed in with wise-cracks about his being sorely in need of an optician's advice. One fellow remarked scathingly: "Any
  dope can see it's nothing but an ordinary two-engine airplane." <br> I didn't say anything, for I had noticed by then
  how flat-toned the craft was and how it failed to reflect the rays of the afternoon sun. <br> Suddenly there was an
  instantaneous flash that appeared to envelope the plane. Wen the flash was over there was no sign of a plane to be
  seen anywhere in the sky. The droning of its motors too had ceased. Many of the group had seen the phenomenon. They
  were startled and confused and everyone started talking at once trying to explain just what had happened. Others
  continued to stare into the skies searching for the vanished plane. <br> Butterfield dazedly brushed his hand across
  his eyes. It seemed difficult for him to come back to the norm of this world. He didn't say much, but for a long time
  after we had gone on the job he appeared to be in deep thought. I didn't volunteer any explanations, for the sudden
  disappearance of the plane in a brilliant flash was a new development for me. I kept mulling it over in my mind as
  well as the two previous experiences in which I had seen airplanes simply disappear into thin air. But I didn't give
  the incidents too much thought as I had more than enough to do to try and unscramble the puzzle of my previous
  experiences with the extraterrestrials without adding more problems. <br> Within a week most of those who had seen the
  plane disappear had either forgotten the incident or had figured out some explanation that satisfied them. I saw then
  that the human mind does not want to believe anything it cannot understand; it will rationalize to any extent rather
  than face the unknown. <br> As the weeks passed I continued to be ribbed more and more. Some of my fellow workers were
  even inferring that I was lying just for cheap publicity. I would joyfully have dropped the whole thing like a red-hot
  coal, if I had not had the deep sense of loyalty and responsibility to those Greater Beings that neither I nor my
  fellows could begin to understand. <br> As the situation became more unpleasant at the plant, I finally decided to
  turn in my notice; for by then my experiences were fairly well-known throughout Southern California and thus I was in
  for constant ridicule. I knew I'd either have to shut up about space visitors or else quit my job. I decided on the
  latter. <br> My last three weeks at work were rather memorable. On August 14th Ernie Oxford and I were working on an
  airplane part outside the building. He, like all of the others when they got me alone, was harping on the space
  visitors and my "wild story in that Twentieth Century Times." He was contentiously declaring that neither he or his
  girl friend could swallow such a story. <br> I told him that it was his right to believe only what he wished to
  believe. Then I suggested that we forget the subject and concentrate on the job we had to do. But Ernie couldn't be
  stopped. He kept on telling me what a big mistake I was making. <br> While he was berating me, I looked toward the
  Burbank mountains and there directly over a ridge top was a flying saucer. I touched Ernie on the shoulder and pointed
  to the saucer. He dropped his tools and stared. Don Quinn, working nearby, saw us gazing into the sky and came running
  over. <br> While we were watching the thing it appeared suddenly to "flip" and vanished. Ernie kept asking: "Where did
  it go?" And after that experience he was quiet for a while. Then he began talking about the saucers and nothing else.
  He still didn't believe my sstory, but he knew he had actually seen a saucer. <br> Friday, August 21st, at 9:15 in the
  evening, the entire shift was hard at work. My mind was preoccupied and I was busy on an airplane part. Suddenly a
  tremor passed over me. I knew it could mean only one thing. I put down my tools and walked to the huge door, which was
  open only about a foot. As I looked out into the night I saw a light in the skies which appeared to be approaching the
  plant. While I watched, the light stopped in mid-air and changed from amber to red. There was no doubt in my mind
  about what it was. <br> I called to some of the fellows in the plant and beckoned them to join me. A number of them
  hurried over and we pushed open the door and went outside. All who came were rewarded. Every one of the men saw the
  red disk hanging overhead in the sky. While they were staring I glanced at their faces and I was deeply impressed with
  what I saw. Momentarily, they were like changed men. Wonder, awe, and belief were in their faces. Thus I was struck
  with the realization of what the mere sight of a single disk can do to the thinking of a number of persons. <br> While
  I was watching their reactions, they all turned suddenly and looked questioningly at me. I glanced up into the sky to
  see that the disk had vanished and only the moon and the stars were overhead. I asked where the disk had gone and all
  of them started to tell me. <br> From the many explanations I learned that the saucer had appeared to move until it
  was directly below the moon where it began to ascend. As it ascended it changed in color from red to amber and then to
  the silvery color of the moon. As it climbed higher its color became indistinguishable from the moon so that they
  could not tell what actually happened to it. But it had vanished. All of that had happened while I was watching their
  faces. <br> We trouped back in to work and all of the men were quiet and thoughtful. At the ten minute break I told
  them that on the following night at the second break I was going to ask each one of them to tell his story of what he
  had seen. <br> Every man told precisely the same story. In all there were twelve men. I failed somehow to get the
  names of two of the fellows but here are the names of the other nine: Dave Donegan, Al Durand, Dave Remick, Michael
  Gallegos, Richard Becker, Richard McGinley, Bruce Bryan, Ernie Oxford and Louis Pasko. Every one of these men will
  affirm the details of this sighting. The phenomenon did not happen fast; they all had plenty of time to observe and
  impress details on their minds. <br> All of them believed they had seen a flying saucer. Hence, I was enabled to leave
  my job with much of the stigma of untruth taken from the account of my experiences I had printed in all good faith in
  my Twentieth Century Times. <br> Among those twelve men there are two who are still deeply perplexed. They are Ernie
  Oxford and Michael Gallegos, for they had seen me drop my tools and go to the door as though beckoned by an unseen
  force. They said I behaved as though I were under a spell. Both of them started involuntarily to follow me, but on
  second thought remained on the job until I called them to come out. <br> Both of them insist that I must have received
  a message of some kind from the disk. When I told them that it was only a physical reaction and a deep intuitive
  feeling that space visitors were near, they believed i was holding something back from them. For they said that for a
  moment they too had felt something indescribable. With that I agree fully and I was happy that I was no longer alone.
  <br> Friday, Aigist 28th was my last work night at Lockheed. I was outside working on an airplane part. That night Don
  Quinn was my partner. He was among those most skeptical of my saucer experiences and like the others he always
  insisted upon talking about them when we were together. He was telling me what a big mistake I was making in giving up
  my job and getting myself generally ridiculed. But I was used to such talk, and let him talk on. I glanced up into the
  sky and saw a silvery disk moving southeastward along the mountain rim. I immediately called Don's attention to it. He
  dropped his tools and stared and immediately began demanding to know what it was. "Why does it behave that way?" "How
  cna it hang in the air like that?" I didn't reply to any of his questions. <br> Suddenly, it too just disappeared.
  Poor Don stared at me incredulous and bewildered. He admitted its flight characteristics were like nothing he had ever
  seen or heard of; yet he would not fully go along with the flying saucer explanation. Actually, he could not quite
  believe his own eyes. Thus seeing is not always believing. For I have seen other persons actually see a saucer and
  refuse to believe the evidence of their own sight. <br> It was during August that many of the strange events included
  in this chapter occurred. I was also in August that a revealing press release came through International News Service
  which recalled to my mind those cases of the airplanes which mysteriously vanished in thin air. The news item follows:
  <br> PLANES SEEN OVER ARCTIC <br> Washington, Aug. 1 (INS). An Air Force spokesman disclosed today that roughly twelve
  unidentified airplanes have penetrated the U.S. defense perimeter in the Arctic within the last year. <br> The
  spokesman said that the "invaders" were not identified as Russian so no protests could be made to Soviet authorities.
  <br> Some of the planes were tracked on radarscopes while others were seen to give off white vapor streaks. But before
  U.S. fighter pilots could give chase, they would myssteriously disappear out of radar range, the spokesman said. <br>
  He asserted that the "raiders" crossed the edge of the U.S. radar perimeter in Greenland and Alaska, but added they
  also flew elsewhere over the North American continent. <br> The Air Force has given pilots strict orders not to fire
  upon any unidentified plane unless a "hostile" act has been committed or is about to be, such as a bomber flying over
  U.S. territory with its bombbay doors open. <br> Could it be that those mysterious "disappearing airplanes" I had seen
  had penetrated the U.S. defense perimeter in the Arctic? <br> On the following day a counter-release came through
  International News Service. This counter-release negated all of the information given out in the first release. <br>
  These contradictory reports followed an already definitely established pattern. fficial news releases of a mystifying
  nature concerning the saucers are invariably followed up by counter releases or actual retractions of previous
  statements. <br> As irritating and confusing as such contradictory reports are to the public, nevertheless this method
  of handling UFO information by the authorities is best for everyone concerned. For with a little thought, it is clear
  that such mystifying news stories without an official damper placed upon them immediately, might easily flare up into
  a nationwideonflagration of panic and hysteria. Official headquarters would be snowed under with avalanches of
  telegrams, letters, phone calls and personal inquiries. Thus only further confusion would result. <br> The story of
  the extra-terrestrials is one that no one can or will ever beable to finish with any degree of finality. It is my
  sincere personal belief that the Air Force and other responsible offices have responded to and handled the problems of
  space visitors precisely as sthose visitors have anticipated and desired them to do. As more and more thinking persons
  realize this significant fact, we will be prepared for greater revelations to come. <br> Perhaps it would be well to
  state here that in the cases of disappearing aircraft I do not believe the ships dematerialize or dissolve into
  nothingness, as it would appear. Being composed primarily of a crystalline substance the ships may give the illusion
  of complete transparency or, if so controlled, they can be rendered entirely opaque. Thus, also, they can manifest any
  color or combination of colors, depending upon the energy employed and its control on the molecular substance of the
  crystal body. <br> It is no problem for the crystal disks to project visual images of ordinary aircraft and similarly
  to produce the auditory vibrations of aircraft engines. These projections may be easily picked up on a radar screen.
  <br> <br> Chapter VII <br> FLYING SAUCER CONVENTION IN HOLLYWOOD <br> <br> During those last days I was at Lockheed I
  thought often of Neptune's cryptic words: "The road will open, Orfeo; walk it as you will," And later when he said: "I
  smile upon you, Orfeo, for your greatly enhanced numbers." <br> Then his last prophetic words, "Strength and courage
  will be given to the millions who will rise and meet the great battles ahead with only a faint hope on their side for
  victory." <br> It was true, I thought; the road was beginning to open. New understandings and an ever increasing
  awareness were coming to me as time passed. Also, as more and more people learned of my experiences many began to
  phone, write, or visit at our home, wishing to know more about the space visitors. We continued the regular meetings
  at the Los Felix Club House, but as the crowds increased, the Club House was know longer large enough to accommodate
  everyone. It was then that Max Miller, President of the Flying Saucers International, an organizational devoted to the
  study of flying saucer phenomena, and Jerome Criswell, the well-known columnist and television Man of Prophecy,
  suggested that we rent the music room in the famous old Hollywood Hotel for our weekly meetings. Thus we had been
  meeting their for several months every Sunday or afternoon. Opinions were exchanged and lectures on saucer phenomena
  were presented to enthusiastic audiences. <br> Paradoxically enough, as the general public's interest in the saucers
  increased, the press, radio, television and other news media suddenly and inexplicably dropped flying saucers from the
  news. Even the second-rate science fiction writers banished the word from their lexicon of horrors. Thus the public
  was left to grope for itself. And surprisingly enough the way was thus cleared for those individuals who had
  experienced actual contacts with the extraterrestrials to work freely without obstruction of erroneous "slanting" by
  official reporting. <br> Gerald Heard, Frank Scully and Donald Keyhoe were familiar names among persons interested in
  the saucers. These men, along with fate magazine and Ray Palmer, had been making every effort to awaken the public to
  the awesome fact that our world might well be under observation by beings from another planet. But now several unknown
  men were speaking up and declaring that they had actually had contact with the saucers and space visitors. Among those
  were George Van Tassel, Truman Betherum, George Adamski, George Williamson and Alfred Bailey. Those few newspapers
  which ran stories on these men did so with the tongue-in-cheek slant. <br> Sunday afternoons I was speaking to groups
  at the Hollywood Hotel. I knew that my audience waited patiently for clear, concise, accounts of my experiences with
  extraterrestrials. But they were often disappointed. Frequently when I stepped upon the platform to speak a strange
  transition came over me. It was as though another personality overshadowed me; someone who knew all the answers. But
  the answers were not in my familiar English or Italian, but in an unfamiliar, half-remembered tongue. I would struggle
  to translate the ideas into English and end up by failing to be clear and direct. Thus with the understanding of the
  universe almost within my grasp, I was often helpless to reveal any part of it. <br> Nevertheless less, even with my
  many failures to be concise and direct, the meetings gained momentum with increasing numbers in the audience. <br> It
  was then that Max Miller conceived the idea of a Flying Saucer Convention. It sounded like a tremendous idea to me.
  With the help of several other persons we enthusiastically began to formulate plans. It was decide that we should hold
  the convention at the Hollywood Hotel where there was plenty of room in the lobby to accommodate a large audience.
  <br> Various exhibits of saucer photographs, space ship models, books, magazines and pamphlets on the saucers were set
  up around the lobby and many circulars were mailed out announcing the event. Also invitations to speak at the
  convention were mailed to all persons who had been most helpful in revealing and disseminating information about the
  saucers and extraterrestrials. <br> But response to the invitations was very poor. Less than a week before the
  convention was to open it appeared that none of the speakers that we had counted upon would be present. Max was
  greatly worried. "It looks like we're sunk, Orfeo," he exclaimed dejectedly. "This thing is going to be the prize flop
  of any and all conventions." <br> But as I looked at him, the conviction was suddenly strongly in my mind that
  everything would come off well. I replied: "Don't worry, Max. It's going to come off much better than we ever dreamed
  it would." <br> My prediction proved entirely correct. Everyone of the speakers whom we had invited showed up for the
  convention, and some others besides. Among the invited speakers were Frank scully, Arthur Luis Joquel II, George Van
  Tassel, George Adamski, Truman Betherum, John Otto from Chicago, Harding Walsh and a mysterious Dr. "X" who spoke long
  and eloquently on the saucers. He left immediately after speaking and no one ever knew who he really was or where he
  came from, although many inquired; for he had some startling things to say. <br> Almost to a man the speakers said
  they had received an irresistible urge to attend on Friday (two days before the opening of the convention). Could it
  be that the space visitors had been at work in their subtle way? <br> At any rate the convention was a tremendous
  success. For three days and nights the crowds overflowed the Hollywood Hotel out onto the lawns and adjacent Hollywood
  Boulevard. In fact the response was so tremendous that on the second morning I requested Max to stop all publicity on
  the convention. Some of the larger Los Angeles newspapers covered the convention. But all news stories were of the
  tongue-in-cheek type. A few of the smaller, more rabid papers tried to "expose" it as nothing but a promotional
  "money-making" scheme. <br> The convention was a hectic one. I was busy night and day and carried on practically
  without sleep. When I wasn't speaking, people were surrounding me and bombarding me with endless questions. Many were
  speaking at the weekly meetings and the three nerve-wracking days of the convention, I never once lost my temper. A
  power beyond my own consciousness or control carried me through. In trying moments of heckling or confusion an
  upsurgence of peace and calm would pick me up and give me strength equal to the occasion. <br> However, on the last
  night of the convention, the power that was sustaining me suddenly failed and I lost my temper for the first time. A
  lone women who had been especially persistent in seeking me out and cornering me to revile me and hurl quotes of
  scripture at me was responsible for the outburst. She knew I was wrong and she was right. And she had books, diagrams
  and bible verses to prove it. When at last I literally blew my top she joyfully picked up her data and departed
  shouting that my temper proved I was an agent of the devil. Within an hour I lost my temper several times again. <br>
  The most trying experience of the convention occurred when a large group of materialists were literally "giving me the
  works" in a stubborn, derisive effort to "get to the bottom of my story" and ferret out obvious flaws from a "from a
  common-sense viewpoint. <br> Sincere, open-minded, honest persons who are willing to investigate the event of space
  visitors never resort to such sneering interrogations. They ask honest, sincere questions on points they fully do not
  understand. But they have an honest desire to know, not to discredit, to sneer and to disparage. <br> This particular
  group had their minds set upon "exposing" me. Their methods, although entirely on a mental plane, would make the
  medieval inquisitions seem innocuous. Like little demons they parroted elementary physics and could see practical,
  intelligent action only behind the Iron Curtain. They knew that I was a cheap publicity seeker who did not hesitate to
  lie about space visitors or anything else to further my own ends. No words of explanation could possibly prove
  anything to them they did not wish to believe. <br> I had undergone just as bitter and insinuating criticism before,
  but I was exceptionally tired that last night. I felt almost though I were melting away before venomous onslaught,
  collapsing at the seams, as it were, and suddenly I felt very, very human and down to earth. I was on the verge of
  exploding in anger again when a kind of veil was drawn over my conscious mind. The gesticulating figures before me
  faded to babbling, inconsequential shadows. <br> As they continued their violent attacks, my thoughts drifted calmly
  back to a scene of a few weeks before. I was attending a convention of science fiction writers at the Hotel Commodore
  on Los Angeles. Since my experiences with the extraterrestrials, I have become interested in the field of
  science-fiction, for I have found that many scientific truths are adumbrated, or delineated, in science-fiction before
  ever they become realties of our own world. <br> Many well known writers in the science-fiction field were present.
  When I came in they were holding open discussions of trends in the science-fiction, the various new markets, etc. <br>
  One of the audience asked: "Why have all science fiction writers suddenly stopped writing or even mentioning flying
  saucers?" <br> A speaker replied authoritatively that the subject had become taboo with them. <br> Another member of
  the audience demanded to know why this was so since the saucers had actually given such an impetus to the
  science-fiction field. <br> The speaker had no adequate answer for that one, but lamely explained that the saucers
  were "old stuff" now. <br> I was becoming impatient with the proceedings and was on the point of leaving when the
  guest speaker of the evening was announced. He was Mr. Gerald Heard, the well-known science-fiction writer and author
  of IS ANOTHER WORLD WATCHING? <br> Mr. heard spoke with great eloquence and a deep, penetrating philosophy. He berated
  the writers for turning out material of an inferior grade and warned that the public would not continue to "stomach
  it", much less to buy it. Many of them squirmed uncomfortably in their seats. <br> As he neared the end of his
  stimulating and thought-provoking talk, his eyes met mine where I was seated near the back with two companions. I
  noticed that he seemed tired and shaken. <br> As our eyes met and held a kind of mutual understanding passed between
  us in ever widening circles. Dimly, I could hear him terminating his speech with these words: There is one in this
  room tonight--I do not know he is, but he's going to upset the whole apple cart." He paused, then his voice
  reverberated as he added: "He is the Awakener--he has not yet appeared, but he well may be here in this room tonight.
  Thank you." <br> And the mystic wheels between us set in motion by the controlled magnetic vortices slowly receded and
  vanished. <br> I looked about the room at the audience, but they were no longer listening to him. Some were whispering
  and laughing among themselves. <br> As I looked about that busy room I thought that it was small wonder that the
  concoctors of science-fiction horror diets had declared the saucers "taboo". Far too much beautiful reality was on the
  side of the saucers. Harmony and beauty are much too tame for the horror boys. They have joined forces with the
  materialists, subversives and egotists to fight the "flying saucer sensationalists" down at every turn. <br> But the
  joke is on them, for reality slipped quietly past them and established new frontiers of its own. The
  science-fictioneers were induced by subtle forces to ignore flying saucers as were many other materialistic sources of
  information. During the welcome lull the actual flying saucer phenomena and the extra-terrestrials were left to the
  inexperienced but honest handling of rank amateurs. At first these men were inept and inarticulate, but they are
  finding their voices and their numbers rapidly increasing. The space visitors had actually only cleared the atmosphere
  for them. Had the professional spinners of horror-fiction stuck to the theme of flying saucers, the true contacts
  could never have been able to perform their missions. <br> <br> <br> Chapter VIII <br> MY AWAKENING ON ANOTHER PLANET
  <br> <br> It was in the late summer of 1953 that the most beautiful and revealing of all of my experiences with the
  etheric beings developed. My life had been a kaleidoscope of new understandings and changing patterns since the night
  of my trip in the saucer, but apparently the most profound of all had to be revealed to my conscious mind in gradual
  steps of understanding, because the experience itself actually occurred in January of 1953 while I was still on the
  job at Lockheed, but it was not until six months later that I had any idea of the tremendous experience that had been
  mine. During those bewildering intervening six months I honestly believed that for seven days of my life in January,
  1953 I had been a victim of complete amnesia. I told no one about it, not even Mabel, for so many confounding things
  had happened in the recent months of my life that I feared further complicating matters by relating an experience for
  which there seemed to be no explanation. <br> During those six months I experienced many very strange and disquieting
  hours. Vivid dreams of a hauntingly beautiful, half-familiar world troubled my sleep. Sometimes I would awaken
  trembling and bathed in perspiration feeling that I was close to conscious remembrance of an exquisitely beautiful
  experience that would explain many things. Also, frequently during the days, fleeting, tenuous memories drifted into
  the borderland of my consciousness. <br> Even more perplexing were those occasions when, while speaking to groups of
  persons at the Hollywood Hotel, I felt as though I were being somehow overshadowed by another greater personality; a
  personality who thought neither in my familiar English or Italian, but in a strange language which it seemed I once
  knew but now could no longer remember. <br> In order to clarify the experience itself, I must go back to that day in
  January, 1953 when it began. I did not go to work that afternoon as I was just recovering from the flu, but I was
  feeling so much better that I believed I could go back on the job the following day. Mabel was at work at the cafe and
  I was alone. About four o'clock a rather strange, detached feeling came over me. I was aware of a familiar odd
  prickling sensation in my arms and the back of my neck which usually announced the proximity of space craft. <br> I
  discounted the strange symptoms thinking they were only the result of my illness. Then suddenly I began to feel so
  drowsy that I could scarcely keep my eyes open. I remember starting toward the divan to lie down for a nap, but I
  later had absolutely no recollection of reaching that divan. <br> My next conscious perception was a peculiar
  "awakening" or regaining consciousness while on my job in the Plastics Department at Lockheed. Stupefied and
  bewildered I looked uncertainly about the factory. Dazedly, I recognized the familiar faces of my co-workers...and
  noticed the tools in my hands. I caught my breath sharply and an icy shiver quivered over my entire body as quite
  involuntarily I recoiled with a shudder from the entire scene. I didn't know why then, but everything seemed
  hopelessly wrong, primitive and crude. <br> In a daze I rubbed a hand across my eyes hoping to eradicate the scene.
  Then I was seized with a blinding vertigo and thought I was going to lose consciousness. Dave Donnegan, my working
  partners, looked at me sympathetically, and there was genuine concern in his eyes. He didn't say anything, but quietly
  took the tools from my hand and in his quiet, understanding way went ahead, carrying on alone. <br> An involuntary
  outburst of utter disgust came from my lips, disgust with everything I saw. It seemed like the Dark Ages. I remember
  hearing Dave say: "Are you all right, boy?" <br> I didn't reply; I couldn't! In panic I turned to rush out of the
  door. In my bland haste I bumped roughly into Richard Butterfield, the temporary lead man in my section. I must have
  looked acutely ill because I vaguely remember seeing the alarm in his eyes as he grasped me firmly but gently by the
  shoulders and exclaimed: "Angie! Angie! What's wrong with you!" <br> I was breathing hard. Both emotionally and
  mentally I was confused and uncertain. My <br> thoughts were in turmoil. I had only one objective; to get out of that
  place! But the presence of Butterfield had a stabilizing, quieting effect upon me. <br> He smiled reassuringly while
  keeping his hands upon my shoulders. "Clam down, Angie, old boy," he said gently. "Go upstairs and take a break. You
  look beat!" <br> I mumbled my heartfelt thanks and stumbled up the steps, not yet aware of what actually had happened
  to me. <br> I got a cup of coffee. Never before had I needed one so badly. My hands were shaking and every nerve in my
  body was quivering. As I drank the hot, aromatic stuff I tried to think back, to remember why I was so shaken and
  upset. But my last recollection before my strange, perturbed "awakening" on the job, was walking toward the divan in
  my apartment The intervening period was a total blank. <br> Noticing a copy of the Los Angeles Times on one of the
  tables, I nervously picked it up and glanced at the date. Perspiration broke out on my forehead: the date of the paper
  was January 19, 1953. Seven days had elapsed of which I had absolutely no recollection! But even the date on the paper
  couldn't convince me. Trying to keep my voice casual, I asked a worker at a nearby table. He confirmed the date on the
  newspaper. <br> My body was bathed in cold perspiration. I was on the edge of panic as I sat there, my hands trembling
  so that I could hardly take a sip of coffee. I couldn't believe that seven days and nights had passed, leaving not a
  trace of memory in my mind. <br> Later in the afternoon when I was feeling a little better I went back downstairs on
  the job. But it was a real effort to behave in a normal, rational manner with my thoughts in turmoil. Cautiously and
  discreetly I questioned Dave and other fellow workers about those seven previous days. From their replies I gathered
  that I had been on the job every day and had apparently behaved in my usual manner until my strange"awakening and
  violent outburst that afternoon. <br> At home I didn't mention my inexplicable loss of memory to Mabel. And apparently
  she had noticed nothing unusual in my behavior during that entire week. It seemed that in every way I had behaved in
  my accustomed manner. I had eaten my meals, slept, gone to and from work and helped <br> Mabel out at the Snack Bar,
  as usual. It was fantastically incredible! <br> I told no one what had happened to me. But in my own mind I was
  utterly baffled and deeply troubled about those seven lost days out of my life. Imagine yourself in my place. Suppose
  that for an entire week your waking consciousness had been obliterated so that you could not remember a single event.
  Wouldn't you be deeply disturbed? Wouldn't you begin to wonder if you might not be psychopathic? In all sincerity I
  can tell that you would, for those were my own panic-stricken thoughts. <br> But as the days passed I gradually
  settled down into the routine of daily life. Often I tried hard to regain the memory of those seven lost days, but it
  seemed hopeless. <br> Months passed and I had about decided that for those seven days I had suffered from complete
  loss of memory. Except for the disquieting thoughts and vivid dreams, I had no intimation of what was coming until
  that memorable night in the first week in September, 1953. <br> I was feeling unusually restless that evening. Shortly
  after ten o'clock I went out for a walk. As always, my feet seemed involuntarily to carry me toward the Hyperion
  Avenue Freeway Bridge. In its dark, mysterious shadows I always found a kind of spiritual peace and comfort, for it
  was there I had met and talked with Neptune, the man from another world! <br> I was thinking of these things as I
  clambered down the concrete embankment into the almost dry bed of the Los Angeles River. Walking over to the spot
  where Neptune had talked with me, I sat down disconsolately upon the ground. I rested my head upon the stone where he
  had sat, and gazed thoughtfully up into the heavens and thought of the spiraling, endless wonders of the universe.
  Lost in reverie, a feeling of deep inner peace and tranquillity came over me. Noisy, clattering Earth with all of its
  troubles, dissensions and animosities seemed remote and relatively unimportant. <br> As my thoughts drifted
  pleasantly, I felt again the odd sensation which was always my first awareness of space visitors. But I was deeply
  puzzled, for Neptune had last told me: "We will return, Orfeo; but not to you." <br> <br> Nevertheless the odd
  tingling in my arms and back of my neck was unmistakable. hopefully, my eyes scanned the heavens. I saw nothing that
  in any way resembled a saucer. The intensity of the vibration increased, dimming the awareness of my conscious mind
  much as it had the night I had first encountered the saucer. <br> As in a dream my thoughts drifted back to that
  mysterious Monday afternoon six months before when, feeling much as I did now, I had walked toward the divan to take a
  nap. An astonishing thing was happening: I was beginning to remember, faintly, hazily, at first, like the sun's golden
  rays breaking through black clouds. <br> As memory flooded back I clearly recalled again that Monday afternoon. I was
  walking towards the divan...my eyes were so heavy I could scarcely keep them open. In a daze I sank down upon the
  divan and immediately fell into a deep sleep! <br> Only now I could remember waking from that sleep! My awakening was
  in a strange and wonderful world! I was no longer upon Earth; some fantastic transition had taken place. I awoke in a
  huge, fabulously beautiful room; a room the substance of which glowed ethereally with soft, exquisite colors. I was
  lying upon a luxurious couch, or lounge. Half awake, I glanced down at my body - but it was not familiar! My body was
  never so perfectly proportioned or of so fine coloring and texture. <br> I noticed that I was wearing only a fine
  white garment, closely fitted and covering my chest, torso and upper part of my thighs. A finely wrought gold belt was
  about my waist. Although the belt appeared to be made of heavy links of embossed gold, it was without weight. My new
  body felt amazingly light and ethereal and vibrant with life. <br> Full consciousness did not come to me at once. My
  first thoughts upon waking in that shining world were nebulous. Somehow the thought persisted in my mind that I was
  recovering from a long and serious illness. Thus I reclined there in a kind of pleasant lethargy as one does who has
  been very ill. Random thoughts drifted in my consciousness. Everything was so new and different and yet it was
  hauntingly familiar. My handsome new body was not my body, and yet it was! The exquisite room with its ethereal,
  softly glowing colors was like nothing ever dreamed of upon Earth, and yet somehow it was not strange and alien to me.
  Only one thing seemed unfamiliar: far away outside the huge, windowless room I could hear the continuous rumble of
  distant thunder. Oddly enough the thunder did not fill me with apprehension as had always been the case in the past.
  <br> Gradually the dark mists began clearing from my mind. Incredible memories were coming back to me; memories of
  another world, a different people - another life! Lost horizons, deep-buried memories, forgotten vistas were surfacing
  to my consciousness. <br> "I remember this world!" I thought rapturously. "I remember it in the same way that a
  condemned prisoner remembers the sunshine, the trees, the flowers of the outside world after an eternity chained in a
  dark and odious prison. This is my real world, my true body. I have been lost in a dimension called Time and a captive
  in a forbidding land called Earth. But now, somehow, I have come home. All is serenity, peace, harmony and
  indescribable beauty here. The only disturbing factor is a troublesome half-memory of an unhappy shadow named Orfeo, a
  bondsman in a prison-world of materiality called Earth. <br> As the disturbing thoughts of this lost Orfeo troubled
  me, a portion of one wall noiselessly divided making an imposing doorway, and a woman entered. She was dazzlingly
  beautiful. Somehow my mind understood that she was the one in whose charge I was placed, even as I also understood
  that the mysterious door opened and closed automatically by means of electro-magnetic controls. <br> She looked down
  at me and smiled warmly. Her beauty was breath-taking. She was dressed simply in a kind of Grecian gown of glowing
  silvery-white substance; her hair was golden and fell in soft waves about her shoulders; her eyes were extremely
  large, expressive and deep blue. Soft shimmering colors played continuously about her, apparently varying with every
  slight change of her thought or mood. <br> Hauntingly, the thought was in my mind that I remembered her from
  somewhere. She seemed to sense my perplexity and reassuringly said that I was looking very well and would soon be up
  and about. Then she touched a control on a crystal cabinet near my bed. In response a large section of the opposite
  wall opened revealing a huge mirror. I looked into its crystal depths, but the man I saw was not Orfeo; nor yet was he
  a stranger to me. Paradoxically, I remembered and yet I didn't remember! <br> "I have gained weight," I remarked, not
  knowing just why I made such a statement, then added: "Also, I feel much better now." <br> She smiled and replied: "On
  the contrary, you have lost weight. According to all Earthly standards you are now almost weightless." <br> Her
  strange words puzzled me. I glanced down at my body which appeared to be solidly substantial in addition to being much
  larger and more finely proportioned <br> "It's all a matter of the scale of vibration in which you are functioning,"
  she explained. "The vibratory rate of dense matter which makes up the planet Earth is extremely low, hence Earthly
  bodies are sluggish, dense and cumbersome. Vibratory rates here are quite high and matter so tenuous that it would
  seem non-existent were you in a dense physical body. Because you are now in a body of a corresponding vibratory rate,
  the phenomena of this world is as real to you as your Earth world." <br> As I listened to her speak, I thought I
  remembered her name. "You are Lyra?" I said half questioningly. <br> She nodded her head. <br> I was about to ask her
  about herself when I was conscious again of the continuous, low rumble of thunder from outside. I became curious to go
  out of doors and look around. Turning to Lyra, I asked: "May I go outside now?" <br> She shook her head. "You are not
  yet strong enough, but I promise that before the seventh day you shall see all, Neptune." <br> Her words startled me.
  Why had she called me Neptune? I wondered. I was not Neptune; neither was Neptune ill! And what did she mean by the
  seventh day? <br> I was about to ask her these questions when she turned and looked expectantly toward the far wall.
  In a moment the mysterious door appeared and a tall, strikingly handsome man entered. It was Orion! In some confused
  way I recognized him at once and felt a surge of affection for him in my heart. As with Lyra, shimmering waves of
  translucent color played about him, seemingly reflecting his thoughts. He smiled warmly and said: "We have missed you,
  Neptune." <br> I brushed my hand across my eyes in a dazed way as I replied: "But I am not Neptune; there is some
  mistake." <br> "Are you certain?" he asked gently. "You will recall that Neptune was the name you gave to our brother
  who first contacted you upon Earth. That name has always held a strange, deep significance for you, perhaps because it
  was once your own name." <br> As he spoke the odd realization possessed me that he was indeed speaking the truth. In
  their world, I was, or had once been, Neptune! "But the other Neptune?" I asked. "Who, then, is he?" <br> Orion
  glanced at Lyra and a scintillating wave of golden light enfolded them both. Orion replied slowly: With us names are
  of little significance. The brother of whom you speak was in the illusion of the past known as Astra, but in the
  higher octaves of light, individualized aspects such as you know upon Earth are non-existent. Even now as we manifest
  in this most tenuous of material states of being, you are not aware of us in our true eternal aspect. We are, you
  might say in terms of Earth, staging a dress-show reception for you, our lost brother. Before the Destruction our
  existence was much as you see it now; that is why you seem to remember all of this. In that phase of the time
  dimension you were known as Neptune." <br> Something was wrong, terribly wrong, somewhere. I thought. If only I could
  remember clearly...but everything was so confused. As I gazed at those two superbly magnificent beings standing side
  by side enveloped in shimmering waves of golden light, I felt intuitively that I had known them well, sometime,
  somewhere! I had known them on an equal level - I had been one of them! But now they were like gods to me, and I a
  straggler, somehow far, far behind them, my mind deluded by a loathsome illness. I pressed my hands to my eyes, trying
  with all of my strength to remember something important - and terrible - that I had forgotten. <br> Neither of them
  spoke. Lyra took a white wafer from the crystal cabinet while Orion poured a sparkling liquid into a lavender crystal
  goblet. These they handed to me. I ate the delicately flavored wafer and drank the delicious beverage. I felt renewed
  vitality and strength flow through my body and with it a dreamy languor of mind. Lyra and Orion smiled upon me and the
  scintillating waves of golden light reached out from them and enfolded me in a warm comforting glow. <br> "Sleep for a
  while, Neptune," Lyra murmured softly. Then the mysterious door appeared and they left arm in arm, leaving me alone.
  The light in the room dimmed and waves of soft, exquisite music flowed from the walls. I fell into a deep, dreamless
  sleep. <br> When I awoke light was streaming brilliantly into the room. One entire wall had miraculously vanished
  revealing an outer balcony. I sat up and looked out beyond the balcony upon an incredibly wonderful and fantastic
  world. It was radiant with light and yet there appeared to be a heavy moving cloud bank overhead. Continuous sheet
  lightning flashed through the rainbow-hued clouds and the constant rumble of distant thunder was slightly louder.
  Also, I saw brilliant slow-moving fireballs, bollides, varied-colored flares and showers of brilliant sparks. <br> I
  was deeply puzzled, for all of this phenomena did not seem at all familiar as had so many other things in this world.
  I jumped up from the couch and ran out onto the broad balcony, marveling at the wonderful feeling of lightness and
  vibrant strength in my body. <br> What a glorious world I looked upon! A dream world, beyond the wildest flight of
  imagination. Ethereal, scintillating color everywhere. Fantastically beautiful buildings constructed of a kind of
  crystal-plastic substance that quivered with continuously changing color hues. As I watched, windows, doors, balconies
  and stairs appeared and just as miraculously disappeared in the shining facades of the buildings. The grass, trees and
  flowers sparkled with living colors that seemed almost to glow with a light of their own. <br> I caught my breath in
  awe. And yet, somehow, it was familiar; a world I had once known, and forgotten! A few statuesque and majestically
  beautiful people were walking in the pedestrian lanes. No vehicles of any type were visible. Then I saw Lyra and Orion
  conversing with each other near a large circular flower garden, almost directly below me. They both looked up and
  smiled, calling out a friendly greeting. I ran down and joined them exclaiming: "What a magnificent world!" <br> "Do
  you remember it, Neptune? Lyra asked gently. <br> I hesitated, then replied: "Much is familiar, but other things are
  not. I can't recall the lightning and the constant thunder. And the horizon appears to be only about a mile distant
  and it should be - I seem to remember it was almost limitless!" <br> For a moment there was deep silence. Lyra glanced
  questioningly at Orion and a look of deep pain crossed their faces as the golden waves of iridescent light about them
  changed to misty purple. I realized immediately I had said the wrong thing. <br> Lyra touched a crystal she held in
  her hand and the sound of the thunder was muffled until it was barely audible. Then drifts of exquisite harmony filled
  the air; the same ethereal music I had heard in my trip in the saucer - only here in this incredible world each tone
  also manifested in the atmosphere as waves of glowing color. <br> I listened and watched spellbound. Lyra and Orion
  sat down upon the grass and motioned for me to join them. When we were seated Lyra laid her hand tenderly upon mine
  and Orion put an arm about my shoulders. <br> Then Orion spoke, saying: "Time is a dimension as your scientists now
  correctly surmise. But it is only a dimension when applied to the various densities of matter. In the absolute, or
  non-material states of consciousness, Time is non-existent. So let us say that in one of the time frames or
  dimensions, there was once a planet in the solar system of Earth, called Lucifer. It was of the least material density
  of any of the planets. Its orbit lay between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Among the etheric beings, or heavenly
  hosts, it was called the Morning Star. Among all planets it was the most radiant planet in the universe. <br> "The
  name of the prince of this shining planet was also Lucifer, a beloved Son of God." Orion paused and the sadness
  deepened in his eyes. Then he continued: "Earth's legends about Lucifer and his hosts are true. Pride and arrogance
  grew in the heart of Lucifer and in the hearts of many Luciferians. They discovered all of the secrets of matter and
  also the great secret of the Creative Word. Eventually they sought to turn this omnipotent force against their
  brothers who were less selfish. Also against the etheric beings and the Father, or Source, for it became their desire
  to rule the universe. You know the rest of the legend: how Lucifer and his followers were cast down from their high
  estate. In simpler words, the Luciferians who were embodied then in the most attenuated manifestation of matter "fell"
  into embodiments in one of the most dense material evolutions, which is the animalistic evolution of Earth." <br> I
  dared not look at him as his frightening words struck dark chords of memory in my heart. "Then you mean that I...was
  one of them?" Shamed tears of realization blinded my eyes. <br> "Yes, Neptune," he said gently, as both he and Lyra
  put their arms around me. <br> Waves of bitter shame and sorrow flooded over me as I realized the terrible truth of
  Orion's words. At last I said haltingly: "But Orion, you and Lyra and these others walking here in the garden; who are
  they" <br> "We were among those who did not join the Luciferians in their revolt against the etheric hosts, " he
  explained gently. "Thus although the Luciferians shattered our radiant planet in the holocaust of their war, we
  entered the etheric, non-material worlds in the higher octaves of light as liberated Sons of God, while the Luciferian
  hosts fell into the dream of mind in matter upon the dark planet of sorrows." <br> "But this world?" I asked in
  bewilderment. "Isn't it the world I half remember?" <br> "Yes, Neptune," Lyra said compassionately. "This is a tiny
  part of what is left of that world. You mentioned that many things were unfamiliar, such as the thunder and lightning
  and the nearness of the horizon. These conditions are new to you. For we are on one of the larger planetoids of the
  shattered planet Lucifer. It is only a few hundred miles in diameter, hence the nearness of the horizon. The thunder,
  lightning and constant play of color phenomena in the atmosphere are the result of magnetic disturbances because of
  the vicinity of other asteroids. The clouds you see above are not clouds as you know them upon Earth, but they serve
  to obscure the debris of our wrecked planet. Only rarely do we leave our etheric state of being and enter our former
  time frame in individualized manifestations as you see us now." <br> I was stunned into utter silence and the deepest
  sorrow. I bowed my head as I thought of the magnificent world I had lost, the great heritage I had cast away to become
  a bondsman chained in a steel like dungeon of dense matter with its erroneous manifestations of sin, sickness,
  corruption, evil, decay and repeated deaths. Sobs wracked my body as I thought of my blinded, lost fellows of Earth.
  At last I murmured hesitantly: "Then all of the peoples of Earth have fallen from this former high estate?" <br> Orion
  shook his head. "No, not all, Neptune, but vast numbers of Earthlings are former Luciferians. About the others we will
  explain to you later. The revelation when it comes will explain many of the enigmas of your planet." <br> Suddenly, a
  terrible thought came to me, almost causing me to collapse in horror as I recoiled from it. Stark terror was in my
  eyes as I looked first at Lyra and then at Orion. I dared not voice what was in my mind. <br> Orion, discerning my
  thought, shook his head and his wonderful eyes radiated sympathy and understanding as he said: "No, Neptune, have no
  fear, you are not in reality Lucifer. In fact you are one of the Luciferians who least wanted to join the others."
  <br> Relief flooded over me leaving me weak and shaken as I heard Orion's voice continuing: "Lucifer is presently
  incarnated upon Earth, but we may not disclose to you his present identity. He had incarnated many times upon Earth
  and every name is familiar even to grade school children. But some of those names would surprise you, for they are not
  what you might expect." <br> I sighed heavily, trying to comprehend all the shattering things which had been revealed
  to me by Lyra and Orion. Rather incongruously I remembered the phenomena of the flying saucers upon Earth, which
  caused me to ask: "But if we destroyed your great planet, why are your disks visiting Earth now? Why did Astra contact
  me? Why don't you leave us to the fate we deserve, each one of us buried in his individual grave of living death?"
  <br> Lyra's hand gripped mine and Orion's arm tightened around my shoulders. "Love is stronger than life and deeper
  than the boundless depths of time and space," he said softly. "While our brothers are lost in the hell of unreality
  and turn their blinded, imploring eyes to the mute heavens, we can never forget them. We intercede unceasingly for
  your peoples' liberation. Thus today every bondsman upon Earth has within himself the power through the mystery of the
  Etheric Christ Spirit to cancel his captivity. <br> "Eventually all of mankind deep-drowned in Time and Matter, will
  surface to reality when they recognize their basic unity of being. When man is for man honestly and sincerely and not
  selfishly arrayed against himself, the hour of deliverance from the underworld will be close at hand. We wait now
  beyond the great, sad river of Time and Sorrows with open arms and hearts to receive among us our lost and prodigal
  brothers in that great day when they rejoin us as liberated Sons of God. <br> "Our disks, or saucers as Earthmen term
  them, are in your space-time frame as harbingers of mankind's coming resurrection from the living death. Although our
  disks are essentially etheric; that is, non-material, they are controlled in such a way that they can almost
  instantaneously attract substance to take on any degree of material density necessary. Various other types of space
  craft are now permitted to visit Earth for certain purposes. These are from other worlds and also space islands of
  various densities of matter. Some are on the borderline between materiality and non-materiality. But all are operated
  by intelligences highly spiritual in nature. All are on a mission of love to their brothers of the Dark World, but
  mankind's understanding of their ultimate intent and purpose will only become fully apparent further along in Earth's
  Time Dimension. We do not say that there are no negatives in the universe who have not attained primitive modes of
  space travel, but at present Earth is fully protected from these by both cosmic law and the etheric host." <br> When
  Orion finished speaking there was silence. I sat with bowed head and contrite heart as realization of the full import
  of his words came to me. As Neptune, fleetingly restored to my lost immortal state, I saw that we of Earth are in
  reality in an underworld of illusion where we mistake false shadows for reality and dream selfish dreams of
  separateness from our brothers. <br> As these thoughts were in my mind the ringing of musical chimes sounded from the
  sea-green building. As though this was a signal everyone arose and entered the building. Orion led us to a large
  dining hall. Five men and five women were already there standing at their places at a huge table. At one end of the
  table was a cross wing with three vacant places. Orion indicated that I should take the middle place while he and Lyra
  seated themselves on either side of me. <br> It was an exquisite room and although there appeared to be no direct
  source of light the room was brilliantly lighted; the substance and colors of the room and everything in it seemed to
  glow with a soft, radiant light of their own. Vaguely, I seemed to remember the other persons present and they spoke
  to me as to an old friend. It was soon apparent, however, that the conversation was for my sole benefit as it was
  obvious that everyone else exchanged thoughts telepathically. As they did so iridescent clouds of color about them
  changed swiftly in shimmering hues and patterns. <br> No servants waited upon the table. Yet it was laid out
  exquisitely with the most delicate plates and shimmering silverware. On each plate were three portions. A triangle
  portion of pale amber; a square portion of varying shades of green; and a round portion of lavender. The beverage was
  clear and sparkling in a crystal goblet. These strange delicacies were the most delicious and delicately flavored
  foods I had ever tasted. And the sparkling drink seemed to give immediate renewed strength and energy. <br> When the
  splendid meal was finished and everyone was preparing to leave the table, I turned and looked at Lyra. Suddenly, I was
  fully aware for the first time of all her exquisite feminine beauty and loveliness. Involuntarily, a wave of desire
  for her swept over me. She turned away from me and all conversation in the room ceased. I glanced hastily about; all
  of the others were standing silently with bowed heads. On an opposite wall I saw my reflection in a huge mirror and
  embarrassment flooded over me as I saw an ugly mottled red and black cloud enveloping my head and shoulders. <br> I
  felt impure and unworthy to be in that shining assemblage. The others left quietly, but I had the comforting feeling
  of their deep sympathy for me and their understanding for my human weakness. Also, I had the strong telepathic
  impression that sexual desire is merely another of the erroneous manifestations of materiality. Upon Earth it is
  neither wrong nor sinful in any of its manifestations except when it is used for selfish, destructive and cruel
  purposes. If motivated by love, altruism and unselfishness the sexual appetite is no more erroneous than any of
  mankind's other desires. But in the higher spiritual worlds it is non-existent. <br> Orion touched my arm as we were
  leaving the hall. "We understand," he said kindly. "It is nothing, as you realize now." <br> I smiled gratefully at
  him. But I felt tired and very sleepy. He and Lyra accompanied me to my room where I lay down upon the couch. They sat
  beside me until I fell into a deep sleep. <br> When I awoke I was alone. I walked outside onto the terrace, but the
  grounds were deserted. For a long while I stood there alone on the balcony marveling at that fantastically beautiful
  world. Apparently it was a world of eternal youth, eternal spring and eternal day. The rainbow-hued clouds were always
  moving overhead shot with soft waves of sheet lightning, and the far-away echo of thunder never entirely ceased. The
  trees, flowers and grass were miracles of color, fire and light which in comparison made the remembered counterfeits
  of Earth seem like gross, dull shadows. <br> As I stood there marveling, I saw Lyra come out of the adjoining
  building. She called a warm greeting. I saw she was holding a small crystal object in her hand. When she joined me she
  said mysteriously: "This is the seventh Earth day and through ourselves we shall take you back. <br> Her strange,
  beautiful eyes were upon me, seeming to look through and beyond me. She did not address me either as Neptune, or
  Orfeo. This saddened me, for it made me realize that I was now a stranger and an imposter in their shining world. <br>
  Understanding my thought, she put her hand gently over mine and I saw a mist of tears in her eyes. Then she raised the
  odd crystal in her hand to her forehead. As though in magic response, a flood of beautiful melody arose from the
  sea-green building; not the ethereal music of their world, but a hauntingly sad and familiar strain. I recognized the
  sublime melody of the Bach-Gounod "Ave Maria". Tears flowed unrestrainedly down my cheeks for a half-remembered, sad
  people who dwelt in a strange shadowed region called Earth. Softly she said: "You will remember this, Orfeo." <br>
  That name sounded strange upon her lips; like the name of an utter stranger. I bowed my head in bitter regret for
  Neptune who was, and who now was not - and for the false shadow of Orfeo who is! Confused and perturbed I turned
  hastily from her and hurried into my room. Somehow I had the feeling that the secret of liberation lay in the
  mysterious crystal panel near my couch. <br> But as I reached eagerly for the controls on the panel, I felt a gentle
  restraining hand upon my arm. I turned and looked into Lyra's wonderful eyes shining with sympathy, compassion and
  purest love. <br> My own heart swiftly responded. Then suddenly, miraculously we were as one being, enfolded in an
  embrace of spirit, shared by all of those in the light of God's infinite love throughout the entire universe. What a
  tragedy, I thought, that I and my lost brothers of Earth know mostly only the counterfeit embrace of sexual desire and
  animal passion. <br> At that moment Orion came in the door and as he stood transfixed, his vibrant love too enfolded
  us in its pure, golden unselfish light. All boundaries of self were lost in a unity of being. "Our lost brother is
  home at last," he said softly. <br> After awhile Orion and Lyra seated themselves near the strange crystal control
  panel and I rested upon the lounge. Orion touched a crystal disk and immediately an entire wall of the room opened up
  into a huge three-dimensional void. The room darkened and I saw the void a magnificent view into outer space. But all
  of space was shining with light; the stars and suns glowed with a deep reddish glow and only the planets appeared of
  varying degrees of darkness. The scene was focussing upon an unfamiliar part of the heavens. A sun and a number of
  encircling planets came into view. <br> Then the scene centered upon a single planet in this unknown solar system. It
  was a smug, sleek planet and apparently as efficient as a billiard ball. But it was exceedingly dark in tone and
  surrounded with concentric waves of deep gray. A tangible vibration or emanation came from it; evil, unpleasant and
  utterly without inspiration or hope. Approaching this world I saw a glowing red dot with a long, misty tail. The fiery
  dot seemed irresistible attracted to the dark world. The two collided in a spectacular fiery display. I felt Lyra's
  hand upon mine as she whispered. "It is an immutable law of the cosmos that too great a preponderance of evil
  inevitably results in self-destruction and a new beginning." <br> The scene shifted to a different part of the
  universe. Another dark misty world came into view, although it was not as dark as the first world. About this world
  there was a vibrant feeling of life and hope. But again I saw a fatalistic fiery red dot approaching and it was
  evident that this world too was doomed. I shuddered to think of conditions upon that planet at the moment of doom. But
  then I held my breath as I beheld two tiny dots coming forth from that world apparently to intercept the fiery comet.
  Intuitively I realized that the dots were remotely controlled by intelligence beings upon the planet who were
  concentrating the magnetic impulses of the dots upon the comet. Suddenly the comet exploded leaving the world
  unscathed. I breathed a sign of relief. <br> Once more the scene shifted and focused upon a third world. Obviously,
  this was an "in-between" world, neither as dark and hopeless as the first, nor yet as light and inspired as the
  second. To the left to this planet appeared another smaller body -- I recognized it as our moon and the planet as
  Earth. From the planet several tiny space ships went out to the moon and did not return. Then a tiny fleet of space
  craft went to the moon, but some of these returned to Earth. <br> Suddenly, terrifyingly, to the right of the planet
  Earth, appeared the red, dot of cosmic doom. Rapidly it increased in size leaving behind it a fiery tail of flame. It
  was evident that the comet was being drawn irresistibly toward Earth. Neither Lyra nor Orion spoke, but a strange
  voice said: "In the Time Dimension of Earth it is now the year 1986." <br> I shuddered and waited anxiously, but the
  portentous scene slowly faded from the screen. I turned excitedly to Orion. "But what happens to Earth?" <br> Orion
  and Lyra both looked compassionately at me as Orion gently replied. "That depends entirely upon your brothers of Earth
  and their progress in unity, understanding and brotherly love during the time period left them between the so-called
  now and the year 1986. All spiritual help possible will be given them, not only by ourselves but by others from all
  parts of the universe. We believe that they and their world will be saved, but in no time frame, or dimension, is the
  future ever written irrevocably. If they bring upon themselves self-destruction of their planet through a
  preponderance of evil there, it will mean another fall for the entities of Earth into even denser meshes of
  materiality and unreality. As you love your brothers of Earth, Orfeo, fight to your dying breath to help them toward a
  world of love, light and unity." <br> With those awful and awesome words, he got up and slowly walked from the room,
  leaving me alone with Lyra. <br> She smiled gently into my eyes ad touched the mysterious crystal panel. Immediately
  the incredible, huge, three-dimensional screen became active again. but no longer were we looking into the boundless
  depths of space and time. Instead, I saw the familiar outlines of the Lockheed plant in Burbank. There was the shop in
  which I worked. The scene shifted inside the plant. I saw the radomes and my working companions, Dave Donnegan and
  Richard Butterfield. An unpleasant sensation came over me as though I were fainting, as though I were fading into the
  huge screen and becoming an active part of the scene I was viewing. Terrified, I turned to call to Lyra, but she was
  no longer there, only a mist. Then I blacked out! <br> My next conscious perception was my "awakening" on the job at
  Lockheed with all of my incredible experiences of those seven days seemingly utterly obliterated from my mind. <br>
  Thus six months passed with only hazy, trouble-some intimations of what had happened to me in those seven lost days.
  But that night as I rested my head upon the rock down in the Los Angeles River bed, it all came back to me crystal
  clear. Also, I remembered my frightening, bewildered "awakening" upon Earth in the Lockheed plant, my terrible
  revulsion with everything I saw upon Earth as compared with the wonder world I had left, although as yet only my
  higher consciousness fully understood. <br> I remembered my fellow workers, Dave Donnegan and Richard Butterfield and
  their reactions to my strange behavior and apparently unreasoning outburst. In the greater scope of my new
  understanding I realized even more clearly how nobly they had caught me up and sustained me by their own strength
  through those critical moments. It was so clearly evident to me then that both Dave and Richard had the same basic
  inherent qualities of goodness and nobility as those godlike beings of that other world. They are both simple, humble
  men, average workers like myself, yet potential gods! If only they and others like them knew and could realize their
  divinity, their kinship with God and the greater world of true reality! If every man and woman upon Earth could grasp
  the great essential basic truth that we are all one and an integral part of God, then indeed all of mankind's hard
  trials and bitter tribulations would be over. Yes, if only in the abstract we could momentarily attain this
  illumination, the heavy chains of material bondage would fall from our burdened bodies and our counterfeit world of
  shadows would vanish in true light. <br> Today, I believe with all my heart, soul and body in my brothers of Earth.
  Because of the innate goodness, honesty, nobility and helpful fellowship of the countless other men and women of good
  will like Dave Donnegan and Richard Butterfield, my undying faith in and love for humanity is forever instilled. Even
  though our greater brothers of that shining, lost, wonder world should have to refuse. My lot is forever with my
  fellows of Earth! I will fight courageously with them and for them in the undying belief that the good in our hearts
  will triumph over evil. In the conviction that every human being upon Earth, trapped in eternity and granted only one
  small awareness of life at a time, will be liberated from our prison cells of unreality and attain again our high
  estate as liberated sons of God. <br> <br> Note: The language spoken by the beings of that other world was neither
  familiar English nor Italian, but another language which I fully understood and remembered while with them. But today
  my conscious mind recalls their language only as a meaningless jumble of strange words, although I have a full
  understanding in my own language of all that passed between us. I can clearly recall only a few words of that other
  language. Those words were spoken to me by Lyra when she first came into the room. I am certain she said, "Un doz e
  pez lo" (or something very similar), meaning "No, you have lost weight." <br> <br> Chapter XI <br> THE TRIP EAST <br>
  <br> Memories, fantastically beautiful memories of that other infinitely greater lost world, haunted me for days. I
  was like a different person. In the light of my new understanding my conception of all things was changed. I viewed
  everything from a new perspective. Thus I felt more than ever like a stranger here upon Earth. <br> One afternoon when
  I was in downtown Los Angeles I stood on a street corner and watched the hurrying throngs of people. All was so
  earnestly intent upon personal ambitions, pleasure, frivolities, worries and personal problems and so completely
  wrapped up in their own private worlds. Few even so much as noticed their fellow-beings on the streets. It was as
  though each person lived a world apart; encased in a tomb of separateness and living death. Like shadows they hurried
  busily on their separate ways lost in dreams of unreality. <br> I realized in truth each went his way alone; even
  those nearest and dearest to him never really touched the deeper core of his aloneness. This is the tragedy of his
  mortality. Things seem pleasant enough on the surface. Earth with its flowers, trees, sunshine; the cities with their
  paved streets and fine buildings; the trim houses with their neat lawns--all appear fair enough. But it is like a
  mirage, for the material world is a prison world where each man is a bondsman locked in a prison cell. The prison
  cells cannot be opened from without. <br> Greatly saddened, I took my car from the parking lot and drove home. A storm
  was brewing and already a fine mist of rain was in the air. I left my car at home and walked down by the Los Angeles
  River where the waters were beginning to flow in the dry and dusty riverbed. <br> All of nature seemed waiting, quiet
  and tremulous, for the life-giving drops of precious water that would drench the sun-baked land and give new life to
  the dying trees and parched hills. <br> The dense clouds were dark and ominous over-head. How symbolic, I thought, of
  our isolation from the rest of the universe. Spiritual intelligences throughout time and space dwell in unity,
  communicating throughout the universe, all a part of the great harmony of the Father; but man here on his tiny planet
  is cut off from contact with those other worlds and fully content to vision himself grandiosely as the higher
  intelligence in the universe. <br> If only we could realize how wrong we are! We exist here on our world in a kind of
  solitary confinement. Our much vaunted atmosphere is one of the bars that prevents us from escaping from our prison
  world. Also, to a great extent, it prevents contact with outside intelligences; for most of our radio and television
  waves are bounced back down to us by the many layers of ionized gases in our atmosphere and beyond. Hence it is much
  more difficult for us here on this planet to establish outer space contacts than for most other planets. <br> Why is
  this so? Why are we so completely isolated and cut off from contact with the rest of the universe? <br> I turned for
  home as the full fury of the storm broke. An onslaught of wind lashed the trees, stripping the dead leaves and
  branches from them. The rain came down in torrents and it was one of the rare occasions when lightning flashed in the
  California sky and the thunder rumbled ominously. At each flash of lightning my entire body quivered in pain. I
  reached home soaking wet and went to bed. <br> In the following weeks I continued with my weekly lectures at the
  Hollywood Hotel, but I was dissatisfied with my effort. I felt I was reaching comparatively few people when I should
  be contacting so many more. <br> Then in September, 1953, Paul Vest's first article about my trip in the flying saucer
  was published in MYSTIC magazine. Immediately letters began coming from all over the United States and even from
  Mexico and Canada. I was amazed at the public interest and the general acceptance of my story. It appeared that
  intuitively many persons had been prepared for the account. <br> Because of the article I was contacted by long
  distance telephone by a man in the East who is a well-known evangelist. His broadcasts over a large radio network a
  week. He told me in all good faith that in answer to his prayer for guidance after reading the article in MYSTIC, he
  had been shown a sign in the skies. The "sign" was the sudden appearance of a flying disk phenomenon above him while
  he prayed. He stated that he was so deeply impressed with what he saw that he drove immediately to the State Police
  barracks and notified the captain of the troop. The captain also witnessed the strange phenomenon and ordered an
  airplane to be sent aloft to investigate. But before the plane was off the ground the phenomenon vanished. Thus, he
  said he was absolutely convinced of the authenticity of my story. He invited me to visit him in the East and make a
  number of appearances there. <br> Since I had already given up my job, we were low on funds at the time. He forwarded
  me one hundred dollars to cover part of our expenses on the trip East. He also enclosed a contract in which he agreed
  to pay me for each lecture. My purpose in going East was to reach a much greater audience, but even the humblest of
  God's creatures must have sustenance for their bodies. And surely a workman, even in God's work, is worthy of his
  hire. <br> Most of the audiences in the east were enthusiastic and highly receptive to the message of the saucers. I
  was happy in the belief that I had sown many seeds of understanding about the space visitors. But the minister of the
  gospel on whose word I had made the trip, failed me completely. He has not up until the present time (one year later)
  paid me for my expense and time. In fact, he was content to desert me in the East far from home and relatives and
  leave me stranded there penniless. His name? Does it matter? <br> The final lecture in Buffalo was the most successful
  of any of the engagements. People came from as far away as Canada, completely filling the large auditorium. Thus, from
  a material standpoint Christianity had thrown me from the heights, but spiritually it had sustained me stronger than
  ever. Also, I was beginning to learn an important lesson. The hypocrites will invariably crucify, but the truly
  faithful will always redeem. Actually, the hypocrites far outnumber the true. But God and only one is indeed a vast
  majority. Similarly, space visitors and a few are also a majority. The absolute truth of these last two statements are
  forever settled in my own mind. <br> Without funds and stranded in the East, we finally got financial help from
  relatives, and also an invitation to visit our folks back in New Jersey. Our spirits, which had dropped to a low ebb,
  began to pick up. Thus we were in an almost joyful, holiday mood as the boys, Mabel and I piled the suitcases into the
  car and headed for Trenton. We stayed with my father-in law, Alfred Borgianni, on Kuser Road, close to the spot where
  I had once sent aloft balloons with the mold cultures in personal experiments, not knowing my work was being observed.
  <br> Our reunion with family and friends was a joyful one. We were invited everywhere and were kept out almost every
  night until a late hour. We quickly forgot our hardships and disappointments of the past weeks and joined in the
  happy, pulsating life around us. But I certainly never dreamed that there, close to my old home, I should have another
  experience with the extraterrestrials. <br> <br> Chapter X <br> NEPTUNE AGAIN AND PHENOMENA <br> IN NEW JERSEY <br>
  <br> One evening in December about midnight I was returning to "Pop's" Borgianini lives on the outshirts of town in a
  pleasant suburban area of average homes and small acreage farms. Clouds were overhead, but it was not a particularly
  dark night as there was considerable reflected light from the city. <br> I drove into the yard and parked my car in my
  usual spot. As I sat in the car for a moment breathing the clean, freah air and looking out over the twinkling lights
  of the countryside, I heard a familiar voice call my name. Surprised, I glanced around to see a tall, well-built
  figure approaching from a shadowed corner of the yard. Because I was so completely unprepared for such a meeting, it
  took me a moment to collect my thoughts and realize that the familiar voice could be none other than that of Neptune.
  As he came nearer to the car I could see him fairly well in the soft light. He appeared just has he that night down by
  the Los Angeles River. His closely-fitted "uniform" wavered like restless clouds of light and shadow. <br> But somehow
  I felt altogether different meeting him now; there was none of the eerie feeling I had experienced upon the occasion
  of our first meeting. <br> He seemed he seemed to feel much as I did, for he said cheerfully: "A merry Christmas to
  you, Orfeo." His warm, radiant smile was still the same, as was his noble bearing and everything else about him; yet I
  was able to comprend and understand him so much more easily now. I wondered, has he desended closer to my level, or
  had I, since my strange "awakening" in that other world, risen nearer to his? <br> He answered the question for me .
  "You are indeed a dweller in two worlds now, Orfeo. Sometimes it is difficult for you to determine which world is
  subtance and which is shadow, or if both are not merely differing degrees of subtance. But you have done well,
  considering all that you have been through these last two years. In In reality you are now liberated from your planet,
  Earth and are a citizen of the cosmos. For seven Earth days you were conscious in our world as it existed in Time,
  while I kept watch over your physical body its normal duties here on Earth. Thus in a way I am a part of you even as
  you are a part of me. There now exist eternal bonds of understanding between us" <br> As he spoke, I thought of a
  puzzling statement he had made to me during our first meeting. It was that memorable night down by the Los Angeles
  River. I distinctly remembered that he had said: "We shall return, dear friend, but not to you." I remembered the
  words so well because I had been so saddened to hear them. Thus I looked at him now I was thinking that his very
  presence there seemed to belie those words. <br> He smiled again and said gently: "In reality we have not returned to
  you, Orfeo. You came to us. When you awakened as one of us, you had come home. Don't you understand? We are not
  returning to the shadow, Orfeo; our lost brother has returned to us. And from our first contact with you we never in
  reality ever left you." <br> I grasped the meaning of his words, for I well knew I was no longer the same person who,
  confused and bewildered, had stepped half-fearfully into the saucer that night under the Hyperion Avenue Bridge.
  "Yes," I replied thoughtfully. "What you say is true. Earth to me now often seems like strange land where I have been
  a prisoner who has forgotten his native home." <br> But you are nolonger a prisoner, Orfeo. You have broken the chains
  of matter. Thus can you realize that you were a prisoner--and that realization is all important. The vast majority of
  Earth's people never dream of their true status."</p>
