<p>Following the emotional shock of that profound and bewildering trip in the saucer, I went about in a veritable daze
  for weeks. I continued on the job at Lockheed and resumed the routine of my daily affairs; but I was like an automaton
  - a dweller in two worlds and at home in neither. It is almost impossible to explain my state of mind But the great
  spiritual illumination I had received in the saucer left me something of a stranger to my own planet, Earth. <br> I
  longed to tell the world, to blazen out the truths of my discoveries; yet I knew that for the greater part I must
  forever remain silent. Among other glimpses of reality, I attained the realization that TIME IS NON-EXISTENT. What we
  call Time exists only in the physical worlds and is an illusion of the senses. Also, I know now that our concept of
  space is entirely erroneous. But who could I convince of these and other truths - who would believe me? <br> But
  because THEY had requested that I tell Earthlings of my experiences, I told many persons about my trip in the flying
  saucer. Nearly everyone laughed and ridiculed me. I was the butt of numerous jokes. Someone was always wise-cracking;
  Are your saucer pals going to show up tonight, Orfeo?" Or: "Tell one of the saucers to land over at the Drive-In
  theatre, Angie, and then we'll all believe it!" Such remarks invariably brought forth gales of laughter at my expense.
  But I no longer cared - I KNEW, and that was enough! <br> As my story got around, several newspapers printed derisive
  accounts of "The Saucer Man". It cut deeply to see the embarrassment and humiliation it all caused my two sons. They
  knew people were saying their father was a "screwball". They didn't want to go to school because their companions
  laughed at them. I knew it all hurt Mabel too. Mabel pleaded with me to forget my experiences. I tried to explain to
  her why I had to tell about them, and we had some bitter misunderstandings on the subject. <br> I wanted so much to do
  something constructive, but I didn't know how to go about it. I began calling various military and defense offices.
  The personnel of several of the smaller ones laughed openly and passed me off, I know, as a crackpot. But it was with
  tremendous relief I found the really important offices referred me to men who were genuinely interested. They
  questioned and cross-questioned me concerning the information I gave them. <br> A little later I began giving weekly
  talks to small groups of interested people about space visitors. At first these meetings were held in private homes
  and then as the attendance increased we met in the Los Feliz Club House. <br> In what little spare time I had I began
  writing down my experiences and planned to publish them in a small newssheet, for I believed I could reach more people
  that way. <br> But as the days and weeks passed following my fantastic trip in the saucer and nothing more happened, I
  began to feel a little uncertain. The constant ridicule and laughter created even more doubts. My insistence upon the
  absolute truth of my experiences finally appeared to be definitely alienating my friends and even my family. My story
  was unbelieved upon Earth and the mysterious visitors were doing nothing to aid me. I actually began to doubt my own
  sanity, to wonder if the bizarre experiences had been an illusion or hallucination of some sort. And yet an inner
  tribunal of Truth assured me that such was not the case for WITH THEM I HAD SEEN AND KNOWN REALITY - and I could never
  forget that. <br> On the night of August 2nd I and Mabel were helping out at the Los Feliz Drive-In theatre snack bar.
  About 11 o'clock I went outside for a breath of fresh air. Over the hills to the west I noticed a fuzzy green light
  apparently hanging suspended in the sky. I watched it for several moments, then went inside and called Mabel and seven
  or eight others to come out and see it. All of them saw the mysterious light hanging motionless in the sky over the
  hill. Unable to explain it, some of them declared it must be a helicopter hovering in the air. Others thought it might
  be a high street lamp of some sort. <br> But when after three or four minutes the "street lamp" climbed slowly and
  silently into the heavens and suddenly vanished, no one had much to say. But for some perverse reason none of them
  wanted to admit that it was actually a flying saucer. <br> As they trouped back into the cafe laughing about "Orfeo
  and his flying saucers", a depressing wave of discouragement passed over me. It was useless - absolutely useless - to
  talk to anyone about the saucers or my experiences. Feeling greatly disheartened and very much alone, I decided to
  leave and walk home. <br> As I cut across the vacant lots the Hyperion Avenue Freeway Bridge loomed huge and dark
  ahead of me. The sky was overcast and the dense, oblique shadows from the vast concrete structure were heavier and
  more eerie than usual. Yet in the shadows of the dark archways of the bridge I had come to feel a kind of warmth and
  welcome, a spiritual communion with a vastly greater and more kindly world. For it was in the shadows of the huge
  bridge that I had come upon the saucer which had carried me out of this world. <br> I was thinking of these things
  when I suddenly became aware of someone approaching from out of the darkness. I was startled for I'd never before met
  anyone taking the short-cut beneath the bridge so late at night. I was about to call out a word of greeting when it
  dawned upon me that the stranger was coming from the dead end of the bridge. My first thought was that someone was
  lying in wait for me, possibly to rob me. But before I could become alarmed, I heard the stranger call: "Greetings,
  Orfeo!" <br> My heart almost stopped beating, for immediately I recognized the vibrant, beautiful voice of the being
  who had spoken to me in the saucer. <br> I stopped in my tracks, utterly speechless, and stared at the approaching
  figure. But then a wave of joy and gratitude flooded over me, and I finally replied falteringly: "Greetings...to
  you..." <br> He laughed pleasantly. "I know that in your mind you have given me a name - I who have remained nameless
  to you, " he said gently. "You may call me by that name, Orfeo - it is as good as any other and has more inner
  significance to you than any name I might give you." <br> "Neptune..." I spoke the name slowly and reverently. For it
  was indeed the name I had given to this great and mysterious being. Then I added: "At last you have come to give me
  strength and faith." <br> He was near enough then for me to see that he was several inches taller than I and similar
  in outline to a well-built man. But the shadows were so heavy that I couldn't make out the details of his figure. But
  just to be in his presence once more was to sense again a tremendous uplifting wave of strength, harmony, joy and
  serenity. <br> "Come, Orfeo," he said gently, continuing on past me. "We have many things to discuss tonight." <br> I
  followed him as he strode ahead of me through the dense shadows. I could hear his solid footsteps upon the graveled
  path which convinced me beyond the shadow of a doubt that he was no phantom or illusion. <br> He led me to a better
  lighted area near the bend of Glendale Boulevard where it goes up and over the bridge. I was actually trembling in
  anticipation of my first actual look at the mysterious visitor from another world. <br> When he turned I saw his face,
  the same wonderful, expressive countenance I had seen on the luminous screen. I again noticed especially his extremely
  large dark and expressive eyes and nobility and beauty of his features which actually seemed to radiate warmth and
  kindliness. <br> Then I noticed that he was wearing a kind of uniform, bluish in color, perfectly tailored and tightly
  fitted to the outlines of his body. But it was apparently without seams, buttons, pockets, trimmings or design of any
  sort. In fact it fitted so perfectly that it was almost like a part of his body. <br> But as I studied him I became
  aware of an astonishing phenomenon: I could see his uniform and figure clearly, but it wavered occasionally, as though
  I were viewing it through rippling water. And the color did not remain solid and uniform, but varied and changed in
  spots, which reminded me of an imperfectly tuned television set. Only his face and hands remained immobile and stable
  as though not partially obscured by a film of rippling water. <br> Headlights from approaching automobiles fell upon
  us from time to time and I remember wondering what manner of being my companion appeared to be to those in the passing
  cars. Did they see him at all? If so, did he appear as solid and substantial as myself? <br> He moved forward again,
  motioning for me to follow him. Without speaking he led me down the sharp concrete declivity into the bed of the dry
  Los Angeles River. There he sat down upon a large stone and motioned for me to do likewise. <br> For a time he was
  silent and I was acutely conscious of a tremendous vibrational field about him; a tangible emanation of serenity,
  brotherly love, and ineffable joy. <br> At last he said: "You sense and understand intuitively many things I cannot
  say directly to you, Orfeo. you have just fully realized that we are not like earthmen in that we function in
  dimensions unknown to your world. Earth is a three-dimensional world and because of this it is preponderantly false. I
  may tell you that to the entities of certain other worlds Earth is regarded as 'the accursed planet', the 'home of the
  reprobate, fallen ones'. Others call your Earth 'the home of sorrows'. For Earth's evolution is evolution through
  pain, sorrow, sin, suffering and the illusion of physical death. Believe me, all evolutions are not similar to
  Earth's, despite the present beliefs of your scientists." <br> As I heard these strange words, my heart and mind cried
  out: "But why must it be so? Why should Earth's people know pain, suffering and death?" <br> He looked up into the
  heavens and in the soft light I saw deep compassion in his face as he said slowly: "The answer to that question is one
  of the mysteries of the illusion of Time. But I can tell you this: such conditions did not always prevail among the
  entities who now inhabit Earth. Once there was another planet in your solar system, the fairest and most radiant of
  all the planets. That planet was the original home of Earthlings. In their native home they knew no pain, sorrow,
  suffering, sickness or death. But in the glory and wonder of their world they grew proud and arrogant. They made war
  among themselves and finally turned against the Great Giver of Life. Ultimately they destroyed their own planet which
  today exists only as a sterile and barren ring of asteroids and debris in the solar system. In order that those
  entities might gain understanding, compassion and brotherly love they were born into the animalistic, material
  evolution of a lesser planet, Earth. Suffering, sorrow, frustration and death became their teacher. Their symbol
  became the Man-Beast. Each man must work out his own destiny and salvation. In the illusion of Time and through
  repeated births and deaths each entity slowly and painfully evolves spiritually toward its former glorified state of
  divinity. Eventually all the entities of Earth will again attain their lost heritage. They will have learned
  understanding, compassion and true love for God and their fellows." <br> I pondered his strange words thoughtfully,
  thinking as I did so that what he had said explained many apparent mysteries about man and his lot upon Earth. But
  soon my attention was distracted once more as I saw the figure of Neptune strangely "waver" again. Suddenly the
  question was in my mind: "Was he really there in the truest physical sense, or was he an immaterial projection into
  the physical world from another dimension? Did I see him in his true form and ordinary state of being, or merely a
  projected approximation of a man's appearance?" These strange thoughts frightened me a little and carried me into too
  deep waters. <br> A reassuring smile lighted his face. "Don't be alarmed, Orfeo. The answer to the troublesome
  question in your mind is both yes and no. On Earth form, color, individuality and the material aspect of things is
  all-important. In our world these illusions are of practically no importance at all. Suffice to say that for you I am
  an approximation of myself as I really am. I can't make it any clearer in three-dimensional terms." <br> I thought
  about my own troubled fellows of Earth. Impetuously, I asked: "What about Earth now? On the surface all seems fairly
  calm, but I know we are only drifting on dangerous and treacherous waters. In their hearts many people are troubled
  and afraid. There is the ever-constant fear of the H-bomb and of other horribly destructive weapons being developed in
  the laboratories. Also there is the creeping menace of Communism that is threatening the world, and so many other
  things..." <br> When Neptune spoke his voice was calm and dispassionate: "Communism, Earth's present fundamental
  enemy, masks beneath its banner the spearhead of the united forces of evil. Along with good all men have evil in their
  hearts to a degree. But some are much more evil than others. Communism is a necessary evil and now exists upon Earth
  as do venomous creatures, famines, blights, tyrannies, cataclysms - all are negative forces which awaken the positive
  forces of good in man and cause them to act. Thus are they combatted, understood and ultimately their unreality
  becomes apparent. For evil is always eventually self-destroyed." <br> He paused and once more I noticed his "uniform"
  darkening and lightening in spots, as though it were made of restless pale bluish clouds and patches of moonlight.
  Then I held my breath as he continued: "Yes, war will come again to your Earth. We are powerless to prevent it.
  Millions in your land will fight to the end for their cherished ideals and freedom of the human mind, with only a
  minimum on their side for victory. The hour of travail which in future history shall be known as 'The Great Accident'
  is nearer than any man dreams. And already the clouds of war are on the horizon, dark and ominous; but overhead beams
  the rainbow, infinite and eternal. Mankind will survive Armageddon and awake to a new more glorious day of fellowship
  and honest brotherly love. In the dawning great New Age of Earth all will forget their bitter hurts and build
  constructively together upon the solid foundation of the Brotherhood of Man." <br> He stopped speaking and turned his
  radiant eyes full upon me. In the half-light his countenance was truly resplendent. <br> "There is not much more I can
  tell you now, Orfeo," he said. "Since the first publicized modern sighting of our disks in the year 1947, thousands
  upon Earth have come to believe in us. Many have actually seen our disks. Some have seen us clairvoyantly. Others have
  communicated with us clairaudiently. Still others recognize the truth of our existence and greater scope of our being,
  through intuitive perception. But as far as official proof of ourselves, for which so many clamor, we cannot offer
  that. Official proof of the existence of our disks will come. But for us to attempt physically to contact mankind
  through any so-called authoritative source would be only useless and possibly disastrous for them. Nearly all
  three-dimensional beings have no concept of, nor could they possibly understand, extra-dimensional beings. Tonight in
  visiting you I have broken a code - the code of 'hands off', as regards any interference in the affairs of Earth.
  Active cosmic law will see the necessary amends made. <br> He looked at me; his strange eyes suddenly saddened. For a
  moment I had the uncanny feeling that in his greater vision I appeared to him only as a fleeting, insubstantial
  shadow, utterly without reality as he knew it. In that revealing instant I knew that we of Earth are as far removed
  from their nature as Earth is from the Sun. <br> After a while he said: "I would shake your hand in token of our
  momentous meeting here tonight. But I cannot. I have gone too far already. For my transgression we must now recede an
  equal degree from you. The immutable law of cause and effect upon Earth will govern accordingly. As a result, but few
  will believe or even hear your account of our meeting. In the over-all picture your story will in no way change
  conditions upon Earth. Neither will any actual Earthly event be either hastened or retarded because of our meeting. At
  most your story will give only greater faith and inner conviction to the few - but it is an important few! The ways of
  God are immutable and apparent only to those who have spiritual discernment. In the illusion of Time all things will
  be fulfilled in their proper hour." <br> I found that I was trembling and my nerves fairly quivering. Whether from
  sheer emotion or actually from being within the vibratory range of Neptune, I don't know. I longed to thank him, to
  express the great feeling of gratitude in my heart; but I didn't know quite how. I said: "From the bottom of my heart
  I thank you, Neptune. I pledge my very life to you and the beings of your world, that greater understandings may come
  to mankind." <br> "We know you will not fail us, Orfeo," he replied. "No other contact may be made at this time. But
  have no further doubts about the reality of your experiences. The road is open now; walk it as you will. Your failure
  will be my own. But I smile upon you for the increased numbers who will come to know us in a truer aspect and to
  believe in us because of you. Strength and encouragement will be given to the millions who will rise courageously to
  meet the fiery trials ahead. I tell you this: the 'Great Accident' is very close and the fury of the next war will
  break when it is least expected; when men are talking of peace. I cannot say more." <br> With these prophetic words,
  Neptune extended his hand to me. But recalling his words, I did not grasp it. <br> He smiled and his face actually
  seemed to radiate light. "Orfeo, my brother!" he said with genuine affection. "For my sake you refused to break the
  code. My trust is forever in you, Orfeo. In your simple action you have cleansed me from my contact with this ground."
  <br> He paused; then added: "Soon we shall recede from Earth, Orfeo - and yet in reality we shall never be far away.
  Later, we shall return, but not to you, beloved friend. You will understand the meanings of these words later on."
  <br> When I made no reply, he said: "I'm thirsty, Orfeo. Perhaps you know where we might get a drink of water?" <br>
  "Oh yes....yes sir," I answered eagerly, getting quickly to my feet. I remembered a small nearby store that remained
  open all night. "Please wait here; I'll be right back." I left him and clambered up the embankment. <br> As I hurried
  toward the store, I turned and looked back at the Hyperion Bridge. Beneath the high center arch I made out the hazy
  outline of a kind of ghostly "igloo" which I immediately recognized as a saucer similar to the one in which I had
  ridden. <br> At the store I bought two bottles of lemon soda and hastened back. But as I approached I was disappointed
  to see that the ghostly saucer was no longer beneath the arch of the bridge. Quickening my pace, I almost ran to the
  spot where I had left Neptune; but he was no longer there. I wasn't too surprised for I'd had a premonition he
  wouldn't be there when I returned. <br> I tossed the sodas away and sank down upon the ground. The place was
  appallingly desolate without him. I felt so acutely alone, so helpless and deserted - like a child left alone in a
  dark room when the light is suddenly extinguished. I looked upward and my eyes hopefully searched the skies. High in
  the western heavens I saw a soft, fuzzy green light which hung for a moment, then shot away and vanished. <br>
  "Farewell, Neptune," I said softly as I felt my eyes grow moist. "I know now Earth is not yet ready for a meeting with
  the beings from your world. But in the dawning of Earth's great New Age, that day will come, friend. When we have
  learned the meaning of true brotherly love; when we have overcome to a greater degree the evil inherent in our selfish
  hearts, then perhaps we will be worthy to meet the infinitely wiser and gentler brothers of your world. In those days
  your fellows will visit us openly and joyfully. No longer will Earth be 'the accursed planet - home of sorrows'." </p>
