<p> During those last days I was at Lockheed I thought often of Neptune's cryptic words: "The road will open, Orfeo;
  walk it as you will," And later when he said: "I smile upon you, Orfeo, for your greatly enhanced numbers." <br> Then
  his last prophetic words, "Strength and courage will be given to the millions who will rise and meet the great battles
  ahead with only a faint hope on their side for victory." <br> It was true, I thought; the road was beginning to open.
  New understandings and an ever increasing awareness were coming to me as time passed. Also, as more and more people
  learned of my experiences many began to phone, write, or visit at our home, wishing to know more about the space
  visitors. We continued the regular meetings at the Los Felix Club House, but as the crowds increased, the Club House
  was know longer large enough to accommodate everyone. It was then that Max Miller, President of the Flying Saucers
  International, an organizational devoted to the study of flying saucer phenomena, and Jerome Criswell, the well-known
  columnist and television Man of Prophecy, suggested that we rent the music room in the famous old Hollywood Hotel for
  our weekly meetings. Thus we had been meeting their for several months every Sunday or afternoon. Opinions were
  exchanged and lectures on saucer phenomena were presented to enthusiastic audiences. <br> Paradoxically enough, as the
  general public's interest in the saucers increased, the press, radio, television and other news media suddenly and
  inexplicably dropped flying saucers from the news. Even the second-rate science fiction writers banished the word from
  their lexicon of horrors. Thus the public was left to grope for itself. And surprisingly enough the way was thus
  cleared for those individuals who had experienced actual contacts with the extraterrestrials to work freely without
  obstruction of erroneous "slanting" by official reporting. <br> Gerald Heard, Frank Scully and Donald Keyhoe were
  familiar names among persons interested in the saucers. These men, along with fate magazine and Ray Palmer, had been
  making every effort to awaken the public to the awesome fact that our world might well be under observation by beings
  from another planet. But now several unknown men were speaking up and declaring that they had actually had contact
  with the saucers and space visitors. Among those were George Van Tassel, Truman Betherum, George Adamski, George
  Williamson and Alfred Bailey. Those few newspapers which ran stories on these men did so with the tongue-in-cheek
  slant. <br> Sunday afternoons I was speaking to groups at the Hollywood Hotel. I knew that my audience waited
  patiently for clear, concise, accounts of my experiences with extraterrestrials. But they were often disappointed.
  Frequently when I stepped upon the platform to speak a strange transition came over me. It was as though another
  personality overshadowed me; someone who knew all the answers. But the answers were not in my familiar English or
  Italian, but in an unfamiliar, half-remembered tongue. I would struggle to translate the ideas into English and end up
  by failing to be clear and direct. Thus with the understanding of the universe almost within my grasp, I was often
  helpless to reveal any part of it. <br> Nevertheless less, even with my many failures to be concise and direct, the
  meetings gained momentum with increasing numbers in the audience. <br> It was then that Max Miller conceived the idea
  of a Flying Saucer Convention. It sounded like a tremendous idea to me. With the help of several other persons we
  enthusiastically began to formulate plans. It was decide that we should hold the convention at the Hollywood Hotel
  where there was plenty of room in the lobby to accommodate a large audience. <br> Various exhibits of saucer
  photographs, space ship models, books, magazines and pamphlets on the saucers were set up around the lobby and many
  circulars were mailed out announcing the event. Also invitations to speak at the convention were mailed to all persons
  who had been most helpful in revealing and disseminating information about the saucers and extraterrestrials. <br> But
  response to the invitations was very poor. Less than a week before the convention was to open it appeared that none of
  the speakers that we had counted upon would be present. Max was greatly worried. "It looks like we're sunk, Orfeo," he
  exclaimed dejectedly. "This thing is going to be the prize flop of any and all conventions." <br> But as I looked at
  him, the conviction was suddenly strongly in my mind that everything would come off well. I replied: "Don't worry,
  Max. It's going to come off much better than we ever dreamed it would." <br> My prediction proved entirely correct.
  Everyone of the speakers whom we had invited showed up for the convention, and some others besides. Among the invited
  speakers were Frank scully, Arthur Luis Joquel II, George Van Tassel, George Adamski, Truman Betherum, John Otto from
  Chicago, Harding Walsh and a mysterious Dr. "X" who spoke long and eloquently on the saucers. He left immediately
  after speaking and no one ever knew who he really was or where he came from, although many inquired; for he had some
  startling things to say. <br> Almost to a man the speakers said they had received an irresistible urge to attend on
  Friday (two days before the opening of the convention). Could it be that the space visitors had been at work in their
  subtle way? <br> At any rate the convention was a tremendous success. For three days and nights the crowds overflowed
  the Hollywood Hotel out onto the lawns and adjacent Hollywood Boulevard. In fact the response was so tremendous that
  on the second morning I requested Max to stop all publicity on the convention. Some of the larger Los Angeles
  newspapers covered the convention. But all news stories were of the tongue-in-cheek type. A few of the smaller, more
  rabid papers tried to "expose" it as nothing but a promotional "money-making" scheme. <br> The convention was a hectic
  one. I was busy night and day and carried on practically without sleep. When I wasn't speaking, people were
  surrounding me and bombarding me with endless questions. Many were speaking at the weekly meetings and the three
  nerve-wracking days of the convention, I never once lost my temper. A power beyond my own consciousness or control
  carried me through. In trying moments of heckling or confusion an upsurgence of peace and calm would pick me up and
  give me strength equal to the occasion. <br> However, on the last night of the convention, the power that was
  sustaining me suddenly failed and I lost my temper for the first time. A lone women who had been especially persistent
  in seeking me out and cornering me to revile me and hurl quotes of scripture at me was responsible for the outburst.
  She knew I was wrong and she was right. And she had books, diagrams and bible verses to prove it. When at last I
  literally blew my top she joyfully picked up her data and departed shouting that my temper proved I was an agent of
  the devil. Within an hour I lost my temper several times again. <br> The most trying experience of the convention
  occurred when a large group of materialists were literally "giving me the works" in a stubborn, derisive effort to
  "get to the bottom of my story" and ferret out obvious flaws from a "from a common-sense viewpoint. <br> Sincere,
  open-minded, honest persons who are willing to investigate the event of space visitors never resort to such sneering
  interrogations. They ask honest, sincere questions on points they fully do not understand. But they have an honest
  desire to know, not to discredit, to sneer and to disparage. <br> This particular group had their minds set upon
  "exposing" me. Their methods, although entirely on a mental plane, would make the medieval inquisitions seem
  innocuous. Like little demons they parroted elementary physics and could see practical, intelligent action only behind
  the Iron Curtain. They knew that I was a cheap publicity seeker who did not hesitate to lie about space visitors or
  anything else to further my own ends. No words of explanation could possibly prove anything to them they did not wish
  to believe. <br> I had undergone just as bitter and insinuating criticism before, but I was exceptionally tired that
  last night. I felt almost though I were melting away before venomous onslaught, collapsing at the seams, as it were,
  and suddenly I felt very, very human and down to earth. I was on the verge of exploding in anger again when a kind of
  veil was drawn over my conscious mind. The gesticulating figures before me faded to babbling, inconsequential shadows.
  <br> As they continued their violent attacks, my thoughts drifted calmly back to a scene of a few weeks before. I was
  attending a convention of science fiction writers at the Hotel Commodore on Los Angeles. Since my experiences with the
  extraterrestrials, I have become interested in the field of science-fiction, for I have found that many scientific
  truths are adumbrated, or delineated, in science-fiction before ever they become realties of our own world. <br> Many
  well known writers in the science-fiction field were present. When I came in they were holding open discussions of
  trends in the science-fiction, the various new markets, etc. <br> One of the audience asked: "Why have all science
  fiction writers suddenly stopped writing or even mentioning flying saucers?" <br> A speaker replied authoritatively
  that the subject had become taboo with them. <br> Another member of the audience demanded to know why this was so
  since the saucers had actually given such an impetus to the science-fiction field. <br> The speaker had no adequate
  answer for that one, but lamely explained that the saucers were "old stuff" now. <br> I was becoming impatient with
  the proceedings and was on the point of leaving when the guest speaker of the evening was announced. He was Mr. Gerald
  Heard, the well-known science-fiction writer and author of IS ANOTHER WORLD WATCHING? <br> Mr. heard spoke with great
  eloquence and a deep, penetrating philosophy. He berated the writers for turning out material of an inferior grade and
  warned that the public would not continue to "stomach it", much less to buy it. Many of them squirmed uncomfortably in
  their seats. <br> As he neared the end of his stimulating and thought-provoking talk, his eyes met mine where I was
  seated near the back with two companions. I noticed that he seemed tired and shaken. <br> As our eyes met and held a
  kind of mutual understanding passed between us in ever widening circles. Dimly, I could hear him terminating his
  speech with these words: There is one in this room tonight--I do not know he is, but he's going to upset the whole
  apple cart." He paused, then his voice reverberated as he added: "He is the Awakener--he has not yet appeared, but he
  well may be here in this room tonight. Thank you." <br> And the mystic wheels between us set in motion by the
  controlled magnetic vortices slowly receded and vanished. <br> I looked about the room at the audience, but they were
  no longer listening to him. Some were whispering and laughing among themselves. <br> As I looked about that busy room
  I thought that it was small wonder that the concoctors of science-fiction horror diets had declared the saucers
  "taboo". Far too much beautiful reality was on the side of the saucers. Harmony and beauty are much too tame for the
  horror boys. They have joined forces with the materialists, subversives and egotists to fight the "flying saucer
  sensationalists" down at every turn. <br> But the joke is on them, for reality slipped quietly past them and
  established new frontiers of its own. The science-fictioneers were induced by subtle forces to ignore flying saucers
  as were many other materialistic sources of information. During the welcome lull the actual flying saucer phenomena
  and the extra-terrestrials were left to the inexperienced but honest handling of rank amateurs. At first these men
  were inept and inarticulate, but they are finding their voices and their numbers rapidly increasing. The space
  visitors had actually only cleared the atmosphere for them. Had the professional spinners of horror-fiction stuck to
  the theme of flying saucers, the true contacts could never have been able to perform their missions. </p>
