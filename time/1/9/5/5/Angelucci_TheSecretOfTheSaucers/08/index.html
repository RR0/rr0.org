<p> It was in the late summer of 1953 that the most beautiful and revealing of all of my experiences with the etheric
  beings developed. My life had been a kaleidoscope of new understandings and changing patterns since the night of my
  trip in the saucer, but apparently the most profound of all had to be revealed to my conscious mind in gradual steps
  of understanding, because the experience itself actually occurred in January of 1953 while I was still on the job at
  Lockheed, but it was not until six months later that I had any idea of the tremendous experience that had been mine.
  During those bewildering intervening six months I honestly believed that for seven days of my life in January, 1953 I
  had been a victim of complete amnesia. I told no one about it, not even Mabel, for so many confounding things had
  happened in the recent months of my life that I feared further complicating matters by relating an experience for
  which there seemed to be no explanation. <br> During those six months I experienced many very strange and disquieting
  hours. Vivid dreams of a hauntingly beautiful, half-familiar world troubled my sleep. Sometimes I would awaken
  trembling and bathed in perspiration feeling that I was close to conscious remembrance of an exquisitely beautiful
  experience that would explain many things. Also, frequently during the days, fleeting, tenuous memories drifted into
  the borderland of my consciousness. <br> Even more perplexing were those occasions when, while speaking to groups of
  persons at the Hollywood Hotel, I felt as though I were being somehow overshadowed by another greater personality; a
  personality who thought neither in my familiar English or Italian, but in a strange language which it seemed I once
  knew but now could no longer remember. <br> In order to clarify the experience itself, I must go back to that day in
  January, 1953 when it began. I did not go to work that afternoon as I was just recovering from the flu, but I was
  feeling so much better that I believed I could go back on the job the following day. Mabel was at work at the cafe and
  I was alone. About four o'clock a rather strange, detached feeling came over me. I was aware of a familiar odd
  prickling sensation in my arms and the back of my neck which usually announced the proximity of space craft. <br> I
  discounted the strange symptoms thinking they were only the result of my illness. Then suddenly I began to feel so
  drowsy that I could scarcely keep my eyes open. I remember starting toward the divan to lie down for a nap, but I
  later had absolutely no recollection of reaching that divan. <br> My next conscious perception was a peculiar
  "awakening" or regaining consciousness while on my job in the Plastics Department at Lockheed. Stupefied and
  bewildered I looked uncertainly about the factory. Dazedly, I recognized the familiar faces of my co-workers...and
  noticed the tools in my hands. I caught my breath sharply and an icy shiver quivered over my entire body as quite
  involuntarily I recoiled with a shudder from the entire scene. I didn't know why then, but everything seemed
  hopelessly wrong, primitive and crude. <br> In a daze I rubbed a hand across my eyes hoping to eradicate the scene.
  Then I was seized with a blinding vertigo and thought I was going to lose consciousness. Dave Donnegan, my working
  partners, looked at me sympathetically, and there was genuine concern in his eyes. He didn't say anything, but quietly
  took the tools from my hand and in his quiet, understanding way went ahead, carrying on alone. <br> An involuntary
  outburst of utter disgust came from my lips, disgust with everything I saw. It seemed like the Dark Ages. I remember
  hearing Dave say: "Are you all right, boy?" <br> I didn't reply; I couldn't! In panic I turned to rush out of the
  door. In my bland haste I bumped roughly into Richard Butterfield, the temporary lead man in my section. I must have
  looked acutely ill because I vaguely remember seeing the alarm in his eyes as he grasped me firmly but gently by the
  shoulders and exclaimed: "Angie! Angie! What's wrong with you!" <br> I was breathing hard. Both emotionally and
  mentally I was confused and uncertain. My <br> thoughts were in turmoil. I had only one objective; to get out of that
  place! But the presence of Butterfield had a stabilizing, quieting effect upon me. <br> He smiled reassuringly while
  keeping his hands upon my shoulders. "Clam down, Angie, old boy," he said gently. "Go upstairs and take a break. You
  look beat!" <br> I mumbled my heartfelt thanks and stumbled up the steps, not yet aware of what actually had happened
  to me. <br> I got a cup of coffee. Never before had I needed one so badly. My hands were shaking and every nerve in my
  body was quivering. As I drank the hot, aromatic stuff I tried to think back, to remember why I was so shaken and
  upset. But my last recollection before my strange, perturbed "awakening" on the job, was walking toward the divan in
  my apartment The intervening period was a total blank. <br> Noticing a copy of the Los Angeles Times on one of the
  tables, I nervously picked it up and glanced at the date. Perspiration broke out on my forehead: the date of the paper
  was January 19, 1953. Seven days had elapsed of which I had absolutely no recollection! But even the date on the paper
  couldn't convince me. Trying to keep my voice casual, I asked a worker at a nearby table. He confirmed the date on the
  newspaper. <br> My body was bathed in cold perspiration. I was on the edge of panic as I sat there, my hands trembling
  so that I could hardly take a sip of coffee. I couldn't believe that seven days and nights had passed, leaving not a
  trace of memory in my mind. <br> Later in the afternoon when I was feeling a little better I went back downstairs on
  the job. But it was a real effort to behave in a normal, rational manner with my thoughts in turmoil. Cautiously and
  discreetly I questioned Dave and other fellow workers about those seven previous days. From their replies I gathered
  that I had been on the job every day and had apparently behaved in my usual manner until my strange"awakening and
  violent outburst that afternoon. <br> At home I didn't mention my inexplicable loss of memory to Mabel. And apparently
  she had noticed nothing unusual in my behavior during that entire week. It seemed that in every way I had behaved in
  my accustomed manner. I had eaten my meals, slept, gone to and from work and helped <br> Mabel out at the Snack Bar,
  as usual. It was fantastically incredible! <br> I told no one what had happened to me. But in my own mind I was
  utterly baffled and deeply troubled about those seven lost days out of my life. Imagine yourself in my place. Suppose
  that for an entire week your waking consciousness had been obliterated so that you could not remember a single event.
  Wouldn't you be deeply disturbed? Wouldn't you begin to wonder if you might not be psychopathic? In all sincerity I
  can tell that you would, for those were my own panic-stricken thoughts. <br> But as the days passed I gradually
  settled down into the routine of daily life. Often I tried hard to regain the memory of those seven lost days, but it
  seemed hopeless. <br> Months passed and I had about decided that for those seven days I had suffered from complete
  loss of memory. Except for the disquieting thoughts and vivid dreams, I had no intimation of what was coming until
  that memorable night in the first week in September, 1953. <br> I was feeling unusually restless that evening. Shortly
  after ten o'clock I went out for a walk. As always, my feet seemed involuntarily to carry me toward the Hyperion
  Avenue Freeway Bridge. In its dark, mysterious shadows I always found a kind of spiritual peace and comfort, for it
  was there I had met and talked with Neptune, the man from another world! <br> I was thinking of these things as I
  clambered down the concrete embankment into the almost dry bed of the Los Angeles River. Walking over to the spot
  where Neptune had talked with me, I sat down disconsolately upon the ground. I rested my head upon the stone where he
  had sat, and gazed thoughtfully up into the heavens and thought of the spiraling, endless wonders of the universe.
  Lost in reverie, a feeling of deep inner peace and tranquillity came over me. Noisy, clattering Earth with all of its
  troubles, dissensions and animosities seemed remote and relatively unimportant. <br> As my thoughts drifted
  pleasantly, I felt again the odd sensation which was always my first awareness of space visitors. But I was deeply
  puzzled, for Neptune had last told me: "We will return, Orfeo; but not to you." <br> <br> Nevertheless the odd
  tingling in my arms and back of my neck was unmistakable. hopefully, my eyes scanned the heavens. I saw nothing that
  in any way resembled a saucer. The intensity of the vibration increased, dimming the awareness of my conscious mind
  much as it had the night I had first encountered the saucer. <br> As in a dream my thoughts drifted back to that
  mysterious Monday afternoon six months before when, feeling much as I did now, I had walked toward the divan to take a
  nap. An astonishing thing was happening: I was beginning to remember, faintly, hazily, at first, like the sun's golden
  rays breaking through black clouds. <br> As memory flooded back I clearly recalled again that Monday afternoon. I was
  walking towards the divan...my eyes were so heavy I could scarcely keep them open. In a daze I sank down upon the
  divan and immediately fell into a deep sleep! <br> Only now I could remember waking from that sleep! My awakening was
  in a strange and wonderful world! I was no longer upon Earth; some fantastic transition had taken place. I awoke in a
  huge, fabulously beautiful room; a room the substance of which glowed ethereally with soft, exquisite colors. I was
  lying upon a luxurious couch, or lounge. Half awake, I glanced down at my body - but it was not familiar! My body was
  never so perfectly proportioned or of so fine coloring and texture. <br> I noticed that I was wearing only a fine
  white garment, closely fitted and covering my chest, torso and upper part of my thighs. A finely wrought gold belt was
  about my waist. Although the belt appeared to be made of heavy links of embossed gold, it was without weight. My new
  body felt amazingly light and ethereal and vibrant with life. <br> Full consciousness did not come to me at once. My
  first thoughts upon waking in that shining world were nebulous. Somehow the thought persisted in my mind that I was
  recovering from a long and serious illness. Thus I reclined there in a kind of pleasant lethargy as one does who has
  been very ill. Random thoughts drifted in my consciousness. Everything was so new and different and yet it was
  hauntingly familiar. My handsome new body was not my body, and yet it was! The exquisite room with its ethereal,
  softly glowing colors was like nothing ever dreamed of upon Earth, and yet somehow it was not strange and alien to me.
  Only one thing seemed unfamiliar: far away outside the huge, windowless room I could hear the continuous rumble of
  distant thunder. Oddly enough the thunder did not fill me with apprehension as had always been the case in the past.
  <br> Gradually the dark mists began clearing from my mind. Incredible memories were coming back to me; memories of
  another world, a different people - another life! Lost horizons, deep-buried memories, forgotten vistas were surfacing
  to my consciousness. <br> "I remember this world!" I thought rapturously. "I remember it in the same way that a
  condemned prisoner remembers the sunshine, the trees, the flowers of the outside world after an eternity chained in a
  dark and odious prison. This is my real world, my true body. I have been lost in a dimension called Time and a captive
  in a forbidding land called Earth. But now, somehow, I have come home. All is serenity, peace, harmony and
  indescribable beauty here. The only disturbing factor is a troublesome half-memory of an unhappy shadow named Orfeo, a
  bondsman in a prison-world of materiality called Earth. <br> As the disturbing thoughts of this lost Orfeo troubled
  me, a portion of one wall noiselessly divided making an imposing doorway, and a woman entered. She was dazzlingly
  beautiful. Somehow my mind understood that she was the one in whose charge I was placed, even as I also understood
  that the mysterious door opened and closed automatically by means of electro-magnetic controls. <br> She looked down
  at me and smiled warmly. Her beauty was breath-taking. She was dressed simply in a kind of Grecian gown of glowing
  silvery-white substance; her hair was golden and fell in soft waves about her shoulders; her eyes were extremely
  large, expressive and deep blue. Soft shimmering colors played continuously about her, apparently varying with every
  slight change of her thought or mood. <br> Hauntingly, the thought was in my mind that I remembered her from
  somewhere. She seemed to sense my perplexity and reassuringly said that I was looking very well and would soon be up
  and about. Then she touched a control on a crystal cabinet near my bed. In response a large section of the opposite
  wall opened revealing a huge mirror. I looked into its crystal depths, but the man I saw was not Orfeo; nor yet was he
  a stranger to me. Paradoxically, I remembered and yet I didn't remember! <br> "I have gained weight," I remarked, not
  knowing just why I made such a statement, then added: "Also, I feel much better now." <br> She smiled and replied: "On
  the contrary, you have lost weight. According to all Earthly standards you are now almost weightless." <br> Her
  strange words puzzled me. I glanced down at my body which appeared to be solidly substantial in addition to being much
  larger and more finely proportioned <br> "It's all a matter of the scale of vibration in which you are functioning,"
  she explained. "The vibratory rate of dense matter which makes up the planet Earth is extremely low, hence Earthly
  bodies are sluggish, dense and cumbersome. Vibratory rates here are quite high and matter so tenuous that it would
  seem non-existent were you in a dense physical body. Because you are now in a body of a corresponding vibratory rate,
  the phenomena of this world is as real to you as your Earth world." <br> As I listened to her speak, I thought I
  remembered her name. "You are Lyra?" I said half questioningly. <br> She nodded her head. <br> I was about to ask her
  about herself when I was conscious again of the continuous, low rumble of thunder from outside. I became curious to go
  out of doors and look around. Turning to Lyra, I asked: "May I go outside now?" <br> She shook her head. "You are not
  yet strong enough, but I promise that before the seventh day you shall see all, Neptune." <br> Her words startled me.
  Why had she called me Neptune? I wondered. I was not Neptune; neither was Neptune ill! And what did she mean by the
  seventh day? <br> I was about to ask her these questions when she turned and looked expectantly toward the far wall.
  In a moment the mysterious door appeared and a tall, strikingly handsome man entered. It was Orion! In some confused
  way I recognized him at once and felt a surge of affection for him in my heart. As with Lyra, shimmering waves of
  translucent color played about him, seemingly reflecting his thoughts. He smiled warmly and said: "We have missed you,
  Neptune." <br> I brushed my hand across my eyes in a dazed way as I replied: "But I am not Neptune; there is some
  mistake." <br> "Are you certain?" he asked gently. "You will recall that Neptune was the name you gave to our brother
  who first contacted you upon Earth. That name has always held a strange, deep significance for you, perhaps because it
  was once your own name." <br> As he spoke the odd realization possessed me that he was indeed speaking the truth. In
  their world, I was, or had once been, Neptune! "But the other Neptune?" I asked. "Who, then, is he?" <br> Orion
  glanced at Lyra and a scintillating wave of golden light enfolded them both. Orion replied slowly: With us names are
  of little significance. The brother of whom you speak was in the illusion of the past known as Astra, but in the
  higher octaves of light, individualized aspects such as you know upon Earth are non-existent. Even now as we manifest
  in this most tenuous of material states of being, you are not aware of us in our true eternal aspect. We are, you
  might say in terms of Earth, staging a dress-show reception for you, our lost brother. Before the Destruction our
  existence was much as you see it now; that is why you seem to remember all of this. In that phase of the time
  dimension you were known as Neptune." <br> Something was wrong, terribly wrong, somewhere. I thought. If only I could
  remember clearly...but everything was so confused. As I gazed at those two superbly magnificent beings standing side
  by side enveloped in shimmering waves of golden light, I felt intuitively that I had known them well, sometime,
  somewhere! I had known them on an equal level - I had been one of them! But now they were like gods to me, and I a
  straggler, somehow far, far behind them, my mind deluded by a loathsome illness. I pressed my hands to my eyes, trying
  with all of my strength to remember something important - and terrible - that I had forgotten. <br> Neither of them
  spoke. Lyra took a white wafer from the crystal cabinet while Orion poured a sparkling liquid into a lavender crystal
  goblet. These they handed to me. I ate the delicately flavored wafer and drank the delicious beverage. I felt renewed
  vitality and strength flow through my body and with it a dreamy languor of mind. Lyra and Orion smiled upon me and the
  scintillating waves of golden light reached out from them and enfolded me in a warm comforting glow. <br> "Sleep for a
  while, Neptune," Lyra murmured softly. Then the mysterious door appeared and they left arm in arm, leaving me alone.
  The light in the room dimmed and waves of soft, exquisite music flowed from the walls. I fell into a deep, dreamless
  sleep. <br> When I awoke light was streaming brilliantly into the room. One entire wall had miraculously vanished
  revealing an outer balcony. I sat up and looked out beyond the balcony upon an incredibly wonderful and fantastic
  world. It was radiant with light and yet there appeared to be a heavy moving cloud bank overhead. Continuous sheet
  lightning flashed through the rainbow-hued clouds and the constant rumble of distant thunder was slightly louder.
  Also, I saw brilliant slow-moving fireballs, bollides, varied-colored flares and showers of brilliant sparks. <br> I
  was deeply puzzled, for all of this phenomena did not seem at all familiar as had so many other things in this world.
  I jumped up from the couch and ran out onto the broad balcony, marveling at the wonderful feeling of lightness and
  vibrant strength in my body. <br> What a glorious world I looked upon! A dream world, beyond the wildest flight of
  imagination. Ethereal, scintillating color everywhere. Fantastically beautiful buildings constructed of a kind of
  crystal-plastic substance that quivered with continuously changing color hues. As I watched, windows, doors, balconies
  and stairs appeared and just as miraculously disappeared in the shining facades of the buildings. The grass, trees and
  flowers sparkled with living colors that seemed almost to glow with a light of their own. <br> I caught my breath in
  awe. And yet, somehow, it was familiar; a world I had once known, and forgotten! A few statuesque and majestically
  beautiful people were walking in the pedestrian lanes. No vehicles of any type were visible. Then I saw Lyra and Orion
  conversing with each other near a large circular flower garden, almost directly below me. They both looked up and
  smiled, calling out a friendly greeting. I ran down and joined them exclaiming: "What a magnificent world!" <br> "Do
  you remember it, Neptune? Lyra asked gently. <br> I hesitated, then replied: "Much is familiar, but other things are
  not. I can't recall the lightning and the constant thunder. And the horizon appears to be only about a mile distant
  and it should be - I seem to remember it was almost limitless!" <br> For a moment there was deep silence. Lyra glanced
  questioningly at Orion and a look of deep pain crossed their faces as the golden waves of iridescent light about them
  changed to misty purple. I realized immediately I had said the wrong thing. <br> Lyra touched a crystal she held in
  her hand and the sound of the thunder was muffled until it was barely audible. Then drifts of exquisite harmony filled
  the air; the same ethereal music I had heard in my trip in the saucer - only here in this incredible world each tone
  also manifested in the atmosphere as waves of glowing color. <br> I listened and watched spellbound. Lyra and Orion
  sat down upon the grass and motioned for me to join them. When we were seated Lyra laid her hand tenderly upon mine
  and Orion put an arm about my shoulders. <br> Then Orion spoke, saying: "Time is a dimension as your scientists now
  correctly surmise. But it is only a dimension when applied to the various densities of matter. In the absolute, or
  non-material states of consciousness, Time is non-existent. So let us say that in one of the time frames or
  dimensions, there was once a planet in the solar system of Earth, called Lucifer. It was of the least material density
  of any of the planets. Its orbit lay between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Among the etheric beings, or heavenly
  hosts, it was called the Morning Star. Among all planets it was the most radiant planet in the universe. <br> "The
  name of the prince of this shining planet was also Lucifer, a beloved Son of God." Orion paused and the sadness
  deepened in his eyes. Then he continued: "Earth's legends about Lucifer and his hosts are true. Pride and arrogance
  grew in the heart of Lucifer and in the hearts of many Luciferians. They discovered all of the secrets of matter and
  also the great secret of the Creative Word. Eventually they sought to turn this omnipotent force against their
  brothers who were less selfish. Also against the etheric beings and the Father, or Source, for it became their desire
  to rule the universe. You know the rest of the legend: how Lucifer and his followers were cast down from their high
  estate. In simpler words, the Luciferians who were embodied then in the most attenuated manifestation of matter "fell"
  into embodiments in one of the most dense material evolutions, which is the animalistic evolution of Earth." <br> I
  dared not look at him as his frightening words struck dark chords of memory in my heart. "Then you mean that I...was
  one of them?" Shamed tears of realization blinded my eyes. <br> "Yes, Neptune," he said gently, as both he and Lyra
  put their arms around me. <br> Waves of bitter shame and sorrow flooded over me as I realized the terrible truth of
  Orion's words. At last I said haltingly: "But Orion, you and Lyra and these others walking here in the garden; who are
  they" <br> "We were among those who did not join the Luciferians in their revolt against the etheric hosts, " he
  explained gently. "Thus although the Luciferians shattered our radiant planet in the holocaust of their war, we
  entered the etheric, non-material worlds in the higher octaves of light as liberated Sons of God, while the Luciferian
  hosts fell into the dream of mind in matter upon the dark planet of sorrows." <br> "But this world?" I asked in
  bewilderment. "Isn't it the world I half remember?" <br> "Yes, Neptune," Lyra said compassionately. "This is a tiny
  part of what is left of that world. You mentioned that many things were unfamiliar, such as the thunder and lightning
  and the nearness of the horizon. These conditions are new to you. For we are on one of the larger planetoids of the
  shattered planet Lucifer. It is only a few hundred miles in diameter, hence the nearness of the horizon. The thunder,
  lightning and constant play of color phenomena in the atmosphere are the result of magnetic disturbances because of
  the vicinity of other asteroids. The clouds you see above are not clouds as you know them upon Earth, but they serve
  to obscure the debris of our wrecked planet. Only rarely do we leave our etheric state of being and enter our former
  time frame in individualized manifestations as you see us now." <br> I was stunned into utter silence and the deepest
  sorrow. I bowed my head as I thought of the magnificent world I had lost, the great heritage I had cast away to become
  a bondsman chained in a steel like dungeon of dense matter with its erroneous manifestations of sin, sickness,
  corruption, evil, decay and repeated deaths. Sobs wracked my body as I thought of my blinded, lost fellows of Earth.
  At last I murmured hesitantly: "Then all of the peoples of Earth have fallen from this former high estate?" <br> Orion
  shook his head. "No, not all, Neptune, but vast numbers of Earthlings are former Luciferians. About the others we will
  explain to you later. The revelation when it comes will explain many of the enigmas of your planet." <br> Suddenly, a
  terrible thought came to me, almost causing me to collapse in horror as I recoiled from it. Stark terror was in my
  eyes as I looked first at Lyra and then at Orion. I dared not voice what was in my mind. <br> Orion, discerning my
  thought, shook his head and his wonderful eyes radiated sympathy and understanding as he said: "No, Neptune, have no
  fear, you are not in reality Lucifer. In fact you are one of the Luciferians who least wanted to join the others."
  <br> Relief flooded over me leaving me weak and shaken as I heard Orion's voice continuing: "Lucifer is presently
  incarnated upon Earth, but we may not disclose to you his present identity. He had incarnated many times upon Earth
  and every name is familiar even to grade school children. But some of those names would surprise you, for they are not
  what you might expect." <br> I sighed heavily, trying to comprehend all the shattering things which had been revealed
  to me by Lyra and Orion. Rather incongruously I remembered the phenomena of the flying saucers upon Earth, which
  caused me to ask: "But if we destroyed your great planet, why are your disks visiting Earth now? Why did Astra contact
  me? Why don't you leave us to the fate we deserve, each one of us buried in his individual grave of living death?"
  <br> Lyra's hand gripped mine and Orion's arm tightened around my shoulders. "Love is stronger than life and deeper
  than the boundless depths of time and space," he said softly. "While our brothers are lost in the hell of unreality
  and turn their blinded, imploring eyes to the mute heavens, we can never forget them. We intercede unceasingly for
  your peoples' liberation. Thus today every bondsman upon Earth has within himself the power through the mystery of the
  Etheric Christ Spirit to cancel his captivity. <br> "Eventually all of mankind deep-drowned in Time and Matter, will
  surface to reality when they recognize their basic unity of being. When man is for man honestly and sincerely and not
  selfishly arrayed against himself, the hour of deliverance from the underworld will be close at hand. We wait now
  beyond the great, sad river of Time and Sorrows with open arms and hearts to receive among us our lost and prodigal
  brothers in that great day when they rejoin us as liberated Sons of God. <br> "Our disks, or saucers as Earthmen term
  them, are in your space-time frame as harbingers of mankind's coming resurrection from the living death. Although our
  disks are essentially etheric; that is, non-material, they are controlled in such a way that they can almost
  instantaneously attract substance to take on any degree of material density necessary. Various other types of space
  craft are now permitted to visit Earth for certain purposes. These are from other worlds and also space islands of
  various densities of matter. Some are on the borderline between materiality and non-materiality. But all are operated
  by intelligences highly spiritual in nature. All are on a mission of love to their brothers of the Dark World, but
  mankind's understanding of their ultimate intent and purpose will only become fully apparent further along in Earth's
  Time Dimension. We do not say that there are no negatives in the universe who have not attained primitive modes of
  space travel, but at present Earth is fully protected from these by both cosmic law and the etheric host." <br> When
  Orion finished speaking there was silence. I sat with bowed head and contrite heart as realization of the full import
  of his words came to me. As Neptune, fleetingly restored to my lost immortal state, I saw that we of Earth are in
  reality in an underworld of illusion where we mistake false shadows for reality and dream selfish dreams of
  separateness from our brothers. <br> As these thoughts were in my mind the ringing of musical chimes sounded from the
  sea-green building. As though this was a signal everyone arose and entered the building. Orion led us to a large
  dining hall. Five men and five women were already there standing at their places at a huge table. At one end of the
  table was a cross wing with three vacant places. Orion indicated that I should take the middle place while he and Lyra
  seated themselves on either side of me. <br> It was an exquisite room and although there appeared to be no direct
  source of light the room was brilliantly lighted; the substance and colors of the room and everything in it seemed to
  glow with a soft, radiant light of their own. Vaguely, I seemed to remember the other persons present and they spoke
  to me as to an old friend. It was soon apparent, however, that the conversation was for my sole benefit as it was
  obvious that everyone else exchanged thoughts telepathically. As they did so iridescent clouds of color about them
  changed swiftly in shimmering hues and patterns. <br> No servants waited upon the table. Yet it was laid out
  exquisitely with the most delicate plates and shimmering silverware. On each plate were three portions. A triangle
  portion of pale amber; a square portion of varying shades of green; and a round portion of lavender. The beverage was
  clear and sparkling in a crystal goblet. These strange delicacies were the most delicious and delicately flavored
  foods I had ever tasted. And the sparkling drink seemed to give immediate renewed strength and energy. <br> When the
  splendid meal was finished and everyone was preparing to leave the table, I turned and looked at Lyra. Suddenly, I was
  fully aware for the first time of all her exquisite feminine beauty and loveliness. Involuntarily, a wave of desire
  for her swept over me. She turned away from me and all conversation in the room ceased. I glanced hastily about; all
  of the others were standing silently with bowed heads. On an opposite wall I saw my reflection in a huge mirror and
  embarrassment flooded over me as I saw an ugly mottled red and black cloud enveloping my head and shoulders. <br> I
  felt impure and unworthy to be in that shining assemblage. The others left quietly, but I had the comforting feeling
  of their deep sympathy for me and their understanding for my human weakness. Also, I had the strong telepathic
  impression that sexual desire is merely another of the erroneous manifestations of materiality. Upon Earth it is
  neither wrong nor sinful in any of its manifestations except when it is used for selfish, destructive and cruel
  purposes. If motivated by love, altruism and unselfishness the sexual appetite is no more erroneous than any of
  mankind's other desires. But in the higher spiritual worlds it is non-existent. <br> Orion touched my arm as we were
  leaving the hall. "We understand," he said kindly. "It is nothing, as you realize now." <br> I smiled gratefully at
  him. But I felt tired and very sleepy. He and Lyra accompanied me to my room where I lay down upon the couch. They sat
  beside me until I fell into a deep sleep. <br> When I awoke I was alone. I walked outside onto the terrace, but the
  grounds were deserted. For a long while I stood there alone on the balcony marveling at that fantastically beautiful
  world. Apparently it was a world of eternal youth, eternal spring and eternal day. The rainbow-hued clouds were always
  moving overhead shot with soft waves of sheet lightning, and the far-away echo of thunder never entirely ceased. The
  trees, flowers and grass were miracles of color, fire and light which in comparison made the remembered counterfeits
  of Earth seem like gross, dull shadows. <br> As I stood there marveling, I saw Lyra come out of the adjoining
  building. She called a warm greeting. I saw she was holding a small crystal object in her hand. When she joined me she
  said mysteriously: "This is the seventh Earth day and through ourselves we shall take you back. <br> Her strange,
  beautiful eyes were upon me, seeming to look through and beyond me. She did not address me either as Neptune, or
  Orfeo. This saddened me, for it made me realize that I was now a stranger and an imposter in their shining world. <br>
  Understanding my thought, she put her hand gently over mine and I saw a mist of tears in her eyes. Then she raised the
  odd crystal in her hand to her forehead. As though in magic response, a flood of beautiful melody arose from the
  sea-green building; not the ethereal music of their world, but a hauntingly sad and familiar strain. I recognized the
  sublime melody of the Bach-Gounod "Ave Maria". Tears flowed unrestrainedly down my cheeks for a half-remembered, sad
  people who dwelt in a strange shadowed region called Earth. Softly she said: "You will remember this, Orfeo." <br>
  That name sounded strange upon her lips; like the name of an utter stranger. I bowed my head in bitter regret for
  Neptune who was, and who now was not - and for the false shadow of Orfeo who is! Confused and perturbed I turned
  hastily from her and hurried into my room. Somehow I had the feeling that the secret of liberation lay in the
  mysterious crystal panel near my couch. <br> But as I reached eagerly for the controls on the panel, I felt a gentle
  restraining hand upon my arm. I turned and looked into Lyra's wonderful eyes shining with sympathy, compassion and
  purest love. <br> My own heart swiftly responded. Then suddenly, miraculously we were as one being, enfolded in an
  embrace of spirit, shared by all of those in the light of God's infinite love throughout the entire universe. What a
  tragedy, I thought, that I and my lost brothers of Earth know mostly only the counterfeit embrace of sexual desire and
  animal passion. <br> At that moment Orion came in the door and as he stood transfixed, his vibrant love too enfolded
  us in its pure, golden unselfish light. All boundaries of self were lost in a unity of being. "Our lost brother is
  home at last," he said softly. <br> After awhile Orion and Lyra seated themselves near the strange crystal control
  panel and I rested upon the lounge. Orion touched a crystal disk and immediately an entire wall of the room opened up
  into a huge three-dimensional void. The room darkened and I saw the void a magnificent view into outer space. But all
  of space was shining with light; the stars and suns glowed with a deep reddish glow and only the planets appeared of
  varying degrees of darkness. The scene was focussing upon an unfamiliar part of the heavens. A sun and a number of
  encircling planets came into view. <br> Then the scene centered upon a single planet in this unknown solar system. It
  was a smug, sleek planet and apparently as efficient as a billiard ball. But it was exceedingly dark in tone and
  surrounded with concentric waves of deep gray. A tangible vibration or emanation came from it; evil, unpleasant and
  utterly without inspiration or hope. Approaching this world I saw a glowing red dot with a long, misty tail. The fiery
  dot seemed irresistible attracted to the dark world. The two collided in a spectacular fiery display. I felt Lyra's
  hand upon mine as she whispered. "It is an immutable law of the cosmos that too great a preponderance of evil
  inevitably results in self-destruction and a new beginning." <br> The scene shifted to a different part of the
  universe. Another dark misty world came into view, although it was not as dark as the first world. About this world
  there was a vibrant feeling of life and hope. But again I saw a fatalistic fiery red dot approaching and it was
  evident that this world too was doomed. I shuddered to think of conditions upon that planet at the moment of doom. But
  then I held my breath as I beheld two tiny dots coming forth from that world apparently to intercept the fiery comet.
  Intuitively I realized that the dots were remotely controlled by intelligence beings upon the planet who were
  concentrating the magnetic impulses of the dots upon the comet. Suddenly the comet exploded leaving the world
  unscathed. I breathed a sign of relief. <br> Once more the scene shifted and focused upon a third world. Obviously,
  this was an "in-between" world, neither as dark and hopeless as the first, nor yet as light and inspired as the
  second. To the left to this planet appeared another smaller body -- I recognized it as our moon and the planet as
  Earth. From the planet several tiny space ships went out to the moon and did not return. Then a tiny fleet of space
  craft went to the moon, but some of these returned to Earth. <br> Suddenly, terrifyingly, to the right of the planet
  Earth, appeared the red, dot of cosmic doom. Rapidly it increased in size leaving behind it a fiery tail of flame. It
  was evident that the comet was being drawn irresistibly toward Earth. Neither Lyra nor Orion spoke, but a strange
  voice said: "In the Time Dimension of Earth it is now the year 1986." <br> I shuddered and waited anxiously, but the
  portentous scene slowly faded from the screen. I turned excitedly to Orion. "But what happens to Earth?" <br> Orion
  and Lyra both looked compassionately at me as Orion gently replied. "That depends entirely upon your brothers of Earth
  and their progress in unity, understanding and brotherly love during the time period left them between the so-called
  now and the year 1986. All spiritual help possible will be given them, not only by ourselves but by others from all
  parts of the universe. We believe that they and their world will be saved, but in no time frame, or dimension, is the
  future ever written irrevocably. If they bring upon themselves self-destruction of their planet through a
  preponderance of evil there, it will mean another fall for the entities of Earth into even denser meshes of
  materiality and unreality. As you love your brothers of Earth, Orfeo, fight to your dying breath to help them toward a
  world of love, light and unity." <br> With those awful and awesome words, he got up and slowly walked from the room,
  leaving me alone with Lyra. <br> She smiled gently into my eyes ad touched the mysterious crystal panel. Immediately
  the incredible, huge, three-dimensional screen became active again. but no longer were we looking into the boundless
  depths of space and time. Instead, I saw the familiar outlines of the Lockheed plant in Burbank. There was the shop in
  which I worked. The scene shifted inside the plant. I saw the radomes and my working companions, Dave Donnegan and
  Richard Butterfield. An unpleasant sensation came over me as though I were fainting, as though I were fading into the
  huge screen and becoming an active part of the scene I was viewing. Terrified, I turned to call to Lyra, but she was
  no longer there, only a mist. Then I blacked out! <br> My next conscious perception was my "awakening" on the job at
  Lockheed with all of my incredible experiences of those seven days seemingly utterly obliterated from my mind. <br>
  Thus six months passed with only hazy, trouble-some intimations of what had happened to me in those seven lost days.
  But that night as I rested my head upon the rock down in the Los Angeles River bed, it all came back to me crystal
  clear. Also, I remembered my frightening, bewildered "awakening" upon Earth in the Lockheed plant, my terrible
  revulsion with everything I saw upon Earth as compared with the wonder world I had left, although as yet only my
  higher consciousness fully understood. <br> I remembered my fellow workers, Dave Donnegan and Richard Butterfield and
  their reactions to my strange behavior and apparently unreasoning outburst. In the greater scope of my new
  understanding I realized even more clearly how nobly they had caught me up and sustained me by their own strength
  through those critical moments. It was so clearly evident to me then that both Dave and Richard had the same basic
  inherent qualities of goodness and nobility as those godlike beings of that other world. They are both simple, humble
  men, average workers like myself, yet potential gods! If only they and others like them knew and could realize their
  divinity, their kinship with God and the greater world of true reality! If every man and woman upon Earth could grasp
  the great essential basic truth that we are all one and an integral part of God, then indeed all of mankind's hard
  trials and bitter tribulations would be over. Yes, if only in the abstract we could momentarily attain this
  illumination, the heavy chains of material bondage would fall from our burdened bodies and our counterfeit world of
  shadows would vanish in true light. <br> Today, I believe with all my heart, soul and body in my brothers of Earth.
  Because of the innate goodness, honesty, nobility and helpful fellowship of the countless other men and women of good
  will like Dave Donnegan and Richard Butterfield, my undying faith in and love for humanity is forever instilled. Even
  though our greater brothers of that shining, lost, wonder world should have to refuse. My lot is forever with my
  fellows of Earth! I will fight courageously with them and for them in the undying belief that the good in our hearts
  will triumph over evil. In the conviction that every human being upon Earth, trapped in eternity and granted only one
  small awareness of life at a time, will be liberated from our prison cells of unreality and attain again our high
  estate as liberated sons of God. <br> <br> Note: The language spoken by the beings of that other world was neither
  familiar English nor Italian, but another language which I fully understood and remembered while with them. But today
  my conscious mind recalls their language only as a meaningless jumble of strange words, although I have a full
  understanding in my own language of all that passed between us. I can clearly recall only a few words of that other
  language. Those words were spoken to me by Lyra when she first came into the room. I am certain she said, "Un doz e
  pez lo" (or something very similar), meaning "No, you have lost weight." </p>
