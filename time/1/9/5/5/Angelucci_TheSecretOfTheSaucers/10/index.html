<p>One evening in December about midnight I was returning to "Pop's" Borgianini lives on the outshirts of town in a
  pleasant suburban area of average homes and small acreage farms. Clouds were overhead, but it was not a particularly
  dark night as there was considerable reflected light from the city. <br> I drove into the yard and parked my car in my
  usual spot. As I sat in the car for a moment breathing the clean, freah air and looking out over the twinkling lights
  of the countryside, I heard a familiar voice call my name. Surprised, I glanced around to see a tall, well-built
  figure approaching from a shadowed corner of the yard. Because I was so completely unprepared for such a meeting, it
  took me a moment to collect my thoughts and realize that the familiar voice could be none other than that of Neptune.
  As he came nearer to the car I could see him fairly well in the soft light. He appeared just has he that night down by
  the Los Angeles River. His closely-fitted "uniform" wavered like restless clouds of light and shadow. <br> But somehow
  I felt altogether different meeting him now; there was none of the eerie feeling I had experienced upon the occasion
  of our first meeting. <br> He seemed he seemed to feel much as I did, for he said cheerfully: "A merry Christmas to
  you, Orfeo." His warm, radiant smile was still the same, as was his noble bearing and everything else about him; yet I
  was able to comprend and understand him so much more easily now. I wondered, has he desended closer to my level, or
  had I, since my strange "awakening" in that other world, risen nearer to his? <br> He answered the question for me .
  "You are indeed a dweller in two worlds now, Orfeo. Sometimes it is difficult for you to determine which world is
  subtance and which is shadow, or if both are not merely differing degrees of subtance. But you have done well,
  considering all that you have been through these last two years. In In reality you are now liberated from your planet,
  Earth and are a citizen of the cosmos. For seven Earth days you were conscious in our world as it existed in Time,
  while I kept watch over your physical body its normal duties here on Earth. Thus in a way I am a part of you even as
  you are a part of me. There now exist eternal bonds of understanding between us" <br> As he spoke, I thought of a
  puzzling statement he had made to me during our first meeting. It was that memorable night down by the Los Angeles
  River. I distinctly remembered that he had said: "We shall return, dear friend, but not to you." I remembered the
  words so well because I had been so saddened to hear them. Thus I looked at him now I was thinking that his very
  presence there seemed to belie those words. <br> He smiled again and said gently: "In reality we have not returned to
  you, Orfeo. You came to us. When you awakened as one of us, you had come home. Don't you understand? We are not
  returning to the shadow, Orfeo; our lost brother has returned to us. And from our first contact with you we never in
  reality ever left you." <br> I grasped the meaning of his words, for I well knew I was no longer the same person who,
  confused and bewildered, had stepped half-fearfully into the saucer that night under the Hyperion Avenue Bridge.
  "Yes," I replied thoughtfully. "What you say is true. Earth to me now often seems like strange land where I have been
  a prisoner who has forgotten his native home." <br> But you are nolonger a prisoner, Orfeo. You have broken the chains
  of matter. Thus can you realize that you were a prisoner--and that realization is all important. The vast majority of
  Earth's people never dream of their true status."</p>
