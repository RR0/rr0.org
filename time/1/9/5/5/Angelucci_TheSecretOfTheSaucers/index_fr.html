<p>De nombreuses personnes m'ont demandé pourquoi les visiteurs de l'espace m'auraient choisi pour un contact plutôt
  qu'un autre individu qu'ils considéraient éminemment qualifié pour un tel contact que moi-même. Pourquoi, ont-ils
  inféré, les visiteurs de l'espace auraient-ils sélectionné une non-entité si insignifiante comme moi pour leurs
  révélations ?</p>
<p>En toute humilité je vous dis que la question que j'ai aussi posée aux visiteurs de l'espace et à moi-même de
  nombreuses fois. Et c'est seulement ces derniers mois que j'ai commencé à pleinement comprendre simplement pourquoi
  j'avais été choisi. Après avoir terminé le livre, cependant, vous aurez la réponse. C'est à vous de décider si vous
  êtes ou non d'accord avec les êtres des soucoupes quant à leur choix de contact. </p>
<p> Ainsi je commencerai en vous parlant un peu du début de ma vie et du 1er contact avec les visiteurs de l'espace
  remontant à l'année <time>1946</time>, lorsque j'étais totalement non informé et que je fis pour la 1ʳᵉ fois une
  observation. </p>
<p> Mon enfance fut l'enfance habituelle heureure et insouciante de la plupart des garçons américains. I joined in the
  less strenuous games, attended school and was fairly good in my studies, although I was always frail and in poor
  health. Fortunately, my family was in fairly comfortable circumstances and they and my two indulgent uncles saw to it
  that I always had the best medical attention available. </p>
<p> My youthful trouble was diagnosed as "constitutional inadequacy" and its symptoms were great physical weakness,
  lassitude, lack of appetite and malnutrition. Hence I tired very easily and the slightest physical effort often left
  me weak and exhausted. I suffered from severe migraine headaches and as I grew older it seemed at times that every
  nerve and muscle in my body ached with excruciating pain. </p>
<p> When I was in the ninth grade the doctors advised that I discontinue school and continue my studies at home. This
  arrangement was highly satisfactory with me, for I have always been intensely interested in all branches of science.
  Ay home I was able to devote my entire time to the study of these subjects.
</p>
<p> With plenty of rest and on a weight-building diet I gained strength and within a year the doctors believed I was
  well enough to return to school. But as my family suffered the financial reverses in the meantime, it was decided that
  it would be best if I went to work for awhile. I heartily approved. My first job was with my uncle's flooring and
  stucco company. He hired me as an estimator salesman as I was not equal to any heavy work. I liked the work and
  enjoyed getting and meeting people. All in all I got along pretty well even though I was considered just a kid. In my
  spare time I continued to study all of the books I could get ahold of on scientific subjects. </p>
<p> In 1936 I met Mabel Borgianini, an attractive Italian girl who is a direct descendant of the famous Borgias. From
  the first, both of us knew we were meant for each other. Her happy, cheerful disposition helped me to keep from
  brooding over my health and physical inability to accomplish all of the things that I longed to do. It was the
  happiest day of my life when we were married. About a year later our first son, Raymond, was born. and our cup of
  happiness was full. </p>
<p> A little later I suffered a complete physical breakdown and was forced to give up my job. My weight fell alarmingly
  from 150 to 103 pounds and I was so weak that I could scarcely sit up. After a number of medical examinations and
  complicated tests, the doctors decided I was suffering from a neurovascular disturbance. They prescribed complete rest
  and continuous medical attention.
</p>
<p> Thus I entered a new world, a white world of doctors, nurses and hospital beds. For eighteen long months I was
  confined to bed. For my body was racked with excruciating pains and I was so utterly exhausted that I could not even
  read. Medical science was doing everything possible for me, but I knew that my doctors didn't believe that I would
  ever pull through. Frankly, I didn't much care whether I lived or died. Life was no longer desirable. To lie day after
  day on a white hospital cot with a body flayed with pain and too exhausted even to think is indeed a living hell.
  Death, I felt could mean release from pain. Especially was the confinement difficult to bear as I had always loved the
  outdoors, the sparkle of the sunshine, the whisper of the leaves in the woods, and the music of the woodland streams.
  Sometimes I prayed that I might die and escape the pain and awful weariness that ached in my muscles. <br> <br> But
  weeks lengthened into months months and gradually I began to improve. Finally I was able too sit up again and then to
  walk. It was like being reborn. I even began to take an interest in my science books once more. At last the joyous day
  when I was able to leave the hospital and return home. All through those long months of confinement the faith and
  encouragement of my wife and family never failed. Mabel was with me through it all and if it hadn't been for her love
  and understanding I doubt if I would have made it. </p>
<p> My body was still wracked with pain, but I had to bear that. The good thing was the terrible exhaustion and
  trembling weekness was gone so that I was able to be up and about. Although my family tried to dissuade me, I insisted
  upon going back to work on my old job almost immediately. I had been inactive so long that I wanted more than anything
  just to be busy again. </p>
<p> After I returned to work, I took up courses in night school. The old insatiable hunger for knowledge was gnawing at
  my very soul. I realized that science had discovered much, but there were still so many things to be learned; so many
  of nature's secrets yet to be revealed. I was obsessed with learning the true nature of the atom; discovering the cure
  for virus diseases and especially for polio, that most ghastly of all crippling diseases. I felt that a satisfactory
  explanation for the creation and operation of the entire universe was yet to be worked out. What was the great mystery
  of the creation of matter, or the actual orgin of the atom? These and other similar enigmas echoed in my brain night
  day. </p>
<p> The field of electricity and electro-magnetic phenomena interested me in particular. Probably because from earliest
  childhood I had an acute fear or phobia about lightning. During an electrical storm I suffered not only actual bodily
  pain, but mental perturbation and distress. Thus I became well versed in atmospheric static electricity. </p>
<p> I conducted some simple experiments on my own. I noticed that all fowl and especially chickens are nervous and
  apprehensive during an impending thunderstorm. It was obvious from my own reactions that they to experienced definite
  physical symptoms because of atmospheric conditions. Also, I discovered chickens are subject to a "range paralysis"
  which in every respect parallels infantile paralysis in human beings. From my studies and experiments in this field I
  believed I had discovered certain facts that might be highly significant in the treatments of polio. In my enthusiasm,
  I wrote a long detailed letter on the subject to President Franklin Roosevelt, who was then in the White House. <br>
  <br> Returning to my studies and home experiments, I became interested in fungi and the atmospheric conditions
  affecting them. I studied the wild mushrooms and the particular atmospheric conditions which resulted in their sudden,
  erratic growth. From the mushrooms I turned to molds. It was my belief that molds are a negative form of life which
  leech on living matter by an illusive, subtle process of mutation . </p>
<p> At that time we were well into World War II. Penicillin had been discovered, but it was yet only a magic word and a
  deep mystery to the public. No books or reports were available on the subject. But by then I was familiar with the
  characteristics of fungi. In my experiments I discovered that one of the most common molds could be made to produce
  chemicals indefinitely if kept in proper nutrition and temperature. It was then I decided to see what structural
  changes would occur in the mold aspergillus clavatus in the upper atmosphere. <br> On August 4, 1946 I took cultures
  of the mold in three stages of growth: embryonic, half mature and mature. I placed the molds in baskets and attached
  the baskets to eighteen Navy-type balloons and prepared to send them aloft. But through an unfortunate accident the
  balloons broke away prematurely, carrying the baskets with the molds aloft with no means of retrieving them. My long
  months of strenuous effort and careful planning were hopelessly lost. <br> Heartsick, I sighed heavily as I watched
  the balloons and my precious molds ascending higher and higher into the clear blue sky. I was a perfect day, just the
  kind of weather I had longed for to make my test, but now everything was irreparably lost. <br> My family and a number
  of friends and neighbors were with me watching the experiment. Also, on hand were a reporter and a photographer from
  the Trentonian, the Trenton daily newspaper. Everyone was silent staring into the heavens watching the balloons
  growing smaller as they gained altitude. Everyone there and especially Mabel and my father-in-law knew how keenly
  disappointed I was. Mabel put her arm comfortingly about my shoulders and murmured: "It's all right, Orfeo. You can
  try again." <br> It was then that my father-in-law, Alfred Borgianini, noticed a craft in the sky and called out:
  "Look! There's an airplane, Orfeo. Maybe it will follow your balloons." <br> Everyone there saw the object and it was
  the consensus that it had been attracted to the spot by the group of ascending balloons. But as it hovered and circled
  overhead, we were all soon aware that it was no ordinary airplane. In the first place it maneuvered in an amazingly
  graceful and effortless manner. Then as we gained a clearer view of it, we were startled to see that it did not have
  the familiar outline of any known type of aircraft. It was definitely circular in appearance and glistened in the
  sunshine. We looked at each other in surprise and bewilderment and the photographer tried to get some shots of the
  thing. Mabel exclaimed: "Why, I never saw such an airplane before! It's round and it doesn't have any wings!" <br>
  Everyone agreed and we continued to stare as it gained altitude and appeared to follow after the balloons until it too
  vanished from our sight. For several days afterward we discussed the strange object, but as in the case of most
  mysteries, we forgot all about it within a week or two. Today, however, any one of those persons who were with me that
  day will vouch for the authenticity of that strange craft. <br> Since then I have learned that the occasion of the
  launching of the balloons was the first time I came under direct observation of the extra-terrestrials. Although I
  never then dreamed of the significance of the event, that was their first contact with me. From that moment on for the
  next five years and nine months I remained under constant observation by beings from another world, although I was
  wholly unaware of it. <br> The state police force was appealed to and requested to be on the lookout for the eighteen
  lost balloons and their strange cargo. Also, local radio stations and newspapers publicized the loss of the balloons
  and requested anyone finding or sighting them to report to authorities. But nothing was ever heard about them and to
  all intents the eighteen balloons and the mold cultures vanished. <br> Several days after the loss of the balloons I
  stopped in at the Palmer Physics Laboratory at Princeton University to visit Dr. Dan Davis, head of the Cosmic Ray
  Department. Dr. Davis had always been most friendly toward me and was never too busy to take time out to help me with
  some of the technical problems that were always troubling me. <br> I told Dr. Davis and one of his aides about the
  experimental molds and their loss in the accident with the balloons. Dr. Davis regretted that I had not told him about
  my experiments beforehand, for he said that the laboratory would have been glad to supply the hydrogen gas for the
  experiment and otherwise help to reduce expenses. Also, he said he would have arranged to have the balloons traced by
  the chain of radar stations in the eastern section. <br> Princeto and its environs were literally heaven-on-earth to
  me, for it was one of the important homes of my beloved science. In the vicinity were such great institutions a
  Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the R.C.A. Laboratories, the American Telephone and Telegraph Co.; the
  Institute for Advance Study; the Heyden Chemical Corporation, producers of penicillin. And nearby were Rutgers
  University, E. R. Squibb and Co., Merck and Son and many others. Yes, I loved every inch of New Jersey with its
  marvelous institutions of learning and scientific research. But my love for the state was offset by my uncontrollable
  apprehensions of and physical anguish during the rather violent thunderstorms there. Thus when Mabel began to talk of
  moving to the West Coast where I'd heard there were few, if any, thunderstorms, I was easily persuaded to go along
  with her plans. <br> In November of 1947 my family, consisting of Mabel and I and my two boys, Raymond and Richard,
  started by automobile for Los Angeles. On the trip we stopped at Rochester, Minnesota where I had an appointment at
  the famous Mayo Clinic with Dr. Walter C. Alvarez, the modern Hippocrates of diagnostic medicine. I sincerely
  appreciated my tremendous good fortune at being granted time by this authority in the field of medicine, for many more
  deserving than I have been unable to see this busy man. <br> Despite his fame and his importance in the medical world,
  I found him extremely modest and kindly. After a thorough examination he concluded that my condition was caused by an
  inherent constitutional inadequacy in an extreme degree. It was his opinion that the condition had been induced by a
  childhood attack of trichinosis from eating contaminated, under-cooked pork. He said I was fortunate to have survived
  the acute attack. He advised me to get as much rest as possible and never to engage in work that was not of my choice
  and liking in order to minimize the burden on my weakened constitution and nervous system. <br> At last we arrived in
  the Golden State on the West Coast. Southern California was a delightful new experience for both my family and myself.
  I decided it was paradise indeed when I discovered that it actually was practically free from electrical storms. And
  my boys and Mabel were thrilled with stretches of golden sand at the seashores, the mountains and the continuous
  semi-spring that prevails there at all seasons of the year. <br> We spent five months in California sight-seeing and
  enjoying the sunshine and the wonders of its scenery. At the end of that time we had to return to Trenton, as I had
  some unfinished business to attend to there. But I had purchased a lot in Los Angeles and we planned to return and
  make our permanent home there as soon as possible. <br> For some years I had been working on a thesis titled, "The
  Nature of Infinite Entities" which included chapters on such subjects as Atomic Evolution, Suspension, and Involution;
  Origin of the Cosmic Rays; Velocity of the Universe, etc. While I was in Trenton I had the thesis published entirely
  at my own expense and mailed copies to various universities and individual scientists working on fundamental research.
  Of course I realized at the time it was presumptuous of me, but I was completely carried away with my tremendous
  enthusiasm for ideas which I believed I understood but could not properly formulate because of lack of technical
  training. <br> It was my deep and abiding hope that some one of the scientists might understand what I was driving at
  and work out the technical and mathematical angles. Some of the men were interested, but none as far as I know ever
  exerted the effort on the theories that I had hoped they might. But at least I was satisfied that I had done my best
  considering the limited circumstances of my education. I was content to let the matter rest. It was obvious science
  had no need of me, a rank and presumptuous amateur. I must remain mute, an orphan of science! <br> We were all happy
  to return to Los Angeles and settle down in our new home. There I went into business with my father. But from the
  first we encountered vicissitudes on every side. For three long, difficult years we struggled along trying to make a
  go of it, but monopolies and stiff competition made the going so rough that we were finally forced to close down the
  business. <br> The temptation was great to return to the security of Trenton where material comfort and a small
  fortune awaited us if we would make our home there. But Mabel and the boys loved Southern California. As far as I am
  concerned, security has never been of great importance in my world of the atom, the electron and the photon. Also,
  there were still those electric storms to reckon with. To an electrophobe like myself, this aspect is always of
  primary consideration. So we decided to forget security and gamble on keeping our home and making a go of it in Los
  Angeles where we were all content. <br> This was in the year 1948and the flying saucers were then making headlines
  from time to time. But I was completely disinterested in the phenomenon. Like many other persons, I thought the
  saucers were some new type of aircraft being secretly developed here in the United States. I figured the information
  would come out in good time. <br> For several months I worked as manager of the Los Feliz Club House. In my spare time
  I endeavored to write a motion picture script. I was more of a hobby than anything else. I didn't really expect the
  script to be accepted as I'd had no writing experience. As the idea of space travel was quite popular in the films
  then, I concentrated on a story about an imaginary trip to the moon. Several studios were interested in the finished
  manuscript, but it was never made into a motion picture. <br> When the club house where I was employed was finally
  leased to a large organization, I made application for work at the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation plant at Burbank,
  California. The application was approved and I went to work for Lockheed on April 2, 1952, in the metal fabrication
  department. <br> After about six weeks in Metal Fabrication I was transferred to the Plastics Unit at Lockheed. Since
  plastics had always interested me, I was pleased with the change. I was one of a three-man crew working on radomes, or
  plastic and glass housings for the radar units of the F-94C and F-94B Starfire jet aircraft. I liked my fellow
  workers, Dave Donnegan and Richard Butterfield. Both were honest sincere, hardworking typical young Americans. They
  had their feet firmly on the ground and although interested on new ideas and scientific developments, they were
  strictly on the material plane and not interested in abstractions. <br> I was fortunate indeed to have two such men to
  cushion the shock of the fantastic chain of events in which I was so soon and unexpectedly to be involved. As I look
  back now it appears that an occult power of some sort had neatly arranged every smallest detail in advance including
  the particular type of job I was in as well as the two men who were to be closest to me through all of my incredible
  experiences. urs was the swing shift. The unusual hours appealed to me as well as the excitement of the new work and
  the motley assortment of people at the plant. But I did not know then what infinitely strange destiny gate held in
  store for me. </p>
