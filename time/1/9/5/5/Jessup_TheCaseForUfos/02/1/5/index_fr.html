<p>There seems to be something of periodicity in events of celestial and spatial origin. This has</span> been called to
  our attention by John Philip Bessor in the <em>Saturday Evening Post </em>as early as May, 1949;</span> but no one has
  thus far been able to catalogue and classify enough of this data to determine for certain</span> whether such cycles
  exist, much less their time period or cause. It is not particularly astonishing that</span> these phenomena should be
  cyclic, for practically everything astronomical is periodic. If periodicity could</span> be firmly established for
  these phenomena, that fact alone would be proof of their reality and integration</span> with the organic world about
  us.</span></p>
<p>The rush of oddities and unusual events in the decade 1877 to 1887 is very much in evidence.</span> Perhaps it does
  seem to be drawing the long bow a bit if one tries to make out that the presence of the</span> great comets, or the
  activity of the Red Spot on Jupiter, were influential in causing such events, but that</span> all of these were
  concomitant is undeniable. If space life is limited to the earth-moon system, there is</span> probably no common
  cause, but it must, however, be borne in mind.</span></p>
<p>Of greater pertinence is the observed and authenticated activity on the lunar surface during those</span> and the
  immediately preceding years. Not only were there appearances and disappearance of lunar</span> craters abaout the size
  of some of the larger space craft which have been seen but there is some</span> evidence that nebulous entities hover
  over these evanescent craters and contribute to their obscuration.</span></p>
<p>Observations of UFO phenomena and related events on or near the earth's surface may be</span> distorted by
  excitement, emotionalism and prejudice. But the direct observations of space life and its</span> contingent activity,
  as seen by astronomers are more objective and more coolly recorded. We can feel</span> more relaxed in dealing with
  them, on more solid ground.</span></p>
<p>Astronomical observations break naturally into three categories: lights, shadows, and bodies.</span> Lights and
  shadows, perhaps, in reality comprise one group since one is the counterpart of the other,</span> while bodies, on the
  other hand, tend to divide into two groups, one made up of solid contrivances and</span> the other of nebulous or
  cloudlike units.</span></p>
<p>Lights seem to be especially representative of intelligence, particularly when they appear to have</span> independent
  movement, or to shine in places where there seems to be no natural organic activity, for</span> lights have to be
  created as well as manipulated. The </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">hundreds </span></strong>of <span
    class="MrBUnderlined">observations </span></strong>of <span class="MrBUnderlined">lights  on </span></strong>or
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">near</span></strong> the </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">moon </span></strong>and <span
    class="MrBUnderlined">in other parts </span></strong><span
    style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">of </span><span
    class="MrBUnderlined">nearby space </span></strong>--lights which seem to exhibit volition, purposefulness and
  direction &ndash; are extremely difficult to explain on any other basis than intelligent activity in space. On
  the</span> other hand, they become a natural corollary to such activity. Again, since </span><span
    class="MrBUnderlined">science has failed utterly to</span></strong> <span class="MrBUnderlined">offer any other acceptable explanation</span></strong>
  , we ask that these lights be taken as one more phenomenon which can be simply adapted to our organic environment by
  the one common denominator of space flight</span> and space life.</span></p>
<p class="note">ED: The following has no obvious reference or necessary position.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">They have built there, now that peace has come these past 70 years. I would Like to see their Great Port
  City but I am too old to travel &amp; even if so could not return. As always, Its</strong>underground</p>
<p>Shadows are almost as easily identified with intelligence as are lights, and one is pretty well the</span>counterpart
  of the other. Their validity cannot be denied. Russell's shadow on the moon, 1,500 miles in</span>diameter, holding a
  steady position for hours, cannot be lightly dismissed. The shadows on our own</span> clouds, as seen in Texas and
  England, are irrefutable proof that some kind of dirigible bodies are moving</span> in our upper atmosphere or in
  nearby space.</span></p>
<p>Bodies seen in space may be considered to have more direct and obvious connection with</span> intelligence than do
  lights and shadow. There was a time when astronomers, seeing these by the</span> dozens, thought them to be
  intra-Mercurial planets, or asteroids. </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">Keen analysts </span></strong>have long
  since dispelled that misapprehension, but they </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">have  not discouraged nor discredited the sightings</span></strong>
  . These have remained without explanation for many decades, and some for hundreds of years. All of these observations
  gradually came to be regarded as erratics, to be ignored if possible. Astronomers who did</span> not make any such
  observations liked to call them hallucinations, especially the </span><span
    class="MrBUnderlined">spindleshaped ones</span></strong> whose configuration did not resemble that of more commonly
  known celestial objects. Mass passages,</span> such as those seen be Herschel and Bonilla, were laughed off as being
  bugs, birds or seeds; or at worst,</span> meteor swarms.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">Ship frames, unfinished &amp; being pushed or turned to new base s, during the Last War</strong><span
  style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">.</span></p>
<p>Little effort was made to determine the parallax of such objects, so their distance was never fairly</span>
  established. We cannot blame the individual astronomer too much for this, particularly since many of</span> those
  observations were made by amateurs. In those days it had not entered our comprehension that</span> any of these
  spatial wanderers could be so close to the earth that parallax would be noticeable between</span> observers only a few
  score miles apart. It has remained for us, awakening to the importance of those old</span> observations, to make what
  we can of parallax studies for determining the distance of the objects sighted.</span> It is not astonishing that our
  findings substantiate earlier analyses, but there may be an element of amazement in finding that these bodies are
  being navigated within the earth-moon system.</span></p>
<p>There is something more of astonishment, however, in finding that the astronomical observations</span> include two
  distinct and divergent types of bodies: the solid, geometrically shaped structures, and the illdefined</span> nebulous
  clouds. Both have been recorded by impeccable witnesses. Both have been shown to</span> exhibit evidences of
  intelligent direction or control. Both have their parallel instances among the current</span> observations of UFO's
  seen by the man in the street, since 1947, and by our forebears as shown in</span> historical records.</span></p>
<p>Strangely enough, however, the cloudy types have been seen really far out in space, and rather</span> probably
  associated with such large comets as that of 1882. But whether seen two-thirds of an</span> astronomical unit away or
  hovering over New York Harbor, they have had peculiar characteristics. Some</span> of those seen by Schmidt in the
  neighborhood of the great comet in 1882 were moving both with the</span> comet and at right angles to it, and there
  were undoubtedly objects moving about within the head of the</span> comet.</span></p>
<p>The astronomical observations are so definite that we must leave them largely to speak for</span> themselves, other
  than to point out again their concentration in certain years. It may be that further</span> investigation will
  disclose other years of concentration, but the task is an enormous one. It is possible to</span> say, however, that
  the search has been fairly exhaustive for the years 1877-86. There is reason to think</span> that the next intensive
  investigation might bear fruit if concentrated around the prior years 1845-1860.</span></p>
<p>It is my contention that these observations of space movements are well explained by the</span> existence of
  controlled space clouds and space structures, and that nothing else known to man does</span> explain them. That the
  structures are the habitat of some kind of intelligence seems reasonable enough,</span> but we also begin to wonder if
  intelligence is also inherent in the big clouds. If it is, then we are almost</span> certainly going to have to adjust
  ourselves to a new type of intelligence and "life."</span></p>
<p class="MrB">Have refused acceptance for 200 ages, <em>How</em></strong> <em>could </em>they ever adjust to What they
  refuse to accept?</strong></p>
<p>Observations by Harrison, Gould, Perrine, Swift, Brooks and others demonstrate incontrovertibly</span> that some of
  the objects seen by astronomers are subject to volitional and purposeful controls, whether</span> they are cometary
  (nebulous) (sic) type (as per Harrison, Perrine, Gould, Bone), or of the planetary</span> (structural) sorts (as per
  Watson, Swift, Lescarbault, Gruitheinsen, et al.).</span></p>
<p>The astronomical literature from 1885 to the present has been but sketchily included and</span> researched. If it is
  but a fraction as prolific as that of the "comet years," there is, indeed, a wealth of UFO</span> lore awaiting some
  research. It is to be doubted if there is as much in later years, because it became</span> increasingly unfashionable
  to publish such information. It is barely possible that the editorial offices of</span> some scientific publications
  may retain some of their old correspondence, and, if so, readers who have</span> enough interest and access to those
  files might reap a rich reward from a bit of browsing. Search of observers' notebooks and observatory files might also
  bear fruit, and the old files of daily and weekly</span> papers, especially where there are professional observatories
  or active amateur clubs, might disgorge</span> some valuable information. I welcome reports of such items.</span></p>
<p>I suggest an alliance between amateur astronomers with telescopes and UFO enthusiasts, for the</span> purpose of
  keeping eyes on the gravitational neutral of the earth-sun-moon systems. At times of new</span> moon and of solar
  eclipse, this neutral point will be directly in line with the sun and moon, which will either</span> be superimposed
  in the sky or be very close to each other. As the moon approached first quarter the</span> neutral will swing to the
  east (left) of the sun and will move back into line between first quarter and full</span> moon. After full moon and
  until third quarter the neutral will move to the west (right) of the sun, and will</span> again swing toward the sun
  between third quarter and new moon. The neutral will reach its maximum</span> distance to left of right at first and
  third quarters, but will not follow the moon around the earth. At new</span> moon the neutral will be very close to
  the moon and that will be the time to watch for objects landing or</span> taking off from the moon, although it is the
  worst time of all to see anything in that region because of the</span> glare of sunlight. On the other hand, at the
  time of full moon the neutral will be closest to the earth, and</span> directly in line with the sun, and that will be
  the time to watch for objects crossing the disc of the sun,</span> probably from left to right. All of this on the
  assumption that space structures do make use of the neutral</span> on account of the lessened navigational problems.
  Look for formations and groups which are especially</span> indicative of intelligent action.</span></p>
<p>Cometary masses, on the other hand, will be more easily seen in other parts of the sky and are</span> less likely to
  be using the neutral. Look for them in the northern sky on dark nights and expect them to</span> look exactly like
  small comets without tails, or like a small nebula. Their rapid motions will give away their</span> nature. </span>

<p class="MrA">"What are we (humans) that Thou hast <em>placed </em>us only a Little "<em>Lower than the Angels" </em>Are
  UFO's Russian</strong></p>
<p>The October 1946, issue of the <em>Intelligence Diges</em>t said:</span></p>
<p>The Soviets have ordered the building of a special centre of Astronomical research--in which will</span> be a number
  of institutes, observatories and special airdromes where flying observatories, special</span> balloons and airships
  are to be based for carrying out protracted studies at high altitudes.</span></p>
<p>Special machinery was acquired and there were further reports of work with monster mirrors. <em>Intelligence
  Digest </em>reported that the Russians were known to be working on a highly secret project involving cosmic rays,
  which (without much proof) was surmised to be related to atomic development.</span> They were reported to have made
  some discoveries far in advance of the atomic research. </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">One of their </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">reported accomplishments was said to be a method of freezing large areas  of ground to subzero</span></strong>
  <span class="MrAUnderlined">temperatures, killing everything therein</span></strong><span
    style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">.</span></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">If that is so then they also have a Heat</strong> Generator all in one IF
  this is Like to what I'm thinking about, in Principle</strong><span
    style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">.</span></p>
<p>The reporting agency, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined"><em>Intelligence  Digest</em></span>, of London, <span
  class="MrAUnderlined">has  proved remarkably accurate </span></strong>in many instances, as for example their
  prediction in November, 1948 of the explosion of a Russian atom</span> bomb which did actually occur during the
  following August, within two months of the time predicted.</span></p>
<p>This is not to say that the UFO's are definitely Russian. But it does appear that </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">Russia has had </span><span
  class="MrAUnderlined">something </span></strong>during the postwar years, <span class="MrAUnderlined">which was worth some very extreme  efforts to conceal</span></strong>
  . Since we were presumably ahead of them in atomic research and development in the late forties, it does seem</span>
  unlikely that concealment of their own atomic work would have justified such tremendous effort.</span></p>
<p>One wonders if their vast military deployment has been of that nature--for if they intended to use it</span> against
  us, their ideal time was in 1950-52 when the United States was weak and spread most thinly over</span> the world.
  There was just enough ostentatious secrecy about their military operations to make them</span> appear to be the major
  interest.</span></p>
<p>UFO's, as we have seen, and as has been pointed out by Palmer and Arnold, Leslie, Wilkins,</span> Fate, and others,
  have been around for thousands of years. </span><span class="MrAUnderlined"><em>It has been no </em>secret that some  principle</span></strong>
  <span class="MrAUnderlined">of space flight </span></strong>or levitation was in existence; the problem was to
  rediscover it for contemporary civilization. As we have said before, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">it  is easier to discover a scientific principle if it is <em>known </em>to </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">exist</span></strong>. The Russians have known this as well as we have known it.</p>
<p>We are contemplating space travel via cumbersome methods within a few years-- at most a few</span> decades. If
  earthlings can be that close to it now, other races, either nonterrestrial or of great terrestrial</span> antiquity,
  can already have it. If the U.S.A. can foresee space navigation in such a short time, there is no</span> reason why
  Russia's mathematicians and physicists cannot have stumbled onto the principles which</span> makes it
  possible.</span></p>
<p>But there is another, and much more plausible, possibility. Have the Russians captured a space</span> ship? Or have
  space people taken over the Red Empire?</span></p>

<p>The </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">secrets of ancient flight </span></strong>and levitation, according to
  researchers into very ancient oriental records and reported by Churchward, Leslie, and others, have </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">been preserved in the monasteries </span></strong>of the Himalayas: </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">in Tibet</span></strong>, Nepal, India and China. <span class="MrAUnderlined">Can there be a  direct relationship between this fact </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">and Russian anxiety to capture and control those mountain fastnesses?</span></strong></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">Could easily be so.</strong></p>
<p class="note">ED: The following has no obvious reference or necessary position.</span></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">Russia FINALLY admits atomic Warfare would</strong> obliterate Civilization

  class="MrAUnderlined">discoveries </span></strong>or through capture of a space ship or association with "Space

<p>If the UFO's are, indeed, interested in preventing disintegration of the earth through atomic</span> warfare, it is
  but natural that they would act through control of one or both of the nations now throwing</span> around their atomic
