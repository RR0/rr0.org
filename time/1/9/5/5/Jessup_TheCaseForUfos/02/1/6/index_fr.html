<p>The <time>1946-10</time>, issue of the <em>Intelligence Diges</em>t said:</p>
<p>The Soviets have ordered the building of a special centre of Astronomical research--in which will</span> be a number
  of institutes, observatories and special airdromes where flying observatories, special</span> balloons and airships
  are to be based for carrying out protracted studies at high altitudes.</span></p>
<p>Special machinery was acquired and there were further reports of work with monster mirrors. <em>Intelligence
  Digest </em>reported that the Russians were known to be working on a highly secret project involving cosmic rays,
  which (without much proof) was surmised to be related to atomic development.</span> They were reported to have made
  some discoveries far in advance of the atomic research. </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">One of their </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">reported accomplishments was said to be a method of freezing large areas  of ground to subzero</span></strong>
  <span class="MrAUnderlined">temperatures, killing everything therein</span></strong><span
    style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">.</span></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">If that is so then they also have a Heat</strong> Generator all in one IF
  this is Like to what I'm thinking about, in Principle</strong><span
    style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">.</span></p>
<p>The reporting agency, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined"><em>Intelligence  Digest</em></span>, of London, <span
  class="MrAUnderlined">has  proved remarkably accurate </span></strong>in many instances, as for example their
  prediction in November, 1948 of the explosion of a Russian atom</span> bomb which did actually occur during the
  following August, within two months of the time predicted.</span></p>
<p>This is not to say that the UFO's are definitely Russian. But it does appear that </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">Russia has had </span><span
  class="MrAUnderlined">something </span></strong>during the postwar years, <span class="MrAUnderlined">which was worth some very extreme  efforts to conceal</span></strong>
  . Since we were presumably ahead of them in atomic research and development in the late forties, it does seem</span>
  unlikely that concealment of their own atomic work would have justified such tremendous effort.</span></p>
<p>One wonders if their vast military deployment has been of that nature--for if they intended to use it</span> against
  us, their ideal time was in 1950-52 when the United States was weak and spread most thinly over</span> the world.
  There was just enough ostentatious secrecy about their military operations to make them</span> appear to be the major
  interest.</span></p>
<p>UFO's, as we have seen, and as has been pointed out by Palmer and Arnold, Leslie, Wilkins,</span> Fate, and others,
  have been around for thousands of years. </span><span class="MrAUnderlined"><em>It has been no </em>secret that some  principle</span></strong>
  <span class="MrAUnderlined">of space flight </span></strong>or levitation was in existence; the problem was to
  rediscover it for contemporary civilization. As we have said before, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">it  is easier to discover a scientific principle if it is <em>known </em>to </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">exist</span></strong>. The Russians have known this as well as we have known it.</p>
<p>We are contemplating space travel via cumbersome methods within a few years-- at most a few</span> decades. If
  earthlings can be that close to it now, other races, either nonterrestrial or of great terrestrial</span> antiquity,
  can already have it. If the U.S.A. can foresee space navigation in such a short time, there is no</span> reason why
  Russia's mathematicians and physicists cannot have stumbled onto the principles which</span> makes it
  possible.</span></p>
<p>But there is another, and much more plausible, possibility. Have the Russians captured a space</span> ship? Or have
  space people taken over the Red Empire?</span></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">NUTS.</strong></p>
<p>The </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">secrets of ancient flight </span></strong>and levitation, according to
  researchers into very ancient oriental records and reported by Churchward, Leslie, and others, have </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">been preserved in the monasteries </span></strong>of the Himalayas: </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">in Tibet</span></strong>, Nepal, India and China. <span class="MrAUnderlined">Can there be a  direct relationship between this fact </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">and Russian anxiety to capture and control those mountain fastnesses?</span></strong></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">Could easily be so.</strong></p>
<p class="note">ED: The following has no obvious reference or necessary position.</span></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">Russia FINALLY admits atomic Warfare would</strong> obliterate Civilization
  from the Earth, No Winner &amp; etc. Would they admitt such if they knew of</strong> Nothing better?</strong></p>
<p>Russia may have discovered such a new force or principle, either </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">through accidental scientific </span><span
  class="MrAUnderlined">discoveries </span></strong>or through capture of a space ship or association with "Space
  People."</p>
<p>If the UFO's are, indeed, interested in preventing disintegration of the earth through atomic</span> warfare, it is
  but natural that they would act through control of one or both of the nations now throwing</span> around their atomic
  weight. Do they, then, control the United States, secretly? Or do they control the</span> Soviets? Or have the Soviets
  captured a space ship? </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">Whether we like it or not, and whether or not </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">our governments admit the true state of affairs, these are <em>some </em>of  the possibilities which we must</span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">consider</span></strong><span
    style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">.</span></p>
<p>If such a condition exists, then even the development of atomic and hydrogen bombs </span><span
  class="MrAUnderlined">could be </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">diversionary.</span></strong></p>
