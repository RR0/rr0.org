<p>It has been postulated that there are "lands in the sky" from which ice falls to earth periodically.</span> But there
  has never been a positioning of these lands. No one tells us what kind of lands, where they</span> are, why ice falls
  from them or why ice exists on them. The lands in the sky theory is based solely on the</span> locale of the falls and
  the kind of ice noted.</span></p>
<p>Read the following citations, bearing in mind our thesis that intelligence or intelligent direction</span> does
  explain the selectivity of materiel and locale.</span></p>
<p>Selectivity can be intelligent or nonintelligent. The affinity of hydrogen and oxygen, which</span> produces water,
  is what we consider nonintelligent selection. The direction which makes rifle bullets</span> strike on or near a
  target is what we believe to be intelligent direction or selectivity.</span></p>
<p>Repetition of falls on the same pinpointed area from fixed regions above a spinning and revolving</span> earth is
  incredible. But repeated showers, selectively directed by intelligence, is a probability within the</span> grasp of
  the uninhibited thinker.</span></p>
<p>We list these occurrences with two thoughts: first, to show that there is a great amount of activity</span> in space
  which has origins difficult to explain on the bases of Newtonian or Keplerian laws, second, they</span> indicate that
  the simplest explanations common to all of these puzzles is that they originate from the</span> actions of space
  contrivances or the intelligence directing such mechanisms.</span></p>
<p>The following reports are from The Books of Charles Fort:</span></p>
<p>1802: During a storm in Hungary on May 8, a mass of ice fell which was three feet long, three</span> feet wide, and
  more than two feet thick.</span></p>
<p>1808: The sun suddenly turned a dull brick red on May 16. At the same time there appeared, on</span> the Western
  horizon, a great number of round bodies, dark brown, and seemingly the size of a hat crown.</span></p>
<p>They passed overhead and disappeared on the Eastern horizon. It was a tremendous procession lasting two hours.
  Occasionally one fell to the ground. When the place was examined, there was found a film</span> which soon dried and
  vanished. Sometimes, on approaching the sun, the bodies seemed to link together</span> in groups not exceeding eight.
  Under the sun they were seen to have tails, Away from he sun, the tails</span> were invisible. Whatever their
  substance may have been, it is described as gelatinous "sopy (sic) and</span> jellied."</span></p>
<p>1811: Lumps of ice, a foot in circumference, fell in Derbyshire, England, on May 11.</span></p>
<p>1828: A mass of ice about a cubic yard in size fell in Candeish, India.</span></p>
<p>1829: A block of ice weighing four and one-half pounds fell at Cazorta, Spain, on June 15.</span></p>
<p>1830: A profound darkness came over the city of Brussels, on June 18, and flat pieces of ice, an</span> inch long,
  fell to the ground.</span></p>
<p>1844: A block of ice weighting eleven pounds fell at Cette, France, in October.</span></p>
<p>1849: An irregular-shaped mass of ice fell at Ord, Scotland, in August, "after an extraordinary</span> peal of
  thunder." It was said that this was homogenous ice, except in a small part, which looked like</span> congealed
  hailstones. The mass was about twenty feet in circumference. The story, as told in the</span> <em>London Times</em>,
  August 14, 1849, is that, upon the evening of August 13, 1849, after a loud peal of thunder, a mass of ice, said to
  have a circumference of twenty feet, has fallen upon the estate of Mr.</span> Moffat, of Balvullich, Rosshire. It was
  said that this object fell alone, without hailstone.</span></p>
<p>1851: Ice the size of pumpkins fell in Gunfalore, India, on May 22.</span></p>
<p>1851: Masses of ice, each piece about a pound and one-half in weight, fell in New Hampshire,</span> August
  13.</span></p>
<p>1853: Masses or irregularly shaped piece of ice fell at Pouen, France, on July 5. They were</span> about the size of
  a hand and described as looking as if all had been broken from one enormous block of</span> ice.</span></p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;">1854: At Pourhundur, India, December 11, flat pieces of ice, many of them weighing
  several pounds each, fell from the sky. They are described as large "Ice-Flakes."</span></p>
<p>1857: The <em>London Times </em>of August 4 reported that a block of ice, described as "pure" ice,</span> weighing
  twenty-five pounds, had been found in the meadow of Mr. Warner, of Cricklewood. There had</span> been a storm the day
  before. As in some of our other instances, no one saw this object fall from the sky.</span></p>
<p>1860: January 14, in a thunderstorm pieces of ice fell on Captain Blackiston's vessel. "It was not hail, but
  irregular-shaped pieces of solid ice of different dimensions, up to the size of half a brick."</span></p>
<p>1860: In a snowstorm in Upper Wasdale, England, on March 16, blocks of ice fell which were so</span> large that at a
  distance they looked like a flock of sheep.</span></p>
<p>1864: During a storm at Pontiac, Canada, July 11, pieces of ice fell which were one-half inch to</span> two inches in
  diameter. What is most extraordinary is that a respectable farmer, of undoubted veracity,</span> says he picked up a
  piece of ice, in the center of which was a small, green frog.</span></p>
<p>1869: Near Tiflis, large hailstones fell which had long protuberances. The most remarkable point</span> is that a
  very long time must have been occupied in their formation.</span></p>
<p>1877: Ice as large as men's hands killed thousands of sheep in Texas on May 3.</span></p>
<p>1880: In Russia, June 14, red hailstones, blue hailstones and gray hailstones fell in profusion.</span></p>
<p>1882: A mass of ice weighing about eighty pounds fell from the sky near Salina, Kansas, in</span> August. Mr. W.J.
  Hagler, a North Santa Fe merchant, collected it and packed it in sawdust in his store.</span></p>
<p>1882: Pieces of ice eight inches long and an inch and one-half thick fell at Davenport, Iowa, on</span> August
  30.</span></p>
<p>1883: A lump of ice the size of a brick, weighing two pounds, fell in Chicago, on July 12.</span></p>
<p>1883: There was a storm at Dubuque, Iowa, on June 16. Great hailstones and pieces of ice fell.</span> The foreman of
  the Novelty Iron Works stated that in two large hailstones, melted by him, were found</span> small living
  frogs.</span></p>
<p>The pieces of ice which fell at that time had a peculiarity as bizarre as anything in this book. They seemed,
  evidently, to have been motionless for a long time floating somewhere.</span></p>
<p>There could be no more perfect description of ice suspended in meteoric orbits.</span></p>
<p>1886: In a small town in Venezuela, April 17, hailstones fell, some red, some blue, and some</span> gray.</span></p>
<p>1887: In Montana, in the winter, snowflakes fell which were fifteen inches across and eight</span> inches thick.
  (Snowflakes?)</span></p>
<p>1889: Intense darkness at Aitkin, Minnesota, April 2; sand and "solid chunks of ice" fell.</span></p>
<p>1889: At East Wickenham, England, on August 5, an object fell, slowly, which was about fifteen</span> inches long and
  five inches wide. It exploded, but no substance was found from it.</span></p>
<p>1891: Snowflakes the "size of saucers" fell near Nashville, Tennessee, on January 24.</span></p>
<p>1893: A lump of ice weighing four pounds fell in Texas, on December 6.</span></p>
<p>1894: From the Weather Bureau of Portland, Oregon, a tornado was reported on June 3. Fragments of ice fell from the
  sky. They averaged three to four inches square and about an inch thick. In</span> length and breadth they had smooth
  surfaces and "</span><span class="MrAUnderlined">gave the impression of </span></strong>a <span class="MrAUnderlined">vast field of ice</span></strong>
  <span class="MrAUnderlined">suspended in the atmosphere</span></strong>, and <span class="MrAUnderlined">suddenly broke into fragments </span></strong>
  about the size of the palm of the hand."</span></p>
<p class="note">ED: The following has no obvious reference or necessary position.</span></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">Crystal, Ice in Great Curved sheets is used</strong> at odd times as a
  Gigantic Lens for close</strong>observation of Humankind or Merely for amusement.</strong></p>
<p>1897: Rough-edged, but smooth surfaced pieces of ice fell at Manassas, Virginia, August 10.</span> They looked much
  like the roughly broken fragments of a smooth sheet of ice. They were two inches</span> across, and one inch
  thick.</span></p>
<p>1901: On November 14, lumps of ice fell during a tornado in Victoria, New South Wales, which</span> weighed a minimum
  of one pound each.</span></p>
<p>1908: A correspondent wrote that, at Braemar, Switzerland, July 2, when the sky was clear</span> overhead and the sun
  was shining, flat pieces of ice fell. Thunder was heard.</span></p>
<p>1911: Large hailstones were noted at the University of Missouri. They exploded like pistol shots. The reporter had
  seen a similar phenomenon at Lexington, Kentucky, eighteen years before.</span></p>
<p>The entire report below, from the <em>Science Record </em>of 1876, is worthy of note.</span></p>
<p>At Potter Station, on the Union Pacific Railroad, recently, a train was just pulling out from the</span> station when
  a storm commenced and in ten seconds there was such a fury of hail and wind that the</span> engineer deemed it best to
  stop the locomotive. The "hailstones" were simply great chunks of ice, many</span> of them three or four inches in
  diameter and of all shapes: squares, cones, cubes, etc., and the first</span> "stone" that struck the train broke a
  window and the flying glass severely injured a lady on the face,</span> making a deep cut. Five minutes later there
  was not a whole pane of glass on the south side of the train,</span> the whole length of it. The windows of the
  Pullman cars were of French plate three-eighths of an inch thick, and double. The hail broke both thicknesses and tore
  the curtains to shreds. The wooden shutters</span> were smashed and many of the mirrors were broken. The deck lights
  on top of the cars were also</span> demolished. The dome of the engine was dented as if pounded with a heavy weight,
  and the woodwork</span> of the south side of the cars was ploughed as if someone had struck it all over with sliding
  blows of a</span> hammer. During the continence of this fusillade, which lasted fully twenty minutes, the damage
  amounted</span> to several thousand dollars and several persons were injured.</span></p>
<p>Note, particularly, the size and shapes of the "hailstones." This was obviously not a hailstorm.</span> Winds strong
  enough to have torn mountain icesheets to bits and carried them across the country, would</span> have lifted the train
  from its tracks. Note, too, the suddenness of the attack.</span></p>
<p>A more definite case of meteoric ice could scarcely be imagined.</span></p>
<p>Lest we fall into the trap of suspecting these reports merely because of their age, I shall depart</span> from my
  desire to draw upon material reported before the present flying saucer phenomenon, and</span> reproduce this letter in
  <em>Fate Magazine</em>, August, 1950.</span></p>
