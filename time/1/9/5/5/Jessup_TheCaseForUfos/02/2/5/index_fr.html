<p>Perhaps the least substantiated, but most fascinating, of the itemized falls include animal and</span> organic matter
  for which no real explanation is yet available. This material is usually considered, but</span> without real thought,
  to be the result of whirlwinds picking up the material in one locale and dropping it</span> elsewhere. It has also
  been suggested that buzzards have been disgorging the matter, particularly the</span> bits of bone and bloody flesh.
  That no whirlwinds were reported at the time of the falls, and that no flights</span> of buzzards have been reported
  seems to have been of little consequence.</span></p>
<p>It is up to us, therefore, to ask: Is there another explanation?</span></p>
<p>1887: On December 13, in Cochin, China, a substance like blood, somewhat coagulated, fell</span> from the
  skies.</span></p>
<p>1888: There was a repeated "red rain" in the Mediterranean region on March 6, and again on</span> March 18. The
  substance, when burned, had a strong and persistent odor of animal matter.</span></p>
<p>It is in the records of the French Academy that, on March 17, 1669, in the town of Chatillon-surSeine, a reddish
  substance fell which was "thick, viscous and putrid." Only organic matter can become</span> putrid.</span></p>
<p>There is also a story of a highly unpleasant substance which fell from the sky in Wilson County,</span> Tennessee. A
  Dr. Troost visited the place and investigated the reports. He declared that the substance</span> was clear blood and
  that portions of bloody flesh were scattered upon tobacco fields.</span></p>
<p>On March 3, 1876, at Olympian Springs, Bath County, Kentucky, flakes of a substance that</span> looked like beef fell
  from a clear sky. Nothing but this falling substance was visible in the sky. It fell in</span> flakes of various
  sizes; some two inches square, and some four inches square. It was a thick shower, on</span> the ground, on trees, on
  fences, but it was narrowly localized on a strip of land about one hundred yards</span> long and about fifty yards
  wide. For the first account see the <em>Scientific American</em>, 34-197, and the <em>New</em></span> <em>York
    Times</em>, March 10, 1876.</p>
<p>It is very important to consider the familiar landmarks of selectivity and localization. The</span> geometric shape
  of distribution, fifty yards by one hundred yards. It corresponds to the size of many of the</span> well-defined falls
  of toads, fish and frogs. Note, too, the thick shower on trees, fences, and the ground.</span></p>
<p>In the American Journal of Science of 1833-1834, in many observations upon the meteors of November, 1833, are the
  following reports of falls of gelatinous substance: (1) that according to</span> newspaper reports, "lumps of jelly"
  were found on the ground at Rahway, New Jersey. The substance</span> was whitish, or resembled the coagulated white of
  an egg; (2) that Mr. H.H. Garland, of Nelson County,</span> Virginia, had found a jellylike substance of about the
  circumference of a twenty-five cent piece; (3) that</span> according to a communication from A.C. Twining to Professor
  Olmstead, a woman at West Point, New York, had seen a mass the size of a teacup, which looked like boiled starch; (4)
  that according to a</span> newspaper of Newark, New Jersey, a mass of gelatinous substance, like soft soap, had been
  found. "It</span> possessed little elasticity, and, on the application of heat, it evaporated as readily as
  water."</span></p>
<p>A story from California, reported in the San Francisco <em>Evening Bulletin</em>, August 9, 1869, tells of</span>
  flesh and blood which fell from the sky, upon Mr. J. Hudson's farm, in Los Nietos Township?a shower</span> that lasted
  three minutes and covered an area of two acres. The conventional explanation was that these</span> substances had been
  disgorged by flying buzzards. "The day was perfectly clear, and the sun was</span> shining, and there was no
  perceptible breeze"; and if anybody saw buzzards, buzzards were not</span> mentioned.</span></p>
<p>Has anyone ever seen buzzards in one flock to disgorge over an area of ten square yards &ndash; much</span> less two
  acres?</span></p>
<p>The </span><span class="JemiUnderlined">flesh </span></strong>was in <span
    class="JemiUnderlined">fine particles</span></strong>, and <span
    class="JemiUnderlined">also in strips </span></strong>from <span
    class="JemiUnderlined">one to six inches long</span></strong>. There were short, fine hairs. One of the witnesses
  took specimens to Los Angeles, and showed them to the editor of</span> the <em>Los Angeles News </em>, as told in the
  <em>News</em>, August 3. The editor wrote that he had seen, but had not</span> kept, the disagreeable objects. "That
  the meat fell, we cannot doubt. Even persons of the neighborhood</span> are willing to vouch for that. Where it came
  from, we cannot even conjecture."</span></p>
<p class="MrA">S-M's Work. They eat so revolting amount of Sea</span></strong> Food that Red-Meat is a Madness in
  Them?</span></strong></p>
<p>The bulletin also said that about two months before flesh and blood had fallen from the sky in Santa Clara County,
  California.</span></p>
<p>These falls of flesh and blood coincide, temporally, with a vast fall of dead birds in Baton Rouge,</span>
  Louisiana.</span></p>
<p>Again we have a familiar pattern: segregation, isolation, clear sky, "about two acres of ground."</span></p>
<p>There is an interesting item from the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1847. On March 16,</span> 1846, at
  about the time of the fall of edible substance in Asia Minor, an olive-gray powder fell at</span>Shanghai. Under the
  microscope it was seen to be an aggregation of hairs of two kinds: Black ones, and</span> rather thick white ones.
  They were supposed to be animal fibers, but, when burned, they gave out "the</span> common ammoniacal smell and smoke
  of burnt hair or feathers." The writer described the phenomenon</span> as a "cloud of 3,800 square miles of fibres,
  alkali, and sand."</span></p>
<p>According to Professor Luigi Palazzo, head of the Italian Meteorological Bureau, on May 15, 1890, at Massagnadi,
  Calabria, something the color of fresh blood fell from the sky. The substance was</span> examined in the public health
  laboratories of Rome and found to be blood. Some said that migratory</span> birds were caught and torn in a violent
  wind, but there was </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">no record of a violent wind at the time</span></strong><span
      style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">,  nor</span> any feathers or dead birds. Later, more
  blood fell from the sky in the same place.</span></p>
<p>The <em>Literary Digest </em>of September 2, 1921 published a letter about a fall of a substance</span> resembling
  blood in southwest China on November 17. It fell upon three villages, and was said to have</span> fallen forty miles
  away as well. The quantity was great, and in one village it covered the ground</span> completely. The writer in the
  Digest accepts that this substance did fall from the sky because it was</span> found on rooftops as well as on the
  ground. He rejects the conventional explanation of dust because the</span> material did not dissolve in several
  subsequent rains.</span></p>
<p>In the <em>American Journal of Science</em>, 1-42-196, we are told of a yellow substance that fell in great
  quantities over a vessel one "windless" night in June, in Pictou Harbor, Nova Scotia. The writer of the</span> article
  analyzed the substance and it was found to "give off nitrogen and ammonia, and an animal odor."</span></p>
<p>I don't think there is much intelligence required in the matter of depositing "a yellow substance</span> giving off
  nitrogen, ammonia, and an animal odor," on a ship. But there could be purposefulness! I feel</span> that there may
  have been intent or necessity, either of which implies some kind of control or cognizance</span></p>
<p class="MrB">Monthly Ship-Cleaning.</span></strong></p>
<p>In these few examples of flesh and blood having come from the sky, we can readily see that it is</span> not beyond
  the realm of </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">possibility that  our space friends are flesh and blood</span></strong>: however, it is a
  more likely assumption that these "disgorged" materials have more to do with experiments and "captures" than</span>
  anything else.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">Kuts, Sky burial impossible.</span></strong></p>
<p>It is possible that there we may have a clue to the whereabouts of the people who have vanished</span> suddenly under
  mysterious circumstances that have baffled witnesses and those seeking to explain these</span> mysteries.</span></p>
<p class="note">ED: The following has no obvious reference or necessary position.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">Burial in Space Not possible, So the L-M's <em>had </em>to</span></strong> grind-up any proof of their
  existence &amp; drop it. THEY Do not Do so now, except in case of attractor</span></strong> failure but deposit their
  dead undersea in the "Vaulted City"</span></strong></p>
<p>Other organic materials have frequently been attributed to meteoric activity, but again we are</span> faced with the
  simple fact that materials fall which do not exist in meteors.</span></p>
<p>In 1872, on March 9, 10, and 11, something fell from the sky and was accompanied by dust. It</span> was described as
  red iron ochre, carbonate of lime, and unidentifiable organic matter.</span></p>
<p>In the <em>American Journal of Science</em>, 1-2-335 (1819), is Professor Graves' account, communicated</span> by
  Professor Dewey, that on the evening of August 13, 1819, a light was seen in Amherst &ndash; a falling</span> object
  &ndash; with accompanying sounds as if from an explosion. In the home of Professor Dewey this light</span> was
  reflected upon a wall of a room. The next morning in Professor Dewey's front yard, in what is said to</span> have been
  the only position from which the light could have been reflected, a substance was found</span> "unlike anything before
  observed by anyone who saw it." It was a bowl-shaped object, about eight inches</span> in diameter, and one-inch
  thick, bright buff-colored, and having upon it a "fine nap." Upon removing this</span> covering, a buff-colored, pulpy
  substance of the consistency of soft soap, was found &ndash; "of an offensive,</span> suffocating smell," A few
  minutes of exposure to the air changed the buff color to a "livid color resembling</span> venous blood," It absorbed
  moisture quickly from the air and liquefied.</span></p>
<p>Note that the "thing" fell with a burst of light. It is not reported to have come with a storm. It was</span>
  obviously of either organic or artificial character, and the "sounds as of an explosion" were scarcely</span> normal
  or commonplace.</span></p>
<p>But it is interesting to compare that report with another; that in Marcn, 1832, there fell in the fields</span> of
  Kourianof, Russia, a combustible, yellowish substance, covering an area at least two inches thick, and</span> six
  hundred or seven hundred square feet. It was resinous and yellowish so one inclines to the</span> conventional
  explanation that it was pollen from pine trees &ndash; but, when torn, it had the tenacity of cotton.</span> When
  placed in water it had the consistency of resin. "This resin had the color of amber, was elastic, like</span> India
  rubber, and smelled like prepared oil mixed with wax."</span></p>
<p class="note">ED: The following has no obvious reference or necessary position.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">Stuff causing "Explosion" was "Force-Impacted"</span></strong> Material Expanding back to Natural "size".
  Thus,Explosions where no Sound is heard, only seen close by.</span></strong></p>
<p>In <em>Philosophical Transaction </em>of 1695 there is an extract from a letter by Mr. Robert Vans, of Kilkenny,
  Ireland, dated November 15, 1695, that there had been "of late," in the countries of Limerick</span> and Tipperary,
  showers of a sort of matter like butter or grease ?"having a very stinking smell." There</span> follows an extract of
  a letter from the Bishop of Cloyne, Leinster, that for a good part of the spring of 1695</span> there fell a substance
  which the country people called "butter" &ndash; "soft, clammy, and of a dark yellow" &ndash;</span> that cattle fed
  "indifferently" in fields where this substance lay. "It fell in lumps as big as the end of one's finger." It had a
  "strong, ill scent." His grace called it a "stinking dew." In Mr. Vans's letter, it is said that the "butter" was
  supposed to have medicinal properties, "and was gathered in pots and other vessels by some of the inhabitants of the
  place."</span></p>
<p>The yellow substance at Kourianof, combustible (organic_ covering six or seven hundred square feet &ndash; about the
  size area we have so often noted &ndash; some characteristics of pine pollen? but who ever saw pine pollen of fibrous
  nature which "when torn had the tenacity of cotton"? Two inches thick means tons!</span></p>
<p>I am inclined to think that there is something of an indication in these buttery things. There is a haunting quality
  which says that these substances were formed by some guidance of a higher intellectual grade than the chemical law of
  averages.</span></p>
<p>The constant references to substances, rather than naming definite elements, compounds, or natural organic products,
  is significant. Why, if all this stuff that admittedly falls from the sky is commonplace, natural material or
  life, </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">is  it usually </span></strong>so difficult for experienced and trained
  scientists and naturalists to give it positive definite identity?</span></p>
<p>There have been many reports of so-called "spider-webs" and "angel hair" that have fallen from the sky. To give but
  one example, let us look at the <em>Montgomery </em>(Alabama) <em>Advertiser </em>of November 21,</span> 1898, which
  reported </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">numerous batches of a  spider-weblike substance </span></strong>which fell
  in Montgomery. Some of it </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">fell in strands </span></strong>and <span
      class="MrBUnderlined">some in masses several inches long </span></strong>and several inches broad. According to
  the writer, it was not spiders' web, but something like asbestos. It was reported, too, as phosphorescent.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">Force-extruder expieriment in Plastic cloth fibreswhich, faild, (sic) then, but Later was successful.
  Boy! My socks wear for 3 years <em>or </em>so!</span></strong></p>
<p>It has been suggested that all of the "falling material" is the result of occasional wrecks of interplanetary,
  super-space contraptions, or even the dumping from them while in route from planet to</span> planet. If one considers
  this proposition carefully, the natural question is: why so often?</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, if adjacent space toward the gravitational neutral at the edge of the earth's sphere of influence,
  perhaps 180,000 to 200,000 miles away from here, should be the habitat of a vast</span> number and considerable
  variety of intelligently operated space widgets or urban concentrations of the</span> like, then the whole proposition
  begins to take on a certain amount of plausibility.</span></p>
<p>In the past two or three decades, there has been a great discussion about miniature fossils found in meteorites, and
  something about spores and mono-cellular organisms, maybe alive, or at least viable.</span> Everyone, but those whose
  weak ego demands that they maintain scientific dignity by making categorical</span> denials with professional aplomb,
  will concede that this question is debatable, and has been since the</span> findings were first announced. But,
  debatability is something different from inconceivability, incredibility,</span> negative proof, positive proof, or
  even smug denial. It is an important point to settle.</span></p>
<p>If settled positively &ndash; that meteorites do contain fossils, viable spores or dormant protozoa &ndash;
  than</span> we have proved that life, or remnants of it, does come from outer space. This is obviously a
  qualitative</span> decision. It is on the periphery of science, especially astronomy, biology, and geology. It can be
  an</span> anthropological question if it can be shown that human life has mergers with life in outer space.</span></p>
<p>If one or more of these fossils or elements of incipient life can be shown to arrive on this planet</span> via
  meteors, we are confronted with a major problem of deciding whether the meteorites were thrown off</span> this earth
  in the remote past, whether they originated in the explosion of another planet, whether they</span> arrive from
  interstellar space, whether they grew spontaneously in the general melee of the origin of the</span> solar system
  &ndash;- or where, in fact, did they originate?</span></p>
<p>A Dr. Hahn has claimed to have found miniature fossils in meteorites, including corals, sponges,</span> shells and
  crinoids, all microscopic, which he photographed. Some, who didn't see them, taking an</span> attitude of professional
  scorn, claimed they were not valid. Some trained and intelligent men, like Francis</span> Blingham, who did see them,
  agree that they are real and were contained in meteorites.</span></p>
<p>Much miscellaneous junk does seem to come from space, and, with all of this material in space, it</span> is but a
  step to acceptance of intelligence, or life, some of it in control of vast assemblages of spatial</span> objects or of
  individual little ones.</span></p>
<p>One supposes organic material to be a product of life processes, associated with life, or the</span> abode of life.
  Life implies intelligence, even of an incipient, primitive or rudimentary type. Our contention</span> is that some
  kind of intelligence </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">has  adapted itself to this environment</span>, if it was
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">not actually indigenous thereto</span>.</p>
<p>We shall close this section with a mystery. The following is from <em>Fate</em>, of April 1951.</span></p>
<p><u>The Mystery of the Falling Grain</span></u></p>
<p>One day last summer construction men were working on the top of the Empire State Building</span> tower, 1,467 feet
  above the street, preparing to put up a new television mast. Suddenly, something stung</span> the check of one of the
  men. Then another reached into his shirt collar and picked out a grain of</span> something or other. He looked at it
  in puzzlement, then flung it aside.</span></p>
<p>Then other men began to notice the kernels falling upon them. While they looked in</span> bewilderment, nearly a peck
  of grain fell upon the men. It stung their faces and necks and bounced off</span> the steel floor.</span></p>
<p>Where was it coming from? They heard no airplanes overhead nor did they see any. There was</span> no wind or storm,
  though the sky was overcast. Meanwhile the grain continued to fall. Tenants along the</span> north side of the
  building heard it rattling against their windows.</span></p>
<p>Samples of the grain were taken to Dr. Michael Lauro, official chemist of the Produce Exchange, who identified it as
  barley. Dr. Lauro suggested that it might have come from one of the great breweries</span> of New York -- possibly
  carried up through cyclone chimneys &ndash; but hastened to add that he was just</span> guessing. Ernest J. Christie,
  of the U.S. Weather Bureau, said that the winds that day were too light to</span> have borne the grain aloft. He did
  not consider it likely that it had blown in from the Midwest. One</span> scientist suggested, but dropped the idea
  hastily, that birds had dropped the barley.</span></p>
<p>Of a reasonable satisfactory explanation, there was none.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">This Man hints much at there being two distinct species or groups of Similar species to be involved in
  his observation. Why does he presist in Mere Hinting so strongly. I believe that he KNOWS FOR CERTAIN <em>but </em>can
  do Nothing. L-M's ARE in for a surprise <em>if </em>he does do <em>something</em>.</span></strong></p>
