<h2> La 1ʳᵉ lettre reçue par M. Jessup de Carlos Allende</h2>
<p>
  <a href="/people/a/AllenCarlMeredith/index.html">Carlos Miguel Allende</a><br> R. D. #1 Box 223<br> New Kensington,
  Penn.</p>
<p> Mon cher Dr. <a href="/people/j/JessupMorrisK/index.html">Jessup</a>,</p>
<p> Your invocation to the Public that they move en Masse upon their Representatives and have thusly enough Pressure
  placed at the right &amp; sufficient Number of Places where from a Law demanding Research into Dr. Albert Einstiens
  (sic) Unified Field Theory May be enacted (1925-27) <u>is Not</u> at all Necessary. It May Intrest (sic) you to know
  that The Good Doctor Was Not so Much influenced in his retracton (sic) of that Work, <u>by</u> Mathematics, as he most
  assuredly was by Humantics. (sic)</p>
<p> His Later computations, done strictly for his own edification &amp; amusement, upon cycles of Human Civilization
  &amp; Progress compared to the Growth of Mans General over-all Character Was enough to Horrify Him. Thus, We are "<u>told</u>"
  today that that Theory was "Incomplete".</p>
<p> Dr. B. Russell asserts privately that It is complete. He also says that Man is Not Ready for it &amp;
  Shan't be until after W. W. III. Nevertheless, "Results" of My friend Dr. Franklin Reno, <u>Were used</u>. These Were
  a complete Recheck of That Theory, With a View to any &amp; Every Possible quick use of it, if feasable (sic) in a
  Very short time. There Were good Results, as far as a Group Math Re-Cheek AND as far as a good Physical "Result," to
  Boot. YET THE NAVT FEARS TO USE THIS RESULT. The Result was &amp;
  stands today as Proof that The Unified Field Theory to a certain extent is correct. Beyond that certain extent No
  Person in his right senses, or having any senses at all, Will evermore <u>dare</u> to go. I am sorry that I Mislead
  You in My Previous Missive. True, enough, such a form of Levitation has been accomplished as described. It is also a
  Very commonly observed reaction of certain Metals to Certain Fields surrounding a current, This field being used for
  that purpose. Had Farraday concerned himself about the Mag. Field surrounding an Electric Current, We today Would NOT
  Exist <u>or if</u> We did exist, our present Geo-political situation would have the very time-bomish, ticking off
  towards Destruction, atmosphere that Now exists. Alright, Alright! The "result" was complete invisibility of a ship,
  Destroyer type, <u>and all</u> of its crew While at Sea. (Oct. 1943) The Field Was effective in an oblate spheroidal
  shape, extending one Hundred yards (More or Less, due to Lunar position &amp; Latitude) <u>out</u> from each beam of
  the ship. Any Person Within that sphere became vague in form BUT He too observed those Persons aboard <u>that</u> ship
  as though they too were of the same state, yet were walking upon nothing. Any person without that sphere could see
  Nothing save the clearly <u>Defined shape of the Ships Hull in the Water</u>, PROVIDING of course, that that person
  was just close enough to see yet, just barely outside of the field. Why tell you Now? Very Simple; If You choose to go
  Mad, then you would reveal this information. Half of the officiers &amp; the crew of that Ship are at Present, Mad as
  Hatters. A few, are even Yet, confined to certain areas where they May receive trained Scientific aid when they,
  either, "Go Blank" or Go Blank" &amp; "Get Stuck". Going-Bland IE an after effect of the Man having been within the
  field too Much, IS Not at all an unplesant experience too Healthily Curious Sailors. However it is when also, they
  "Get Stuck" that they call it"HELL" INCORPORATED" The Man thusly stricken can Not Move of his won volition unless tow
  or More of those who are within the field go &amp; touch him, quickly, else he "Freezes".</p>
<p>If a Man Freezes, His position Must be Marked out carefully and then the Field in cut-off. Everyone but that "Frozen"
  Man is able to Move; to appreciate <u>apparent</u> Solidity again. Then, the Newest Member of the crew Must approach
  the Spot, where he will find the "Frozen" Mans face or Bare skin, that is Not covered by usual uniform Clothing.
  Sometimes, it takes only an hour or so Sometimes all Night &amp;
  all Day Long &amp; Worse <u>It once took 6 months</u>, to get The Man "Unfrozen". <u>This "Deep Freeze" was not
    psychological</u>. It is the Result of a Hyper-Field that is set up, <u>within</u> the field of the Body, While the
  "Scorch" Field is turned on &amp; this at Length or upon a Old Hand.</p>
<p> A Highly complicated Place of Equipment Had to be constructed in order to Unfreeze those who became "True Froze", of
  "Deep Freeze" subjects. <u>Usually a "Deep Freeze" Man goes Mad, Stark Raving,, Gibbering, Running MAD</u>, if his
  'freeze' is far More than a Day in our time.</p>
<p> I speak of TIME for DEEP "Frozen Men" are Not aware of Time as We know it. They are Like Semi-comatoese (sic)
  person, who Live, breathe, Look &amp; feel but still are unaware of So Utterly Many things as to constitute a "Nether
  World" to them. A Man in an ordinary common Freeze is aware of Time, Sometimes <u>acutely</u> so. Yet They are <u>Never</u>
  aware of Time precisely as you or I are aware of it. The First "Deep Freeze" As I said took 6 months to Rectify. It
  also took over 5 Million Dollars worth of Electronic equipment &amp; a Special Ship Berth. If around or Near the
  Philadelphia Navy 2 and you see a group of Sailors in the act of Putting their Hands Upon a fellow or upon "thin air,"
  observe the Digits &amp; appendages of the Stricken Man. If they seem to Waver, as tho within a Heat-Mirage, <u>go
    quickly</u> &amp; Put YOUR Hands upon Him, <u>For that Man is the Very Most Desparate of Men in The World. Not one
    of those Men ever want at all to become again invisible</u>. I do Not think that Much More Need be said as to Why
  Man is Not Ready for Force-Field Work. Eh?</p>
<p> You will Hear phrases from these Men such as "Caught in the Flow (or the Push) or "Stuck in the Green" or Stuck in
  Molasses" or "I was "going" FAST", These refer to Some of the Decade-Later after effects of Force-Field "ork. "Caught
  in the Flow" describes exactly the "Stuck in Molasses" sensation of a Man going into a Deep Freeze" or Plain Freeze"
  either of the two. "Caught in the Push" can either refer to That Which a Man feels Briefly WHEN he is either about to
  inadvertently "Go-Blank" IE Become Invisible" or about to "Get Stuck" in a "Deep Freeze" or "Plain Freeze."</p>
<p> There are only a very few of the original Experimental D-E's Crew Left by Now, Sir, Most went insane, one just
  walked "throo" His quarters Wall in sight of His Wife &amp; Child &amp; 2 other crew Members (WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN),
  two "Went into "The Flame, "I.E. They "Froze" &amp; caught fire, while carrying common Small-Boat Compasses, one Man
  carried the Compass &amp; Caught fire, the other came for the"Laying on of Hands" as he was nearest but he too, took
  fire. THEY BURNED FOR 18 DAYS. The faith in "Hand Laying" Died When this Happened &amp; Mens Minds Went by the scores.
  <u>The expierement (sic) Was a Complete Success. The Men Were Complete Failures</u>.</p>
<p> Check Philadelphia Papers for a tine one Paragraph (upper Half of sheet, inside the paper Near the rear 3rd of
  Paper, 1944-46 in Spring or Fall or Winter, NOT Summer.) of an Item describing the Sailors Actions after their initial
  Voyage. They Raided a Local to the Navy Yard "Gin Mill" or "Beer Joint"
  &amp; caused such Shock &amp; Paralysis of the Waitresses that Little comprehensible could be gotten from them, save
  that Paragraph &amp; the Writer of it, Does Not Believe it, &amp; Says "I only wrote what I heard &amp; them Dames is
  Daffy. So, all I get is a "Hide-it" Bedtime Story."</p>
<p> Check observer ships crew, Matson Lines Liberty ship out of Norfolk, (Company MAY Have Ships Log for that Voyage or
  Coast Guard have it) The S.S. Andrew Furnseth, Chief Mate Mowsely, (Will secure Captains Name Later) (Ships Log Has
  Crew List on it.) one crew Member Richard Price or "Splicey" Price May Remember other Names of Dec Crew Men, (Coast
  Guard has record of Sailors issued "Papers") Mr. Price Was 18 or 19 then, Oct. 1943, and Lives or Lived at that time
  in His old Family Home in Roanoke, VA a small town with a Small Phone book. These Men Were Witnesses, The Men of this
  crew, "Connelly of New England, (Boston?), May have witnessed but I doubt it. (Spelling May be incorrect) DID Witness
  this. I ask you to Do this bit of Research simply that you May Choke on you own Tongue when you Remember what you have
  "appealed be Made Law"</p>
<p> Very Disrespectfully Yours,</p>
<p> Carl M. Allen</p>
<p> P.S. Will Help More if you see Where I can. (Z416175)<br> 2 Could be "Free Freeze"</p>
<h2> Days Later</h2>
<p> Notes in addition to and pertaining to Missive.<br> (Contact Rear Admiral Ransom Bennett for verification of info
  Herein. Navy Chief of research. He may offer you a job, ultimately)</p>
<p>Coldly &amp; analytically speaking, without the Howling that is in the Letter to you accompanying this, I will say
  the following in all Fairness to you &amp; to Science. (1) The Navy did Not know that the men could become invisible
  WHILE NOT UPON THE SHIP &amp; UNDER THE FIELDS INFLUENCE. (2) The Navy Did Not know that <u>there would be</u> Men Die
  from odd effects of HYPER "Field" within or upon "Field." (3) Further, They even yet do Not know Why this happened
  &amp; are not even sure that the "F" within "F" is the reason, for sure at all. <u>In Short</u> the Atomic bomb didn't
  kill the expierimentors (sic) thus the expieriments (sic) went on-but eventually one or two were accidentally killed
  BUT <u>the cause</u> was known as to Why they died. Myself, I "feel" that something pertaining to that Small-boat
  compass "triggered" off The Flames." I have no proof, but Neither Does the Navy. (4) WORSE &amp; Not Mentioned When
  one or two of their Men, Visible-within-the-field-to-all-the-others, Just <u>Walked into Nothingness</u>, AND Nothing
  Could be felt, of them, either when the "field Was turned on OR off, THEY WERE JUST GONE! <u>Then</u>, More Fears Were
  Amassed. (5) Worse, Yet, When an apparently Visible &amp; New-Man Just walks seemingly "throo" the Wall of his House,
  the surrounding area Searched by all Men &amp; thoroughly scrutinized by &amp; with &amp; Under an Installed Portable
  Field developer AND NOTHING EVER found of him. <u>So Many Many Fears were by then in effect that the Sum total of them
    all could Not ever again be faced by ANY of those Men or by the Men Working at &amp; Upon The Experiments</u>.</p>
<p> I wish to Mention that Somehow, also, the Experimental Ship Disappeared from its Philadelphia Dock and only a Very
  few Minutes Later appeared at its other Dock in the Norfolk, Newport New Portsmouth area. This was distinctly AND
  clearly identified as being that place BUT the ship them, <u>again</u>, disappeared And Went <u>Back</u> to its
  Philadelphia Dock in only a Very few Minutes or Less. This was also Noted in the Newspapers But I Forget what paper I
  read it in or When It happened. Probably Late in the experiments, May have been in 1956 <u>after</u> Experiments were
  discontinued, I can Not Say for Sure.</p>
<p> To the Navy this Whole thing was So Impractical due to its Morale Blasting effects Which were so much so that
  efficient operation of the Ship was Drastically Hindered and then after this occurrence It was shown that even the
  Mere operation of a ship could Not be counted upon at all. In short, Ignorance of this thing bred Such Terrors of it
  that, on the Level of attempted operations, with what knowledge was then available It was deemed as impossible,
  Impracticable and Too Horrible.</p>
<p><u>I believe</u> that Had YOU <u>then</u> been Working upon &amp; With the team that was Working upon this project
  With yourself knowing what You <u>NOW</u> know, <u>that</u> "The Flames" Would Not have been so <u>unexpected</u>, or
  Such a Terrifying Mystery. Also, More than Likely, I must say in All fairness, None of these other occurrences could
  have happened without some knowledge of their possibility of occurring. In fact, They May have been prevented by a far
  more Cautious Program AND by a Much More Cautiously careful Selection of Personnel for Ships officers &amp; Crew. Such
  Was Not the case. The Navy used Whatever Human <u>Material</u> was at hand, Without Much, <u>if any</u>, thought as to
  character &amp; Personality of that Material. If care, Great Care is taken in selection of Ship, and officers and crew
  AND If Careful Indoctrination is taken <u>along</u> with Careful watch over articles of apparel Such as rings &amp;
  Watches &amp;
  Identification bracelets &amp; Belt buckles, <u>Plus</u> AND ESPECIALLY the effect of Hob-Nailed shoes or
  Cleated-shoes U.S. Navy issue shoes, I feel that some progress towards dissipating the fearfilled ignorance
  surrounding this project Will be Most surely and certainly accomplished. The Records of the U.S. Maritime
  <u>Service</u> HOUSE Norfolk Va., (for Graduated Seamen of their Schools) Will reveal Who was assigned to S S. Andrew
  Furuseth for Month of either Late Sept. or October of 1943. I remember positively of one other observer who stood
  beside Me When tests were going on. He was from New England, Brown-Blond Curly Hair, blue eyes, Don't remember Name. I
  Leave it up <u>to you</u> to Decide if further Work shall be put into this or Not, and Write this in Hopes there Will
  be.</p>
<p> Very Sincerely,</p>
<p> Carl M. Allen</p>
<h2>The second letter received by Mr. Jessup from Carlos Allende</h2>
<p>Carl M. Allen<br> RFD #1 Box 223<br> New Kensington, Pa</p>
<p> Dear Mr. Jessup:</p>
<p> Having just recently gotten home from my long travels around the country I find that you had dropped me a card. You
  ask that I write you "at once" and So after taking everything into consideration, I have decided to do so. You ask me
  for what is tantamount to positive proof of something that only the duplication of those devices that produce "this
  phenomenon" could ever give you. At least, were I of scientific bent, I presume that, were I of Such a Curiosity about
  something, the which has been produced from a theory that was discarded (1927) as incomplete, I am sure that I would
  be of such a dubiousness towards that I would Have to be <u>shown</u> these devices that Produced such a curious
  interaction of Forces&amp; Fields, in operation &amp; their product Mr. Jessup, I could NEVER possibly satisfy such an
  attitude. The reason being that I could not, Nor ever would the Navy Research Dept. (Then under the present oss of the
  Navy, Burke) ever let it be known that any such thing was ever allowed to be done. For you see, It was because of
  Burkes Curiosity &amp; willingness &amp; prompting that this experiment was enabled to be carried out. It proved a
  White-elephant <u>but</u> His attitude towards advance &amp; ultra-advanced types of research is just <u>"THE"
    THING</u> that put him where he is today. (Or at least, to be sure, It carries a great weight). Were the stench of
  such an Experiments results EVER to come out, He would be crucified.</p>
<p> However, I have noticed, that throo the ages, those who have had this happen to them, once the vulgar passions <u>that</u>
  caused the reaction have cooled-off AND further research OPENLY carried on, that these crucified ones achieve
  something akin to Saint hood. You say that this, "is of the greatest importance". I disagree with you Mr. Jessup, not
  just whole Heartedly, <u>but vehemently</u>. However at the same time, your ideas &amp; your own sort of curiosity is
  that of mine own sort and besides my disagreement is based upon philosophical Morality and not upon that curiosity
  which Drives Science so rapidly. I can be of some positive help to you in myself <u>but</u> to do so would require a
  Hypnotist, Sodium Pentathol, a tape recorder &amp; an excellent typist-secretary in order to produce material of <u>Real</u>
  value to you.</p>
<p> As you know one who is hypnotized cannot Lie and one who is both hypnotized AND given "Truth serum" as it is
  colloqually (sic) known, COULD NOT POSSIBLY LIE, <u>AT ALL</u>. To boot, <u>My Memory</u> would be THUS enabled to
  remember things in such great detail, things that my present consciousness cannot recall at all, or only barely and
  uncertainly that it would be of far greater benefit to use hypnosis. I could thus be enabled to <u>not only</u> Recall
  COMPLETE names, but also addresses &amp; telephone numbers AND perhaps the <u>very</u> important Z Numbers of those
  sailors whom I sailed with then or even came into contact with. I could too, being something of a Dialectician, be
  able to thusly talk exactly as these witnesses talked and imitate or <u>illustrate</u> their mannerisms &amp; <u>Habits
    of thought</u>, thus your psychologists can figure IN ADVANCE the Surefire method of dealing Most Successfully with
  these. I could NOT do this with someone with whom I had not observed at length &amp; these men, I lived with for about
  6 months, so you are bound to get good to excellent results. <u>The mind does NOT ever forget, Not really, As you
    know</u>. Upon this I suggest this way of doing this with Myself but further, the Latter usage of Myself in
  Mannerism &amp;
  Thought pattern illustration is suggested in order that the Goal of inducing these Men to <u>place themselves</u> at
  &amp; under you disposal (HYPNOTICALLY OR UNDER TRUTH-SERUM), is a Goal, the Which could Have FAR greater impact, due
  to co-relation of Experiences remembered Hypnotically <u>by Men who have NOT seen or even written to each other, at
    all, for Nearly or over TEN years</u>. In this, With such Men as Witnesses, giving irrefutable testimony It is my
  belief that were, Not the Navy, but the Airforce, confronted with such evidence, (IE Chief of Research) there would be
  either an uproar or a quiet and determined effort to achieve SAFELY "that which" the Navy failed at. They did NOT fail
  <u>to</u>, I hope you realize, achieve Metallic &amp; organic invisibility nor did they fail to, unbesoughtedly, (sic)
  achieve transportation of thousands of tons of Metal &amp; Humans at an eyes blink speed. Even though this latter
  effect of prolonged experimentation was (to them) THE thing that caused them to consider the experiment as a failure,
  I BELIEVE THAT FURTHER EXPERIMENTS WOULD NATURALLY HAVE PRODUCED <u>CONTROLLED</u> TRANSPORT OF GREAT TONNAGES AT
  ULTRA-FAST SPEEDS TO A <u>DESIRED</u> POINT <u>THE INSTANT</u> IT IS DESIRED throo usage of an area covered by: (I)
  those cargoes and (2) that " Field" that could cause those goods, Ships or Ship parts (MEN WERE TRANSPORTED AS WELL)
  <u>to go</u> to another Point. Accidentally &amp; to the embarrassed perplexity of the Navy THIS HAS ALREADY HAPPENED
  TO A WHOLE SHIP, CREW &amp; ALL. <u>I read of this AND</u> of THE OFF-BASE AWOL ACTIVITIES OF the crew-Men who were
  <u>at the time</u> invisible <u>in</u> a <u>Philadelphia</u> NEWSPAPER. UNDER HARCOHYPNOSIS I CAN BE ENABLED TO
  DIVULGE THE NAME, DATE &amp; SECTION &amp; PAGE NUMBER of <u>that</u> Paper &amp; the other one. Thus this papers
  "Morgue" Will Divulge EVEN MORE POSITIVE PROOF ALREADY PUBLISHED of this experiment. The Name of the REPORTER who
  skeptically <u>covered &amp; Wrote</u> of these incidents (OF THE RESTAURANT-BARROOM RAID WHILE INVISIBLE &amp; OF <u>THE
    SHIPS</u> SUDDEN AWOL) AND WHO INTERVIEWED the Waitres<u>ses</u> CAN THUS BE FOUND, thus HIS and the Waitresses
  testimony can be added to the Records. Once on this track, I believe That you can uncover CONSIDERABLY MORE evidence
  to sustain this, ------- (what Would you call it --SCANDAL or DISCOVERY?) You would Need a Dale Carneigie to <u>Maneuver
    these folks </u>into doing just as you wish. It would be cheaper than paying everyone of all these witnesses &amp;
  <u>Much more Ethical</u>. The Idea Is, to the Layman type of person, utterly ridiculous. However, can you remember,
  all by yourself, the Date of a Newspaper in which you saw an interesting item more than 5 years ago? Or recall names
  of Men, their phone #'s that you saw in 1943-44.</p>
<p> I do hope you will consider this plan. You will Progress as Not possible in any other way. Of course, I realize that
  you would need a Man Who can cause people to want to have fun, to play with Hypnotism, one that can thusly dupe those
  he-you need to: #1 come to His Demonstrations &amp; thus call on them to be either or both "Honored" as Helping with
  the show" &amp; for doing Him a Great favor, &amp;/or being part of the act for the mite of a small fee He would HAVE
  to be a Man of such an adroit ingenuity at Manufacturing a <u>plausible story</u> on the-instant-he-sizes-up-his-"<u>personality-to
    be dealt-with</u> THAT had cost PLENTY. The ability to convince people of an outright Lie as being the absolute
  truth would be one of his prime prerequisites. (Ahem.) Yes, some such skulduggery (sic) would have to be thought well
  out &amp; done. THE ULTIMATE END WILL BE A TRUTH TOO HUGE, AND TOO FANTASTIC, TO NOT BE TOLD. A WELL-FOUNDED TRUTH
  BACKED UP BY UNOBFUSCATIVE PROOF POSITIVE. <u>I would like to find where it is that these Sailors live NOW. It is
    known</u> that some few people can somehow tell you a mans name &amp; his Home address UNDER HYPNOSIS EVEN THOUGH
  <u>NEVER</u> HAVING EVER MENT OR SEEN THE PERSON. These folks have a very high or Just a High PSI factor in their
  make-up that can be intensified under stress or strain OR that usually <u>is</u> intensified under extreme fright. It
  also can be RE-intensified by Hypnosis, <u>thus</u> is like reading from the Encyclopedia Britannica. Even though that
  Barroom-Restaurant Raid was staged by invisible <u>or</u> partly invisible men, those men <u>CAN SEE EACH OTHER</u>
  THUS NAMES, In the excitement, <u>were</u> sure to have been Mentioned, whether last or first Names or Nicknames. A
  check of the Naval Yards Dispensaries or Hospital or aid stations or prison RECORDS of that particular day that the
  Barroom-Restaurant occurred May revela (sic) the EXACT NAMES OF PRECISELY WHO WERE THE MEN, THEIR SERVICE SERIAL
  NUMBERS &amp; THUS THE INFORMATION ON WHERE THEY ARE <u>FROM</u> BE SECURED &amp; by adroit "Maneuvuerings" (sic) of
  those still at Home, THE NAME OF <u>THE PLACE</u> where they are at present can be secured.</p>
<p> HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO ACTUALLY SPEAK TO (or some of <u>THE MEN</u>) A MAN WHO WAS ONCE <u>AN INVISIBLE HAMAN
  BEING</u>? (MAY BECOME SO IN FRONT OF YOUR VERY EYES IF HE TURNS-OFF HIS HIP-SET). Well, all this fantastically
  preposterous sort of rubbish <u>will be</u> necessary, Just to do that, the Hypnotist-psychologist &amp; all that.
  Maybe I suggest something <u>too</u> thorught (sic) &amp; <u>too</u> Methodical for your taste but then I, as first
  subject, Don't care to be Hypnotized <u>at all</u>, But too, feel that certain pull of curiosity about this thing
  that, to me, is irresistible. I <u>want</u> to crack this thing wide open. My reasons are simply to enable <u>more
    work</u> to be done upon this "Field Theory".</p>
<p> I am a star-gazer Mr. <a href="/people/j/JessupMorrisK/index.html">Jessup</a>. I make no bones about this and
  the fact that I feel that <u>IF HANDLED PROPERLY, I.E. PRESENTED TO PEOPLE &amp; SCIENCE IN THE PROPER PSYCOLOGICALLY
    EFFECTIVE MANNER.</u> I FEEL sure THAT Man will go where He now dreams of being---to the stars via the form of
  transport that the Navy accidentally stumbled upon (to their embarrassment) when their EXP. SHIP took off &amp;
  popped-up a minute or so later on several Hundred sea

  travel--trip miles away at another of its Berths in the Chesapeake Bay area. I read of <u>this</u> in another
  newspaper &amp; only by Hypnosis could <u>any</u> Man remember <u>all</u> the details of which paper, date of
  occurrence &amp; etc., you see? Eh. Perhaps already, the Navy has used this accident of transport to build your UFO's.
  It is a logical advance from any standpoint. What do <u>you</u> think???</p>
<p>VERY RESPECTFULLY</p>
