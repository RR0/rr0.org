  swims and has webbed feet--</span>then perhaps it is a duck!</span></p>
<p>But a child, seeing his first platypus, will say, "It looks like a duck with four feet and fur! But what is
  it?</span></p>
<p>But what happens when a man sees something for the first time and asks, "What is it?"?and</span> there is no one who
  can supply the answer?</span></p>
<p>Fortunately, our experience and knowledge enable us to explain the seeming inconsistencies of</span> this freak of
  nature.</span></p>
<p>The controversy about the s0-called Flying Saucers began in just such a fashion with <a
    href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Kenneth</span> Arnold</a>-s startling announcement in 1947.</span></p>
<p>A businessman of Boise, Idaho, Mr. Arnold was on his way from Chehalis to Yakima,</span> Washington. Flying in his
  private plane, he was startled to see a bright flash on his wing.</span></p>
<p>Looking in the direction of Mount Rainier, he was astonished to see </span><span class="JemiUnderlined">nine</span>
  gleaming disks, each approximately the size of a C-54. They were </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">clearly  outlined</span> against the snow.</p>
<p>As he later told the story, "it was as if they were linked together. They flew close to the top of</span> mountain in
  a diagonal, chainlike line."</span></p>
<p>Mr. Arnold estimated their speed to be around twelve hundred miles per hour, and he thought</span> they must have
  been about twenty to twenty-five miles from his plane.</span></p>
<p>"I watched them about three minutes," he said. "The were swerving in and out around the high</span> mountain peaks.
  They were flat, like a pie pan, and </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">so shiny</span> they <span
      class="MrBUnderlined">reflected  the sun</span> like a mirror. I never saw anything so fast!</span></p>
<p>Thus, as of June 24, 1947, Flaying Saucers were born.</span></p>
<p>"I saw them--but what are they?" Mr. Arnold undoubtedly asked. And no one had the answer.</span></p>
<p>Since that memorable day, thousands of other sightings have been reported and verified, and still</span> the question
  must be asked, "What are they?" But more importantly, </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">where do they come from</span>, what is their purpose here, and if they can do it, why can't
  we? Are they Russian secret weapons?</span></p>
<p class="MrB">Not Worry, Jemi, those were L-M Ships, Not "S" Men. They are an improved type &amp; were only on a
  training Flight. That is why their leader inter-connected their force-fields-to teach them Ion Level TeleControl
  without inducing a fear-block <span class="note">Clearest Translation</span> which they, too, get When "Mowing the
  Lawn."</p>
<p>Several well-documented volumes have been devoted to listings of sightings, to reports by</span> everyone from boy
  scouts and families on picnics to astronomers and a man who claims to have had a</span> conversation with a Saucer
  passenger from <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus">Venus</a>.</span></p>
<p>But our answers to the questions, our evaluation of the potential answers to the fascinating and</span> sometimes
  frightening questions, end where others begin. In other words, we shall not devote ourselves</span> to the recent
  sightings and reports which have flooded newspaper offices, official bureaus of the</span> government and, for some
  strange reason, airports. (Presumably, the public feels that anything which</span> takes place in the air is the
  business of the airport!)</span></p>
<p>I have long been interested in the study of the unexplained areas of human existence, and </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">as an</span></strong><span class="MrAUnderlined"> astronomer </span></strong>with special
  interest in the moon, the early reports of flying saucers caught my attention.</span> References in dusty volumes in
  the Library of Congress flashed through my mind, references I </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">had noted</span></strong> <span class="MrAUnderlined">years ago </span></strong>and
  which </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">now</span></strong>, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">in  the light of these developments, seemed to offer a new field </span></strong>
  of</span> research, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">of analysis and co-relation </span></strong>which might throw
  light upon the matter.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace:none;"><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">I began to ask myself questions </span></strong>? </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">and </span></strong>I began to see a shape, a form, take place in the entire</span> field of
  observable phenomena </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">which  had remained obscure and previously unrelated.</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace:none;"><em>This flying saucer was </span></em><span class="JemiUnderlined">photographed </span></strong>
  <em>over the Brazilian Jungle</span></em></p>
<p>Desmond Leslie, in the book, "Flying Saucers Have Landed," reviewed some of the</span> interesting material gleaned
  from old manuscripts, many of which referred to sightings of unidentified</span> objects flying through the air. The
  most cursory examinations of such material, when collected and</span>organized into a readable whole, made it </span>
  <span class="MrAUnderlined">quite  evident </span></strong>that conclusions could be drawn.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace:none;"><span class="MrAUnderlined">Does it follow</span></strong>, I
  wondered, that </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">still further conclusions </span></strong>could be drawn if one were
  to collect</span> and sift and evaluate data from many different fields? Would there be any indication that life does,
  in fact,</span> exist in space? If so, would that life have direction, control, intelligence? Or would it be amoebic
  in</span> nature, lacking intelligence, be a form of vegetable or animal-mineral life? Would a thorough study
  of</span> material in many fields </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">reveal a pattern</span></strong>, a consistency
  of any sort which would provide clues to the future </span>activities of these Unidentified Flying Objects?</span></p>
<p>I wanted to know the answers. I wanted to know if the somethings existed, and if they did, what</span> they
  were. </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">I wanted to know where  they lived and how they lived</span></strong>. I
  wanted to know what they were</span> doing when we didn't see them. I wanted to know why some people saw them and some
  people didn't</span> see them. I wanted to know why they appeared in one place and not another. </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">I wanted to know</span></strong> <span class="MrAUnderlined">whether they were friendly or hostile.</span></strong>
</p>
<p><span class="MrAUnderlined">L-M? PALS; S-M?</span></strong>  <span class="note">This note is quite ambiguous. It may be  interpreted as the above or as: L---M: PALS S-M? or since L-M closely follows  the word hostile it might be: Hostile LM?</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace:none;"><span class="MrBUnderlined">Even if he knew he nor any number of men could</span></strong>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">ever do anything, Jemi</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace:none;">PALS: S-M? From the similarity of the marks following L-M and S-M the
  first interpretation is most likely the correct one.</p>
<p class="MrA">For first they would refuse to even believe. Requires true Humility or active<span
    style="font-family:Arial; font-size:7.0pt; color:#008100; ">2 </span>fascination.</p>
<p>I wanted to know, further, if they might be a Mark Twain-like hoax which a gullible public was</span> swallowing,
  having tired of ordinary pursuits of happiness and excitement.</span></p>
<p>I wanted to know, too, whether we would have to wait until the things decided to visit us, or if we could
  possibly </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">expect to pay them a  surprise visit in their own territory in the near future</span></strong>
  .</span></p>
<p>Like a child seeing his first platypus, I asked myself questions. But unlike the child, I searched for</span> my own
  answers.</span></p>
