<p>A serious approach to the question of Unidentified Flying Objects demands, first of all, that we</span> face a
  fundamental change in concept as regards the world of our environment. We must loosen out</span> thinking, let our
  imaginations fly with the winds, and, above all, we must want to think!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace:none;"><span class="JemiUnderlined">No human being with a closed mind need read further</span></strong>
  , for he will be asked to think as he has</span> never thought before, to admit to possibilities which will shake the
  very foundations of his being.</span></p>
<p>For countless generations mankind has been confronted with an endless series of events, the</span> causes of which
  have been obscure, if not altogether outside any casual sequence which his mind was</span> able to imagine. In varying
  degrees, these happenings have generally been called supernatural: in more</span> modern terminology, paranormal. This
  convenient phraseology may </span><span class="JemiUnderlined">name </span></strong>them and, to a lesser
  extent,</span> classify them; however, it does </span><span class="JemiUnderlined">not </span></strong>explain the
  events, nor does it transmit and real knowledge to a</span> groping mankind.</span></p>
<p>To gain understanding, therefore, </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">we  must do more than classify; we must analyze and</span></strong>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">theorize</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace:none;"><span class="MrBUnderlined">To do these things we must courageously invade a field which has so  frightened formal</span></strong>
  <span
      class="MrBUnderlined">science that it has been omitted from man's professed and organized  cognizance. </span></strong>
  Only a few have</span> <span class="MrAUnderlined">dared </span></strong><span class="MrBUnderlined">to admit these phenomena and to  investigate them </span></strong>
  Of the few, </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">a large proportion have</span></strong> <span class="MrBUnderlined">become outcasts from their chosen field of study</span></strong>
  . They have become nonconformists, and few sins</span> are considered more basic. </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">Yet the mass of  our qualitative knowledge has come through</span></strong>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">nonconformity</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="MrA">Don't Worry those few DO NOT COUNT. He again asks too much of Proud, Vain Humankind</strong></p>
<p>In this volume, we are going to confront, for the first time, a number of hitherto incorrigible facts.</span> We
  shall relate, for the first time, previously unrelated data and draw startling conclusions therefrom.</span></p>
<p>To begin such a leap into the maelstrom of the "supernatural," we must first clarify our use of the</span> word
  "world." We must no limit it to a state or a continent. And, despite the fact that it may disturb our</span>
  complacency and arouse vague fears, we can no longer limit it to a single planet. The earth is not alone,</span> nor
  has it been for some time.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace:none;"><span
    style="font-family:'Arial Narrow'; font-size:7.0pt; color:black; ">2 </span><span
    style="font-family:'Arial Narrow'; font-size:8.5pt; color:black; ">Clearest translation. Could be actual.</span></p>
<p>Next, we segregate paranormal experiences into groupings having some family likenesses. Only</span> by so doing can
  we give them the merciless scrutiny necessary to determine their significance. If there is</span> enlightenment to be
  had from the, we shall have it. (If this be nonconformity, let us make the most of it;</span> our orthodox opponents
  may try to make the worst.)</span></p>
<p>This segregation of "erratics" or "oddities" into groups having some similarity serves a two fold</span> utility.
  First, it simplifies our problem of analysis, because it helps t bring order out of chaos-chaos which</span> is the
  product of centuries of accumulated data with no co-relation, with no purpose other than that of</span> cataloguing
  facts for posterity. We may now assume, and with great assurance, that we are the posterity</span> for whom these data
  were recorded. The time has come when these isolated ? and lone facts, so long</span> orphaned, must be brought into
  the light, marshaled, and made to serve our purpose. This heterogeneous mass of data has doubtless been preserved for
  some purpose, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">if life has any meaning </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">at all</span></strong>, and </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">the  solution of the mystery of the UFO's may well be that purpose</span>.</span>
</p>
<p>The second utility of grouping is to establish emphasis and striking power, for any one of these innumerable events
  is too weak to stand alone in the face of scientific scoffing. It does not matter,</span> evidently, that a thousand,
  or even ten thousand, people observe and report paranormal events. </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">One</span></strong> <span class="MrBUnderlined">self-confident</span></strong>, </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">assertive </span></strong>and </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">arrogant scientist</span></strong>, </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">backed by the tacit support of his esoteric</span></strong>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">profession</span></strong>, </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">can deny the occurrence</span></strong>, </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">obfuscate its record</span></strong>
  , </span><span class="MrBUnderlined"><em>nullify </em>its import</span></strong>, and come close to</span> convincing
  the ten thousand people </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">that  they did not see what they <em>plainly </em>saw</span></strong>. </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">This, of course, is</span></strong> <span
      class="MrBUnderlined">not really science</span></strong>. It comes close to a kind of intellectual dictatorship,
  and imperialism of the intellect.</span> Thus, by relating the previously unrelated, we can build a wall </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">unscalable by such conformists</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">Such contempt for those badly frightened or</strong> Strictly Orthodox Namby-Pamby Scientists, The Shade
  of Galileo Walks again in the Name</strong> of Better Science</strong>.</span>Will he arouse &amp; Enlighten as
  before?</strong></p>
<p class="MrA">No, my twin, He Walks throo cloudsl</strong></p>
<p>But let us not be over ambitious. We can as easily overstep the bounds of our capabilities </span><span
    class="MrBUnderlined">as we</span></strong> <span
    class="MrBUnderlined">can shirk our responsibilities. </span></strong>Some of the unexplained phenomena do seem to
  lie in what, for lack of</span> a better terminology, we must still call the paranormal or psychic fields. One must be
  on guard not to</span> commit the prime fallacy of all analysis, that of evolving a theory and then proceeding to find
  facts by</span> which to substantiate it. Therefore, we must sort our observations into two groups. One group will
  contain everything which can be attributed to physical action by intelligent beings or an undeified and</span>
  nonspiritual status. The second group is the residue which, as far as one can judge after careful</span>
  consideration, must remain associated with the psychic or spiritual realm.</span></p>
<p>Even a cursory survey of the vast and scrambled field of strange events--oddities, we can call</span> them--shows us
  at least three major areas. One of these relates to things which fall from the sky, some of</span> which come from
  space and which may be roughly classified as organic and inorganic. We use "organic"</span> in the sense of something
  which is part of, or associated with, a living, thinking entity, and "inorganic" as</span> being merely the debris of
  space. An ordinary iron-nickel meteorite from space is inorganic within the</span> sphere of our present definition;
  but if this meteorite arrives on earth shaped like a seven-headed Malayan goddess, or a compound microscope, it's
  organic.</span></p>
<p>A second major category stands out in the bibliography of oddities. It is the great area of events which encompasses
  disappearing people, and ships; airplanes and airships crashing and disappearing</span> without trace and without
  warning; instantaneous and mysterious transportations of people and things;</span> inexplicable tracks and marks, such
  as the Devil's Footprints of Devonshire, and the "cup-marks" found in</span> stone over much of the world; the
  organically shaped meteorites found in Tertiary rock and coal</span> formations; evidences of levitation and flight
  from prehistoric antiquity; and many other phenomena which</span> appear to us to be, or resemble, acts rather than
  things.</span></p>
<p>All of these are terrestrial events--manifestations more or less on the terrestrial surface.</span></p>
<p>But there is a third great area of observational data. It is that vast conglomerate of purely astronomical
  observations which relates to things and phenomena in space or on planets and satellites</span> other than earth.
  These are the unpopular, poor relatives of </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">orthodox </span></strong>astronomy, the
  untouchable</span> erratics. </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">These have come to be regarded with  such disfavor </span></strong>that there are few
  published records of</span> them within the past fifty to seventy-five years.</span></p>
<p>We may consider that the sciences of meteorology and mereoritics, whose nature we will discuss later, speak almost
  eloquently in behalf of the case for space life and UFO's. </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">It is within these fields</span></strong>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">that we have found the greatest volume </span></strong>of </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">detailed observation and data</span></strong>. And it is just here that we</span> have found
  the most difficulty in grouping and organizing. Even here, however, we can not a primitive</span> <span
      class="MrBUnderlined">pattern </span></strong>and by simple use of it as a guide, we begin to separate acts of
  intelligence from "natural" acts of</span> statistical nature.</span></p>
<p>Whereas the actual groupings are given in Parts Two, Three, and Four, the problems involved in</span> the initial
  research are of interest. The resolution of those problems is still another key to the fact that we</span> are on the
  right track, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">that by  relating the previously unrelated we have discovered pattern and</span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined"> form.</span></strong></p>
<p class="note">ED: The following has no obvious reference or necessary position.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">All men of renown had two things, Courage &amp;</strong> Conviction, often so Much that they were
  ridiculed. This Man opens &amp; invites same merely</strong> by Saying what his observations, Records &amp; Data <em>have
    shown </em>him, What Cannot be escaped. There are, of course, such Men who like the one that</strong> Would not
  permit himself to View the Planets</strong> Circling the sun Lest it interfere with his religious "Dogmas of the
  day."</strong></p>
<p>An example of the way such things develop is our experience in classifying falling objects. Our</span> first thought
  was that this was a minor field which could be disposed of with a casual perusal. Not so. It</span> soon developed, as
  the pattern began to evolve, that we could not coordinate these onslaughts from the</span> sky, nor interpret them,
  unless we gave consideration to their effect, their origins, and to concomitant</span> phenomena. Not only that, but
  very shortly we were forced to acknowledge that falling objects and other</span> phenomena in the sky must be
  considered in three categories if order was to ensue from chaos. In short,</span> there seemed to be a class of
  objects which were merely physical debris cluttering up space and moving</span> in orbits of varying shapes and which
  had little, if any, relationship to or association with intelligent being.</span> A second group was obviously the
  product of thinking, if not, indeed, of higher mental characteristics such</span> as purposefulness, determination,
  morality, and perhaps even humor. Then, especially in those</span> instances where space phenomena appear to
  intermingle with our native meteorological condition, it</span> became necessary to consider, as a third group, the
  less spectacular terrestrial events and to clarify our</span> thinking by segregating these and getting them out of
  our way.</span></p>
<p>The upshot of this coercion was that we found more than half a dozen subcategories wherein we</span> were allied with
  the sciences of meteorology which is the terrestrial science of the air, and meteoritics</span> which is a branch of
  <a href="../../../../../../../../astronomie/index.html">astronomy</a>.</span></p>
<p>Let us, then, consider briefly these segments of our problem. To most of you who read this book,</span> falling ice
  has been limited to hailstones, mostly small, perhaps the size of marbles. But in trying to</span> organize data on
  ice which falls from the sky, we ran head-on into cases where chunks of ice weighing</span> from a few pounds to some
  tons were known to fall, and without final proof we were forced to give thought</span> to "spacebergs" which might
  weigh thousands of tons each, maybe hundreds of thousands, and which</span> arrived from space in swarms of hundreds
  or even thousands, and left vast scars on the surface of the</span> earth. We were compelled to consider some of these
  falling blocks of ice as having been produced by, or at least associated with intelligent entities. It was even
  necessary to consider various sources for the</span> orbital ice, depending on whether it came from the exploded fifth
  planet, whether it was blasted off the</span> earth by prehistoric atom scientists, whether it was detached from the
  earth by tidal action when the earth</span> and moon were united, whether it fell off the moon, or just where did it
  come from? In sifting out these</span> cases where intelligence seemed to be involved, we found the process to have
  certain resemblances to</span> panning gold nuggets from alluvial gravel. At least if the nuggets were there, we had
  to do our own sifting.</span></p>
<p class="note">ED: The following has no obvious reference or necessary position.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">I am Not adverse to saying that a Force-Field <strong><em><span

<p>We went through similar compelling experiences with regard to falling stones, falling live animals,</span> and
  falling animal or organic matter. We found that life arriving from the sky was almost universally of a</span> low
  order, such as reptilian or aquatic, and we found that some of it involved such intellectual elements as</span>
  functionality, localization of target and repetition in fixed areas. The only common denominator for all the</span>
  observed conditions turned out to be -- of all things --hydroponic tanks in space craft!</span></p>
<p class="MrB">ON <em>THE </em>HEAD!</strong></p>
<p>And if we are confronted with a falling object of crystalline rock obviously shaped as an optical</span> aid, are we
  to cravenly call it an erratic, and discard or ignore it? And are we to cringe before the</span> deposition of a few
  hundreds of dead birds from the heavens, all on one city, but of species completely</span> scrambled and mostly
  unknown within hundreds of miles of that city?</span></p>
<p>What would you do with a piece of meteoric iron, unmistakably shaped by intelligent hands, but</span> which was
  equally unmistakably removed from solid formations of geological Tertiary Age of 300,000</span> years ago? Wouldn't
  you perhaps reshuffle your conception of the antiquity of intelligence and wonder</span> whether it was, for a fact,
  indigenous to this planet?</span></p>
<p>If you found raw meat, with hair attached, falling over a two-acre space, from a clear and</span> undisturbed sky,
  wouldn't you struggle even harder to find some kind of category for it, and a common</span> denominator of explanation
  relating it with other phenomena?</span></p>
<p class="Jemi">SPOILED FOOD, DROPPED.</strong></p>
<p>If you found that water sometimes arrives from the sky in solid masses, flooding little brooks until</span> they
  washed away villages, but neglecting the brooks a half mile away, wouldn't you look for a category</span> outside
  routine meteorological storms?</span></p>
<p>These problems all had to be faced. Something had to be done about them -- and they all arose</span> from objects
  falling from the sky. Also, they had to be distinguished from meteorological storms -- for</span> <span
      class="MrAUnderlined">some of the clouds which </span></strong>we studied </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">just appeared</span></strong>
  , spat a stone or two and passed on. They were</span> not thunderstorms, What were the?</span></p>
<p>Those were the problems which we faced in a welter of data on things coming from the sky, but they were, on the
  whole, less puzzling than events which directly involve people, or which were clearly</span> current actions and not
  merely things which may have been operated in distant times and places. Among</span> those phenomena involving people,
  the sudden disappearances are probably the most amazing. Some</span> have disappeared instantly, while being watched
  by friends and close relatives. Crews have mysteriously</span> disappeared from ships-- sometimes within sight of
  their home port--without warning and without trace.</span></p>
<p class="Jemi" style="text-autospace:none;">HEH! IF HE ONLY KNEW WHY, HE'D DY OF SHOCK.</strong></p>
<p>There are too many instances of planes and ships disappearing for us to ignore them. One plane</span> is reported to
  have flown into a cloud from which it never emerged, while the crew of a blimp disappeared</span> before the eyes of
  dozens of watchers. We are still wondering what happened to about fifty passengers</span> from a plane whose wreckage
  was found recently on a mountainside in the Pacific Northwest.</span></p>
<p>These are several of the instances which have prompted some writers to postulate that UFO's</span> were on the
  attack. My contention is that, at the very worst, such an attack is no more organized or</span> malicious than that of
  a redcapped hunter stalking deer in the Pennsylvania mountains is an attack by the</span> human race against the deer;
  and there may be elements of similarity.</span></p>
<p>It is almost an inseparable corollary to our thesis that we admit to an unfathomable antiquity for</span> mankind, or
  at least intelligence, upon the earth, and its vicinity. This conclusion is made unavoidable by</span> the antiquity
  of records of UFO's and wingless flight. It is apparent in the innumerable megalithic works of</span> stone which
  involve masses </span><span
      class="JemiUnderlined">too huge to be  moved by means other than levitation </span></strong>and which have</span>
  been standing for ages before any written record now available.</span></p>
<p class="Jemi" style="text-autospace:none;">THE MAN IS CLOSE, <em>TOO </em>CLOSE.</strong></p>
<p>As these pieces of the jigsaw puzzle make themselves known, and as we realize fully that this is</span> an old, old
  problem, we can begin to take comfort. If UFO's have been here for 300,000 years and have</span> not yet chosen to
  launch a mass attack on humanity, it is scarcely likely that they will do it now -- unless</span> they are forced to
  do something to prevent the world's experimenting militarists and scientists from</span> destroying the earth through
  ignition of its hydrogen, thus crating another nova or new star in the galaxy,</span> a may well have been done when
  the fifth planet disintegrated at an incalculable time in the past.</span></p>
<p>So there are two elements of importance in our study of the antiquity of intelligence: the proof</span> that superior
  beings have been here longer than mankind has been civilized, and the demonstration that</span> forces were at work in
  those millennia, the magnitude and nature of which are only suspected today.</span></p>
<p>Is this, then, a </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">hint that </span></strong>we are </span><span
    class="MrBUnderlined">at this moment awakening </span></strong>and, like a chrysalis, emerging into a</span> new and
  much more powerful state of existence and cognizance? Are, therefore, our current troubles,</span> domestically and
  internationally, but the excruciating birth pains of such a renaissance, as </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">we could no </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">have imagined </span></strong>one short generation ago? Will we, then perhaps be welcomed
  rather than repelled by</span> the intelligences which inhabit the UFO's or which may even be the UFO's?</span></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">Man's Emotional structure is such that he <em>cannot </em>awaken to Powers
  of 'True-'Thinking.'</strong></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">Alright so it was not thougth that man would</strong> <em>ever </em>mature,
  Don't worry, Jemi.</strong></p>
<p>Probably the oldest, and almost surely the most prolific of sources bearing on wingless flight, are</span> the
  records of the Indian and Tibetan monasteries. These in themselves </span><span class="JemiUnderlined">are almost conclusive</span></strong>
  .</span> Records of 15,000 years ago imply wingless flight at least 70,000 years prior to that. Add this to the</span>
  recorded visit of a space fleet to the court of Thutmose III, approximately 1500 B.C., and we are close to</span>
  paralleling the sightings of today. Evidence of continued interest by the space dwellers comes from</span> medieval
  France where Adamski was completely scooped by elements of the French populace who </span><span
      class="JemiUnderlined">were </span><span class="JemiUnderlined">given rides in the UFO's</span></strong>.</span>
</p>
<p class="note">ED: The following has no obvious reference or necessary position.</span></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">No Not pals but the French are such of an general</strong> Pholosophic
  attitude Even in that Day that they were chosen to be contacted. Now, some L-M's live</strong> in france out of
  preference <em>in </em>field of Philosophical Study. <em>They </em>like it.</strong></p>
<p>If early visits to Asia, subsequent contacts with the Egyptians at the peak of their culture, rumored</span>
  associations of flight with the disappearance of Atlantis, and tours of France some centuries ago, indicate</span> a
  pattern, then it may be of little wonder that the civilizations of today, perhaps the most spectacular of all,</span>
  are receiving attention.</span></p>
<p>In many ways, the most intriguing data of all comes from the skeptical astronomers. Their</span> observations do tend
  to be quantitative, timed, and documented. The astronomical data is more than</span> merely qualitative. In other
  words, the astronomers themselves, being conscientious data hounds, were</span> not content with merely seeing things
  move in space. Although unaware of the true nature of what they</span> saw, they recorded as much as time and
  equipment would permit, and, as a result, they have enabled us</span> to locate the habitat of the UFO's.</span></p>
<p>As with out own observations today, any single sighting by an astronomer could be a mistake or</span> an
  illusion. </span><span class="JemiUnderlined">But hundreds of  sightings are involved, and dozens of serious, reliable astronomers</span></strong>
  .</span></p>
<p class="Jemi" style="text-autospace:none;"><strong><em>BOY! IF ONLY HE KNEW THE THOUSANDS</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p>Many round things have been seen crossing the discs of the sun and moon, and some in space</span> with no background.
  Roundness implies spherical or discoid shapes. Lights have been seen in space,</span> some of them near Mercury,
  Venus, Mars, and the moon, and some between us and those orbs, so that</span> they might be on their surfaces. In the
  case of the moon, lights have been seen on the surface. There</span> have been shadows on the moon and on the earth
  which could have been cast only by manipulated</span> space contrivances. The advent of the great comets and the red
  spot on Jupiter in the late 1870's was coincident with the mysterious appearance of a new crater on the moon precisely
  the size of the UFO's seen by <a href="/people/astronomes.html">astronomers</a> between the earth and the moon.</span>
</p>
<p>The astronomers have seen two distinct classes of objects: the spherical, definitely outlined</span> ones, and the
  hazy, nebulous ones. Both have appeared to undergo intelligent manipulation and exhibit</span> erratic motions. In all
  of these are features that have counterparts among the sightings listed by lay</span> observers since 1947.
  Simultaneous observations by tow or more observers have at times established</span> the approximate distances of the
  UFO's through study of parallax. ("Parallax" is the displacement, often</span> measurable, caused by looking at an
  object from too different points; e.g. hold up a finger and view it with</span> first one eye and then the other. The
  displacement against a distinct background is parallax.) All-I-all, the</span> astronomical evidence for UFO's while
  less voluminous than other types, is better grounded in factual and</span> quantitative data. It must be given great
  weight.</span></p>
<p>If, in reality, the astronomical profession is to be forced into the position of being the principal</span> witness
  for the defense, in the case of the UFO's its members will suffer a most peculiar type of</span> embarrassment, for
  theirs is the unenviable position of having been most dogmatic and derogatory.</span></p>
<p>It seems unfortunate that astronomy, once the leader in the search for qualitative knowledge, </span><span
    class="JemiUnderlined">is</span></strong> <span class="JemiUnderlined">apparently degenerating into opposition to pioneering</span></strong>
  . Yet, astronomy, while strictly an</span> observational and not an experimental science, takes front rank in denying
  authentic observational data</span> which threatens in the slightest to upset its own scientific applecart.</span></p>
<p class="Jemi" style="text-autospace:none;">IT SEEMS QUIOTICALLY RELIABLE OF HUMANS TO WAIT TILL THEY THEMSELVES HAVE
  KNOWN FLIGHT &amp; THINK NOW</strong> OF SPACE-FLIGHT BEFORE ADMITTING THAT OTHERS TOO HAVE FLIGHT. NOT, OF COURSE,
  (HE!-HEH) THAT <em>THEY </em>ARE SURPASSED,NO NOT WHEN THEY NOW ARE CLUED TO AN EQUALING IDEA IN FORCE FIELDS. THEY
  NOW HOPE TO BECOME EQUALS. <em>ALAS</em>!</strong></p>
<p>In an observational science such as <a href="../../../../../../../../astronomie/index.html">astronomy</a>, </span>
  <span class="MrAUnderlined">laws have to be built from innumerably</span></strong> <span class="MrAUnderlined">repeated observations </span></strong>
  and not, as is partially true in physics and chemistry, on the basis of duplicative</span> laboratory experiment. In
  such cases, as the astronomer knows only too well, repeated observations</span> must be accepted as tantamount to
  proof.</span></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">H-K HAS Enough observations, as he says, They ignore them</strong></p>
<p>Many of astronomy's tenets are in such a category. To take only one example, the hypothetical</span> life history of
  stars is based entirely on the so-called spectral sequence built solely upon spectroscopic</span> observations of
  thousands of stars and the subsequent grouping and arranging of these into some logical</span> structure. Even in this
  ponderous sequence there are erratics, or stars with peculiar spectra, whose real</span> nature is a matter of
  speculation even after a hundred years of spectroscopy. Yet, the astronomer can</span> hardly deny the existence of
  the obviously shinning star, no matter how recalcitrant may be its light waves.</span></p>
