<p>La grande quantité d'information du passé, dans tous les domaines, <span
    class="MrBUnderlined">montre clairement</span> que de l'intelligence existe dans l'espace ! "Intelligence" est le
  <em>sine qua non</em> de notre analyse. Sans elle nos réflexions pourraient ne pas avoir de sens. Avec elle, nos

<p class="MrB">Is Nothing, les expériences de Harvard montrent que seulement quelques Humains Have Pie factors of any

<p>Dans ce livre, nous faisons certaines nuances. La différence entre pluie et de "l'eau qui tombe" en est une. Pour les
  concepts de <u>notre</u> environnement spatial nous devons faire une distinction semblable entre "pensée" et
  "intelligence.'' "Pensée," dans notre approche, est la fonction de réflexion du cerveau de l'humanité, ou peut-être
  d'animaux inférieurs. Par "intelligence," nous devons considérer une capacité plus large à penser, construire,
  diriger, analyser, planifier, naviguer, rire, etc., ce qui n'est pas nécessairement partie ou est associée avec un un
  cerveau incarné. En bref, nous devons adapter notre <em>ego</em> à la possibilité qu'une intelligence existe dans
  l'espace, qu'elle puisse être et soit probablement supérieure à la nôtre, et qu'il puisse y habiter des entités
  physiques de nature désincarnée telles que les corps nébuleux ou <a
      href="../../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/nuage/index.html">nuageux</a> observés par Barnard (décrits plus
  loin). </p>
<p>Partout, nous recherchons des <span class="MrBUnderlined">objets, des corps</span>, des événements ayant été <span
    class="MrBUnderlined">fabriqués</span>, modelés ou guidés par des <span class="MrBUnderlined">forces</span>
  contrôlées à l'évidence par une "intelligence" qui a le pouvoir de décision, contrairement à celles qui ont seulement
  été animées par des forces "physiques" et des lois "physiques", comme la gravitation et les lois Kepleriennes ou
  Newtoniennes. C'est seulement ainsi que nous pouvons établir l'"intelligence" en tant que composante universelle de
  notre espace environnant.</span></p>

<p><span class="MrAUnderlined">Personne ne connait la nature exacte</span> de cette intelligence spatiale, et encore
  moins la nature <span class="MrAUnderlined">des corps physiques</span> dans laquelle elle réside. Cette intelligence
  semble se manifester de nombreuses façons. Dans notre étude des tempêtes nous avons été inexorablement conduits à
  admettre que certaines tempêtes avaient un aspect artificiel, une sorte d'apparence organique, l'air d'être élaborées
  dans un but et de mener à bien ce but. Nous postulons par conséquent un pourcentage d'artificialité, ou
  d'intelligence, parmi le petit pourcentage de tempêtes qui apparaissent soudainement dans des cieux autrement calmes,
  agissent de manière orientée, comme pour dissimuler quelque chose, et déchargent des matériaux particuliers. Elles
  semblent être concentrées, peut-être trop dirigées, pour avoir une origine entièrement météorologique (sic).</span>
</p>
<p><span class="MrA">DEAD GIVE-AWAY! <em>HE KNOWS, </em>SAYS AS MUCH, TOO.?</span></strong></p>
<p>Comme indication, alors, pour nous assurer que nous <span class="MrBUnderlined">ne fermons pas les yeux en connaissance
  de cause</span> sur tout élément pouvant contribuer à une preuve dans la question des ovnis, je vous demande de garder
  à l'esprit ces informations sur les tempêtes et formations de nuages, et, si possible, de les faire correspondre avec
  le fondement de toute conclusions globables que vous pourriez échafauder par la suite. Je pense que des structures
  spatiales de 5 à 20 miles de diamètre sont suffisamment grandes pour produire de tels orages, et qu'il pourrait y
  avoir des élements expliquant les buts de cela, ne serait-ce que pour le camouflage et la dissimulation.</p>
<p class="MrA">LA GRANDE ARCHE DES L-M=<em>PLUS GROSSE </em>!</strong></p>
<p>Il pourrait être difficile de mesurer la significativité de l'antiquité dans la question du vol spatial ou de
  l'habitat spatial. <span class="JemiUnderlined">Mais ne pas arriver
  à considerer le contexte tentaculaire du problème ovni est le
  seul grand facteur de l'épouvantable chaos qui engloutit cette énigme</span>. Prenez ne serait-ce qu'<span
      class="JemiUnderlined">un</span> élément : le petit morceau d'acier météoritique qui fut découvert à l'intérieur
  d'une veine de charbon du tertiaire. Le lieux et la découverte sont authentiques. La forme est purement artificielle.
  Il est pratiquement, à un pouce carré près, un cube. 4 côtés se font face de manière carrée, et les 2 autres ont une
  forme convexe, en symétricité totale. Autour des 4 côtés de surface court une rainure, arrangée géométriquement. Voici
  3 faits établis : </p>
<ol>
  <li> Placement dans une veine de charbon naissante il y a 300 000 ans. </li>
  <li>Faite de fer météoritique, identifiable d'après sa structure et son contenu chimique. </li>
  <li>Clairement façonnée de manière artificielle.</li>
</ol>
<p>Le nombre d'explications concernant la manière dont il est arrivé dans cette veine de charbon pourrait être réduit ou
  multiple, mais il est un fait sous-jacent qui ne peut être sérieusement ignoré : Ce morceau d'acier naturel a été
  façonné par un appareillage intelligent il y a au moins 300 000 ans !</p>
<p class="Jemi">AVANT L'ACIER ETAIT CONNU DE H.S.</strong></p>
<p>Nous pouvons continuer, mais <span class="MrAUnderlined">quelqu'un doit faire un choix</span>, ou nier et ignorer le
  substrat factuel en totalité. La <a href="../../../../../../../../analyse/Science.html">science</a> l'a ignoré. Le
  choix <span class="MrBUnderlined">est plus désagréable à affronter</span> : Est-ce que cet accessoire, créé comme il
  l'a été par une intelligence, a été placé là par un homme indigène de la terre, ou a-t-il été lâché de l'espace par un
  voyageur de l'espace ?</p>
<p>Vous pouvez choisir de dire : placé par l'Homme ? Alors il y avait une race d'hommes là il y a 300 000 ans qui savait
  suffisamment comment façonner l'acier, et, par déduction, fabriquer des machines. S'ils pouvaient faire cela, <span
      class="JemiUnderlined">ils devaient très probablement avoir un moyen de locomotion</span>, et il n'y a pas de
  raison de nier qu'ils puissent avoir découvert le vol spatial par recherche ou accident. Au pire il y eut le temps de
  développer une civilisation au rafinement sans précédent. <span class="JemiUnderlined">La science n'aime
  pas ça</span>. En alternative à cette sirène du dilemne, nous devons contempler un vol spatial d'il y a 300 000 ans,

<p>Une controverse a fait rage pendant des générations entre pro-Atlantiens et anti-Atlantiens au sujet de l'antiquité
  de l'humanité civilisée sur cette planète. <span class="MrAUnderlined">Les restes archéologiques de ces civilisations-noyaux</span>

  Ils offrent une <span class="MrAUnderlined">matière facile d'étude</span>. L'archéologie et l'ethnologie, partageant
  avec l'<a href="../../../../../../../../astronomie/index.html">astronomie</a> la caractéristique d'être
  observationnelles et non expérimentales, ont construit tout leur cadre sur l'étude de ces restes. Cependant,
  sous-jacents et entremêlés avec ce vaste réseau de matière, <span class="MrAUnderlined">se trouvent les restes de cultures d'âge presque imprononçable</span>.
  Les objets façonnés ont été soumis à des cataclysmes géologiques et cosmiques d'une violence presque incompréhensible
  et peu de reliques majeures restent pour être lues. Ces quelques-là, cependant, sont mis de côté comme les erratics de
  l'archéologie et de l'ethnologie, et leur existence-même est enterrée ou niée dans des efforts pour éviter de
  renverser le chateau de cartes si laborieusement établi par ces branches de l'éducation. </p>

<p>Ces études décomposent presquement entièrement une antiquité d'approximativement 7000 ans, point auquel elles

<p>The few erratics in the following pages show that there have been very ancient cultures, or</span> civilizations,
  which may have and could have developed methods of flight much simpler and more</span> effective than ours, </span>
  <span class="JemiUnderlined">and more directly  associated with forces which we do not yet comprehend</span></strong>
  .</span> Again we are dealing with indirect evidence, not always of the greatest clarity. Yet in support of an</span>
  antiquity of such an order I have seen and touched stonework carved out of the solid mountains of rock in South
  America</span><span class="JemiUnderlined">, which certainly  antedate the Andean glaciers, </span></strong>and almost
  as </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">certainly predate the </span></strong><span class="MrAUnderlined">formation of the mountains themselves</span></strong>

      class="JemiUnderlined">by "forces" </span></strong>different from those in use by us today. The quandary is
  largely</span> <span class="JemiUnderlined">resolvable by admitting to a levitating force </span></strong>developed
  and used by the same common denominator--space flight--which simplifies so many other puzzles for us.</span></p>
<p class="note">ED: The following has no obvious reference or necessary position.</span></p>
<p class="Jemi">SUCH PRE-GLACIAL AGE WORKS OF CIVILIZATION </strong>ARE GENERALLY KNOWN BUT MUST BE DENIED A</strong>
  PLACE IN HISTORY FOR THEY ALL ARE--MYSTERIES.</strong></p>
<p class="MrA">PRIDE IGNORANCE</strong></p>
<p>On the basis of the evidence of an antiquity involving epochs of 50,000 to 200,000 or 300,000</span> years or more,
  we postulate the ancient development of some kind of science which either produced</span> space flight or was brought
  to this third planet via space flight. I do not believe it is of great significance to</span> our thesis at the moment
  whether one, or the other, of these assumptions is most likely to be true. Either</span> is abhorrent to science and
  to some religions, yet either presents a background of conditionality favorable</span> to an extremely ancient
  development of wingless flight. Nothing else answers all of the conundrums</span> presented by observed and recorded
  facts.</span></p>
<p>As you will see, history is replete with stories of another great category of phenomena: the</span> mysterious and
  ghostly disappearances of people, singly and in groups, publicly or in unobserved</span> obscurity. These
  skin-ting-ling episodes seemed at first to have little in common with the falls of objects</span> and the antics of
  storms. Many are incidents which, if their reality has been admitted at all, are in the</span> view of scientists,
  spiritualists, and students of the occult, considered to belong to or border on the socalled</span> supernatural.
  Within these segregations we must place the disappearance of the crews of ships, such as the Sea Bird and the Marie
  Celeste; the disappearance of individuals while in the company of</span> their peers. There is not much hypothecating
  to be done with these. The stories can be told, and the</span> cases lumped together as one big unexplained group of
  events. No explanation other than that of</span> abduction by intelligently navigated aerial or celestial craft can be
  advanced: It is almost a case of proof</span> by default.</span></p>
<p>With planes, there is perhaps some added element other than metal fatigue which involves</span> striking some
  apparently solid object while in the air, or being rent by unimaginable forces just before</span> falling. (Because of
  this additional evidence I have put the accidents to planes into a separate section of</span> Part Three,
  below.)</span></p>
<p>Planes seem to hit something which crushes them or tears them apart, which </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">is </span></strong>nevertheless</span> <span class="MrAUnderlined">invisible</span></strong>,
  and which strikes with such suddenness that the pilots do not have time to make an outcry via</span> their ever-live
  radios.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Arial Black'; font-size:11.5pt; color:black; ">Passage of Auroral beam,  November 17, 1882, as seen from</span>

</p>
<p>Then, too, there are cases of dead or frightened birds, and the cases of people being struck by unseen forces, as
  with seventeen marching soldiers in eighteenth-century France who were</span> simultaneously struck down by an
  invisible agency.</span></p>
<p class="MrA">One had a compass on him, fouled a "SWEEP" made L-Ms ANGRY</strong></p>
<p>After analyzing these things, one speculates as to </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">new types </span></strong>of
  obstacles </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">as well as new </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">forces</span></strong>.
  Take the mysterious </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">Maunder object</span></strong>, which moved deliberately across
  the sky above southern</span> England in November 1882. Rand Capron, an authority on auras, said it was auroral, while
  other equally</span> competent scientists said it was a physical or material object. Then there are the many modern
  sightings</span> of things which seem to manifest intelligent action, and to possess all normal physical
  characteristics</span> except mass or weight. We recollect that radar sees things which are not visible to the
  eye.</span></p>
<p class="MrA">ARK IN STASIS, THEN CAME OUT OF STASIS.</strong></p>
<p><span class="MrAUnderlined">From such analysis we come </span></strong>by </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">easy stages to conceive of a force, ray, or focal point</span></strong>
  , </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">in </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">some force-field </span></strong>either;
  unknown to us, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">or at least not understood</span></strong>, which produces rigidity
  in a</span> localized or sharply delimited volume of air, or possibly in space itself. We are thinking of something
  like</span> crystals of ice freezing within a body of water. The element remains the same but its physical
  attributes</span> change suddenly and drastically.</span></p>
<p class="MrA">DEH O', They Can't Prove it <em>yet!</em></strong></p>
<p>Another example might be the passage of a limited but </span><span
    class="MrBUnderlined">powerful magnetic field </span></strong>through a</span> scattering of iron filings or iron
  powder. Before the approach of the magnetic flux, the powder lies loose,</span> flexible, and penetrable. Yet, when
  the flux enters it, invisibly and imperceptibly to the senses of man,</span> this docile powder become rigid,
  tenacious, coherent, and at least semisolid. Do the space dwellers have</span> a force </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">which </span></strong>produces </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">this temporary rigidity In the air, or </span></strong>
  <span class="MrAUnderlined">even possibly in the gravitation field</span></strong> itself? Or do they create "local"
  concentrations of the gravitational field </span><span
      class="JemiUnderlined">as we are able to do  with the</span><span
      class="JemiUnderlined">magnetic field?</span></strong></p>
<p class="Jemi">REVERSE MAG. FORCE?</strong></p>
<p>Suppose that some intelligent entity was directing a concentration of potential which could make</span> small volumes
  of rarefied air rigid, could set up a sort of island in the gravitational or magnetic field,</span> moving the island
  about as the spot of a searchlight is moved on thin clouds. Such a thing would be</span> invisible, would have many of
  the physical attributes of a solid body, but very small mass. For example,</span> its movement through the air would
  be wavelike, and would not envolve translation of the medium any</span> more than the spot of the searchlight would
  require movement of the cloud which enabled the beam to attain visibility. In moving, this island would simply
  "freeze" on the advancing edge and "thaw" on the</span> trailing edge. In this way it could have almost infinite
  velocity, and also acceleration, just as the spot of</span> the searchlight. In this manner it would appear to be free
  of mass, and actually it would be free of mass,</span> because only the force beam would move, not the air. Yet in
  resisting the impingement of a bird, a plane,</span> or perhaps a meteor, it would have mass, and a very destructive
  mass at that. A pilot flying a plane into</span> such a body would have no warning. Yet if such a thing were a few
  hundred yards in diameter, its mass</span> in resisting the plane would be thousands of pounds, perhaps tons. The
  analogy to a ship hitting an iceberg would be very close.</span></p>
<p>If such a force island were formed in the upper atmosphere, it might be very possible for it to have</span> many of
  the physical characteristics of a solid body, and yet in matters of illumination it could behave</span> exactly as any
  other auroral phenomena. In this connection we must remember that </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">auroral phenomena</span></strong><span class="MrBUnderlined"> are magnetic </span></strong>
  and may be caused by streams of electrons from the sun which are, in effect, </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">precisely</span></strong>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined"> the type </span></strong>of force beam upon which we are speculating.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">Yes, He is Close, but doesn't think of Mag. Inductors</strong> <strong><em><span
    style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:blue; ">or </span></em></strong>of Gravity as "air" Or thought of

  Power, While being converted &amp; used as a Force-Propulsive HE MAY KNOW OF FORCESHIELDS</strong> of Primitive
  Ancient type.</strong></p>
<p>It seems obvious that a single beam could not have the effect which we have suggested, else the</span> freeze would
  take effect along the entire length of the beam. However, it is possible that the threedimensional</span> volume
  enclosed within the intersection of two beams might create such a congealed island.</span></p>
<p>Speculating further on this weird possibility, remember that </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">oxygen is a magnetic substance</span></strong>
  . It</span> is not, perhaps, paramagnetic like iron, manganese and nickel, but nevertheless sufficiently magnetic
  that</span> it can be separated from the other constituents of air by means of a magnetic field.</span></p>

<p>If such a </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">congealmen</span></strong>t were possible, consider the result of

<p>Before we leave this tantalizing topic, give thought to the nature of an aurora borealis. As early</span> as the time
  of Maunder's object, it was recognized that auroras are magnetic phenomena, or at least</span> associated with the
  earth's magnetic field. It has been further ascertained that they are related to</span> sunspots, and that they are
  probably due to the interaction of electronic streams from the sun or from</span> sunspots. </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">Is not an aurora, then, something  very much akin to the congealed islands </span></strong>
  which we have just postulated? Is it not a delimited volume of rarefied air caught within the tripping reaction of an
  electron stream passing through a magnetic field? Was Maunder's object, then, in a sense both material and
  nonmaterial; both massive and nonmassive? Is it the incounter with the "pockets" which makes meteors explode? Do they
  make blips on a radar screen?</span></p>

<p>It is but a step from such contemplations to a similar analysis of the "Foo" fighters, fireballs, the</span>
  comet-like objects usually seen in groups of six or eight, and the darting evanescent things seen now and</span> then
  over Washington D.C. Such phenomena must be considered as most likely due to intelligent</span> manipulation, or
  remote control, from distant structures, and </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">technically trained observers have often</span></strong>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined"> said as much</span></strong>. We do not entirely rule out a self-contained intelligence,
  but many of these manifestations</span> have more the quality of something which, for want of an established
  terminology, we might call the</span> searchlight type of UFO. Many reports have described objects or UFO's as
  appearing to have been</span> operated by remote control. I believe that they are exactly that.</span></p>
<p>It is by no means clearly established that all apparently self-luminous phenomena are of this</span> nature. There
  are still a number of luminous spheres and discs which seem to have a more material</span> nature and to contain the
  intelligences which operate them. The widgets seen by astronomers in space</span> are examples, and I think, too, of
  such things as the ruddy disc which buzzed Captain Manning's DC-3</span> near south Bend, Indiana.</span></p>
<p>The "Devil's Hoofprints" and related phenomena, discussed below in Part Three, offer another</span> key or clue, and
  in segregating them from the mass of unclassified data we can, again, remove a</span> considerable segment of the load
  which burdens the psychic and paranormal field. The misinterpretation</span> adherent to the Hoof marks are more
  fantastic than the phenomenon itself. It is unbelievable, to me at</span> least, that people intelligent enough to
  make a living among their fellows would try to interpret a linear</span> sequence of exactly duplicated marks,
  crossing roof tops, walls and haystack unfalteringly and</span>indiscriminately as animal tracks. These marks
  were </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">equally spaced</span></strong>, occurring singly, not in twos or fours. Even
  in the old mythology there is no tale of a one-legged animal.</span></p>

<p>Dans les séries modernes (après <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a>) d'observations d'ovnis, il
  existe une séquence de <span class="MrBUnderlined">références
  fréquentes</span> à des "Vaisseaux Mères" <span class="MrAUnderlined">et d'énormes
  superconstructions</span>. L'<span class="MrAUnderlined">énorme chose</span> prise en chasse par <a
      href="../../../../../../../../MantellThomas.html">Mantell</a> <span class="MrAUnderlined">et la chose longue de 10 miles</span>

  villes. </p>
<p>Je suis convaincu que ces constructions sont peu nombreuses (il est possible, en fait, qu'il n'y en ait que deux) et
  qu'elles ne proviennent pas de planètes éloignées telles que <a
      href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus">Venus</a>, <a
      href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/mars/index.html">Mars</a>, <a
      href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/jupiter">Jupiter</a> ou des étoiles bien plus éloignées. It is my belief
  that these constructions are few in number, not many (there is some possibility, in fact, that there may be only two
  of them) and that they do not come from distant planets such as Venus,</span> Mars, Jupiter or the vastly more distant
  stars. It is my belief that they are usually globular, sometime</span> spindlelike, and that they are an indigenous
  part of earth-moon binary-planet system. </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">I make this </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">statement on the basis of hundreds of astronomical observations </span></strong>in which the
  rough determinations</span> of parallax can be made. Parallax shows these objects to be somewhere between a few
  hundred miles</span> away and a maximum of something less than the distance of the moon. While I believe that these
  space</span> islands probably use both earth and moon for their own convenience, I suggest that their most
  natural</span> and permanent habitat is at the </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">gravitational  neutral </span></strong>of the earth-sun-moon, three-body system
  which </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">is </span><span

<p>Dean Swift was prescient in regard to his astronomy, predicting that Mars had two small</span> satellites, one of
  which was close to Mars' surface and made two revolutions daily. It has been pointed</span> out that this inner body
  is too close to Mars to be in adjustment with any known postulate of the natural</span> distribution of satellites
  relative to their parent body. This may be an indication that </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">Mars' inner satellite </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">is artificial</span></strong>
  .</span></p>
<p class="MrA">Also an old "Dead-Ark" S-M MAKE</strong></p>
<p>It has been postulated that </span><span class="JemiUnderlined">gravitation  need not be considered as acting with uniform </span><span
    class="JemiUnderlined">continuity</span></strong>, from the center of the attracting body outward, even if subject
  to the inverse square law.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:red; ">Such a concept, today</span></strong>, </span>
  <span class="JemiUnderlined">would be especially horrendous to physics and astronomy. </span></strong>Yet, there is a
  suspicious rhythm to the distribution</span></p>
<p class="MrA">TODAY IS When it could be if the Most Technical use Tomorrow is too-Late for these

<p>of planets, outward from the sun. This has been somewhat crudely expressed in Bode's "law," and in</span> spite of
  scientific protestations there is a similarity between atomic structure as we comprehend it and the</span> obvious
  structure of the solar system.</span></p>
<p class="Jemi">&amp; HOW ABOUT MOLECULAR STRUCTURES &amp; ITS "FIELDS"???</strong></p>
<p>Refinements of Bode's law indicate </span><span
    class="MrBUnderlined">nodes  in the gravitational field</span></strong>, at which planets, asteroids,</span> and
  possibly comets and meteors tend to locate themselves. An extension of the theory to the satellite</span> systems of
  the major planets </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">indicates  a similar system of nodes </span></strong>on smaller
  scales, where planets,</span> rather than the sun, are gravitational centres. This indicates a sort of generality, and
  since these smaller</span> planets, such as Venus, Earth, Mars, do not have satellite systems (the moon is more of a
  companion</span> than satellite and may have joined the earth through acquisition rather than formation), it might
  well be</span> that these gravitational </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">nodes </span></strong>are occupied to some
  degree by navigable construction.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">"Nodes," are the old Traps &amp; burial "Grounds"</strong> Here Lay quite a few Dead-Ships they
  cannot</strong> get away. The old types couldn't but these</strong> new types can. It was nodes in great
  number</strong> on Surface of this Earth that gave the clue to</strong> L-M's of How to Neatralize forces but a
  floor</strong> pattern in METAL ACTUALLY SHOWED THE MEANS.</strong></p>
<p>Over a period of almost two hundred years there have been many modifications of Bode's law, in</span> an effort to
  completely generalize it, and to make it theoretical as well as empirical. Many researchers</span> have extended the
  law so as to establish nodes </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">right down to the surface </span></strong>of the
  central bodies, and in</span> so doing the nodes become closer and closer together so that there may be many of them
  at short</span> distances from the parent body. Thus, if the law or its derivatives have significance, there could be
  a</span> number of these orbital nodes between the moon and the surface of the earth.</span></p>
<p>We can therefore, take it as highly probable that there are many zones of convenience around</span> the planets, as
  well as around the sun, which are presently unoccupied by planets or satellites of any</span> considerable size and
  which may well be used by enlightened space dwellers. Such zones, if they exist,</span> are </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">in addition </span></strong>to the demonstrable earth-sun-moon neutral. Since this system of
  nodes appears to be</span> some function of the radius of the attracting body, it may be that there is a complete
  series of them in</span> concentric circles starting at the surface of a parent body such as the earth, but their
  existence or true nature can hardly be known to us until we can in some way determine the nature of gravity
  itself.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">No, they are Part of Same Physics Principal.</strong> They DO Extend outward concentrically, Usually stay
  in position, Not, always.</strong></p>
<p>There may even be hints available to us regarding gravity. For instance, no final settlement has</span> ever been
  made of the argument over the opposed wave and corpuscular theories of the propagation of</span> light. An assumption
  that the ether, a necessary adjunct to the wave theory, is identical with the</span> gravitational field, whatever
  that may be, would reconcile the opposing theories and a quantum of light</span> would then be merely a pulsation or
  fluctuation in the gravitational field. </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">Intense studies </span></strong>of
  the</span> movements </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">of space-navigable UFO's </span></strong>might furnish vital
  clues to such problems.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">It would only tell all, What this one has guessed.</strong></p>
<p>Let us go back for a moment to the matter of </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">masslessness  of some of the UFO's</span></strong>. Their ability</span> to achieve enormous
  acceleration has been one of the greatest puzzles to scientists. Time after time </span><span class="JemiUnderlined">we </span><span
      class="JemiUnderlined">are told that the UFO's could not possibly contain living bodies of  flesh and bone </span></strong>
  -- that such</span> bodies could not withstand the stresses imposed by the observed accelerations. Yet such argument
  can</span> well be based on </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">entirely erroneous ideas  as to the nature of the propulsive forces used </span></strong>
  by the</span> UFO's. Acceleration is damaging </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">only </span></strong>because </span>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">the  forces necessary to produce it are applied</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="MrBUnderlined">externally to the living body</span></strong>, or to the structural members of any flying

  <span class="JemiUnderlined">every </span></strong>molecule of either the living body or the mechanical

  of</span> acceleration without the slightest damage or discomfort!</span></p>
