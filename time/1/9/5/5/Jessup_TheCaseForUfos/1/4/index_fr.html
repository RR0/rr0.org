<p>It is but a step from such contemplations to a similar analysis of the <a
    href="../../../../../4/2/FooFighters/index.html">"Foo" fighters</a>, fireballs, the</span> comet-like objects
  usually seen in groups of 6 ou 8, and the darting evanescent things seen now and</span> then over Washington D.C. Such
  phenomena must be considered as most likely due to intelligent</span> manipulation, or remote control, from distant
  structures, and </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">technically trained observers have often</span></strong><span
      class="MrBUnderlined"> said as much</span></strong>. We do not entirely rule out a self-contained intelligence,
  but many of these manifestations</span> have more the quality of something which, for want of an established
  terminology, we might call the</span> searchlight type of UFO. Many reports have described objects or UFO's as
  appearing to have been</span> operated by remote control. I believe that they are exactly that.</span></p>
<p>It is by no means clearly established that all apparently self-luminous phenomena are of this</span> nature. There
  are still a number of luminous spheres and discs which seem to have a more material</span> nature and to contain the
  intelligences which operate them. The widgets seen by astronomers in space</span> are examples, and I think, too, of
  such things as the ruddy disc which buzzed Captain Manning's <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/aeronef/DC3.html">DC-3</a></span> near south Bend, Indiana.</span>
</p>
<p>The "Devil's Hoofprints" and related phenomena, discussed below in Part Three, offer another</span> key or clue, and
  in segregating them from the mass of unclassified data we can, again, remove a</span> considerable segment of the load
  which burdens the psychic and paranormal field. The misinterpretation</span> adherent to the Hoof marks are more
  fantastic than the phenomenon itself. It is unbelievable, to me at</span> least, that people intelligent enough to
  make a living among their fellows would try to interpret a linear</span> sequence of exactly duplicated marks,
  crossing roof tops, walls and haystack unfalteringly and</span>indiscriminately as animal tracks. These marks
  were </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">equally spaced</span></strong>, occurring singly, not in twos or fours. Even
  in the old mythology there is no tale of a one-legged animal.</span></p>

</p>
<p>Here is something clearly mechanical. With equal clarity it is something maneuvering in the sky.</span> Since the
  mysterious phenomenon occurred half a century before our race developed mechanical flight,</span> this, to me, is an
  isolated and clear-cut indication of space flight.</span></p>
<p>Throughout the series of modern (after Arnold) sightings of UFO's there is a thread of </span><span
    class="MrBUnderlined">frequent </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">references </span></strong>to "Mother
  Ships" </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">and huge superconstructions</span></strong>. The </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">vast thing </span></strong>chased by Mantell </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">and </span></strong><span class="MrAUnderlined">the ten-mile-long thing</span></strong>/over
  Kansas are examples. There can </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">no longer </span></strong>be serious </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">doubts of their </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">existence</span></strong>. It seems
  probable that these constructions </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">are the domiciles </span></strong>of the
  small-fry discs, spheres,</span> <span class="MrAUnderlined">balls of light</span></strong>, etc., which are so
  frequently seen in proximity to the earth's surface and to our planes,</span> rockets, air fields and cities.</span>
</p>
<p>It is my belief that these constructions are few in number, not many (there is some possibility, in fact, that there
  may be only two of them) and that they do not come from distant planets such as Venus,</span> Mars, Jupiter or the
  vastly more distant stars. It is my belief that they are usually globular, sometime</span> spindlelike, and that they
  are an indigenous part of earth-moon binary-planet system. </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">I make this </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">statement on the basis of hundreds of astronomical observations </span></strong>in which the
  rough determinations</span> of parallax can be made. Parallax shows these objects to be somewhere between a few
  hundred miles</span> away and a maximum of something less than the distance of the moon. While I believe that these
  space</span> islands probably use both earth and moon for their own convenience, I suggest that their most
  natural</span> and permanent habitat is at the </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">gravitational  neutral </span></strong>of the earth-sun-moon, three-body system
  which </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">is </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">well within the orbit of the moon</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="Jemi">Why Not, The Neutral has Less wearing effects on Tissue, Nerves &amp; Lets one Live Much, Much Longer.

<p>Dean Swift was prescient in regard to his astronomy, predicting that Mars had two small</span> satellites, one of
  which was close to Mars' surface and made two revolutions daily. It has been pointed</span> out that this inner body
  is too close to Mars to be in adjustment with any known postulate of the natural</span> distribution of satellites
  relative to their parent body. This may be an indication that </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">Mars' inner satellite </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">is artificial</span></strong>
  .</span></p>
<p class="MrA">Also an old "Dead-Ark" S-M MAKE</strong></p>
<p>It has been postulated that </span><span class="JemiUnderlined">gravitation  need not be considered as acting with uniform </span><span
    class="JemiUnderlined">continuity</span></strong>, from the center of the attracting body outward, even if subject
  to the inverse square law.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:red; ">Such a concept, today</span></strong>, </span>
  <span class="JemiUnderlined">would be especially horrendous to physics and astronomy. </span></strong>Yet, there is a
  suspicious rhythm to the distribution</span></p>
<p class="MrA">TODAY IS When it could be if the Most Technical use Tomorrow is too-Late for these
  War-Lovers.</strong></p>
<p>of planets, outward from the sun. This has been somewhat crudely expressed in Bode's "law," and in</span> spite of
  scientific protestations there is a similarity between atomic structure as we comprehend it and the</span> obvious
  structure of the solar system.</span></p>
<p class="Jemi">&amp; HOW ABOUT MOLECULAR STRUCTURES &amp; ITS "FIELDS"???</strong></p>
<p>Refinements of Bode's law indicate </span><span
    class="MrBUnderlined">nodes  in the gravitational field</span></strong>, at which planets, asteroids,</span> and
  possibly comets and meteors tend to locate themselves. An extension of the theory to the satellite</span> systems of
  the major planets </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">indicates  a similar system of nodes </span></strong>on smaller
  scales, where planets,</span> rather than the sun, are gravitational centres. This indicates a sort of generality, and
  since these smaller</span> planets, such as Venus, Earth, Mars, do not have satellite systems (the moon is more of a
  companion</span> than satellite and may have joined the earth through acquisition rather than formation), it might
  well be</span> that these gravitational </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">nodes </span></strong>are occupied to some
  degree by navigable construction.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">"Nodes," are the old Traps &amp; burial "Grounds"</strong> Here Lay quite a few Dead-Ships they
  cannot</strong> get away. The old types couldn't but these</strong> new types can. It was nodes in great
  number</strong> on Surface of this Earth that gave the clue to</strong> L-M's of How to Neatralize forces but a
  floor</strong> pattern in METAL ACTUALLY SHOWED THE MEANS.</strong></p>
<p>Over a period of almost two hundred years there have been many modifications of Bode's law, in</span> an effort to
  completely generalize it, and to make it theoretical as well as empirical. Many researchers</span> have extended the
  law so as to establish nodes </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">right down to the surface </span></strong>of the
  central bodies, and in</span> so doing the nodes become closer and closer together so that there may be many of them
  at short</span> distances from the parent body. Thus, if the law or its derivatives have significance, there could be
  a</span> number of these orbital nodes between the moon and the surface of the earth.</span></p>
<p>We can therefore, take it as highly probable that there are many zones of convenience around</span> the planets, as
  well as around the sun, which are presently unoccupied by planets or satellites of any</span> considerable size and
  which may well be used by enlightened space dwellers. Such zones, if they exist,</span> are </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">in addition </span></strong>to the demonstrable earth-sun-moon neutral. Since this system of
  nodes appears to be</span> some function of the radius of the attracting body, it may be that there is a complete
  series of them in</span> concentric circles starting at the surface of a parent body such as the earth, but their
  existence or true nature can hardly be known to us until we can in some way determine the nature of gravity
  itself.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">No, they are Part of Same Physics Principal.</strong> They DO Extend outward concentrically, Usually stay
  in position, Not, always.</strong></p>
<p>There may even be hints available to us regarding gravity. For instance, no final settlement has</span> ever been
  made of the argument over the opposed wave and corpuscular theories of the propagation of</span> light. An assumption
  that the ether, a necessary adjunct to the wave theory, is identical with the</span> gravitational field, whatever
  that may be, would reconcile the opposing theories and a quantum of light</span> would then be merely a pulsation or
  fluctuation in the gravitational field. </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">Intense studies </span></strong>of
  the</span> movements </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">of space-navigable UFO's </span></strong>might furnish vital
  clues to such problems.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">It would only tell all, What this one has guessed.</strong></p>
<p>Let us go back for a moment to the matter of </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">masslessness  of some of the UFO's</span></strong>. Their ability</span> to achieve enormous
  acceleration has been one of the greatest puzzles to scientists. Time after time </span><span class="JemiUnderlined">we </span><span
      class="JemiUnderlined">are told that the UFO's could not possibly contain living bodies of  flesh and bone </span></strong>
  -- that such</span> bodies could not withstand the stresses imposed by the observed accelerations. Yet such argument
  can</span> well be based on </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">entirely erroneous ideas  as to the nature of the propulsive forces used </span></strong>
  by the</span> UFO's. Acceleration is damaging </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">only </span></strong>because </span>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">the  forces necessary to produce it are applied</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="MrBUnderlined">externally to the living body</span></strong>, or to the structural members of any flying
  machine. </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">Any  force </span></strong>which would simultaneously accelerate </span>
  <span class="JemiUnderlined">every </span></strong>molecule of either the living body or the mechanical
  structure</span> would avoid all such stresses, and both the living and the mechanical could undergo any amount
  of</span> acceleration without the slightest damage or discomfort!</span></p>

<p>Since the UFO's, even the material, structure like ones, are observed to sustain acceleration</span> without mishap,
  we cannot but conclude that whatever the force used for such violent propulsion may be,</span> it </span><span

  acceleration, but</span> because of the impossibility of transporting the necessary fuel and carrying the heavy
  reactance motors.</span> Few laymen realize that, for rocket flight, the fuel is of dual purpose. Its ability to
  produce energy is no</span> whit more valuable than its ability to produce inertial reactance when expelled through a
  jet, and</span> therefore, any rocket propulsion craft must carry mass in some form for the purpose of being expelled
  so</span> as to create reactance. Using fuel for both energy and reactance is only a partial solution of the
  problem,</span> and </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">obviously limits </span></strong>both the range and speed of a

  <span class="JemiUnderlined">Such a force or power will have to originate in </span><span class="JemiUnderlined">reactance directly with the gravitational field, since magnetic fields  will not account for the </span><span

  things which have been</span> seen to leave the ground without apparent cause. </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">The lifting of the ancient megalithic structures, too,</span></strong>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined"> must surely have come through levitation</span></strong>.</span></p>

<p>The same inhibited thinking which has consistently aroused our protests is responsible for the</span> maladjusted
  direction of our attack on the problems of space flight through rocket power. There must be,</span> and almost
  certainly is, a better, shorter way of accomplishing it. The difference between the pre-Incan</span> methods of
  handling huge stone masses and those of our present-day engineers offers a kind of parallel.</span> We should be
  looking for the simpler, more direct course-- not wasting our resources on unworkable</span> methods.</span></p>
<p>In the magazine, <em>Look</em>, August 24, 1954, there was an article entitled "How Close Are We To</span> Space
  Flight?" by J.Gordon Vaeth. He thinks we are not very close. If we accept his reasons we have to</span> agree with
  him. He says the problem is too massive, too expensive, too intricate. We might add,</span> ponderous. And--he is
  quite correct if we continue along present channels of research and development.</span> Our procedure is expensive,
  cumbersome, tedious, and extremely wasteful of money, time, manpower,</span> and intellect.</span></p>
