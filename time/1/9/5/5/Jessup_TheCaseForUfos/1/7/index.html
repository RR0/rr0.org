<p>If I should be asked to state my thesis in one word, I believe that this word would be isolationism,</span> or if I
  could squeeze in a hyphen, anti-isolationism.</span></p>
<p>Whatever else we may do or think, we have to extend our ideas of one world to include at least</span> one solar
  system, and maybe more. But, whether or not, it is beyond the comprehension of our weary</span> minds to go further at
  the moment, and we will just have to be content to consider our solar system as</span> one living entity. </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">This war-weary,  heartsick and bedraggled planet </span></strong>is not alone--it is just
  one cell in a multicellular unit.</span></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">GALACTICLY SPEAKING</strong></p>
<p>Let us revive from the </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">sedative idea </span></strong>fostered by both science and
  religion that man, homo sapiens, of here and now, of the United States and today, is the final, glorious, end-point in
  the work of an</span> omnipotent and benevolent creator, all alone in an infinite universe. It cannot be true and in
  our honest</span> hearts all of us know that it is not so.</span></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">IT IS NICE TO HAVE COMPANY. EH? DRAGA?</strong></p>
<p>Were I to be granted one more word, that word would be Truth. </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">I am interested in true </span><span
    class="MrBUnderlined">knowledge, for its own sake. </span></strong>It is my philosophy that science and religion
  should have at least one thing in common: the untiring, unceasing, </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">unwavering  quest </span></strong>
  <span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">of </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">unbiased,  undistorted true knowledge</span></strong>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">of the world around us? </span></strong>and, again, I use the word world in its old,
  original and all-comprehensive sense.</span></p>
<p>To cry out that we have discovered the truth about UFO's </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">would be to invite ridicule</span></strong>
  , even for our effort. </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">Therefore, let us  summarize our conclusions </span></strong>and preface them with the same
  statement of open-mindedness which we demand of others whom </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">we invite </span></strong>to immerse themselves in our studies of historical,
  meteorological, and astronomical erratics. </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">We believe that our analyses </span></strong>have taken every possibility into account
  and </span><strong><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:red; ">have </span></strong><span

<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">What this guy Believes he has knowledge to Prove his beliefs in the
  Main.</p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">Psychological appeal to be Man enough to keep an open Mind, Lively with
  wanting to know, and to try Not to form any opinion until book</strong> is concluded.</strong></p>
<p>Our general conclusions then, are:</span></p>
<ol>
  <li> A</span> vast number of hitherto unexplained phenomena are readily accounted for by admitting that they result
    from intelligent action on the part of being living in space in navigable contrivances.</span></li>
  <li> Abundant observations by accredited astronomers, despite the general attitude of the</span> profession, indicate
    both the existence and location of the parent structures from which UFO's come.</span></li>
  <li> UFO's inhabit the space between the earth and the moon, probably at the approximate region of the earth-sun-moon
    gravitational neutral, about 165,000 to 170,000 miles from the earth.</span></li>
  <li> While some of the larger widgets (like the one chased by Mantell and the ten-miler seen over</span> Kansas) may
    occasionally come close to our terrain, we see, mostly, the small, agile observers of both</span> solid and nebulous
    types <u><strong>which they send </strong></u>on exploratory <u><strong>missions</strong></u>.</span></li>
  <li> They have developed a source of power much superior to anything of which we aware.</span></li>
  <li> UFO's have pointed the way too a shortened research program which might give us space</span> travel in a decade,
    at a small fraction of the cost of trying to develop rocket flight, if we will only</span> concentrate our research
    into the proper channels.</li>
  <li> Russia may well have captured a UFO and be developing the resources gained therefrom,</span> employing atomic
    experimentation as a diversionary measure.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">NOT SO or else she'd have cornered the Worlds</strong> Diamond Market by Now
  as a dead-Give-away that</strong> she'd Caught one. (Takes a Powerful Magnetic</strong> "Net" to do so)</strong></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">one with a reverse "snap Neutralizer" in it.</strong></p>
<ol start="8">
  <li>The very number and variety of the UFO's </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">which  are constantly seen </span></strong>is almost a priori <span class="MrAUnderlined">proof </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">of </span></strong>an <span class="MrAUnderlined">origin  close </span></strong>to the <span
      class="MrAUnderlined">earth</span></strong>. Even the distance to nearby planets such as Venus and Mars seems too
    great to permit of such promiscuity.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>We can conclude that the UFO's are permanent because they have been here for many centuries. That we have so suddenly
  become aware to them may be due in part to an increased activity,</span> but it is more likely the result of our own
  slow awakening from intellectual immaturity. </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">Exhaustive </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">research has disclosed records of sightings covering thousands of years,  and occasionally actual </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">visits and contacts </span></strong>with our race. More of these incidents are coming to
  light constantly as research is pursued with UFO's in mind. Now that </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">we  are aware of UFO's </span></strong>
  and know what to look for the uncorrelated data of our predecessors takes on a meaning hitherto lacking and becomes
  significant. It is</span> now up to us to discover and analyze all the data, and to correlate it with current
  observations.</span></p>
<p>We can allay our fears of present-day "Flying Saucers." </span><span
    class="MrBUnderlined">They have been here since </span></strong><strong><span
    style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:red; ">before </span></strong><span
    class="MrBUnderlined">the </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">dawn of our civilization, </span></strong>so what is
  there to get excited about? If we haven't been molested seriously in two thousand centuries, why get excited
  now? </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">If  anything is at stake, it is our ego, </span></strong>not our physical
  welfare. (</span><strong><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:red; ">Red is </span></strong><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">A</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">&amp;</span></strong><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">B)</span></strong></p>
<p>Yet, it is hard to discourage the innate feeling that there has recently been a great surge of</span> activity on the
  part of UFO's as if in preparation for something big. One does not have to look far for a</span> motive. These
  entities have probably been living in the solar system long enough to have seen the fifth</span> planet explode,
  destroying itself and perhaps jeopardizing life throughout the system. They may have</span> originated on that
  planet</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:#008100; ">. </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">Should one be astonished if these space dwellers are preparing to </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">prevent a few fearstricken human beings from blowing up another planet,  perhaps the only </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">remaining one which offers supplies and a haven to space navigators? If  we are incapable of the </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">self-control necessary for our preservation, are we to assume that  superior neighbors will permit </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">their safety to be imperiled by our immature behavior?</span></strong></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">Matches our own thoughts.</strong></p>
<p>It is no longer necessary to explain them as visitors from Mars, Venus, or Alpha Centauri. They</span> <span
    class="MrBUnderlined">are a part of our own </span></strong>immediate <span
    class="MrBUnderlined">family</span></strong>-- a part <span class="MrBUnderlined">of the earth-moon, binary-planet syste</span>.
  They didn't have to come all of those millions of miles from anywhere. They </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">have been here for thousands of </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">years</span></strong>. Whether we belong to them by possession, like cattle, or whether
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">we  belong to each other by </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">common origin </span></strong>and association is an interesting problem, and one which may
  soon be settled if we keep our heads.</span></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">He <em>Knows </em>Something but <em>How </em>Does He know.</strong></p>
<p>In final summary, the UFO's have been around us for a long time and probably are a connecting</span> link with the
  first wave of terrestrial civilization. They have been used against us in some very minor and</span> insignificant
  cases, but, on the whole, have either been friendly or indifferent. They are </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">operated by </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">forces </span></strong>currently unknown to us, but of <span class="MrBUnderlined">vastly greater efficiency than anything we now contemplate</span></strong>
  <span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">.</span> Space contains enough miscellaneous debris
  to supply many of the requirements of space life, and the</span> remainder are obtained from the surfaces of the earth
  and moon, while the UFO's spend most of their</span> time at the neutral points in space. The Russians have something
  which they have determined to</span> conceal at all costs. The Russians have been doing very advanced experimental
  research with cosmic</span> forces; UFO activity was stepped up greatly just a year or so after intelligence reports
  noted the unusual</span> Russian scientific activity. It is not necessary to assume that the Russian basic science is
  far ahead of</span> our own if we can believe that a space ship has landed in inner Asia and that they have captured
  it and</span> are studying its principles and experimenting with models -- or that the space people have taken over
  the</span> Russian high officialdom and are directing their efforts and supplying know-how.</span></p>
<p>We </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">do have </span></strong>the UFO's. They are of several kinds, always have been,
  so they may come from various sources. They are either terrestrial, extraterrestrial, or both. We think they are
  extraterrestrial,</span> but remotely of terrestrial origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="MrAUnderlined">We </span></strong>believe they are both, and that the Russians may have captured one or
  more. <span class="MrAUnderlined">We  think </span></strong>that some new scientific principles are with us, perhaps
  even now operating within our </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">military </span></strong>laboratories, and may burst
  forth at any moment -- and that as a race we may be on the verge of something akin to</span> what the modern atomic
  scientist calls a "quantum expansion"!</span></p>
<p>No other set of conclusions will serve as a common denominator for all observable facts.</span></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">The possibility of the Ruskies have FOUND</strong> an <em>old </em>"Dead-Ship"
  is Not without the realm of</strong> probability. His admittance to other forms of</strong> Humanoid Life is
  near-revealatory to what I surmise;</strong> <strong><em><span
      style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:#008100; ">He </span></em></strong>is <em>being Lead </em>by his
  short-Wave Telepathic</strong> nose, so to speak; too "SEE" these things. He says, "WE" and that could imply anything
  from one friendly</strong> L-M to a fellow scientist or his Wife or Some Member of U.S. Government.</strong></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">If What I, now, surmise, is true, then the L-Ms</strong> are in trouble <em>or </em>the
  S-Ms Wish to War upon the</strong> L-Ms &amp; are USING this Man, telepathically, to "get</strong> help." Whether this
  consideration is of import to</strong> him only remains to be seen. If is isn't , then, He</strong> will be Left out
  on a Emotional Limb, trying to say</strong> "See, I am right, "They" are Wrong" &amp; will forget what IS important
  here.</strong></p>
