<p>

<p>Books have been written, libraries of them, to show this antiquity,

  but it has not yet been accepted, even in principle, by any branch of science.

  Geology opposes any type of cataclysmic change in the structure of the

  earth and will go to any extremes to avoid coming to grips with its erratics.

  Yet every science breaks down when it is forced to contemplate the origin

  of man's intellectual development.

<p>The few erratics in the following pages show that there have been very ancient cultures, or civilizations which may
  have and could have developed methods of flight much simpler and more effective than ours, and more directly
  associated with forces which we do not yet comprehend. Again we are dealing with indirect evidence, not always of the
  greatest clarity. Yet in support of an antiquity of such an order I have seen and touched stonework carved out of the
  solid mountain of rock in South America, which certainly antedate the Andean glaciers, and almost as certainly predate
  the formation of the mountains themselves. This work is superior in technique to that accomplished by our currently
  mechanized civilization. Much of that construction, sculpture and tunneling could only have been accomplished by
  forces different from those in use by us today. The quandary is largely resolvable by admitting to a levitating force
  developed and used by the same common denominator — space flight — which simplifies so many other puzzles for us.
<p>On the basis of the evidence of an antiquity involving epochs of 50 000 to 200 000 or 300 000 years or more, we
  postulate the ancient development of some kind of science which either produced space flight or was brought to this
  third planet via space flight. I do not believe it is of great significance to our thesis at the moment whether one or
  the other, of these assumptions is most likely to be true. Either is abhorrent to science and to some religions, yet
  either presents a background of conditionality favorable to an extremely ancient development of wingless flight.
  Nothing else answers all of the conundrums presented by observed and recorded facts.
<p>As you will see, history is replete with stories of another great category

  of phenomena: the mysterious and ghostly disappearances of people, singly

  and in groups, publicly or in unobserved obscurity. These skin-tingling

  episodes seemed at first to have little in common with the falls of objects

  and the antics of storms. Many are incidents which, if their reality has

  been admitted at all, are in the view of scientists, spiritualists, and

  students of the occult, considered to belong to or border on the so-called

  supernatural. Within these segregations we must place the disappearance

  of the crews of ships, such as the Sea Bird and the Marie Celeste; the

  disappearances of individuals while in the company of their peers. There

  is not much hypothecating to be done with these. The stories can be told,

  and the cases lumped together as one big unexplained group of events. No

  explanation other than that of abduction by intelligently navigated aerial

  or celestial craft can be advanced! It is almost a case of proof by default.

  With planes, there is perhaps some added element other than metal fatigue

  which involves striking some apparently solid object while in the air,

  or being rent by unimaginable forces just before falling. (Because of this

  additional evidence I have put the accidents to planes into a separate

  section of Part Three, below.)

<p>Planes seem to hit something which crushes them or tears them apart,

  which is nevertheless invisible, and which strikes with such suddenness

  that the pilots do not have time to make an outcry via their ever-live

  radios. Then, too, there are cases of dead or frightened birds, and the

  cases of people being struck by unseen forces, as with seventeen marching

  soldiers in eighteenth-century France who were simultaneously struck down

  by an invisible agency.

<p>After analyzing these things, one speculates as to new types of obstacles

  as well as new forces. Take the mysterious Maunder object, which moved

  deliberately across the sky above southern England in November, 1882. Rand

  Capron, an authority on aurae, said it was auroral, while other equally

  competent scientists said it was a physical or material object. Then there

  are the many modern sightings of things which seem to manifest intelligent

  action, and to possess all normal physical characteristics except mass

  or weight. We recollect that radar sees things which are not visible to

  the eye.

<p>From such analysis we come by easy stages to conceive of a force, ray,

  or focal point, in some force field either unknown to us, or at least not

  understood, which produces rigidity in a localized or sharply delimited

  volume of air, or possibly in space itself. We are thinking of something

  like crystals of ice freezing within a body of water. The element remains

  the same but its physical attributes change suddenly and drastically.

<p>Another example might be the passage of a limited but powerful magnetic

  field through a scattering of iron filings or iron powder. Before the approach

  of the magnetic flux, the powder lies loose, flexible, and penetratable.

  Yet, when the flux enters it, invisibly and imperceptibly to the senses

  of man, this docile powder becomes rigid, tenacious, coherent, and at least

  semisolid.

<p>Do the space dwellers have a force which produces this temporary rigidity in the air, or even possibly in the
  gravitational field itself? Or do they create "local" concentrations of the gravitational field as we are able to do
  with the magnetic field ?
<p>Suppose that some intelligent entity was directing a concentration of

  potential which could make small volumes of rarefied air rigid, could set

  up a sort of island in the gravitational or magnetic field, moving the

  island about as the spot of a searchlight is moved on thin clouds. Such

  a thing would be invisible, would have many of the physical attributes

  of a solid body, but very small mass. For example, its movement through

  the air would be wavelike, and would not involve translation of the medium

  any more than the spot of the searchlight would require movement of the

  cloud which enabled the beam to attain visibility. In moving, this island

  would simply "freeze" on the advancing edge and "thaw" on the trailing

  edge. In this way it could have almost infinite velocity, and also acceleration,

  just as the spot of the searchlight. In this manner it would appear to

  be free of mass, and actually it would be free of mass, because only the

  force beam would move, not the air. Yet, in resisting the impingement of

  a bird, a plane, or, perhaps a meteor, it would have mass, and a very destructive

  mass at that. A pilot flying a plane into such a body would have no warning.

  Yet if such a thing were a few hundred yards in diameter, its mass in resisting

  the plane would be thousands of pounds, perhaps tons. The analogy to a

  ship hitting an iceberg would be very close.

<p>If such a force island were formed in the upper atmosphere, it might

  be very possible for it to have many of the physical characteristics of

  a solid body, and yet in matters of illumination it could behave exactly

  as any other auroral phenomena. In this connection we must remember that

  auroral phenomena are magnetic and may be caused by streams of electrons

  from the sun which are, in effect, precisely the type of force beam upon

  which we are speculating.

<p>It seems obvious that a single beam could not have the effect which

  we have suggested, else the freeze would take effect along the entire length

  of the beam. However, it is possible that the three-dimensional volume

  enclosed within the intersection of two beams might create such a congealed

  island.

<p>Speculating further on this weird possibility, remember that oxygen

  is a magnetic substance. It is not, perhaps, paramagnetic like iron, manganese

  and nickel, but nevertheless sufficiently magnetic that it can be separated

  from the other constituents of air by means of a magnetic field.

<p>If such a congealment were possible, consider the result of crossing the two beams at the exact aerial position of a
  flying plane and congealing the air around and in the plane. Could you, in this way, hold a plane in suspension, or
  even carry it away ? Could you, by a similar concentration of beams, freeze two aviators on the sands of the Arabian
  desert, and carry them away ? Could you freeze a man and instantly lift him out of sight, or cause him to be invisible
  within the block of frozen air or oxygen ? Could you freeze the crew of a ship, and remove them from the vessel ?
  Could you catch or kill birds, quickly and over a vast area, with such a thing, and dump them on a city in Louisiana?
<p>Toutes ces choses particulières sont arrivées, mais nous ne savons pas comment, ni pourquoi.
<p>Before we leave this tantalizing topic, give thought to the nature of

  an aurora borealis. As early as the time of Maunder's object, it was recognized

  that auroras are magnetic phenomena, or at least associated with the earth's

  magnetic field. It has been further ascertained that they are related to

  sunspots, and that they are probably due to the interaction of electronic

  streams from the sun or from sunspots.

<p>Is not an aurora, then, something very much akin to the congealed islands which we have just postulated ? Is it not a
  delimited volume of rarefied air caught within the gripping reaction of an electron stream passing through a magnetic
  field ? Was Maunder's object, then, in a sense both material and nonmaterial; both massive and nonmassive'? Is it the
  encounter with these "pockets" which makes meteors explode? Do they make blips on a radar screen? Have we a clue here,
  or are we dangerously close to science fiction?
<h2>Short-cut to Space Travel</h2>
<p>It is but a step from such contemplations to a similar analysis of the

  "Foo" fighters, fireballs, the cometlike objects usually seen in groups

  of six or eight, and the darting evanescent things seen now and then over

  Washington, D. C. Such phenomena must be considered as most likely due

  to intelligent manipulation, or remote control, from distant structures,

  and technically trained observers have often said as much. We do not entirely

  rule out a self-contained intelligence, but many of these manifestations

  have more the quality of something which, for want of an established terminology,

  we might call the searchlight type of UFO. Many reports have described

  objects or UFO's as appearing to have been operated by remote control.

  I believe that they are exactly that.

<p>It is by no means clearly established that all apparently self-luminous

  phenomena are of this nature. There are still a number of luminous spheres

  and discs which seem to have a more material nature and to contain the

  intelligences which operate them. The widgets seen by astronomers in space

  are examples, and I think, too, of such things as the ruddy disc which

  buzzed Captain Manning's DC-3 near South Bend, Indiana.

<p>The "Devil's Hoofprints" and related phenomena, discussed below in Part

  Three, offer another key or clue, and in segregating them from the mass

  of unclassified data we can, again, remove a considerable segment of the

  load which burdens the psychic and paranormal field. The misinterpretations

  adherent to the Hoof marks are more fantastic than the phenomenon itself.

  It is unbelievable, to me at least, that people intelligent enough to make

  a living among their fellows would try to interpret a linear sequence of

  exactly duplicated marks, crossing roof tops, walls and haystacks unfalteringly

  and indiscriminately as animal tracks These marks were equally spaced,

  occurring singly, not in twos or fours. Even in the old mythology there

  is no tale of a one-legged animal.

<p>Here is something clearly mechanical. With equal clarity it is something

  maneuvering in the sky. Since the mysterious phenomenon occurred half a

  century before our race developed mechanical flight, this, to me, is an

  isolated and clear-cut indication of space flight.

<p>

<p>While I believe that these space islands probably use both earth and moon for their own convenience, I suggest that
  their most natural and permanent habitat is at the gravitational neutral of the earth-sun-moon, three-body system
  which is well within the orbit of the moon.
<p>


  Dean Swift was prescient in regard to his astronomy, predicting that

  Mars had two small satellites, one of which was close to Mars' surface

  and made two revolutions daily. It has been pointed out that this inner

  body is too close to Mars to be in adjustment with any known postulate

  of the natural distribution of satellites relative to their parent body.

  This may be an indication that Mars' inner satellite is artificial.

  It has been postulated that gravitation need not be considered

  as acting with uniform continuity, from the center of the attracting body outward,

  even if subject to the inverse square law. Such a concept, today, would be especially

  horrendous to physics and astronomy. Yet, there is a suspicious rhythm to the

  distribution of planets outward from the sun. This has been somewhat crudely

  expressed in Bode's "law," and in spite of scientific protestations there is

  a similarity between atomic structure as we comprehend it and the obvious structure

  of the solar system.

<p>Refinements of Bode's law indicate nodes in the gravitational field, at which planets, asteroids, and possibly comets
  and meteors tend to locate themselves. An extension of the theory to the satellite systems of the major planets
  indicates a similar system of nodes on smaller scales, where planets, rather than the sun, are gravitational centers.
  This indicates a sort of generality, and since the smaller planets, such as <a
      href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/Venus.html">Venus</a>, Earth, Mars, do not have satellite systems (the moon
  is more of a companion than a satellite and may have joined the earth through acquisition rather than formation), it
  might well be that these gravitational nodes are occupied to some degree by navigable constructions.
<p>Over a period of almost two hundred years there have been many modifications

  of Bode's law, in an effort to completely generalize it, and to make it

  theoretical as well as empirical. Many researchers have extended the law

  so as to establish nodes right down to the surface of the central bodies,

  and in so doing the nodes become closer and closer together so that there

  may be many of them at short distances from the parent body. Thus, if the

  law or its derivatives have significance, there could be a number of these

  orbital nodes between the moon and the surface of the earth.

<p>We can, therefore, take it as highly probable that there are many zones

  of convenience around the planets, as well as around the sun, which are

  presently unoccupied by planets or satellites of any considerable size

  and which may well be used by enlightened space dwellers. Such zones, if

  they exist, are in addition to the demonstrable earth-sun-moon neutral.

<p>Since this system of nodes appears to be some function of the radius

  of the attracting body, it may be that there is a complete series of them

  in concentric circles starting at the surface of a parent body such as

  the earth, but their existence or true nature can hardly be known to us

  until we can in some way determine the nature of gravity itself. There

  may even be hints available to us regarding gravity. For instance, no final

  settlement has ever been made of the argument over the opposed wave and

  corpuscular theories of the propagation of light. An assumption that the

  ether, a necessary adjunct to the wave theory, is identical with the gravitational

  field, whatever that may be, would reconcile the opposing theories and

  a quantum of light would then be merely a pulsation or fluctuation in the

  gravitational field. Intense studies of the movements of space-navigable

  UFO's might furnish vital clues to such problems.

<p>Let us go back for a moment to the matter of masslessness of some of

  the UFO's. Their ability to achieve enormous acceleration has been one

  of the greatest puzzles to scientists. Time after time we are told that

  the UFO's could not possibly contain living bodies of flesh and bone --that

  such bodies could not withstand the stresses imposed by the observed accelerations.

  Yet such argument can well be based on entirely erroneous ideas as to the

  nature of the propulsive forces used by the UFO's. Acceleration is damaging

  only because the forces necessary to produce it are applied externally

  to the living body, or to the structural members of any flying machine.

  Any force which would simultaneously accelerate every molecule of either

  the living body or the mechanical structure would avoid all such stresses,

  and both the living and the mechanical could undergo any amount of acceleration

  without the slightest damage or discomfort.

<p>Since the UFO's, even the material, structure-like ones, are observed

  to sustain acceleration without mishap, we cannot but conclude that whatever

  the force used for such violent propulsion may be, it must be of such a

  nature that all fractions of the accelerated bodies are acted upon individually.

  This could only come about through reactance with the gravitational field,

  because nonmagnetic materials do not react to a magnetic field. Therefore,

  since such movements are observed, we have to stop thinking in terms of

  jet or rocket propulsion, or reactance with a magnetic field, any of which

  subject both flesh and metal to outside pressures, and, instead, ascertain

  how space craft obtain reactance with gravity.

<p>
  Few laymen realize that, for rocket flight, the fuel is of dual purpose. Its ability to produce energy is no whit more
  valuable than its ability to produce inertial reactance when expelled through a jet, and therefore, any rocket
  propulsion craft must carry mass in some form for the purpose of being expelled so as to create reactance. Using fuel
  for both energy and reactance is only a partial solution of the problem, and obviously limits both the range and speed
  of a space craft.
<p>, at least not as regards jet or reactance propulsion, for all of the atomic power in the world will not move a space
  craft, by reactance propulsion, unless there is an enormous mass to be ejected and lost. The amount of such expendable
  mass is proportional to the weight of the craft and the square of the speed obtained. It is exactly here that the
  great cost and impracticality of current attempts at rocket flight occur.
<p>A cheap power must, therefore, be found. By cheap power we have in mind

  something like the effect of the winds on sailing craft, or the reactance

  of revolving cylinders with the winds, as was tried on a Scandinavian vessel

  twenty to thirty years ago. Such a force or power will have to originate

  in reactance directly with the gravitational field, since magnetic fields

  will not account for the observed accelerations, nor are they, so far as

  we know, extensive enough in space.

<p>If the money, thought, time, and energy now being poured uselessly into

  the development of rocket propulsion were invested in a basic study of

  gravity, it is altogether likely that we could have effective and economical

  space travel, at a small fraction of the ultimate cost which we are now

  incurring, within one decade.

<p>Our present path of development will not give it to us.

<p>Science has consistently scoffed at any thought of gravity control or

  levitation, and such scoffing has had to be accepted as authoritative in

  the absence of proof to the contrary. Such proof new seems to be within

  sight, or at least there is increasingly strong evidence that gravity is

  neither so continuous, so immaterial nor so obscure as to be completely

  unamenable to use, manipulation and control. Witness not only the documented

  movements of UFO's in the form of lights, discs, nebulosities, etc., but

  the many instances of stones, paper, clothes baskets and many other things

  which have been seen to leave the ground without apparent cause. The lifting

  of the ancient megalithic structures, too, must surely have come through

  levitation.

<p>The same inhibited thinking which has consistently aroused our protests is responsible for the maladjusted direction
  of our attack on the problems of space flight through rocket power. There must be, and almost certainly is, a better,
  shorter way of accomplishing it. The difference between the pre-Incan methods of handling huge stone masses and those
  of our present-day engineers offers a kind of parallel. We should be looking for the simpler, more direct course — not
  wasting our resources on unworkable methods.
<p>Our procedure is expensive, cumbersome, tedious, and extremely wasteful

  of money, time, manpower, and intellect. If, on the contrary, we shift

  our concentration to the intensive study of gravity, and put on that problem

  brains and education comparable to those which have solved the problems

  of fission and atomic structure, it is my honest belief that we can whip

  tile problem of space travel inexpensively within a decade.

<p>It is my belief that something of the sort was done in the antediluvian

  past, through either research or through some fortuitous discovery of physical

  forces and laws which have not as yet been revealed to scientists of this

  second wave of civilization.

<p>It is always easier to uncover a principle, or a fact, if it is known

  in advance to exist. It probably helped Columbus in his quest for the "Indies,"

  even though he found something slightly different. It is my belief that

  the possibility of gravity control, or at least gravity reactance, has

  been strongly indicated by the phenomena listed in this book.

<h2>The Home of the UFO's</h2>
<p>Il semble y avoir une sorte de périodicité dans les événements d'origine céleste et spatiale. Cela a été porté à
  notre attention par John Philip Bessor dans le <em>Saturday Evening Post </em>dès mai <a
      href="../../../4/9/index.html">1949</a> ; mais personne n'est alors allé assez loin pour suffisamment cataloguer
  et classifier ces données pour déterminer avec certitude si de tels cycles existent, du moins leur périodicité ou leur
  cause. Il n'est pas particulièrement étonnant que ces phénomènes soient cycliques, pratiquement tout ce qui est
  astronomique étant cyclique. Si une périodicité peut être clairement établie pour ces phénomènes, ce seul fait serait
  une preuve de la réalité et de leur intégration dans le monde qui nous entoure.
<p>L'accumulation d'étrangetés et d'événements inhabituels dans la décennie de <a href="../../../../8/7/7/index.html">1877</a>
  à <a href="../../../../8/8/7/index.html">1887</a> est very much in evidence. Peut-être it does seem to be drawing the
  long bow a bit if one essaie de faire comprendre que la présence de grandes comètes, ou l'activité de la Tache Rouge
  sur <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/Jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>, furent des facteurs d'influences pour ces
  événements, but that all of these were concomitant is undeniable. If space life is limited to the earth-moon system,
  there is probably no common cause, but it must, however, be borne in mind.
<p>Of greater pertinence is the observed and authenticated activity on

  the lunar surface during these and the immediately preceding years. Not

  only were there appearances and disappearances of lunar craters about the

  size of some of the larger space craft which have been seen, but there

  is some evidence that nebulous entities hover over these evanescent craters

  and contribute to their obscuration.

<p>Observations of UFO phenomena and related events on or near the earth's

  surface may be distorted by excitement, emotionalism and prejudice. But

  the direct observations of space life and its contingent activity, as seen

  by astronomers, are more objective and more coolly recorded. We can feel

  more relaxed in dealing with them, on more solid ground.

<p>Astronomical observations break naturally into three categories: lights,

  shadows, and bodies. Lights and shadows, perhaps, in reality comprise one

  group since one is the counterpart of the other, while bodies, on the other

  hand, tend to divide into two groups, one made up of solid contrivances

  and the other of nebulous or cloudlike units.

<p>Lights seem to be especially representative of intelligence, particularly when they appear to have independent
  movement, or to shine in places where there seems to be no natural organic activity, for lights have to be created as
  well as manipulated. The hundreds of observations of lights on or near the moon and in other parts of nearby
  space—lights which seem to exhibit volition, purposefulness and direction -- are extremely difficult to explain on any
  other basis than intelligent activity in space. On the other hand, they become a natural corollary to such activity.
  Again, since science has failed utterly to offer any other acceptable explanation, we ask that these lights be taken
  as one more phenomenon which can be simply adapted to our organic environment by the one common denominator of space
  flight and space life.
<p>Shadows are almost as easily identified with intelligence as are lights, and one is pretty well the counterpart of
  the other. Their validity cannot be denied. Russell's shadow on the moon, 1500 miles in diameter, holding a steady
  position for hours, cannot be lightly dismissed. The shadows on our own clouds, as seen in Texas and England, are
  irrefutable proof that some kind of dirigible bodies are moving in our upper atmosphere or in nearby space.
<p>Bodies seen in space may be considered to have more direct and obvious

  connection with intelligence than do lights and shadows. There was a time

  when astronomers, seeing these by the dozens, thought them to be intra-Mercurial

  planets, or asteroids. Keen analysts have long since dispelled that misapprehension,

  but they have not discouraged nor discredited the sightings. These have

  remained without explanation for many decades, and some for hundreds of

  years. All of these observations gradually came to be regarded as erratics,

  to be ignored if possible. Astronomers who did not make any such observations

  liked to call them hallucinations, especially the spindle-shaped ones whose

  configuration did not resemble that of more commonly known celestial objects.

  Mass passages, such as those seen by Herschel and Bonilla, were laughed

  off as being bugs, birds or seeds; or at worst, meteor swarms.

<p>Little effort was made to determine the parallax of such objects, so

  their distance was never fairly established. We cannot blame the individual

  astronomer too much for this, particularly since many of those observations

  were made by amateurs. In those days it had not entered our comprehension

  that any of these spatial wanderers could be so close to the earth that

  parallax would be noticeable between observers only a few score miles apart.

  It has remained for us, awakening to the importance of those old observations,

  to make what we can of parallax studies for determining the distance of

  the objects sighted. It is not astonishing that our findings substantiate

  earlier analyses, but there may be an element of amazement in finding that

  these bodies are being navigated within the earth-moon system.

<p>There is something more of astonishment, however, in finding that the

  astronomical observations include two distinct and divergent types of bodies:

  the solid, geometrically shaped structures, and 't. he ill-defined nebulous

  clouds. Both have been recorded by impeccable witnesses. Both have been

  shown to exhibit evidences of intelligent direction or control. Both have

  their parallel instances among the current observations of UFO's seen by

  the man in the street, since 1947, and by our forebears as shown in historical

  records.

<p>Strangely enough, however, the cloudy types have been seen really far

  out in space, and rather probably associated with such large comets as

  that of 1882. But whether seen two-thirds of an astronomical unit away

  or hovering over New York Harbor, they have had peculiar characteristics.

  Some of those seen by Schmidt in the neighborhood of the great comet of

  1882 were moving both with the comet and at right angles to it, and there

  were undoubtedly objects moving about within the head of the comet.

<p>The astronomical observations are so definite that we must leave them

  largely to speak for themselves, other than to point out again their concentration

  in certain years. It may be that further investigation will disclose other

  years of concentration, but the task is an enormous one. It is possible

  to say, however, that the search has been fairly exhaustive for the years

  1877-86. There is reason to think that the next intensive investigation

  might bear fruit if concentrated around the prior years 1845-1860.

<p>It is my contention that these observations of space movement are well

  explained by the existence of controlled space clouds and space structures,

  and that nothing else known to man does explain them. That the structures

  are the habitat of some kind of intelligence seems reasonable enough, but

  we also begin to wonder if intelligence is also inherent in the big clouds.

  If it is, then we are almost certainly going to have to adjust ourselves

  to a new type of intelligence and "life."

<p>Observations by Harrison, Gould, Perrine, Swift, Brooks and others demonstrate

  incontrovertibly that some of the objects seen by astronomers are subject

  to volitional and purposeful controls, whether they are cometary (nebulous)

  type (as per Harrison, Perrine, Gould, Bone), or of the planetary (structural)

  sorts (as per Watson, Swift, Lescarbault, Gruitheinsen, et al.).

<p>The astronomical literature from 1885 to the present has been but sketchily

  included and researched. If it is but a fraction as prolific as that of

  the "comet years," there is, indeed, a wealth of UFO lore awaiting some

  research. It is to be doubted if there is as much in later years, because

  it became increasingly unfashionable to publish such information. It is

  barely possible that the editorial offices of some scientific publications

  may retain some of their old correspondence, and, if so, readers who have

  enough interest and access to those files might reap a rich reward from

  a bit of browsing. Search of observers' notebooks and observatory files

  might also bear fruit, and the old files of daily and weekly papers, especially

  where there are professional observatories or active amateur clubs, might

  disgorge some valuable information. I welcome reports of such items.

<p>

<p>Cometary masses, on the other hand, will be more easily seen in other parts of the sky and are less likely to be
  using the neutral. Look for them in the northern sky on dark nights and expect them to look exactly like small comets
  without tails or like a small nebula. Their rapid motions will give away their nature. Watch the region of the
  terminator on the moon for lunar surface activity. You might get a surprise.
<p>

<p>Si les terriens peuvent en être aussi proches aujourd'hui, d'autres races, non terrestres ou de grande antiquité
  terrestre, peuvent d'ors-et-déjà l'avoir.
<p>

<h2>Vol spatial ; dénominateur commun</h2>
<p>If I should be asked to state my thesis in one word, I believe that

  this word would be isolationism, or if I could squeeze in a hyphen, anti-isolationism.

<p>Whatever else we may do or think, we have to extend our ideas of one

  world to include at least one solar-system, and maybe more. But, whether

  or not, it is beyond the comprehension of our weary minds to go further

  at the moment, and we will just have to be content to consider our solar

  system as one living entity.

<p>This war-weary, heartsick, and bedraggled planet is not alone — it is just one cell in a multi-cellular unit. Let us
  revive from the sedative idea fostered by both science and religion that man, Homo Sapiens, of here and now, of the
  United States and today, is the final, glorious, endpoint in the work of an omnipotent and benevolent creator, all
  alone in an infinite universe. It cannot be true — and in our honest hearts all of us know that it is not so.
<p>Were I to be granted one more word, that word would be Truth. I am interested in true knowledge, for its own sake. It
  is my philosophy that science and religion should have at least one thing in common: the untiring, unceasing,
  unwavering quest of unbiased, undistorted true knowledge of the world around us... and, again, I use the word world in
  its old, original and all-comprehensive sense.
<p>To cry out that we have discovered the truth about UFO's would be to

  invite ridicule, even for our effort. Therefore, let us summarize our conclusions

  and preface them with the same statement of open-mindedness which we demand

  of others whom we invite to immerse themselves in our studies of historical,

  meteorological, and astronomical erratics.

<p>Nous considérons que nos analyses ont pris en compte toutes les possibilités et nous ont fourni les réponses les plus
  logiques.

<p>

<p>Nous pensons que de nouveaux principes scientifiques sont avec nous, peut-être même utilisés aujourd'hui dans nos
  propres laboratoires militaires, et peuvent émerger à tout moment — et qu'en tant que race we may be on the verge of
  something akin to what the modern atomic scientist calls a "quantum expansion" ! No other set of conclusions will
  serve as a common denominator for all observable facts.
