<p>On Sunday, September 11, 1949, three acquaintances, Dr. Robert Botts, Dr. John Tipton, and Dr.</span> T.J. Treadwell,
  went dove hunting on the Eugene Tipton Ranch in northwest Stephens County, Texas.</span></p>
<p>Dr. Botts told me about it, and said that it was a fairly clear, hot afternoon on the ranch when the skies let loose
  with about forty pounds of ice, all in one chunk. Dr. Tipton and Dr. Treadwell substantiate</span> what Dr. Botts says
  that he saw.</span></p>
<p>Dr. Botts was sitting by an earthen tank, waiting for birds. He said that he "heard a whistling</span> sound, and
  when I looked up, I saw a glistening, whirling object falling. It landed fifteen feet from me and</span> shattered
  into hundreds of pieces." He added that the ice knocked a hole several inches deep in the</span> ground. He
  immediately called his companions, and, when they arrived, all three saw that the ice was</span> milky white, and when
  they tasted it they found that it had a soapy flavor.</span></p>
<p>Botts said there were a few thunderheads in the sky, but none overhead. He declared that no</span> airplanes had
  passed overhead.</span></p>
<p>The ice fell about 4:30 P.M., and had not completely melted when Dr. Botts and his friends left,</span> about two
  hours later.</span></p>
<p>Treadwell, said that he did not hear the sound of the ice falling, but he arrived on the scene</span> immediately
  after and saw the chunk where he was sure there had been no ice when he walked by the</span> tank earlier.</span></p>
<p>Tipton, whose uncle owns the ranch, said that the ice did not look like the truck-delivered variety,</span> but did
  have something of the appearance of hail, except for the dimensions. All three declared that the</span> pieces were
  not dry ice, and both Drs. Tipton and Treadwell agreed that there had been no airplanes</span> heard overhead, before
  or after the ice fell.</span></p>
<p>After hearing this story, I turned to <em>my </em>Bible, Revelations 16:21 -- "And there fell upon men a</span> great
  hail out of Heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent." According to a dictionary definition, a</span> talent
  is fifty-eight pounds.</span></p>
<p>Can you explain this mystery?</span></p>
<p>Lewis W. Mathews,</span></p>
<p>Fort Worth, Texas</span></p>
<p>Now? how do we interpret these strange falls of ice? What, after careful consideration, do they</span> mean to
  us?</span></p>
<p>We have already enough data to indicate three classes of falling ice:</span></p>
<ol>
  <li>real hailstones, from thunderstorms, or normal meteorological phenomena,</span></li>
  <li> large and small blocks of meteoric ice, which may have been blasted from the polar regions, or</span> oceans,
    when scientists of Mu invented the first series of atom and hydrogen bombs, and removed Mu,</span> plus a few
    million square miles of surrounding land and seascapes from the southwest corner of our</span> harassed planet, and
    (3) ice from some superstructures which make repeated visits to the atmosphere of</span> the earth.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Since some of the pieces of ice, which show evidence of some contact with a smooth surface, fell long before the days
  of modern mechanical flight, we are forced to assign their origin to some other, older</span> type of space
  inhabiting, moving mechanism.</span></p>
<p>It seems most natural that a space contrivance, if made of metal, and coming in from cold space,</span> would soon
  become coated with ice. That ice should fall, or be pushed off by de-icing mechanisms, or</span> even melt off when
  the space ships are heated by friction with the air, or become stationary in the</span> sunshine, seems equally
  natural. If these contrivances are drawing power from surrounding media via an</span> endothermic process, the space
  structure will become colder and colder to more power it draws, and, in</span> the atmosphere, ice would tend to form
  on it, just like the frosting of the coils in a refrigerator.</span></p>
<p>I am fully convinced that huge ice swarms are moving around in space, in orbits like those of</span> meteors.
  Somewhere in space there is a borderline--beyond it the sun's rays will not melt ice: on the</span> sunward side of
  the line, melting takes place slowly.</span></p>
<p>I cannot accept the idea of a floating ice field permanently near the earth. In contrast, I postulate</span> vast
  masses in orbital motion, so that when they approach the earth they are held against its attraction by</span> the
  dynamic force of their velocity. Meteoric and cometic orbits are of what we call very high eccentricity,</span> which
  is to say that the material following such paths varies extremely in it distance from the sun, as</span> compared to
  the movement of the earth and other planets, which have orbits almost circular. Then, as</span> the ice swarm approach
  the sun, in its periodic orbital circuit, tiny amounts of ice are melted and, being</span> fluid, the film of melted
  ice is pulled toward the side of greatest gravitational attraction, probably earthward or sunward. This melted ice
  flows toward the direction of greatest gravity, on the surface of the spatial</span> iceberg exactly as, and for the
  same reasons that, the sun and moon pull water toward the proximate side</span> of the earth in their production of
  ocean tides.</span></p>
<p>We come to the inevitable conclusion, therefore, that this series of falling ice cannot be explained</span> other
  than as vast masses of ice in orbital motion, in which case they are an intrinsic element of the space</span> life or
  space craft, and that their very inconsistency indicates intelligence in space. Since they are not</span> consistent
  with natural laws, there must be direction behind them.</span></p>
