<p>What, indeed, do "falling stones" have to do with UFO's?</span></p>
<p>We shall list, herein, but a few of the more interesting and entertaining examples of stones having</span> fallen
  from space, and we can note that </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">quartz </span></strong>and other materials not of
  usual meteoric types indicate something other than meteors. Where else, then, but from UFO's?</span></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">Yes, quartz, it has its use s Electro-Magnetically and otherwise on the
  Home-ships.</strong></p>
<p>It is essential, too, to keep reminding ourselves that because we attribute intelligence too these</span></p>
<p>otherwise inexplicable phenomena, it does not necessarily mean human Intelligence. </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">It is a blow to our </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">ego to accept the fact that our racial intelligence is anything but the  supreme summation of </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">creation</span></strong><span
    style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:#008100; ">; </span>however, <span class="MrAUnderlined">the quicker we adjust to the notion </span></strong>
  that the human body and the human mind are but incidental in a limitless welter of space life and activity, the
  quicker we shall approach a true grasp of</span> the nature of the Universe and our own true purpose in it.</span></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">"WHAT IS MAN THAT THOU HAST PLACED (planted)</strong> HIM A LITTLE LOWER
  THAN ANGELS." "angelic" is a good discription of the Little-Men <em>when</em></strong> they aren't <em>on </em>business.</strong>
</p>
<p>On June 20, 1887, during a violent storm, a small stone fell from the sky at Tarbes, France. It</span> was thirteen
  millimeters in diameter, five millimeters thick, and weighed two grams. It was reported to the</span> French Academy
  by M. Sudre, Professor of the Normal School, Tarbes.</span></p>
<p>It is difficult for the conventionalists to press the old, convenient expostulation that the stone was</span> there
  in the first place. Such a dodge must be resisted, for?the stone was covered with ice.</span></p>
<p>The object had been cut and shaped by means" similar to human hands and human mentality."</span> That expression,
  "similar to," begins to tell a story. It was a disc of worked stone, "tres regulier." "Il a ete</span> assurement
  travaille." There is no word of any known whirlwind or tornado, or notes of any other objects</span> or debris which
  fell at, or near, this date, in France. It was a single entity. It had fallen alone!</span></p>
<p>Can part of our trouble with the acceptance of miscellaneous falls lie in our definition of "sky" and</span> our use
  of the word sky instead of space? When we get far enough out into space, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">Only a few hundred </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">miles, </span></strong>the word sky becomes meaningless.</p>
<p>To the surface dwellers, sky is essentially something opposed to earth, or the solid understratum</span> of dirt and
  pavement on which we live. It is usually thought of as the immediate layer of air above us. But</span> out in space,
  the earth, with its air and sky is but a minute detail. If you were in a space ship remote from</span> planets,
  completely surrounded by the blackness of infinity, but nevertheless bathed by the sea of</span> sunlight, what would
  be your concept of sky?</span></p>
<p><em>Monthly Review</em>, 1796: "The phenomenon which is the subject of the remarks before us will seem, to most
  persons, as little worthy of credit as any that could be offered. The falling of large stones</span> from the sky,
  without any assignable cause of the previous ascent, seems to partake so much of the</span> marvelous as almost
  entirely to exclude the operation of known and natural agents. Yet a body of</span> evidence is here brought to prove
  that such events have actually taken place, and we ought not to</span> withhold from it a proper degree of
  attention."</span></p>
<p>That was one hundred and fifty-nine years ago! It is a part of a paper read to a very learned</span> society. These
  were intelligent and erudite men. They had to overcome their own prejudices, and those</span> of even more bigoted
  people. They had to undergo a change of concept and to accept a less egocentric</span> or geocentric, viewpoint. They
  had to attain an increased degree of objectivity. And they had to do it</span> innately, spontaneously, on the basis
  of accumulating evidence which ran contrary to their every belief</span> and tenet.</span></p>
<p>1846: Something described as "slag" fell at Darmstadt, Germany, on June 6.</span></p>
<p>1875: Ashes fell on the Azores.</span></p>
<p>1879: A quantity of "slag" fell from the sky near Chicago, on April 9. A professor who did not see</span> the fall
  and who was not there, said that the slag was there all the time. But the <em>New York Times </em>of April</span> 14,
  1879 said that about two bushels had fallen.</span></p>
<p>1881: Two silver crosses were found by Charles C. Jones in Georgia. An unintelligible</span> inscription was upon
  them and they were definitely not Christian since both arms of the cross were of</span> equal length.</span></p>
<p>1884: <em>Nature</em>, of January 10, quotes a Kimberley newspaper: "Toward the end of November,</span> 1883,
  a</span> thick shower of ashy matter fell at Queenstown, South Africa. It was in marble-sized balls, soft and pulpy,
  and crumbled when dry. The shower was confined to one narrow strip of land, and thus hardly</span> attributable too
  Krakatao almost halfway around the world. With the fall, loud noises here(sic) heard."</span></p>
<p>It is most significant that this shower was confined to a narrow strip of land.</span></p>
<p>1908: A white substance, like ashes, fell at Annoy, France, on March 27.</span></p>
<p>1910: Charles F. Holder wrote that on September 10: "Many years ago a strange stone, resembling a meteorite, fell
  into the valley of the Yaqui, Mexico, and the sensational story went from one</span> end of the country to the other,
  that a stone bearing human inscriptions had descended to the earth?</span> The stone was brown igneous rock, about
  eight feet long, and on the 'eastern' face was the deep-cut</span> inscription? I submitted the photographs to the
  Field Museum and the Smithsonian, and others, and, to</span> my surprise, the reply was that they could make nothing
  of it."</span></p>
<p>A lot of coke, cinders, ashes and slag fell in, the proximate to, the decade of the 1880's. There are too many cases
  of stones, fire balls, and other things falling in storms. It is useless to argue that</span> storms pick these things
  up. The list is too selective. So we have to think of some reasons why these</span> things fall during storms; and one
  wonders if the storms were created by something outside of what we</span> are commonly calling meteorological
  conditions?</span></p>
<p>1885: It was reported that a good-sized stone, of clearly artificial form, had fallen at Naples, in</span>
  November.</span></p>
<p>La Science Pour</span> Tous, 5-264: At Wolverhampton, England, June, 1860 a violent storm, there fell so many little
  pebbles that they were cleared away with shovels? Rept. Brit. Assoc., 1864. Great</span> numbers of small black stones
  which fell at Birmingham, England, in August, 1858 &ndash; in a storm? Mon.</span> Weath. Rev., July, 1888: Pebbles of
  the water-worn variety, not common to the locality, fell at Palestine,</span> Texas, July 6,1888?Am. Jour. Sci.,
  1-26-161: Many round smooth pebbles fell at Kandahar in</span> 1834?Mon. Weath. Rev., May, 1883: "a number of stones
  of peculiar formation and shapes, unknown in</span> this neighborhood, fell at Hillsboro, Illinois, May 18,
  1883."</span></p>
<p>Concentrate on the selectivity?a function of intelligence?and possibly shape. Possibly, we</span> should consider the
  coincidence of storms, to which we can hardly attribute this selectivity nor the</span> dexterity with which to
  implement it.</span></p>
<p>1815: Hailstones the size of baseballs, which were said to contain small pebbles, fell near</span> Annapolis,
  Maryland.</span></p>
<p>1824: Small symmetrical objects of metal fell at Orenburg, Russia, in September. A second fall</span> of these
  objects at Orenburg, January 25, 1825.</span></p>
<p>Selectivity, repetition, symmetry, timing: attributes of intelligent action!</span></p>
<p>1884: A report from the <em>Signal Service </em>observer at Bismark, North Dakota, states that at 9:00</span> P.M.,
  May 22, sharp sounds were heard throughout the city, caused by the fall of flinty stones at</span> Bismarck. Fifteen
  hours later there was another fall of flinty stones at Bismarck. None reported falling</span> anywhere else.</span>
</p>
<p>1860: Professor Sayed Abdulla, Professor of Hindustani, wrote an account of the fall of stones at</span> Dhurmsalla,
  India, which were of "divers forms and sizes, many of which bore great resemblance to</span> ordinary cannonballs,
  just discharged from engines of war."</span></p>
<p>Note that some of these Dhurmsalla stones were spherical. Spherical stones are most likely</span> shaped by
  intelligence. It is further noted that, within a few months of the fall of the Dhurmsalla</span> "meteorite," there
  had been a fall of live fish at Berares, a shower of red substance at Furrackabad, a dark</span> spot observed on the
  disc of the sun, an earthquake, "an unnatural darkness of some duration," and a</span> luminous appearance in the sky
  that looked like an aurora borealis.</span></p>
<p>1855: A series of explosions in the sky, fall of debris, slag, cinders, powder, discolored rain,</span> reported at
  and near Crieff, England.</span></p>
<p>Recurrence, in a localized area, of unusual events, mostly of celestial, or mysterious origin.</span></p>
<p>1858-1868: Dr. C.M. Inglsby, a meteorologist, wrote: "During the storm on Saturday (12)</span> morning, (May),
  Birmingham was visited by a shower of aerolites. Many hundreds of thousands must</span> have fallen, some streets
  being strewn with them." Many pounds of stones gathered from awnings.</span> Greenhouses damaged. The </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">same type of  stones fell </span></strong>again at Wolverhampton, thirteen miles from
  Birmingham, June 9, 1860, two years later. Eight years later they fell again in Birmingham. Birmingham</span> Daily
  Post, May 30, 1868: Letter from meteorologist, Thomas Plant, who said: "I think for one hour the</span> morning of May
  29, 1868, stones fell from the sky at Birmingham. From nine to ten o'clock, meteoric</span> stones fell in immense
  quantities in various parts of town. They resembled, in shape, broken pieces of</span> Rowley ragstone?in every
  respect they were like the stones that fell in 1858." In the Post, June 1, Mr.</span> Plant says the stones of 1858
  did fall from the sky, and were not washed out of the pavement by rain (although of the same shape) because many
  pounds of them were gathered from a platform which was twenty feet above the ground.</span></p>
<p>This phenomenon may have continued in driblets, for in the <em>Post </em>of June 2, 1868, a</span> correspondent
  wrote that on the first of June, his niece, walking in a field, was struck by a stone that</span> injured her hand
  severely. In the <em>Post</em>, June 4, someone else wrote that his wife had been cut on her</span> head by a stone
  while walking down a lane.</span></p>
<p>Some of these big falls occurred in storms, and all of the falls are identified as being of the same appearance as
  the Rowley ragstone with which Birmingham was paved, and the old explanation of</span> whirlwinds is invoked. But
  regardless of the origin, there is again repetition and a selectivity of material</span> which is inexplicable except
  through intelligent manipulation. Why anyone or anything would pick up</span> Rowley ragstone and dump in on
  Birmingham and Wolverhampton, repeatedly, is more than we can say!</span> There must be a reason.</span></p>
<p>1896: On February 10, a tremendous explosion occurred in the sky over Madrid, and throughout</span> the city windows
  were smashed. A wall in the building occupied by the American Embassy was thrown</span> down. The people of Madrid
  rushed to the streets and there was a panic in which many were injured.</span> For five and a half hours a luminous
  cloud of debris hung over Madrid, and stones fell from the sky.</span></p>
<p>Here we have stone falling from the sky, a hint of a localized cloud, luminosity, and definitely the</span>
  suggestion that some violent activity had come from space. There is also a haunting resemblance to the</span>
  circumstances of the Great Heresford Quake, in England, of December 17, 1896.</span></p>
<p>A disc </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">of quartz </span></strong>fell on the plantation, Bleijendal, Dutch
  Gueana,(sic) and was sent to the Layden Musuem (sic) of Antiquities. It measures six centimeters by five millimeters
  by about five centimeters. I</span> am puzzled by these dimensions, unless the disc is slightly oval and is six cm. in
  its major axis and five</span> cm. in the minor axis. This seems to be a good datum. It has some individuality. Even
  if we omit space</span> ships from our cognizance, this thing could have been blasted into space by our progenitors in
  Mu when</span> they lost control of the atom.</span></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">The Muaneans <em>Never knew What </em>an atom was &amp;</strong> Niether did
  the Atruscan-Lems. They only know &amp; knew Force-field work as their top accomplishment</strong> &amp; found that
  throo Inlay work in Metal that the</strong> Design had been Hit by Lightning causing it to</strong> Have No weight
  somehow. THEY WENT ON FROM THAT FLOOR Design or floor pattern which</strong> may have been Laid in Lodestone for all I
  know.</strong></p>
<p>Anything about quartz that appears to come from the sky is interesting because it helps to</span> illustrate the
  diversity of debris which drifts around in space. Quartz, as celestial debris, is scientifically</span> damned at
  present, for science has not yet admitted, openly, the existence of meteoric material other</span> than the two
  conventional types. Certainly, we do not find meteoric quartz to be plentiful. It's so scarce</span> that if you
  encounter it, you almost feel instinctively that it has some connection with intelligent being.</span> That may seem
  an arbitrary assumption; </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">however</span></strong>, worked quartz is something else
  again!</p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">As I said; it has its uses.</strong></p>
<p>There is the instance of a man, his wife, and his three daughters, of Casterton, Westmoreland,</span> who were
  looking at their lawn during a thunderstorm when they saw a stone fall from the sky, kill a</span> sheep, and bury
  itself in the ground. They dug. They found a stone ball. The object was exhibited at a</span> meeting of the Royal
  Meteorological Society and is described in its Journal as a sandstone ball and it is</span> described as a sandstone
  by Mr. Symons.</span></p>
<p>There is a suggestion of symmetry and structure in this object, and it had an external shell</span> separated from a
  loose nucleus.</span></p>
<p>Science maintains that it is impossible for quartz to come from any place other than earth. I offer that quartz not
  only can, but has come from elsewhere. There are two possible sources: (1) that items</span> such as quartz, closely
  resembling our own geological specimens, may have been blown off this planet</span> by erratic Muvian scientists when
  they erred in their explosions of hydrogen, and that some of these</span> things are coming home after several eons in
  orbital isolation, and (2) they may be a part of the space</span> ships or be attracted by them as they pass, drawing
  them up and then, through some spatial phenomenon, dropping them at a later date.</span></p>
<p>Bode's law indicated a gap in the planetary sequence between Mars and Jupiter, and near the</span> beginning of the
  nineteenth century small planetoids began to be discovered at the designated place.</span> They now number much over a
  thousand, and it is suspected that millions of small pieces of space debris</span> occupy this belt. Astronomical
  science has never fully accepted the idea that a planet exploded in that</span> location, but a case can be made for
  such a cataclysm, and it would explain the origin of stones which fell</span> to the earth.</span></p>
<p>The asteroid zone is the only gap in the Bode systems, but some of the derivatives of that</span> system, which seem
  to fit observed data a little bit more snugly, have gaps which do not seem to be filled.</span> Furthermore, such
  systems indicate zones surrounding the larger planets which are not always occupied</span> by satellites, and which
  may contain interplanetary debris.</span></p>
<p>The earth-moon system is unique. It is really a binary planet, and while we speak of the moon as</span> being earth's
  satellite, it may be that this is a misnomer, and the result of a misconception of the formation</span> of the little
  system. There are a number of traditions, among ancient tribes and races, to the effect that</span> their forefathers
  were thriving before there was a moon. This would hint that the moon was picked up by</span> acquisition and not
  formed in the original coagulation of earth-material. At any rate, neither the earth nor</span> its twin Venus formed
  satellite systems such as accompany the outer major planets. Nevertheless, the</span> laws, such as Bode's </span>
  <span
      class="JemiUnderlined">imply physical  conditions in which either satellites or belts of debris could</span></strong>
  <span class="JemiUnderlined">exist</span></strong>. If this is true, then we see no reason for not suspecting that
  there may be gravitational nodes around the earth, as around the sun, and major planets; and these nodes may very well
  be the abode of</span>all manner of particles, either directed or undirected.</span></p>
<p class="Jemi" style="text-autospace:none;">Bodes Law to that extent is Proved.</strong></p>
<p>Most of the material in these belts would doubtless be meteoric material, but our experience is that meteoric
  material includes a much broader category than has heretofore been accepted, and that</span> mixed with it are things
  associated with intelligence.</span></p>
<p class="Jemi" style="text-autospace:none;">MOON NOW <em>RECOGNIZED </em>AS RECENT ACQUISITION OF EARTH. NOT KNOWN FROM
  WHENCE IT CAME. <em>STRONGLY </em>SUSPECT QUANTUM "GAP" indicated Bodes Law as original position of
  <em>our </em>Moon.</strong></p>
