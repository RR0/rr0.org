<p class="MrB">Food expieriments (sic) to compensate for Growing</span></strong> Population of L-M and
  Mutations.</span></strong></p>
<p>In the reported falls of live things, we find again selectivity and localization.</span></p>
<p>There are recorded, by Charles Fort, two hundred and ninety-four distinct reports of showers of</span> living things.
  The reports are authenticated and are quoted in magazines of learning, substantiated by</span> countless eyewitnesses
  and newspaper articles, contemporary with the falls. This is excluding, or course,</span> the numerous ancient and
  biblical references. The latter, for the uninhibited thinker, are not difficult to</span> allow.</span></p>
<p>Live things falling from the sky have been almost exclusively confined to sea life and lower forms: snails, worms,
  reptiles, fish, crabs, and a few insects. Most of these have high reproductive rates, simple</span> living habits, and
  require a minimum of attention to raise.</span></p>
<p>In case someone is thinking "hoax!" why was it, or would it be, confined to these lower forms?</span> Why not rabbits
  or groundhogs or cats? Why snails, fish, worms?</span></p>
<p>Accepting as I do the veracity of the many reports of live things having fallen from the skies, I</span> <span
    class="MrAUnderlined">submit that they are the inhabitants of celestial hydroponic tanks and  that their falls come from</span></strong>
  <span class="MrAUnderlined">one of two things: </span></strong>(1) when the tanks are dumped and cleared for
  refilling, for whatever reason there might be, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">(2) </span></strong>that the falls
  may be the residue from the collection from earth while the monitors of the tanks are replenishing their
  supplies.</span></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">Some of Both &amp; of Wrecks &amp; repair-Jobs on</strong> Most
  Ships.</strong></p>
<p>Again we are faced with the admission of intelligence and direction. An intelligence in space</span> controlling
  either the collection, dissemination, or nurture of sea life, either for study or for food or both, is</span> the only
  answer which satisfies all the elements of all the reports.</span></p>
<p>Let us scan but a few of the more dramatic of the falls.</span></p>
<p>1886: There was a shower of snails, during a heavy thunderstorm, in Cornwall, England, on</span> August
  13.</span></p>
<p>1890: Fish showered over Montgomery County, California, on February 6.</span></p>
<p>1891: A great shower of fish took place at Seymour, Indiana. They were completely unknown</span> and remain
  unidentified. This was August 8.</span></p>
<p>1892: At Coalburg, Alabama, on May 29, a tremendous shower of enormous eels took place.</span> The eels were of a
  variety unknown in Alabama, though somebody said he knew of such eels in the</span> Pacific Ocean. There were piles of
  eels in the street, and farmers came with carts and took them away to</span> use for fertilizer.</span></p>
<p>1892: A yellow cloud appeared over Paderborn, Germany, and a torrential rain fell from the cloud</span> in which
  there were hundreds of mussels.</span></p>
<p>1921: Innumerable little frogs appeared in the streets of northern part of London during a</span> thunderstorm on
  August 17. A thorough search of newspapers of the day indicated no whirlwinds or</span> storms, nothing but
  frogs!</span></p>
<p>1922: Toads dropped for two days at Chalon-sur Saone, France.</span></p>
<p>1924: A shower of red objects fell, with snow, at Halmstead, Sweden, on January 3. They were</span> red worms varying
  from one to four inches in length.</span></p>
<p>1925: Mr. C.J. Grewar reported, on March 21, from Uitenhage, Transvaal, that on "The Flats"</span> about fifty miles
  from Uitenhage he noted some springboks leaping and shaking themselves</span> unaccountably. At a distance he could
  conceive of no explanation for such eccentricities. He</span> investigated and found that a rain of little frogs and
  fish had pelted the springboks. Mr. Grewar heard</span> that, sometime before, at the same place, there had been
  similar shower.</span></p>
<p>It is interesting to note that this localized repetition; the yellow cloud over Paderborn, Germany,</span> appears to
  have been an artificially created cloud which </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">might well conceal a navigable structure</span></strong>
  . It makes us think again of someone opening a vast hydroponic tank in which mussels are grown.</span></p>
<p>1842: Enormous numbers of fish were reported to have fallen at Derby, England.</span></p>
<p>1873: A shower of frogs was reported during a rain storm in Kansas City, Missouri. The sky was exceptionally
  dark.</span></p>
<p>1877: It was reported that during the winter of 1876-77 at Christiana, Norway, worms were found crawling upon the
  ground. The worms could not have come up from the ground because the ground was</span> completely frozen at the time
  and, too, the fall of worms was reported from Sweden.</span></p>
<p>1877: In Memphis, Tennessee, after a violent storm during which rain fell in torrents, thousands of</span> snakes
  were found in the space of two blocks! They were crawling on sidewalks, in yards and in streets,</span> masses of
  them.</span></p>
<p>Again note the localized area, as if a "dumping" had taken place.</span></p>
<p>Perhaps the most glamorous of all falls in this category took place in Geneva, Switzerland, on</span> March 21, 1922.
  The incident, as reported in the <em>Boston Transcript</em>, reads as follows:</span></p>
<p>"Geneva, March 21. During a heavy snowstorm in the Alps, recently, thousands of exotic insects</span> <span
    class="JemiUnderlined">resembling </span></strong>spiders, caterpillars <span
    class="JemiUnderlined">and huge ants </span></strong>fell on the slopes and quickly died. Local naturalists are
  unable to explain the phenomenon?"</span></p>
<p>There are several other records of similar falls in the Alps, and usually in late January. It is</span> interesting
  to note that most falls of worms and insects are recorded in late winter and often in the snow.</span> It may be that
  this is merely because we are unlikely to see or notice them otherwise.</span></p>
<p>Again we encounter selection and segregation, despite the fact that we have a mixture of</span> species. These falls,
  nevertheless, do indicate selection as they are always of relatively the same order</span> and remain unmixed with
  twigs, grasses, or other debris from space.</span></p>
<p>The reports are too lengthy and detailed for inclusion in such a volume as this; however, we</span> should at least
  mention the many unexplained records of eels appearing in inland ponds and mountain</span> tarns; seals and squids in
  Onondaga Lake; sudden appearances of plants in unexpected areas; a five</span> and one-half foot alligator found
  frozen on the bank of Rock River, Janesville Wisconsin; parakeets, one</span> after another, appearing in Scotland,
  These are all verified, substantiated reports.</span></p>
<p>But, as we have pointed out, most of the falls of animal life have been reptilian, insect, or other low-grade life
  forms, especially of marine varieties. Fish are among the highest types. There must be</span> significance in this.
  Are these things indicative of the eating habits of the beings that run space</span> contraptions? Or are they
  representative of the operators themselves?</span></p>
<p>We almost drift into fantasy with the "tremendous red rain" in France, October 16-17, 1846. It is</span> said that
  this rain was so vividly red and so blood-like that many persons in France were terrified. Two</span> analyses were
  given. One chemist noted a great quantity of corpuscles?whether blood-like or not?in</span> the red rain. The other
  chemist set down the organic matter at thirty-five percent. Of significance is the</span> fact, that with this
  substance, larks, quail, ducks, and water hens, some of them alive, fell at Lyons,</span> Grenoble, and other
  places.</span></p>
<p class="MrA">Chico, California, must be a crossroads for celestial phenomena. Not only are there very</strong>
  extensive falls of stone in Chico, but there have been other phenomena there. In the <em>New York</em></strong> <em>Times</em>,
  September 2, 1878, it was said that on August 20, 1878, according to the <em>Chico Record</em>, a</strong>  great
  number of small fish fell from the sky, covering the roof of a store and falling in the streets</strong>  and upon an
  area of several acres. Perhaps the most important part of the observation is that the</strong>  fell from a cloudless
  sky</strong><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:#008100; ">.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">Hah! Even yet they Honor their Heros of</span></strong> The Great Battle.</span></strong></p>
<p>1917: A Baton Rouge correspondent to the <em>Philadelphia Times </em>reported that in the summer of</span> 1896, into
  the streets of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and from a "clear sky," hundreds of dead birds fell.</span> There were wild
  ducks, catbirds, woodpeckers, and "many birds of strange plumage," some of them</span> resembling canaries.</span></p>
<p>Usually one does not have to look very far from such an event to learn of a storm, but the best that can be done in
  this instance is to point out that there has been a storm on the coast of Florida.</span></p>
<p>Isn't there more than just a hint of intelligent action in the fall of these birds? Especially such a</span>
  heterogeneous collection of species from widely separated places of usual habitat which are not usually</span> found
  flocking together? Doesn't this smack of dumping, as in the many cases of fish, frogs, periwinkles,</span>
  etc.?</span></p>
<p>I have seen reference to live birds which flew head-on into a locomotive, as though frightened into complete panic;
  also a group of starlings flying as though completely terror-stricken into suicidal collision</span> in New York
  streets. What had they seen, or encountered? Something real, but invisible to, or unnoticed</span> by man? Have we
  some clues in the apparently unmaterial things which are being reported today under</span> the misnomer "flying
  saucers"?</span></p>
<p>1921: A shower of little frogs fell upon Anton Wagner's farm, near Sterling, Connecticut.</span></p>
<p>By way of coincidence, Professor Campbell of Lick Observatory, Ace Aviator Eddie</span> Rickenbacker, conservative
  astronomer, Colonel Marwick, and Dr. Emmert, of Detroit, all reported from</span> widely separated points of the earth
  that an unknown, luminous object had been seen near the sun on</span> August 6 and 7. "Near the sun," means, in
  astronomical parlance, something more or less in line with the</span> sun as seen from terrestrial observation. It
  actually means "apparently near the sun," not necessarily</span> physically close to that orb.</span></p>
<p>In conclusion, let us summarize the vital features of these phenomena as they relate to our</span> thesis.</span></p>
<p>Most falls involve only low forms of life, </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">most  of which require water </span></strong>for their environment, or at least a moist
  habitat. Many falls are reported in clear weather from a clear sky, but most are associated</span> with torrential
  downpours of water &ndash; not an ordinary rain. In some cases, isolated and strange-looking</span> clouds are
  responsible, and some of these suddenly appear in otherwise cloudless skies. The</span> descriptions of these storms
  and clouds have an element of similarity and the haunting suggestion arises</span> that these storms and clouds are
  the result of artificial conditions as opposed to ordinary meteorological forces.</span></p>
<p>This does not prove that hydroponic tanks exist for the convenience of our space race; however, whether these tanks
  are for supplies or experimentation, it substantiates our thesis for </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">either </span></strong>a race originally from earth which drove itself to space, </span>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">or a race </span></strong>which originated in space and keeps in touch with earth.</span>
</p>
<p class="MrB">If he has "seen" them, It does not seem</span></strong> that he has managed "clear-talk" with them &amp;
  Mistakes their or its actual meaning<br> Their spoken tongue is rough from Disuse and only a True?"Thinker" could see
  their complete Lingo. Besides, When they are Hungry they Don't "speak" well.</span></strong></p>
