<p>I use the word "shaped" here to mean forming by intelligence.</span></p>
<p>I suggest the following classifications of things that have fallen from the sky:</span></p>
<ol type="A">
  <li type="A">Object unassociated with intelligent action.</span>
    <ol>
      <li>Substances of inorganic nature, shaped or moved by random forces: e.g., inorganic dust, "true meteoritic
        material," etc.</li>

      <li> Miscellaneous objects.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li type="A"> Object associated with intelligent action.</span>
    <ol>
      <li> Symmetrical Objects: wedges, spheres, discs, threads, carvings, works of art, nails; any object</span> not
        obviously the product of the unguided forces of nature.</span></li>
      <li> Objects and substances of organic or functional nature.</span></li>
      <li> Objects, lights, substances, or groups of these, of any kind, which demonstrated motions,</span> control,
        accumulation placing, selection, delimitation, direction, defiance of gravity or other natural forces,</span>
        locomotion, gregariousness, purposefulness, or any dynamic or volitional characteristic not attributable
        to</span> recognized physical forces alone.</span></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>We have to consider some of the utilitarian or functional categories as including items which might be used for food:
  shrimps, periwinkles, snails, etc., or edible substances.</span></p>
<p>Two purposes will be served in this chapter. We will consider shapes and functional things as</span> related to
  intelligence and to falls from space, but will also include gadgets which indicated the extreme</span> antiquity of
  some type of intelligence or intelligent life on earth; and items found in locations and strata</span> where falls
  from space, or space ships, might have placed them.</span></p>
<p>In some of these cases we have to decide between several possible alternatives:</span></p>
<ol type="a">
  <li type="a">Extreme antiquity, attributable to ancient civilizations without space flight;</li>
  <li type="a"> The same, but with space flight developed internally</li>
  <li type="a"> Space flight independent of man on earth, bringing occasional widgets from extraterrestrial</span>
    sectors of intellectual development;</span></li>
  <li type="a"> Falls of items originally on the earth but previously expelled by explosion or other force;</span></li>
  <li type="a"> Falls of items blown off other exploding planets.</li>
</ol>
<p>We cannot forever ignore the immense antiquity of some archaeological items. It is not fashionable with
  archaeological circles, which is anything but an exact science, to admit the existence of</span> culture or rather
  civilization, more remote than that of the historically recorded Egyptians and Orientals:</span> four to seven
  thousand years at most; and heaven forbid if one suggests advanced races in eras of ten,</span> twenty, forty, or one
  hundred thousand years ago. </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">Yet no scientist has found a logical common denominator for the various races, cultures</span></strong>
  , and <span class="MrBUnderlined">civilizations of which we have unmistakable</span></strong> <span
      class="MrBUnderlined">records</span></strong>, except that of a common source predating the Egyptians, the
  Chinese, the Indians (Asiatic), the Incas, and the Mayas, and in fact all branches covered by the study of
  anthropology and ethnology.</span> Much as we may deride writers such as Churchward (as per De Camp; Lost Continents)
  in his rather</span> crude presentation of his hypothesis of the Lost Continent of Mu, his is the only general
  explanation of</span> terrestrial intellectual development and distribution to be advanced which in a broad way
  explains the observed data. Such explanations, however desirable, are ruled out by </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">the fashion of the day </span></strong>
  which decries emphasis on qualitative knowledge in favor of quantitatively investigating the fifth place of</span>
  decimals or other exaggerated refinement of classified knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">Who is Churchward or this DeCamp? Some "Gaiyor"</strong> Baini who guessed
  or knew right???</strong></p>
<p>Because we feel so strongly on this subject, we list some of the obstreperous items which prove</span> that articles
  created by intelligence existed tens or scores of thousands of years ago. These things prove</span> either, or both,
  of two things: there was a vast and advanced civilization on the earth in those distant</span> times; or those
  articles have come here from space, via ships, or from a scattering of debris in space.</span> <span
      class="JemiUnderlined">Anyway you look at it, the arrogant omnipotence of homo sapiens takes a  beating </span></strong>&ndash;
  for our present egotistical state of culture was preceded by another of unfathomable age.</span></p>
<p>If intellectual development is that old, isn't it logical that it may have created a form of flight not yet</span>
  known to our engineers? Let's forget the fifth decimal place &ndash; go back to unity &ndash; to the objective</span>
  assimilation of qualitative data; back to philosophical generalizations and the divination of natural law;</span>
  back, in fact, to the mentality of a Humboldt, a Newton, a Copernicus. Science is starved for such ability,</span>
  more than at any time in the past century.</span></p>
<p>A Dr. Gurlt, in 1877, reported an object found in a tertiary coal bed. In several magazines of that</span> general
  period there were questions from speculative scientific men as to why, if meteors have been</span> encountering the
  earth from remote times, there are no meteorites in tertiary coal deposits. Subsequent</span> finds have answered the
  questions. Well, anyway, this object, incongruous in its carbonaceous</span> environment, is a fossil meteorite. There
  has been much debate, some of it venomous, as to whether it</span> can be more than merely that. The find has been
  placed in the Salzburg Museum, after being taken from</span> a block of coal in Lower Austria.</span></p>
<p>The specimen was examined by many interested persons and scientists, who did not fully agree</span> on its origins.
  Some said that it was a meteorite; some said that it was an artificial production; others</span> remarked that is
  resembled a meteorite modified by the hands of man. (Nobody, so far as I know, ever</span> suggested that modification
  could have been effected through the agency of intelligence </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">other </span></strong>
  than human.)</span></p>
<p>The object is an almost perfect cube, and many examiners consider it </span><span
    class="JemiUnderlined">too </span></strong>geometric in shape to be entirely natural. Two opposite faces are a
  little bit rounded, reducing the size of the other four. A deep</span> incision runs around the cube. The material is
  of a variety conventionally conceded to be meteorite iron</span> and nickel, roughly three by two by two inches. It
  weights 785 grams, has a specific gravity of 7.75, and it</span> is hard as steel, as are all iron-nickel
  aerolites.</span></p>
<p>I can't help thinking of the little stone of Tarbes: </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">are </span></strong>most of
  the things, which come from space of a little more physical delicacy than most of the indigenous items of the same
  types?</span></p>
<p>This cubic meteorite is most disturbing to </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">conservative  science</span></strong>
  <span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">. </span><span class="JemiUnderlined">Its  tertiary age cannot be </span><span
      class="JemiUnderlined">denied</span></strong>, nor its authenticity &ndash; that much is firm. That is, it was
  certainly placed in the coal bed <span class="JemiUnderlined">in tertiary </span><span
      class="JemiUnderlined">times</span></strong>, but <span class="JemiUnderlined">no  one knows how much older it may be</span></strong>
  . Equally firm is its nature as meteoritic iron, nickel and carbon (it is really a form of steel.)</span></p>
<p>The greater puzzle is its geometric shape, including the circumscribed groove, so regularly and</span> doubly
  "artificial" that it seems certainly to have been shaped by hands.</span></p>
<p>"Hands"? Human hands, in the tertiary era? No! say the anthropologists. Extraterrestrial hands,</span> maybe on an
  exploded planet, or blasted off this bedeviled old earth when Mu went up in cosmic glory?</span></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">Hands with 3 fingers &amp; thumb</strong></p>
<p><span class="JemiUnderlined">To uninhibited thinkers</span></strong>, facts <span
    class="MrAUnderlined">remain </span></strong>facts. This specimen is artificially shaped; it is a fossil of tertiary
  coal beds; it is of meteoritic structure and material which even conservative science has</span> reluctantly admitted
  as being from outer space. So this must have been shaped by intelligence either</span> before or after falling, but
  certainly prior to or surely concomitant with the formation of tertiary coal.</span></p>
<p>For our purpose, we do not care whether one says it was fashioned by extraterrestrial hands or terrestrial hands, for
  we are just as much interested in proving the extreme antiquity of civilized man as</span> we are in indicating the
  existence of extraterrestrial intelligence. This obstreperous whickeroo was</span> dropped into an embryonic coal bed,
  either from an indigenous civilization or by an off-shore agency of</span> some kind.</span></p>
<p>If there was civilization in tertiary times &ndash; terrestrial or spatial &ndash; the sequel of intelligence in
  space,</span> then or evolving later from the ground variety, is a quantitative development, and the emergence of
  space</span> travel is inherent in the later case and an almost inevitable emergence in the former.</span></p>
<p>It is recorded in the <em>Annals of Scientific Discovery</em>, 1853-71, that Sir David Brewster had made a</span>
  startling announcement at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1853.</span> He had,
  he said, to call to the attention of the meeting an object of so incredible a nature that nothing</span> short of the
  strongest evidence was necessary to render the statement at all probable. He claimed that a</span> <span
      class="MrBUnderlined">true crystal lens </span></strong>had been found in the treasure house at Nineveh. It is on
  record that many of the temples and treasure houses of old civilizations were in the habit of </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">preserving things which fell </span></strong>from the sky and things which, to these ancient
  peoples, </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">were already antiquities</span></strong><span
      style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">.</span></p>
<p>This egocentric race has been so imbued with its own importance that it cannot believe that</span> optical equipment
  could have evolved in times prior to the Renaissance. We will concede that such items</span> <span
      class="MrBUnderlined">were not in use during the Dark Ages</span></strong>, nor, apparently, during the centuries
  from that period backward to some thousands of years BC. </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">But  such a concession is</span></strong>, in fact, a victory, for it then becomes necessary
  to concede a knowledge of optics some millennia </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">before </span></strong>the <span
      class="MrBUnderlined">incarceration  of this lens at </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">Nineveh. </span></strong>
  And that is a major part of our whole tenet.</p>
<p>In <em>The Microscope and its Revelations</em>, Carpenter presents two drawings of the lens, but he</span> argues
  that it is impossible to accept that optical lenses have ever been made by the ancients. He says</span> the object
  must have been an ornament. Brewster says </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">it was a true optical lens</span></strong><span
      style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">.</span></p>
<p>Then we are right back where we started with the little worked meteorite. If either, or both, of these shameless
  trinkets are indigenous to our planet we must, perforce, accept a civilization with a</span> knowledge of optics,
  predating all presently recorded history.</span></p>

<p class="Jemi" style="text-autospace:none;">MAN SPEAKS FROM GENERAL CONCENSUS.</strong></p>
<p>Wilkins, in <em>Secret Cities of South America</em>, reports the finding of optical lenses and mirrors in a</span>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">submerged city </span></strong>on the coast of Equador, and others in archaic ruins of
  Central America. These appear to be pre-Incan and pre-Andean.</span></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">These Were Muanian in Make</strong></p>
<p>The <em>London Times </em>of February 1, 1888, has reported the finding of a roundish, or ovate, object of</span>
  iron which was found in a garden at Brixton, after a violent thunderstorm on August 7, 1887. It is</span> described as
  an oblate spheroid about two inches across its major axis. An oblate spheroid is the shape</span> generated by an
  ellipse if rotated about its minor axis, and a prolate spheroid is similarly generated by</span> rotation about its
  major axis. A football is shaped something like a prolate spheroid, while a flattish</span> pumpkin or tomato is close
  to being an oblate spheroid.</span></p>
<p>The paper discussed this object at length, while also describing an "iron cannon ball," found in a</span> manure heap
  after a thunderstorm. Both items seem to be too shapely, or symmetrical, to have been</span> created without the aid
  of intelligence. There may be some significance in the fact of their all being small,</span> a couple of inches or so
  in diameter.</span></p>
<p><em>The Scientific American</em>, 1851-52, has the following to say, which is contributory to our theme:
</p>
<p>A few days ago, a powerful blast was made in the rock at Meeting House Hill, in Dorchester, a</span> few rods south
  of Reverend Mr. Hall's meeting house. The blast threw out an immense mass of rock,</span> some of the pieces weighing
  several tons, and scattered small fragments in all directions. Among them</span> was picked up a metallic vessel in
  two parts, rent asunder by the explosion. On putting the two parts</span> together, it formed a bell-shaped vessel,
  four and one-half inches high, six and one-half inches at the</span> base and two and one-half inches at the top, and
  about an eighth of an inch in thickness. The body of this vessel resembles zinc in color, or a </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">composition  material</span></strong>, in which there is a considerable portion of silver.
  On the sides there are six figures of a flower or bouquet, beautifully </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">inlaid </span></strong>with pure silver, and around the lower part of the vessel a vine or
  wreath, </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">inlaid </span></strong>also with silver. The chasing, carving, and inlaying
  are </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">exquisitely done by the  art of some cunning workman</span></strong>. This
  curious and unknown vessel was blown out of the pudding stone fifteen feet below the surface... there is </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">no doubt </span></strong>but <span class="MrBUnderlined">that this </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">curiosity was blown out </span></strong>of the rock as above stated...the matter is worthy
  of investigation, as there is no deception.</span></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">Inlay Work the Mark of Atruscan-Lemurians.</strong></p>
<p>The <em>London Times</em>, for June 22, 1844, reports that some workmen, quarrying rock close to</span> Tweed, not
  far from a place called Rutherford Mills, had discovered a gold thread embedded in the stone</span> at a depth of
  about eight feet. A piece of the gold thread had been forwarded to the office of the <em>Kelso</em></span> <em>Chronicle</em>.
  That is a very simple item, indeed! Just a wee bit of gold thread in solid rock!</p>
<p>Matching the gold thread in interest is something found inside a lump of coal by a Mrs. Culp, at</span>
  Morrisonville, Illinois, in 1891. When the lump of coal for her cooking range fell apart she was startled to</span>
  find embedded in circular fashion, a small gold chain about ten inches long and of quaint workmanship. If</span>
  the </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">cubical Austrian meteorite </span></strong>is not enough to convince you that
  things of intelligent manufacture were falling into coal beds in tertiary times, then surely this one will.</span></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">Cube shaped by Mag. Force compressor.Caused</strong> tremendous Heat, thus
  the regard of it as being a Meteorite.</strong></p>
<p>It is further reported that James Parsons, and his two sons, exhumed a slate wall </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">in a coal mine</span></strong>
  at Hammondville, Ohio, in 1868. </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">It  was a large, smooth wall, disclosed when a great mass of coal</span></strong>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">fell away </span></strong>from it, and on its surface, <span
      class="MrBUnderlined">carved </span></strong>in bold relief, <span class="MrBUnderlined">were several lines of hieroglyphics</span></strong>
  . Nothing further seems to have been reported, and if any reader knows more of this incident the author would</span>
  welcome a report (send care of the publisher) &ndash; perhaps from some local newspaper of that date. This item, at
  least, we will concede was not dropped by space ships. It must represent the work of</span> contemporary, indigenous
  civilization in tertiary times.</span></p>

<p>In the <em>London Times </em>of December 24, 1851, it is stated that a citizen of Springfield,</span> Massachusetts,
  a Mr. Hiram de Witt, had returned from California bringing a chunk of auriferous quartz</span> about as big as a man's
  fist. It was accidentally dropped and broke upon. It had a nail in it. A cut iron</span> nail, about the size of an
  ordinary six-penny nail, a bit corroded, "straight and with a </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">perfect </span></strong>head."</p>
<p class="MrB"> DISCARDED FORCE-CRYSTAL</strong></p>
<p>According to the <em>Reports of the British Association</em>, 1845-51, Sir David Brewster astounded the</span>
  assembled brethren with an account of a nail which was found in a block of stone from Kingoodie Quarry,</span> in
  North Britain. The block of stone was nine inches thick. There was little, if any, evidence as to what</span> part of
  the quarry it came from, except that it could not have come form the surface. The quarry had been</span> worked for
  about twenty years, and consisted of alternate layers of hard stone and a substance called</span> "till." The point of
  the nail extended upward into the till and was badly eaten by rust. Part of the nail lay on the surface of the stone,
  but about an inch, </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">including the head</span></strong>, was embedded in the stone.
</p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">Head imbedded thus could Not have been pounded</strong> in Head first, It
  <em>Would Not go in</em>.</strong></p>
<p>This till intrigues me. Once upon a time I read the book, <em>Raganork </em>, by Ignatius Donnelly, who</span> was a
  U.S. Congressman with time on his hands, and who spent that time in the Library of Congress,</span> making himself one
  of the most literate Congressmen ever to invade Washington. His theme was of</span> Atlantis, and he built up a case
  for this till having been splattered all over the Atlantic hemisphere of the</span> earth by collision with a comet.
  In this splash were transported the erratics of the till which are so</span> annoying to geologists. Maybe this nail
  was one of these erratics.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">The Learned Rep. Was right, save that It was</strong> done by MANY "Comets" in The Great
  War.</strong></p>
<p>Under the title "Mysterious Monoliths," <em>Fate Magazine</em>, March 1950, shows a photograph of some</span>
  spherical sandstone balls which were blasted out of solid rock by a highway crew near Hornbrook,</span> California.
  The balls appear </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">incredibly  ancient</span></strong>. Sandstone balls of nearly
  spherical shape are not especially rare, and they are oblate spheroids which used to be sought after for garden
  ornaments</span> throughout the Middle West. They were called concretions, and were shaped either by the action of
  water or by successive deposits of sand which later solidified, according to geologists. We can believe in</span>
  their natural formation, since the condition in which they were found seem to indicate that this is true. </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">But </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">these balls in California were apparently found in quantity</span></strong>
  , in solid rock. Their symmetry indicates <span class="MrBUnderlined">artificial shaping</span></strong>, they are an
  indication of antiquity, rather than a proof.</p>

<p>W.S. Forest, in <em>Historical Sketches of Norfolk, Virginia</em>, reports the finding of a coin at a depth of</span>
  thirty feet, by well borers, in September, 1833. It was about the size of a shilling and unlike anything seen</span>
  before. Although buried for many centuries, the markings were well preserved, represent a warrior or</span> hunter,
  and had a Roman appearance.</span></p>

<p>burial at very early dates is indicated. A coin described by Donelly is fully discussed in <em>Proceedings
  of</em></span> <em>the American Philosophical Society</em>, and was brought up from a depth of one hundred and twenty
  feet, with the borings of a well in Illinois. The crosses reported in the <em>Smithsonian Institute Reports</em>, 1881
  are</span> puzzling. Looked at in a mirror, some of the inscription resembles Roman numerals, but is not quite</span>
  intelligible. Their appearance is certainly not indicative of anything within everyday experience. They may have been
  dropped from space ships. The alphabetical characters resemble our own to a degree,</span> but are not interpretable
  in any known language. These were found in an ancient grave in the state of</span> Georgia.</span></p>

<p>Some scientists believe that </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">the  Andes have been formed twice</span></strong>,
  and that the last formation was perhaps 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. It probably was farther into the past than that.
  The meteor</span> craters spread across the southwestern United States and down into tropical Mexico have an
  apparent</span> age of 8,000 to 12,000 years. The traditions agree that "Atlantis" or its equivalent, was destroyed
  about</span> 9,000 years or so BC. There are several traditions in several parts of the world that the ancestors
  of</span> some races and tribes were flourishing before the moon existed.</span></p>
<p>A detailed build-up for this antiquity is beyond the scope and ability of this book. Mainly we are</span> interested
  in showing that such an antiquity did exist, and that it is conceivable that some very early race,</span> 200,000
  years ago or so, may have developed space flight, and after the cataclysm of 12,000 years ago</span> may have chosen
  to stay in space, thinking it a safer habitat than this uncertain planet.</span></p>
<p>We offer no proof for this supposition. What we do offer is a set of conditions which might make it</span> possible,
  plus a long series of observations of activity in space which gives every appearance of being the</span> result of
  intelligent direction. Such a hypothesis relieves us of having to assume that the UFO's of today</span> must
  necessarily come from another planet, or another star. We submit that our postulate is an</span> improbability of
  lesser order, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">and  that the growing evidence of the antiquity of mankind, far beyond </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">anything heretofore admitted by science is a contributory factor worthy  of consideration</span></strong>
