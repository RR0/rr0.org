<p>There are many instances of lights, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">clouds </span></strong>or structures which
  <span class="MrAUnderlined">seem to exhibit voluntary or</span></strong> <span class="MrAUnderlined">controlled motions. </span></strong>
  This applies to some isolated freak storms which appear in otherwise undisturbed skies. Some of these storms seem to
  have organic entity. They seem to have many components, including debris of all sorts, and their clouds are apt to be
  of unique shape, density, texture, or color; they may be luminous or contain lights; they often produce extremely
  violent winds and stygian darkness.</span></p>
<p>It is my contention that some of these storms are associated with intelligent action, that they may</span> contain
  navigable structures which may surround themselves with clouds, for purposes of camouflage, or</span> merely through
  natural interaction with the atmosphere. We will try to distinguish between these and the</span> meteoritic
  disturbances proper, some of them very huge indeed, which sometimes appear to share some</span> of their physical
  characteristics.</span></p>
<p>Also, we are going to draw a very fine distinction. We must distinguish between rain and falling</span> water. We are
  going to assume that the rain is falling water, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">but that falling water is not necessarily </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">rain &ndash; </span></strong>at least not as understood by meteorological science.</p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">DEC. 22, California Mysteriously flooded, 1955.</strong></p>
<p>All through our research into the falls of unusual objects from the sky, we frequently encounter</span> the statement
  that these objects fall in a torrential downpour of water, and almost as frequently we find</span> references to
  peculiar cloud formations which do not appear to have their origin based on normal, or at</span> least familiar,
  meteorological conditions &ndash; conditions of weather, that is.</span></p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;"><span class="MrBUnderlined">We hope that you will give very special thought to the world-wide scope  of some of these</span></strong>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">intense and violent storm periods. </span></strong>There are many cases where storms and
  floods which inundated a considerable part of our own country have been almost </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">universal in their action</span></strong>
  <span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">. </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">This tends to hint the</span></strong>
  <span
      class="MrBUnderlined">entrance of the earth into a large cosmic cloud of water and debris  sufficient to deluge </span></strong>
  most of the areas in both northern and southern hemispheres together. The volume of water falling and the concomitants
  of mud, black rain, stones, etc., indicate unity of external origin.</span></p>
<p>There are some cases where the distribution of violence follows restricted belts of terrestrial</span> latitude, so
  that one thinks of the rotation of the earth as </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">carrying successive longitudes into the </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">disturbance.</span></strong></p>
<p>About the middle of September, 1886, water was falling from a cloudless sky, always within an area of twenty-five
  feet square, at Dawson, Georgia, and showers were reported over an area ten feet</span> square at Aiken, South
  Carolina, and at Cheraw, South Carolina, (<em>Charleston News and Courier</em>, October</span> 8, 21, 25, 26). Falls
  of water from a cloudless sky, to a point in Chesterfield County, South Carolina, and</span> falling so heavily that
  streams of it gushed from roof pipes.</span></p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;"><span class="MrAUnderlined">To the honest skeptic</span></strong>, either layman or
  meteorologist, who protests that these events, while not usual, are nevertheless not abnormal nor paranormal, I would
  ask: </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">"Since when are meteorological </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">conditions so stable that water can condense and fall over precisely  delimited areas, over such </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">periods of time?"</span></strong></p>
<p>There is an account from a Dr. Wartmann about water which fell from the sky, at Geneva,</span> Switzerland. It seems
  that there were clouds on the horizon at 9:00 AM, August 9, 1837, but the sky was</span> clear at zenith. It may not
  be startling that some raindrops should fall from a clear sky, but these were</span> large drops of warm water, and
  they fell in such abundance that people were driven to shelter. This kept</span> up for several minutes, and there
  were repeated falls during a period of an hour or so. Warmed, perhaps,</span> by meteoric velocity?</span></p>
<p>Repetition, selection, pinpoint localization, warmth!</span></p>
<p>Not only do we have pinpoint accuracy in these precipitations but there is an obvious tendency for reports of them to
  be restricted to certain general areas.</span></p>
<p>Compare these extremely localized falls of water with the highly delimited falls of other objects,</span> and the
  purity of segregation which is so characteristic of most of the falls which we have noted. It is falls</span> of
  water, of this type, which we believe should be included in the same overall category with ice, stones,</span> live
  organisms, etc., together with the dumpings of water concomitant with the unloading of periwinkles,</span> fish, etc.
  We suggest that intelligence is involved in the obvious selection and placement.</span></p>
<p>As with the case of ice, we believe there are </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">three types of water falling to the ground</span></strong>
  . That class of water which seems to partake of direction and isolation corresponds to the ice, for instance,</span>
  which we postulated to have origin in, on, or with, space navigating objects. We hope it will be apparent</span> that
  cloudburst and the almost solid masses of water know to fall are the counterpart of the large pieces</span> of ice or
  their congregations of "chunk-like" nature: in other words, both the ice and the water are</span> meteoritic. Then we
  have the common variety of meteorologically formed hailstones and rain. To us, there appears a parallelism.</span></p>
<p>It seems, at times, that there is a merging between the space structure, the water and</span> cloudbursts. Here is a
  little item from the <em>New York Tribune </em>of July 3, 1922. For the fourth time within a</span> month, it is said,
  a great volume of water, or a "cloudburst" had poured from one local sky, near</span> Carbondale, Pennsylvania. This
  event, or series of events, has the localization and repetitive qualities</span> which we have learned to associate
  with falls of periwinkles, snails and frogs and other things. </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">In </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">addition </span></strong>it has the almost cataclysmic feature, on a small scale, of the
  impacts of meteoritic masses of water. But in line with our speculation regarding the dumping of hydroponic tanks, we
  find it convenient to</span> link repetitive, highly localized impacts of dense masses of water with the dumpings.
  Sometimes there is</span> animal life in the water; sometimes not. We think that some judgment </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">can be exercised </span></strong>in deciding which of these falls of water are meteoritic
  and which are connected with space contrivances.</span></p>

<p>In <em>Symons Meteorological Magazine</em>, for 1889, it is said that the annual fall of rain, at Norfolk,</span>
  England, is about twenty-nine inches, and that is not a dry or desert locality. But Mr. Symons points out</span> that
  volumes of water up to twenty-four inches fell from May 25,to 28 in New South Wales?and of a</span> deluge much
  greater, thirty-four inches, which engulfed Hong Kong on May 29 and 30. In the United</span> States, </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">one inch of rain a day is a big  fall </span></strong>and two inches is a flood. A <span
      class="MrAUnderlined">normal thunder </span></strong>shower can <span class="MrAUnderlined">bring </span></strong>
  from one-eighth to one-half inch of rain water. Mr. Symons called attention to these two splashes which were a couple
  of thousand miles or more apart, and posed the question of whether they were</span> merely coincidence, but leaving it
  to </span><span style="font-family:Wingdings; font-size:10.0pt; color:#008100; ">zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz </span><span

  on any known basis of meteorological science.</span></p>
<p>This is another example of partial data and partial thinking. Newspapers reported the soak in</span> New South Wales,
  but from their reports: columns of water fell in other places, notable Avoca, in Victoria;</span> Tasmania was
  flooded, its fields gutted with floating rabbits. The <em>Melbourne Argus </em>"explained": a</span> waterspout had
  burst in Victoria. Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales?a whole continent and more &ndash;</span> and Hong Kong. That
  is not local, and bulks of water are not normal. We look for outside help.</span></p>

<p>Let us now follow the startling cases of </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">the  floods </span></strong>of 1913 which
  seriously damaged our Middle Western States but </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">which were practically  world-wide </span></strong>and, for some reason, failed to attract
  much attention from science or to be recognized as a single, complex disturbance. It is especially this sort of</span>
  condition to which we direct your attention. We believe that you should question how such a widespread</span> upheaval
  of our normal meteorological processes could be generated without an encounter with</span> extraterrestrial clouds of
  space matter.</span></p>
<p>In March, 1913, farmers were caught short with their spring planting. People were alarmed and driven from homes?
  March 23, 1913, found the State of Ohio flooded, inundated. Torrents were falling</span> and rivers were out of
  control. The floods at Dayton, Ohio were singularly disastrous and they were the</span> center of attraction in the
  national press. 250,000 people were homeless, many homes were obliterated.</span></p>
<p>Dayton was a shambles of bodies, stalled street cars, snarled traffic, wrecked buildings, and the general flotsam of
  any flood. Dayton got the headlines, I remember them. I was two hundred miles away,</span> on a farm in western
  Indiana. It rained there, too. We couldn't plow the land, much less plant crops.</span> That was the year I got my
  first camera, and I bought a brownie. And one of the very first rolls of film I</span> used was to photograph the tiny
  brook which ran through our pasture. Only it wasn't tiny then, it was a</span> raging torrent and I snapped my sister
  standing by it. The little brooklet had a drainage basin not over a</span> half a mile long, but it was a river that
  day in March. So I remember 1913 and the news from Dayton?</span>the last dispatch: "Dayton in total darkness?no
  power."</span></p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;"><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">Meteorology was not as advanced in 1913 as it is today</span></strong>, but it was a lusty
  infant and weather forecasting was not wholly undeveloped. But there was no warning to farmers about the
  protracted</span> deluge. It surprised the scientists as well as the layman.</span></p>
<p>On March 23, 24, and 25, a watery sky sat on the Catskills and Adirondacks. It slipped and</span> ripped its pants on
  a peak, and rivers invaded the streets of Troy and Albany. Lampposts disappeared</span> and furniture floated against
  the ceilings of rooms. In New Jersey something called a "cloudburst"</span> grabbed factories and made a mess of them,
  cluttering up the nicely laid out streets. There were a</span> thousand dead in Columbus, Ohio, which is close to
  Dayton, and the Delaware River at Trenton was fourteen feet above normal. The Ohio River floods at the slightest
  opportunity?it had a field day. At Parkersburg, West Virginia, people called on their second-story neighbors in
  rowboats. There were lakes in Vermont. Farmers were caught napping in Wisconsin. Destructive floods occurred in
  Illinois and Missouri.</span></p>
<p>By March 27, the meteorologists began to catch up, and the weather bureau was issuing storm warnings (<em>New York
  Tribune</em>, March 28, 1913). Indiana was an inland sea.</span></p>
<p>Waters were falling and freezing on trees in Canada, breaking power lines and telegraph wires and flooding
  powerhouses. Towns were in darkness, listening to crashes of trees heavy with ice. California, two thousand miles from
  Ohio, was drenched; torrents were falling in Washington and Oregon. Texas should be warm, maybe hot, in latter March;
  there were unprecedented snows, as also in New Mexico and Oklahoma. Alabama was inundated; Florida flooded.</span></p>
<p>Deluges in France. All Europe was wet. Not much sunny evaporation there. In Spain, near Valencia, there was a
  hailstorm: trains were stalled by unusually large hailstones, piles three feet deep.</span></p>
<p>South Africa is practically antipodal to our Midwest; there were watery fists from the skies of Colesburg,
  Murraysburg, and Prieska, and one of these bulks was the equivalent of one-tenth of the total normal rainfall of South
  Africa for a whole year!</span></p>
<p>Summer in the South American Andes? Maybe, but snow was covering them two months ahead of schedule?and in the jungles
  of Paraguay people were dispersing in panic from flooded rivers. The Uruguay River was rising?governments were rushing
  supplies and equipment to thousands of starving, homeless people.</span></p>
<p>The Fiji Islands were drenched and Tasmania was under water. On March 22, the day before the catastrophe in Ohio and
  four neighboring States, there began a series of great thunderstorms in Australia; a "rain blizzard" in New South
  Wales, in Queensland all transportation was tied up.</span></p>
<p>According to the <em>Wellington Evening Post</em>, of New Zealand, March 31, there was "the greatest disaster in the
  history of the colony&quot;; where there had been listless rivers there were unruly torrents embellished with the
  woolly bodies of sheep and the accouterments of farming. The roar of rivers was the cry of drowning and cattle. Store
  windows were smashed; dead bodies were wrapped in silk curtains from the red-light district.</span></p>
<p>May, 1889: There was a spectacular "afterglow" in France although no volcanic eruptions had occurred to fill the air
  with dust?and storms everywhere had supposedly cleared the murky air. There was a red rain in Cardiff, Wales, and red
  dust fell on the island of Hyeres, off the coast of France. An unknown substance fell for several hours from the sky
  at St. Louis, crystalline particles, some pink and some white. Fine dust fell in Dakota: looked like a
  snowstorm. </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">In Greece there was a monstrous </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">debacle </span></strong>
  and <span class="MrAUnderlined">the  rivers choked with cattle</span></strong>. The Bahama Islands were on a spree of
  water. A downpour was described by a newspaper on St. Helena. A drought occurred in British Honduras, followed by
  heavy rains, June 1 and 2. Floods raged in California, Ceylon, Cuba; cities and plantations of Mexico were raped by
  deluges.</span></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">All in certain Range of Latitude.</strong></p>
<p>Deluges and falls of lumps of ice throughout England. France deluged. Water dropped from the</span> sky in
  Switzerland, flooding some streets five feet deep. It was not rain: there were falling columns of</span> water from
  what was thought to be a waterspout. "Bulks Dropped! and one of them was watched?or</span> some kind of a vast,
  vaporous cow sailed over the town, and people looked up at her bag of water.</span> Something that was described as a
  large body of water was seen at Coburg, Ontario. It crossed the</span> town, </span><span class="JemiUnderlined">holding its baglike formation</span></strong>
  . When it broke, it splashed rivers that broke all dams between Coburg and Lake Ontario. In the <em>Toronto Globe</em>,
  June 3, this falling bulk is </span><span class="JemiUnderlined">called </span></strong>a waterspout. Fall of a
  similar bulk was noted in Switzerland and Saxony." (Quoted from The Books of <a
      href="/people/f/FortCharles/FortCharlesHoy.html">Charles Fort</a>.)</span></p>
<p>One can find plenty of other references to concentrated, local cloudbursts. They are all of a</span> pattern: solid
  masses of water flooding small demarcated areas, causing local floods and flash flash</span> floods. One was observed
  in France, yet two miles away, dry land.</span></p>
<p class="Jemi" style="text-autospace:none;">These are what we may call single, or isolated slugs of meteoric
  water.</strong></p>
<p>What can account for these erratics?</span></p>
<p>Surely, here is proof of intelligence, or selectivity and regularity of a sort which must be attributed to something
  in space.</span></p>
