<p>Many of these singular objects which are known to have fallen with storms come from storms</span> having some
  peculiarity. Sometimes the only notation is that the storms were of unusual violence, but</span> even then there is
  something, perhaps of statistical significance. These small, you might say</span> independent, storms sometimes seem
  to have causes other than the accepted meteorological conditions.</span> They are quick, tempestuous, sometimes
  luminous; frequently with geometrically defined clouds of rare</span> and striking colors. They often appear suddenly
  in clear skies.</span></p>
<p>As in the instances of some other phenomena, there appear to be three classes of clouds. The</span> first, and most
  common, of course, are the ordinary meteorological or "weather" clouds. Everybody sees</span> them by the million.
  Then there are clouds that seem to come from, at least be connected with outer</span> space. These, we can sort into
  two broad categories, although there may be some merging of one into</span> the other. Of these, the small, peculiarly
  formed, and sometimes startlingly colored, are the more difficult</span> to define and the rarest in literary
  descriptions. They are often noted only by a casual phrase in passing, in connection with hailstorms, earthquakes, and
  sudden violent disturbances of the air; or in some other</span> way they call themselves to the attention of observers
  whose most urgent interest lies in the more forceful</span> physical aspects which may endanger him, or his crops,
  animals and home. It is seldom that anyone has</span> the time or opportunity of observing such clouds </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">carefully</span></strong>, and even more rarely does he make notes.</p>
<p class="note">ED: The following has no obvious reference or necessary position.</span></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">1955, 9 Hurricaines (sic) Where they never <em>were </em>before &amp; all of
  a sudden, too</strong></p>
<p>The other category of clouds, or storms, of seemingly cosmic nature, are larger sometimes we</span> think they may be
  larger than the earth itself, and in the case of dusts or mists they may be very much</span> larger. They seem to
  cause all sorts of widespread trouble and disturbance, either directly or by generally</span> upsetting the earth's
  meteorological balance. They may cause discoloration of the sun for considerable</span> periods; or diminution in its
  light, with ensuing darkness; or very cold weather, such as the extremes of</span> the winter of 1882-83, when space
  around the earth seemed to be replete with clouds of spatial debris.</span></p>
<p>They may bring floods to the whole earth, simultaneously, they do not always seem to be wholly</span> vaporous, and
  there are some which are certainly made up of debris, dust, water, stones, ice, etc.</span></p>
<p>It seems impossible to organize a firm classification from data not at hand. There are apparently</span> mergings or
  blendings of each type into the others. We will describe and list some of them. Maybe</span> something will work out
  as we go along.</span></p>
<p>1697: A horrid black cloud, attended by frequent lightnings, was precursor of a violent hailstorm.</span> Animals
  were killed, crops ruined, and people had their heads broken. The breadth of the cloud was</span> about two miles. The
  hailstones were some round, some semispherical and others were embossed and</span> crenulated like the foot of a
  drinking glass, the ice being very transparent and hard.</span></p>
<p>1812: The latest remarkable fall of aerolites in Europe, of which there is a distinct account, was in the vicinity of
  Laigle, Normandy, early in the afternoon of April 26. A fiery globe of a very brilliant</span> splendor, which moved
  in the air with great rapidity, was followed in a few seconds by a violent explosion</span> which lasted five or six
  minutes and was heard for thirty leagues in all directions. Three or four reports</span> like those of a cannon were
  followed by discharge resembling musketry fire, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">after which a dreadful </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">rumbling was heard like the beating of a HUGE </span></strong>drum. The air was calm and the
  sky serene with the exception of a few clouds such as are frequently observed. The noise proceeded from a small cloud
  of</span> rectangular form, the largest side being in a direction from east to west. It appeared motionless all
  the</span> time the phenomenon lasted, but the vapor of which it was composed was projected momentarily from</span>
  the different sides by the effect of the different explosions. The cloud was about half a league to the</span>
  northeast of Laigle, and was at so great an altitude that the inhabitants of two hamlets a league apart saw it
  directly overhead. A multitude of meteoric stones fell amid a hissing sound.</span></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">Thunderbird, Dragon of Lao Fzu, p. 27, Saucer,</strong> ALL the same thing,
  all Rumble when "Hit" Hard or When in Need of Repairs.</strong></p>
<p>The shape of that "cloud" is important. It seems to be the only sure clue that this could be</span> anything more
  than an ordinary exploding meteor. Rectangular clouds do not just happen. They almost</span> certainly have to be
  made. And the cloud appeared to be motionless. Meteors do not remain Motionless.</span> The clouds which they usually
  provoke are not capable of sustaining the heavy meteoritic material inside,</span> should the whole complex become
  immobile. So this cloud was certainly not of ordinary meteorological</span> origin, and seems to partake of
  artificiality. Also, a stationary state is indicative of control.</span></p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;"><span class="MrAUnderlined">There is something of the incongruous in meteors which exit from clouds,  especially</span></strong>
  <span class="MrAUnderlined">clouds of such peculiar formation that they do not associate easily with  the common variety of</span></strong>
  <span class="MrAUnderlined">weather clouds. </span></strong>Maybe that seems to be a rather remarkable statement. But
  if a meteor is moving through the atmosphere at a rate of ten to twenty miles per second there is not much time for
  clouds to</span> form ahead of it. A cloud train behind the meteor would require little in the way of
  explanation, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">but, under </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">such circumstances, how do we form a cloud in time for the meteor to  emerge from it; </span></strong>
  why does the cloud suddenly and sharply stop moving while the meteor passes onward; </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">why, in short, does there </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">seem to be a slight difference between the usual meteors and those which  emerge from clouds?</span></strong>
</p>
<p>We quote the following from <em>Observatory</em>, 1877, a popular British astronomical monthly of</span> competence
  and reliability:</span></p>
<p>? the meteor was seen by J. Plant, Esquire, F.O.S., at Salford, and is described by him as</span> bursting from an
  intensely lit cloud, like a ball of silver quite as large as the moon. The explosion was</span> remarkable, a whirling
  shower of pear-drop (sic) stars?ruby, blue, white and yellow?radiating from the</span> center mass, the colors being
  quite brilliant. The meteor was seen about three seconds before the</span> explosion.</span></p>
<p>The meteor itself may be only casually interesting, although its colors may be unusual and may hold some interest for
  students of meteoritics. </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">What is of interest to </span></strong>us <span
      class="MrAUnderlined">is the cloud</span></strong>, which seems to have </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">preceded the meteor instead of  following it</span></strong>
  , and especially, to have been illuminated or <span class="MrAUnderlined">self-luminous.</span></strong></p>
<p>Many are the report of meteors emerging from clouds, as in 1808: "?such a phenomenon as</span> appeared at Siena in
  1794, when stones descended, not from a moving meteor, but from a luminous</span> cloud?"</span></p>
<p>A yellow cloud appeared over Paderborn, from which came a torrential rain and a shower of</span> mussels; the
  triangular cloud with a tail, whose red nucleus exploded; February 13, 1901, greenish-yellow</span> clouds appeared in
  France, spreading "intensest darkness&quot;; people froze to death in </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">Naples </span></strong>that night.</p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">Naples in Southernmost Italy.</strong></p>
<p>Did something bring in the cold of outer space?</span></p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;"><em>The Journal of Royal Meteorological Society </em>contains some extracts from the
  Captain's log, of the ship Lady of the Lake, Captain F.W. Banner. On March 22, 1870 position 5° 47' N. Lat., 27° 52'
  W.</span> Longitude, the crew observed a remarkable cloud in the sky. It </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">was a cloud with a circular form </span></strong>
  which <span class="MrAUnderlined">enclosed a semicircle divided into four parts</span></strong>, the central dividing
  line (cord, bar, partition or what?) starting at the center of the circle, and extending far beyond the limits of the
  structure, then curving</span> backward, like a hook.</span></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">NO CLOUD EVER SHAPED BY WIND COULD EVER TAKE THIS SHAPE, NOHOW, IN
  NATURE</strong></p>
<p>This cloud had geometric shape, and a mechanical complexity. In fact it had an </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">organic</span></strong>
  , or an artificial form.</span></p>
<p>Thompson says: "In August and September, 1831, there was an anomalous brightness in the</span> sky and small print
  was visible at midnight?the barometer fell, the sun was of a silvery whiteness and</span> storms were general in
  Europe and the West Indies."</span></p>
<p>W.S. Forest says: "Citizens were much surprised on the morning of August 13, 1831, by the</span> strange appearance
  of the sun. The sun's disc seemed on rising, to have changed from its usual golden</span> color to a pale, greenish
  tent which soon gave way to cerule blue and this to a silvery white. In the</span> afternoon the sun appeared like an
  immense plane of polished silver and to the naked eye there was</span> exhibited an appearance on the surface termed a
  black spot. The sun shone with a dull gloomy light, and</span> the atmosphere was moist and heavy."</span></p>
<p>These two passages, one written in England, the other in Virginia, will serve to indicate the</span> vastness of this
  condition and nature of it.</span></p>
<p>Many sources mention frequent cases of darkness and obscuration of the sun. There is, in this</span> darkness and
  "cold days," the blending of terrestrial and cosmic clouds. We will have other occasions to</span> mention cosmic
  clouds, in connection with things astronomers have seen in space. For now, it is enough</span> to say that when these
  clouds contact the earth, we have dust, gas, obscuration, darkness, cold and</span> meteorological disturbances in
  general; a blending of meteoritic and meteorological conditions.</span></p>
<p>According to the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, January 7, 1892, a </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">fiery </span></strong><span
    style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">blast </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">shot  across the State of </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">Georgia, </span></strong>on the previous June 5th described as "a black tornado, <span
    class="MrAUnderlined">filled </span></strong>with fire." About this time there were earthquake shocks in Italy,
  approximately the same geographical latitude; people in New York State</span> were watching a glare in the sky and
  shocks were felt. On June 8th, dust fell from the sky in northern</span> Indiana. Quakes followed around the world for
  several days. Snow fell in Mobile, which is certainly an indication that the storm may have brought materials from the
  cold of outer space. There was a tidal</span> wave in the Atlantic, and there were shocks at Memphis, Tennessee, on
  June 14. There was a tidal wave</span> in Lake Michigan on June 18. A mass of fire fell from the sky on the 20th, on a
  town in Massachusetts. At</span> the same time quakes occurred in Italy and France. On the 24th, a great meteor shot
  over Cape Town. Durango, Mexico had its first rain in four years. Glare in the sky alarmed Germans on the
  26th. </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">In</span></strong> <span class="MrAUnderlined">England, people watched a luminous cloud at night</span></strong>
  . Quakes were reported in Tasmania and Australia.</span></p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;"><em>Meteor from an organic cloud, seen by J. Plant, F.S.S., Salford, England, November
  23, 1877 - - t </em><em>The first year of the "Incredible Decade."</em></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">SMALL BATTLE</strong></p>
<p>Why recite all those things? Why imply a relationship? Because it is a part of our present</span> purpose to indicate
  that earthquakes and local storms may be engendered by huge masses of space</span> material passing close to the
  terrestrial surface.</span></p>
<p>That storm across Georgia, from the phrase, "A black tornado, filled with fire," does not have to</span> be
  considered extranormal just from that description. Tornadoes are black, and they often involve brilliant</span> and
  vicious </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">displays </span></strong>of electrics. on OUTER EDGES, NOT IN MIDDLE "FILL"
  It is the concomitants which cause us to wonder. The events which we mentioned spread over a rather long time to be in
  any</span> way connected with one local storm, but there does seem to be a family resemblance, and there are many such
  examples. Yet in view of the concomitants, and since we do not have a definite statement that the storm was a twister,
  the term, tornado, being frequently used loosely, we wonder if there were</span> extensive gravitational
  irregularities, or if something was made to surge through our lower atmosphere,</span> thereby creating a vehement
  black cloud, filled with fire, which was only a detail in a world-wide melee.</span> Could we have had the close
  approach of a vast scattering of space debris, through which the earth</span> passed during a period of several days,
  and from which we had meteorites, water, dust, cold, etc., and</span> disruption of the normal meteorological
  processes over most of our globe, not to speak of seismic upheavals on a wide scale?</span></p>
<p>The instances of apparent association between clouds, meteors, and quakes are many. It seems like stretching things
  too far to claim that all are merely coincidence.</span></p>
<p>For four hours, in the wake of the Georgia storm, on January 8, dust fell on northern Indiana?no records of such in
  between. Research fails to disclose any volcanic action to put dust into the air, and if it did, what of the
  intervening places? There was no dust bowl in Georgia, and besides this storm, as is general, was moving eastward, not
  northward. From the western deserts?a long way to carry a heavy fall of dust without dropping noticeable amounts!
  Could it be that the dust was not from Georgia's tornado, but from the common cause of both?</span></p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;"><span class="MrAUnderlined">Time after time </span></strong>it seems that <span
    class="MrAUnderlined">isolated clouds, of a singular appearance</span></strong>, approach the earth's
  surface, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">yet remain suspended in flight</span></strong>. To be sustained by
  velocity they would have to move with the speed of escape, around six and one-half miles per second, which they
  obviously are not doing. Since they apparently bring with them a considerable amount of space debris, they are
  indicated to have celestial origin rather than arising from the earth's surface.</span></p>
<p>It is our suggestion that some of the singular, or disassociated clouds, contain camouflaged,</span> navigable space
  contraptions, or they are dirigible space widgets, guided and directed by intelligence.</span></p>
<p>Again we close with an arresting quotation. Bearing our theories in mind, consider the following</span> contribution
  from John P. Bessor to <em>Fate</em>, March, 1954:</span></p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;"><strong><q>The Battle of the Clouds</q></strong><q>: On July 28th, 1874, the little
  community of Saw Mill Run, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, met with disaster from a most singular phenomenon. Curious
  villagers and</span> country folk looked at the sky and beheld something very strange. Over the northeastern horizon,
  slowly</span> and majestically, sailed a black cloud </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">ringed  with a scarlet belt</span></strong>; and over the southwest horizon slowly
  sailed </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">another black cloud</span></strong>?with a scarlet belt.</q></p>
<p>Onward they came towards each other, like two men-of-war approaching the scene of battle. As</span> they drew nearer,
  they discharged flashes of lighting, and the whole effect was that of an eerie sea battle</span> high in the
  air.</span></p>
<p>Nearer and nearer they drew, the violence of the flashes of lightning increasing the closer they</span> approached,
  until, with one great flash, they collided, and rain fell in torrents. One hundred and fifty</span> persons drowned
  and it is believed to be the most disastrous flood ever to befall that section of the</span> country.</span></p>
