<p>These few chapters of observational material show that space contains a much greater amount</span> and variety of
  material scattered between planets than most of us, including the astronomers, have</span> known. Before true meteoric
  material (the now well-known iron and stone meteorities) were scientifically</span> accepted there had to be
  innumerable cases where meteorites were truly seen to fall. These were</span> collected by authoritative witnesses.
  That these meteorites had been identified by their testure and</span> chemical elements, as well as their external
  appearance, was </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">not enough to overcome bigotry</span></strong>, and <span
      class="MrAUnderlined">more than one French scientist had to risk his professional standing  before the Academy in Paris</span></strong>
  <span class="MrAUnderlined">ere it was accepted by science that iron and stone did fall from the sky</span></strong>.
  This <span class="MrAUnderlined">controversy was</span></strong> <span
      class="MrAUnderlined">raging as recently </span></strong>as one hundred and fifty years ago, in spite of firm
  demonstrations by some isolated scientific observers one or two hundred years previously, and there were still
  holdouts until the end of the 19th century. So firm is astronomy in its entrenched dogma, that there are still some
  respected men who</span> dispute that the Arizona meteor crater is meteoric in origin, or that the Carolina Bays were
  caused by</span> anything but mysteriously formed whirlpools.</span></p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, when we learn that among the vast amount of material that has</span> fallen from the
  sky, </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">sulfur is present</span></strong>. But it cannot fall from the sky because it
  isn't in the sky! But it does!</span></p>
<p>1868: A mass of burning sulfur about the size of a man's fist fell at Pultusk, Poland, on January</span> 30. It fell
  upon a road and was stomped out by several villagers.</span></p>
<p>Inflammable objects falling from space may well account for the many reports of falling "fire," from</span> which no
  tangible debris is found; and since such material is of low specific gravity, its velocity is speedily</span> checked
  by atmospheric friction, and it can fall slowly, burning the while, and thus, perhaps, give rise to</span> some of the
  reports of </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">large appearing </span></strong>slowly moving <span

<p>There was a staggering fall of dust and mud in Europe in February 1903. It seems that southern</span> England was
  quite a dumping ground, although some scientists thought the dust cam from lanes and</span> byways of the local
  shires. They hadn't heard that it also covered the Canary Islands. The substance</span> contained a sizable percentage
  of organic matter, and was, of course, identified by some as sand from</span> the Sahara Desert. It covered Ireland,
  England, and the Canaries. It was reported on the 27th in</span> Belgium, Holland, Germany, and Austria. Ten million
  tons fell on south England alone! A vessel reported the stuff falling midway between England and Barbados. It fell in
  Switzerland, according to <em>Symons'</em></span> <em>Meteorological Magazine</em>, of March, 1903. It fell in Russia.
  Not only did Australia get covered with this stuff in November 1902; it was falling there again in February &ndash;
  enormously?fifty tons per square mile of</span> red mud.</span></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">-RESULT OF L-M'S "HOME ON MOON" being built.</strong></p>
<p>This stuff was variously said to be like brick dust, buff colored, or light brown, chocolate colored</span> and silky
  to touch, and slightly iridescent, gray; red-rust colored; quite red, yellowish brown, tinged with</span>
  pink.</span></p>
<p>I do not believe these falls of mud on earth indicate life in space, unless in very indirect ways,</span> obscurely,
  and deviously. But there is definitely, here, an indication of dust in the space proximate to the</span> earth, or in
  orbits intersecting our orbit. It seems more and more inescapable that there are immense</span> amounts of material of
  almost every fanciable type. That such unaccountable millions of tons of red dust</span> composed of a high percentage
  of organic matter could be whirled aloft from the Sahara, or any desert,</span> and disseminated to such scattered
  areas, is an incomprehensibility far more durable than that of orbital</span> existence in space &ndash; and we have
  to assume clouds of something in space to account for the disturbance of comets' tails, and for the temporary
  disappearance of comets, as for instance the great comet of 1882.</span></p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;"><span class="MrAUnderlined">It is therefore, my contention that these falls of mud originate in  space</span></strong>
  , and that such clouds of dust are a normal part of space debris. Whether they come from the explosion producing
  the</span> asteroids, or from </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">an atom explosion </span></strong>which hoisted Mu
  into the firmament and into eternity, is beyond or ability to ascertain.</span></p>
<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">NOT ATOMIC, Was sudden, broad inerse snap of stasis</strong><span
    style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">.</span></p>
<p>It is our stand that, if there is such diversity and quantity of material in vicinal space, then there is</span>
  room, and perhaps sustenance of a sort, for intelligence and intelligently manipulated space ships.</span></p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;"><span class="MrBUnderlined">It is equally our contention, that, if all of this dispersed, but  tangible, array of assorted</span></strong>
  <span
      class="MrBUnderlined">items can exist in nearby space, or in orbits intersecting that of the  earth, and </span></strong>
  <span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">if </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">all  of these things</span></strong>
  (except the conventional iron and stone meteorites) </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">can have escaped the cognizance of science for such a long time, </span></strong>
  even though falling to earth in considerable quantity<span
      class="MrBUnderlined">, then there is no reason  why</span></strong> <span class="MrBUnderlined">intelligently operated contrivances cannot also be in the same celestial  regions</span></strong>
  , and have escaped our attention, in spite of </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">visiting </span></strong>our
  atmosphere <span class="MrBUnderlined">frequently.</span></strong></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">VISITING! They Live here &amp; Work here &amp; build Here but fortunately
  all undersea</strong><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:black; ">.</span></p>
<p>To list but a few of some of the other materials reported: ashes, sand, algae, iron, gelatinous</span> matter, seeds,
  red edible stuff, mud, dust, powder, vegetable matter, white substance, soot, coke,</span> charcoal, coal, earthy
  matter, soft substance, wedge shapes, black rain, colored rain.</span></p>
<p>Add these things to the stone, ice, water, organic matter, living organisms, gadgets, gold thread, etc., and you have
  three possible explanations: the surface debris of an exploded planet, the surface</span> debris of a continent
  blasted off the earth, or the rubbish of a space life of vast extent and unspeakable</span> age; perhaps also,
  curiosity, a trait of intelligence.</span></p>
<p>I believe it substantiates a "space life" of some sort. Space being cluttered with such a vast</span> amount of
  debris, sparsely scattered, but of all types and enormous in the aggregate, it is sufficient to</span> supply many of
  the needs of space life. You will note that throughout our enumeration of "falls," our</span> theme has been that
  there seem to be two types of arrivals from outer space: those which are moving in</span> highly elliptical meteoric
  orbits (true space debris, that is), and those which seem to be, or have been,</span> associated with intelligence.
  There may well be some overlapping for some of the intelligences may be moving in such orbits, especially if it should
  develop that some of them are associated with the great</span> comets such as those of 1880-81-82. In its simplest
  form, then, our idea is that the </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">least objectionable </span><span
      class="MrAUnderlined">explanation for these falls is that they come from intelligently  operated space craft, </span></strong>
  or are in some way formed, guided, or influenced by the operators of such craft. We base this on characteristics
  of</span> shape, texture, functionality, delimited and localized distribution, timing, repetition, location in places
  inaccessible to modern man; and on the purely negative deduction that they could not have happened through any
  commonly accepted chain of casual conditions.</span></p>
<p>Such a cause or, such a common denominator does appear to exist in the contemplation of</span> space flight or space
  navigation, to put it more simply, in space life. This appears to be the least</span> improbable causal factor in
  sight at this time. Also, there appears to be </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">ample observational proof </span></strong>for this view since 1947.</span></p>
<p>I believe that space between the earth and the moon is occupied, however thinly, by large</span> navigable
  constructions of a rigid nature, whose size may range from one to many miles in diameter, and</span> which have a
  planetary appearance as seen in telescopes. These sometimes come close to the earth.</span> There are other bodies
  which seem to be of a cloudlike nature, which cast shadows on both earth &amp;</span> moon, and; which may range the
  entire solar system accompanying comets. These also, or </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">their smaller</span></strong> <span class="MrBUnderlined">components</span></strong>,
  sometimes approach the earth. All of these objects evince evidences of control by intelligence, as do the more
  recently sighted UFO's.</span></p>
<p>Smaller <span class="MrAUnderlined">"scouts or operators," </span>which are probably inhabitants of, or associates,
  of the great spherical contraptions, are constantly seen in earth's atmosphere. They are of many types, and in
  fact </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">it </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">does seem </span></strong>that many of
  them have the ability to change shape. They <span class="MrBUnderlined">seem to be of two  sorts: the </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">solid or material, </span></strong>and <span
      class="MrBUnderlined">the massless or ethereal</span></strong>. All exhibit elements of control, but the
  weightless ones seem more to have the appearance of remote control. Solid types tend to be discoid or to be spherical
  or</span> spindle shaped, and these shapes, in themselves, </span><span style="color:red; ">are indicative of intelligent construction</span><span
