<p>In all these discussions, <span class="MrBUnderlined">one thing</span> seems to be <span class="MrBUnderlined">outstanding </span>as
  a common denominator.</span></p>
<p>All of the aerial or spatial contrivances and gadgets which we have postulated appear to have one feature in common:
  they have their natural habitat in space, or at very least in the atmosphere. There is no sure record of an appearance
  on the ground, and few indications. </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">Appearances from</span></strong>, or </span>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">disappearances </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">into, </span></strong>the sea indicate
  only </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">an ability to make use of the fluid medium of seawater</span></strong>, when
  necessary or desirable. This leads to an assumption that UFO's live naturally and easily in space; that they do not
  necessarily come from other stellar systems, or even from other planets.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">No. Not Easily<br> The "Little-Men" are known to have GILLS<br> Just as all Men before birth, have gills,
  too.</p>
<p>After considering that the space structures or UFO's spend most of their time in line between earth and the sun, it
  has been suggested that some of the ancient Sun worship may have originated in</span> the condition that some god-like
  beings may have come from UFO's which were said to be "in the Sun,"</span> because of this alignment of the neutral,
  and that perhaps the "death boats" for celestial flight which were</span> buried with the Egyptian kings may have been
  <span class="MrAUnderlined">symbolic  of the UFO flight XXXXXX</span>. Perhaps some of these traditions were
  fragmentary memories from the first wave of civilization. In fact there are several very ancient traditions which can
  be at least partially accounted for </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">by </span></strong>our common denominator of
  life in and from space.</span></p>
<p>For emphasis, and for the establishment of present principles, we repeat that it <span class="MrAUnderlined">is relatively unimportant whether we decide that civilization was brought to us from  space</span>,
  perhaps from the</span>exploded planet between Mars and Jupiter, <span class="MrAUnderlined">or  whether it reached space from terrestrial development in a previous upsurge of civilization. </span></strong>
  Such relics as the Great Pyramid indicate the advancement of</span> that age, and it is perhaps a little less strain
  on our sensibilities to assume that space life, especially if</span> limited to the earth-moon system, originated on
  earth. </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">Our two greatest mental hazards at themoment </span></strong><strong><span
      style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:red; ">are to overcome the blows  to our racial ego</span></strong>, </span>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">and to free ourselves from the idea that UFO's and space life now reaching our cognizance necessarily come from a  planet</span></strong>
  . Their</span> presence in near-by space regions is improbability of lesser order and has little about it which is
  difficult of acceptance.</span><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:red; ">(Red is </span><span

<p>There </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">is much </span></strong>to make us believe that this extraordinary thing
  which we call civilization today is nothing but flickering flamelets rekindled from almost extinct embers of
  civilization, <span class="MrAUnderlined">the antiquity of which is undreamed of by modern archaeologists.</span></p>
<p class="MrB">The Man is Right, So What</strong>.</span></p>
<p>The Hawaiians claim to have known about flying saucers for 1,000 years, and even to have a name for them: Akualele,
  or flying spirits. They describe these flying spirits as appearing in many shapes</span> and colors just as they are
  sighted today?the balls of fire. cones and saucer-shaped discs.</span></p>
<p>From this it is an easy jump to an obscure, but reliably documented case from England, A.D.</span> 1290. It is one of
  the best reports on things in space that we call UFO's.</span></p>
<p>A Mr. A.X. Chumley, a British scholar, recently found a Latin document at Byland Abbey, in</span> Yorkshire,
  describing a strange aerial object that terrified the monks in A.D. 1290. The document refers</span> to a "Round,
  flat, silver object </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">called </span></strong>a discus which flew over the monastery
  exciting maximum terrorem among the brethren."</span></p>

  realty.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to lead you still farther back in time &ndash; to the threshold of human
  intelligence, in a wave of civilization covering the world before the flood. If we discover that no matter how far we
  push the periphery of our quest, we still find a ready-made civilization &ndash; we have to admit human intellectual
  antiquity of (to us) fantastic and unbelievable vastness. Could this mean that civilization was planted here, within
  the species of animal selected by some superintelligence as most fit to develop culture? Could these superfolk be
  space dwellers? Could they be tending us as sheep are tended? Are we actually owned? Could the UFO's be their abode?
  Or perhaps their supervisors, shepherds? Could it be that the saucers, in their whimsical variety, are the space
  dwellers &ndash; the intelligences?</span></p>

<p>In 1809 a Mr. Stavely, in London, saw many bright specks of light moving around the edge of a black cloud. The lights
  played around for an hour, and one of them became as large and bright as</span> Venus, moving with great speed around
  the cloud; later it became stationary, lost its brilliance and finally</span> disappeared. There was no lightning, and
  the altitude of the lights seemed variable.</span></p>

<p>In the early winter of 1387, a fire in the sky was seen many times, like </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">a burning and revolving wheel</span>,

<p>This weird report is dated AD 1322. In the first hour of the night of November 4, after 7:00 PM, there was seen in
  the sky over Uxbridge, England, a pillar of fire of the size of a small boat, pallid and livid in color. It rose from
  the south, crossed the sky with a slow and grave motion, and went northward. Out</span> of the front of the pile of
  fervent </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">red  flame burst forth with great beams of light</span></strong>?many

  out, but while the air was clear, serene and shining, a great star appeared. It was like a torch, rising from the
  south, and flying </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">on both sides </span></strong>of it there </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">was emitted </span></strong>in the height of the sky <span class="MrBUnderlined">a very great light</span></strong>

<p>Now let us consider the hieroglyphs from an Egyptian papyrus, together with a translation by Boris de Rachewiltz. De
  Rachewiltz says that the original is a part of the Royal Annals of the times of</span> Thutmose III, circa 1504-1450
  BC, and that the original is in bad condition. Parts were too obliterated for</span> translation.</span></p>
<p>In the year 22, third month of winter, sixth hour of the day (..2..) The scribas of the House of Life found it was a
  circle of fire that was coming in the sky. (though) it had no head, the breath of its mouth (<span
      class="MrAUnderlined">had</span></strong>) <span class="MrAUnderlined">a foul odor</span></strong>. Its body one
  'rod' long and one 'rod' large. <span class="MrAUnderlined">It  had no voice</span></strong>. Their hearts became
  confused through it: then they laid themselves on their bellies (..3..) They went to the King..? to report it.</span>
</p>
<p>His Majesty ordered (..4..) has been examined (..5..) as to all which is written in the papyrus rolls of the House of
  Life His Majesty was meditating upon what happened. Now, after some days had passed over those things, Lo! <span
      class="MrAUnderlined">They were more  numerous than "anything" </span></strong>They were <span
      class="MrAUnderlined">shining in the sky more than the Sun to the limits of the four supports of heaven </span></strong>
  (..6..) Powerful was the position of the fire circles. The army of the King looked on and His Majesty was in the midst
  of it. It was after supper.</span></p>
<p>Thereupon they (the fire circles) went up higher directed to the south. Fishes and volatiles fell down from the sky.
  (it was ) a marvel never occurred since the foundation of this land. Caused His Majesty to brought incense to pacify
  the hearth (..9..) (to write?) what happened in the ook of the House of Life (..10..) (to be remembered?) for the
  Eternity.</span></p>
<p class="MrA">ole TITMOUSE SAW "The Great Return: a Story you know very Well.</p>
<p class="MrA">He saw Group "Coat" Burnings of Whole Convey.</p>
<p class="MrA">in Great Return, one ship payed-call in Titmouses towns peopole (sic), was Honored &amp; received
  Graciously, even if at first somewhat fearfully, Like sun Worshipers the World over.</p>
<p>To this added the following comment from the translator:</span></p>
<p>As you can see from (the translation) the "flying saucers" made their first appearance in the 22nd year of the reign
  of Thutmose III, about 3,500 years ago. The first lacuna of the papyrus in the end of another marvel. I think that
  this papyrus was part of a book preserved in the mysterious institution called House of Life (of which Sir Alan
  Gardner has written), that I am actually deeply investigating. In it, magic rites were performed and a special group
  of scribes was trained.</span></p>
<p>Two things have to be noticed: it left after a foul odor and it was not making any noise. It measures one rod, i.e.
  100 cubit. As a cubit is about 20.6 inches we might judge the fire circle was large and long, about fifty meters.
  During their second appearance they were very numerous and shining, and fishes and volatiles fell down from the sky.
  And their movements through the sky, from north to south, was regular, and, more than that, powerful! Therefore the
  king thought that the best thing to do was to pacify the hearth of Ammon Ra, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands
  (Egypt).</span></p>
<p>This record is a part of the archives of a responsible government. The event was unusual enough to warrant inscribing
  in the archives, and to have the past records searched for precedent. The descriptions are concise, although the
  vacant places are annoying in their omissions. De Rachewiltz's comments, supplementing his translation, indicate an
  interpretation similar to that which we, ourselves, might make.</span></p>
<p>However we find it difficult to resist pointing out some of the elements of this event, which are so typical of the
  reports in current sightings. Silence of operation for one thing. Foul odor. In size, this UFO was said to be about
  one hundred cubits, which is about 172 feet long. The fact that two equal dimensions were given indicating (perhaps)
  equal length and breadth implies disc shape. In any case it was described as a fire circle, indicating its shape, and
  that flames were associated with it as has so often been the case. The exact nature of the flames is of course unknown
  to us; they may have been electrical discharges which would have been strange to the Egyptians of 1500 BC and would
  have been recorded as ordinary flames. As in our modern sightings, there was sometimes one object and sometimes a
  group or flock. <span class="MrAUnderlined">They were shining</span></strong>, and by this it seems we can infer that
  they were luminous.</span></p>
<p class="MrA">LAMINATED METAL, COVERED BY SHEET-DIAMOND?</p>
<p>One other thing is obvious from this Egyptian record; that mechanical flight, if it had been previously known to the
  Egyptians, or to their progenitors, was Already a completely lost science in 1500 BC. It is in line with our thinking
  that the Egyptians were merely another one of the trickles through the dyke of time from the previous great wave of
  civilization.</span></p>
<p>The records of Tibet, however, seem to be more complete than those of Egypt, <span class="MrAUnderlined">and more ancient</span>.
  Perhaps it is because the mountain fastnesses of Tibet and Northern India have not been subjected to the burnings and
  other destructive activities of Western civilization which annihilated the</span> libraries of the Egyptians and the
  Mayas.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:#810081; ">TRUE</span></strong></p>
<p>If one may judge from his writings, <span class="MrAUnderlined">Colonel  James Churchward</span></strong>, in a <span
    class="MrAUnderlined">lifetime  of study</span></strong>, Learned something of the lore which is stored in the
  Tibetan monasteries, and supplemented this with studies throughout the world.</p>
<p>Churchward says that he came upon <span class="MrAUnderlined">many </span></strong>records ranging back to at <span
    class="MrAUnderlined">least </span></strong>200,000 years. <span class="MrAUnderlined">One</span> of <span
    class="MrAUnderlined">his </span></strong>most fascinating <span class="MrAUnderlined">finds </span></strong>relates
  to mechanical flight, brought to India by the first settlers, and it <span class="MrAUnderlined">antiquity</span> may
  be anything from 15,000 to 200,000 years, with the longer term the more likely. It is</span> Churchward's deduction
  that India was settled by Nagas from Burma, who, <span class="MrAUnderlined">in their turn</span></strong>,
  were</span> descendents of the original Mayas of the "motherland," common ancestors of the Naga and the Central</span>
  American Maya. This settlement must have taken place about 70,000 years ago, and it seems most</span> probable that
  mechanical flight <span class="MrAUnderlined">came </span></strong>form the "Motherland."</span></p>
<p class="MrA">Not know Churchward. If then he has seen so ancient writs, then he KNEW Why we do Not War.</p>
<p class="MrA">Nor ever Worry &amp; Why each of us knows or Day of Death AND THAT WE ONCE RULERS THEN WERE SLAVES.</p>
<p>Here, by mechanical flight, we most certainly mean something different either our lighter than air or heavier than
  air flight mechanisms of today. That the flight of those millennia employed a type of</span> power unknown today,
  "<span class="MrAUnderlined">seems almost  certain</span></strong>." <span class="MrAUnderlined">Whatever  the source of that power was </span></strong>
  it did not</span> involve power plants as we know them today, and apparently did not result in a truly mechanical
  or</span> industrialized civilization such as we have. </span><span class="JemiUnderlined">That  this power source worked on some principle of levitation </span>or
  <span class="JemiUnderlined">gravity nullification seems logical</span>. It may be, too, that such a force or power

<p>An Hindu Manuscript of ancient origin says: "When morning dawned, Rama, taking the celestial car which Pushpaka had
  sent him be Vivishand, stood ready to depart; self moving was this car; it was</span> large and <span
      class="MrAUnderlined">finely </span></strong>"painted." It had two stories, and many chambers with windows, and
  was draped with</span> flags and banners. It gave forth a melodious sound as it coursed along its airy way."</span>
</p>
<p>This was written millennia ago &ndash; and this translation was made before the modern age of</span> mechanical
  flight. <span class="MrAUnderlined">If the translation had  been made by a person with the technical training available in 1955, it would read like this:</span>
</p>
<p>When dawn came, Rama took the flying machine with Pushpaka had sent to him by Vivishand, and stood by to take off.
  This machine was self-propelled, large and finely-finished. It was a <span
      class="MrAUnderlined">two-decker</span></strong>,</span> with many compartments having windows, and was draped
  with flags and pennants. As the machine flew it made a humming or droning sound.</span></p>
<p class="MrA">NO; Had TWO EQUALLY SHAPED HALVES; LOOKED UP AT FROM GROUND IT SEEMED ---- TO BE OF TWO PARTS as
  hereon.</p>
<p>There is another Hindu manuscript dated 500 BC, which has been translated as follows:</span></p>
<p>Rawan (Ravan?), King of Ceylon, flew over the enemy's army and dropped bombs, causing many casualties. Eventually
  Rawan was captured and slain, and his flying machine fell into the hands of the Hindu Chieftain, Ram Chandra (Rama),
  who flew it all the way back to his Capital in northern India.</span></p>

</p>
<p><span class="MrAUnderlined">Both of these manuscripts </span></strong>seem to have been taken from the same temple
  records at Ayhodia and refer to a time <span class="MrAUnderlined">at least </span></strong>20,000 years ago.</span>
