<p>Dans toutes ces discussions, <span class="MrBUnderlined">une chose</span> semble se <span class="MrBUnderlined">dégager</span>
  comme dénominateur commun.
</p>
<p>Il apparaît que tous les contrivances et gadgets aériens ou spatiaux que nous avons postulé ont une caractéristique
  en commun : leur habitat naturel se trouve dans l'espace, ou tout du moins dans l'atmosphère. Aucune apparition au sol
  n'a été répertoriée de manière certaine, et on n'en dispose que de peu d'indications. <span class="MrBUnderlined">Les apparitions depuis</span>,
  ou les <span class="MrBUnderlined">disparitions vers</span> la mer n'indiquent qu' <span class="MrBUnderlined">une capacité à exploiter le medium fluide de l'eau de mer</span>
  lorsque c'est nécessaire ou souhaitable. Ceci amène à supposer que les ovnis vivent naturellement et facilement dans
  l'espace ; qu'ils ne viennent pas nécessairement d'autres systèmes stellaires ou même d'autres <a
      href="/science/discipline/hard/nat/univ/astro/superamas/amas/galaxie/etoile/planete/index.html">planètes</a>.
</p>
<p class="MrB">Non. Pas facilement<br> On sait que les "Petits-Hommes" ont des GILLS<br> Juste comme tous les Hommes
  avant la naissance ont des gills, aussi.
</p>
<p>Après avoir envisagé que les structures spatiales ou les ovnis passent la plupart de leur temps alignés entre la <a
    href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/index.html">Terre</a> et le <a
    href="/place/systeme/solaire/Soleil/index.html">Soleil</a>, il a été suggéré que certaines anciennes vénérations du
  <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/Soleil/index.html">Soleil</a> puissent avoir eu pour origine le fait que certains
  êtres à l'apparence de dieux ait pu venir d'ovnis décrits comme étant <q>dans le <a
      href="/place/systeme/solaire/Soleil/index.html">Soleil</a></q> en raison de cet alignement of the neutral, et que
  peut-être les "navires de mort" pour le vol céleste qui furent enterrés avec les rois d'Egypte aient pu <span
      class="MrAUnderlined">symboliser le vol XXXXXX d'ovni</span>. Peut-être certaines de ces traditions étaient-elles
  des souvenirs fragmentaires de la première vague de civilisation. Il existe en fait plusieurs traditions très
  anciennes qui peuvent au moins être partiellement expliquées <span class="MrBUnderlined">par</span> notre dénominateur
  commun de vie dans et provenant de l'espace.
</p>
<p>For emphasis, et for the establishment of present principles, nous répétons qu'il <span class="MrAUnderlined">est relativement peu important de trancher sur le fait de savoir si cette civilisation nous a été apportée de l'espace</span>,
  peut-être de la planète explosée entre <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/mars/index.html">Mars</a> et <a
      href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/jupiter/index.html">Jupiter</a>, <span class="MrAUnderlined">ou de savoir si elle a atteint l'espace depuis un développement terrestre lors d'un précédente recrudescence de civilization. </span>–
  Des reliques telles que la Grande Pyramide indiquent l'avancement de cette époque, et il est peut-être un peu moins
  lourd pour notre sensibilité d'affirmer que la vie dans l'espace, en particulier si elle est limitée au système
  terre-lune, est venue de la terre. <span
      class="MrBUnderlined">Nos 2 plus grands dangers mentaux actuellement </span><span style="color:red; ">sont de surmonter les blows  to our racial ego</span>, </span>
  <span class="MrBUnderlined">et de nous libérer de l'idée que les ovnis et la vie spatiale qui atteint maintenant notre connaissance vient nécessairement d'une planète</span>–
  . Leur présence dans des régions proches de l'espace est improbability of lesser order and has little about it which
  is difficult of acceptance. (Red is A and B)
</p>
<p>There <span class="MrBUnderlined">is much</span> to make us believe that this extraordinary thing which we call
  civilization today is nothing but flickering flamelets rekindled from almost extinct embers of civilization, <span
      class="MrAUnderlined">the antiquity of which is undreamed of by modern archaeologists.</span></p>

<p>Le but de ce chapitre est de vous amener encore plus loin dans le temps – jusqu'au seuil de l'intelligence humaine,
  dans une vague de civilisation couvrant le monde avant le déluge. If we discover that no matter how far we push the
  periphery of our quest, we still find a ready-made civilization – we have to admit human intellectual antiquity of (to
  us) fantastic and unbelievable vastness. Could this mean that civilization was planted here, within the species of
  animal selected by some superintelligence as most fit to develop culture? Could these superfolk be space dwellers?
  Could they be tending us as sheep are tended? Are we actually owned? Could the UFO's be their abode? Or perhaps their
  supervisors, shepherds? Could it be that the saucers, in their whimsical variety, are the space dwellers – the
  intelligences?

  disappeared. There was no lightning, and the altitude of the lights seemed variable.

  the south, crossed the sky with a slow and grave motion, and went northward. Out</span> of the front of the pile of

<p>Now let us consider the hieroglyphs from an Egyptian papyrus, together with a translation by Boris de Rachewiltz. De
  Rachewiltz says that the original is a part of the Royal Annals of the times of</span> Thutmose III, circa 1504-1450
  BC, and that the original is in bad condition. Parts were too obliterated for</span> translation.</p>
<p>In the year 22, third month of winter, sixth hour of the day (..2..) The scribas of the House of Life found it was a
  circle of fire that was coming in the sky. (though) it had no head, the breath of its mouth (<span
      class="MrAUnderlined">had</span>–) <span class="MrAUnderlined">a foul odor</span>–. Its body one 'rod' long and
  one 'rod' large. <span class="MrAUnderlined">It  had no voice</span>–. Their hearts became confused through it: then
  they laid themselves on their bellies (..3..) They went to the King..? to report it.</span>
</p>
<p>His Majesty ordered (..4..) has been examined (..5..) as to all which is written in the papyrus rolls of the House of
  Life His Majesty was meditating upon what happened. Now, after some days had passed over those things, Lo! <span
      class="MrAUnderlined">They were more  numerous than "anything" </span>–They were <span class="MrAUnderlined">shining in the sky more than the Sun to the limits of the four supports of heaven </span>–
  (..6..) Powerful was the position of the fire circles. The army of the King looked on and His Majesty was in the midst
  of it. It was after supper.</p>
<p>Thereupon they (the fire circles) went up higher directed to the south. Fishes and volatiles fell down from the sky.
  (it was ) a marvel never occurred since the foundation of this land. Caused His Majesty to brought incense to pacify
  the hearth (..9..) (to write?) what happened in the ook of the House of Life (..10..) (to be remembered?) for the
  Eternity.</p>
<p class="MrA">ole TITMOUSE SAW "The Great Return: a Story you know very Well.</p>
<p class="MrA">He saw Group "Coat" Burnings of Whole Convey.</p>
<p class="MrA">in Great Return, one ship payed-call in Titmouses towns peopole (sic), was Honored &amp; received
  Graciously, even if at first somewhat fearfully, Like sun Worshipers the World over.
</p>
<p>To this added the following comment from the translator:</p>
<p>As you can see from (the translation) the "flying saucers" made their first appearance in the 22nd year of the reign
  of Thutmose III, about 3,500 years ago. The first lacuna of the papyrus in the end of another marvel. I think that
  this papyrus was part of a book preserved in the mysterious institution called House of Life (of which Sir Alan
  Gardner has written), that I am actually deeply investigating. In it, magic rites were performed and a special group
  of scribes was trained.</p>
<p>Two things have to be noticed: it left after a foul odor and it was not making any noise. It measures one rod, i.e.
  100 cubit. As a cubit is about 20.6 inches we might judge the fire circle was large and long, about fifty meters.
  During their second appearance they were very numerous and shining, and fishes and volatiles fell down from the sky.
  And their movements through the sky, from north to south, was regular, and, more than that, powerful! Therefore the
  king thought that the best thing to do was to pacify the hearth of Ammon Ra, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands
  (Egypt).</p>
<p>This record is a part of the archives of a responsible government. The event was unusual enough to warrant inscribing
  in the archives, and to have the past records searched for precedent. The descriptions are concise, although the
  vacant places are annoying in their omissions. De Rachewiltz's comments, supplementing his translation, indicate an
  interpretation similar to that which we, ourselves, might make.</p>
<p>However we find it difficult to resist pointing out some of the elements of this event, which are so typical of the
  reports in current sightings. Silence of operation for one thing. Foul odor. In size, this UFO was said to be about
  one hundred cubits, which is about 172 feet long. The fact that two equal dimensions were given indicating (perhaps)
  equal length and breadth implies disc shape. In any case it was described as a fire circle, indicating its shape, and
  that flames were associated with it as has so often been the case. The exact nature of the flames is of course unknown
  to us; they may have been electrical discharges which would have been strange to the Egyptians of 1500 BC and would
  have been recorded as ordinary flames. As in our modern sightings, there was sometimes one object and sometimes a
  group or flock. <span class="MrAUnderlined">They were shining</span>–, and by this it seems we can infer that they
  were luminous.</p>
<p class="MrA">LAMINATED METAL, COVERED BY SHEET-DIAMOND?</p>
<p>One other thing is obvious from this Egyptian record; that mechanical flight, if it had been previously known to the
  Egyptians, or to their progenitors, was Already a completely lost science in 1500 BC. It is in line with our thinking
  that the Egyptians were merely another one of the trickles through the dyke of time from the previous great wave of
  civilization.</p>
<p>The records of Tibet, however, seem to be more complete than those of Egypt, <span class="MrAUnderlined">and more ancient</span>.
  Perhaps it is because the mountain fastnesses of Tibet and Northern India have not been subjected to the burnings and
  other destructive activities of Western civilization which annihilated the libraries of the Egyptians and the Mayas.
</p>
<p><strong>TRUE–</strong></p>
<p>If one may judge from his writings, <span class="MrAUnderlined">Colonel  James Churchward</span>–, in a <span
    class="MrAUnderlined">lifetime  of study</span>–, Learned something of the lore which is stored in the Tibetan
  monasteries, and supplemented this with studies throughout the world.
</p>
<p>Churchward says that he came upon <span class="MrAUnderlined">many </span>–records ranging back to at <span
    class="MrAUnderlined">least </span>–200000 years. <span class="MrAUnderlined">One</span> of <span
    class="MrAUnderlined">his </span>–most fascinating <span class="MrAUnderlined">finds </span>– relates to mechanical
  flight, brought to India by the first settlers, and it <span class="MrAUnderlined">antiquity</span> may be anything
  from 15000 to 200000 years, with the longer term the more likely. It is Churchward's deduction that India was settled
  by Nagas from Burma, who, <span class="MrAUnderlined">in their turn</span>–, were descendents of the original Mayas of
  the "motherland," common ancestors of the Naga and the Central American Maya. This settlement must have taken place
  about 70000 years ago, and it seems most probable that mechanical flight <span class="MrAUnderlined">came </span>–form
  the "Motherland."</p>
<p class="MrA">Not know Churchward. If then he has seen so ancient writs, then he KNEW Why we do Not War.</p>
<p class="MrA">Nor ever Worry &amp; Why each of us knows or Day of Death AND THAT WE ONCE RULERS THEN WERE SLAVES.</p>
<p>Here, by mechanical flight, we most certainly mean something different either our lighter than air or heavier than
  air flight mechanisms of today. That the flight of those millennia employed a type of power unknown today, "<span
      class="MrAUnderlined">seems almost  certain</span>–." <span class="MrAUnderlined">Whatever  the source of that power was </span>–
  it did not involve power plants as we know them today, and apparently did not result in a truly mechanical or
  industrialized civilization such as we have. <span class="JemiUnderlined">That  this power source worked on some principle of levitation </span>or
  <span class="JemiUnderlined">gravity nullification seems logical</span>. It may be, too, that such a force or power
  does not lend itself to industry.</p>
<p>
  <strong>IT DOES. FROM LIFE-BOAT POWER IS XXXXX–

<p>An Hindu Manuscript of ancient origin says: "When morning dawned, Rama, taking the celestial car which Pushpaka had
  sent him be Vivishand, stood ready to depart; self moving was this car; it was large and <span class="MrAUnderlined">finely </span>–"painted."
  It had two stories, and many chambers with windows, and was draped with</span> flags and banners. It gave forth a
  melodious sound as it coursed along its airy way."</span>

<p>This was written millennia ago – and this translation was made before the modern age of</span> mechanical flight.
  <span class="MrAUnderlined">If the translation had  been made by a person with the technical training available in 1955, it would read like this:</span>
</p>
<p>When dawn came, Rama took the flying machine with Pushpaka had sent to him by Vivishand, and stood by to take off.
  This machine was self-propelled, large and finely-finished. It was a <span
      class="MrAUnderlined">two-decker</span>–,</span> with many compartments having windows, and was draped with flags
  and pennants. As the machine flew it made a humming or droning sound.</p>
<p class="MrA">NO; Had TWO EQUALLY SHAPED HALVES; LOOKED UP AT FROM GROUND IT SEEMED ---- TO BE OF TWO PARTS as hereon.
</p>
<p>There is another Hindu manuscript dated 500 BC, which has been translated as follows:</p>
<p>Rawan (Ravan?), King of Ceylon, flew over the enemy's army and dropped bombs, causing many casualties. Eventually
  Rawan was captured and slain, and his flying machine fell into the hands of the Hindu Chieftain, Ram Chandra (Rama),
  who flew it all the way back to his Capital in northern India.</p>
<p><strong>No, Not bombs: <em>Rocks </em>or "Frozen" air,– <em>or 'Coat" Burnings</em>–.</strong></span>
</p>
<p><span class="MrAUnderlined">Both of these manuscripts </span>–seem to have been taken from the same temple records at
  Ayhodia and refer to a time <span class="MrAUnderlined">at least </span>–20,000 years ago.</span>
