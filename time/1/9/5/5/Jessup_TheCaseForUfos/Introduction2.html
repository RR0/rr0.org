<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">NOTE: <br> Anyone reading this book would have to KNOW that Electron <em>quatums </em>(sic),
  Within Molecular structures, are similar in scope of "field" as Planets <em>orbits. </em>They Would Have to know that.
  Electrons in Metal go across, What in Planetary Systems, would be BILLIONS OF MILES, Leaving three a Graviational
  field, Deadspot <em><span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt;">or </span></em>Node, or Vortice or Neutral as
  <em>this one </em><em>thing </em>is variously called. Realizing this as Dr. Albert Einstien did, it shows clearly how
  solids may become Energy or Dissolute AND How then they May Pass easily out of Visual scope <em>instantly. </em>This
  is Merely one Clue gleamed from <em>Einstiens Theory of a Unified Magnetic </em>Field through <em>all substances </em>AND
  throughout Whole inter-Galactic-Universe.U.S. EXPIERMENTS, 1943 ON ONE PART OF IT <em>PROVED </em>PLENTY!</p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;">The Case for the UFO is perhaps the <strong>most unusual</strong> and <span
    class="MrBUnderlined">comprehensive volume yet produced <em>o</em>n </span>the fascinating subject of the "flying
  saucers." To bring the rare combination of <span class="MrBUnderlined">a scientifically trained mind</span>, plus
  imaginative, <span class="MrBUnderlined">fetter-free thinking </span>to the mysterious subject of possible
  intelligence from outer space, is something which has been much needed. This is precisely what Jr. Jessup has done.
</p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;">This book is a sound step forward in the great need to approach, dispassionately,
  material pertaining to the flying saucers; it goes far toward putting the topic on a down-to-earth basis. I have <span
      class="MrBUnderlined">never before seen such </span>apparently unrelated <span class="MrBUnderlined">subject matter brought into focus </span>so
  skillfully and <span class="MrBUnderlined">analyzed so successfully</span><em><span
      style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:blue; ">.</span></em></p>
<p class="MrB" style="text-autospace:none;">He <em>says </em>"apparently" means "seemingly"</p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;">It <span class="MrBUnderlined">is </span></strong>the <span class="MrBUnderlined">men of insight and </span></strong>
  the men </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">of unobstructed vision </span></strong>of </span><span
      class="MrBUnderlined">every </span></strong>generation who are able to lead us through the </span><span
      class="MrB"><em>quagmire of a  in-a-rut thinking. It is the men of imagination who are able to see relationships which escape the casual observer</em></span>.
  It remains for the men of intuition to seek answers while others avoid even the question.</span></p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;">Mr. Jessup's analyses are based on phenomena which were of scientific record many years
  before the present controversial era, and are therefore objective; thus, the overall picture which we have </span>here
  will, and should, become the bible for the UFO.</span></p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;">Whereas, I may </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">not necessarily agree </span></strong>
  with Mr. Jessup </span><span class="MrBUnderlined"><em>in each </em></span>of his startling deductions,certainly
  there </span><span class="MrAUnderlined">is every reason to  believe that his is the correct approach</span></strong>:
  indeed, many of his conclusions will be difficult, if not </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">altogether  impossible to refute!</span></strong>
</p>
<p style="text-autospace:none;">Having brought to The Case for the UFO his ability to reason clearly, </span><span
    class="MrBUnderlined">to research assiduously </span></strong>and to write lucidly and effectively, </span><span
    class="MrAUnderlined">Mr.  Jessup has performed a valuable service to all of us who know and believe</span></strong>
  <span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10.0pt; color:#008100; ">_</span>"There are more things in heaven and earth?
  than are dreamt of in </span><span class="MrBUnderlined">(our) </span></strong>Philosophy."</span></p>

<p class="MrA" style="text-autospace:none;">Jemi;<br> He may reason clearly <em>but only to the point </em>where Logical
  deduction stops &amp; Emotionalism takes over, as do all Humans. Mortification <em>or </em>pride or Lack of enough
  evidence May put him on a Soap-box Level. Yet, He <em>is </em>a Scientist and as such May show No such traits, as are
  ;usually found in Gaiyari. I see your point, Jemi, He could convince the whole thing but then have you ever tried to
  tell the Honest truth about Something of which <em>only </em>you have observed? True enough, It cannot be done. So Let
  us see What <em>this </em>man has in ways of Doing So, Eh?</strong></p>
