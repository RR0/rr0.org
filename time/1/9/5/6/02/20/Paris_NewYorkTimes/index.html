  <p class="abstract">Unidentified Object, on Radar, Flew at 1,500 M.P.H.</p>
  <p>PARIS, Feb. 19 (AP) ? Aviation circles were speculating today on the identity of a strange object, alternately
    hovering and flying at speeds in excess of 1,500 miles an hour, picked up Friday night by <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a> operators at Orly International Airport.</p>
  <p>The object made a "blip" on the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a> screen approximately
    twice as large as that of the average airliner, according to technicians. It apparead to be at an altitude of about
    5,000 feet and was seen to follow aircraft taking off or coming in for a landing at Orly.</p>
  <p>A radio beacon station soutwest of Paris also reported the object but neither the <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a> at Le Bourget Airport nor the Paris Observatory reported
    contact. A spokesman at the observatory suggested that it might have been a <a href="/org/us/index.html">United
      States</a> weather <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon">ballon</a> launched in
    Germany and blown west by the "jet stream" air currents.</p>
