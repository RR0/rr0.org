<p>PARIS, France (UP).&#8212;An unidentified flying object, described as twice as large as a normal commercial airliner,
  has been tracked on radar screens here, Orly Airport officials reported recently.</p>
<p>Traveling at an estimated 1,500 miles an hour, the object appeared over the Paris region in the late evening, and
  seemed to hover a few moments before disappearing at high speed.</p>
<p>The object was also sighted by an Air France pilot flying to London who reported seeing an intermittent ref flame in
  the sky above him. </p>
