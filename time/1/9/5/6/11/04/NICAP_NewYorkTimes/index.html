<p>WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 (UP) ? The <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">National Investigations Committee on Aerial
  Phenomena</a> named a nine-man board of governors today to direct its effort to provide <q>more honest information</q>
  about flying saucers and space flight. </p>
<p>The committee is a non-profit organization set up recently to provide the public with a <q>broader understanding of
  such aerial phenomena as unidentified flying objects and the technical problems of space flight</q>. </p>
<p>It said it was starting a detailed scientific investigation of flying saucers because <q>there does exist more than
  enough evidence of certain and obvious aerial phenomena to justify independent evaluation</q>. </p>
<p>Those elected to the board of governors were:</p>
<p>Dr Charles A. Maney, professor of physics, Defiance (Ohio) College; Rear Admiral <a
    href="/people/f/FahrneyDelmerS">D. C. Fahrney</a>, retired; A. M. Bonnabend, president, Hotel Corporation of
  America, Boston; the Rev. Albert H. Baller, Robbins Memorial Congregational Church, Greenfield, Mass.; Brig. Gen.
  Thomas B. Catron, retired; Frank Edwards, radie-TV commentator, Indianapolis; Talbot T. Speer, Speer Foundation,
  Baltimore; the Rev. Leon C. Levan, New Jerusalem Christian Church, Pittsburg, and Robert Emerson, Nuclear physicist,
  Kaiser Aluminium Company, Baton Rouge, La. </p>
