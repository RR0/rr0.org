<p>À l'Eté <time>1952</time> un jet intercepteur F-86 de l'United States Air a déscendu une soucoupe volante.</p>
<p>Ce fait, comme tant d'autres qui make up the full flying saucer story n'a jamais été dit auparavant.</p>
<p>Je connais toute l'histoire des soucoupes volantes et je sais que cela n'a jamais été dit auparavant parce que j'ai
  organisé et j'ai été directeur du <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook/index.html">projet Blue Book</a> de
  l'Air Force, le projet spécial mis en place pour enquêter et analyser les objets volants non identifiés, ou
  signalements d'ovnis (OVNI est le terme officiel que j'ai créé pour remplacer les mots "soucoupes volantes").</p>
<p>Il y a une <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/KirtlandAFB.html">base de chasseurs aux Etats-Unis</a> que j'avais l'habitude
  de visiter parce que, au cours de <time>1951</time>, <time>1952</time> et <time>1953</time>, elle eut plus que sa part
  de bons signalements d'ovnis.</p>
<p>L'officier commandant du groupe de chasseurs, un plein colonel et pilote de commandement, était convaincu que les
  ovnis étaient réels. Le colonel croyait aux ovnis parce qu'il avait une grande foi en ses pilotes - et ils avaient
  pris en chasse des ovnis dans leurs <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/f86">F-86</a>. Il avait vu des ovnis sur les
  écrans de ses installations radar, et il connaissait les radars.</p>
<p>L'officier de renseignement du colonel, un capitaine, ne croyait pas exactement que les ovnis étaient réels, mais
  pensait qu'ils méritaient ue investigation précautionneuse. La logique que l'officier de renseignement utilisait dans
  ses enquêtes des signalements d'ovnis - et dans l'obtention de réponses pour de nombreux d'entre eux - me fit
  souhaiter de nombreuses fois qu'il travaille pour moi sur le <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook/index.html">projet Blue Book</a><a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook"></a>.</p>
<p>Un jour l'officier de renseignement m'appela à ma base à <span class="place">Dayton (Ohio)</span>. Il voulait savoir
  si je prévoyais de faire à voyage vers lui bientôt. Lorsque je lui dis que je pensais être dans la région d'ici une
  semaine, il me demanda de ne pas oublier de venir le voir. Il n'y avait pas d'urgence spéciale, ajouta-t-il, mais il
  avait quelque chose de très intéressant à me montrer.</p>
<p>Lorsque nous avions vent d'une bonne histoire, le <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook/index.html">projet
  Blue Book</a><a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook"></a> aimait commencer à travailler dessus tout de
  suite, et je demandais donc à l'officier des renseignements de me dire ce qu'il avait. Mais rien à faire. Il ne
  voulait pas en parler au téléphone. Il avait même exclu l'idée de le mettre sur un câble secret. Une telle précaution
  extrême m'arrêta vraiment, parce que n'importe quoi peut être codé et mis sur un câble.
</p>
<p>Lorsque je quittais Dayton environ 1 semaine plus tard, je décidais d'aller droti à la base de chasseurs, prévoyant
  d'arriver là en milieu de matinée. Mais alors que je changeais de ligne aérienne mes réservations got fouled up, et je
  dus faire face à une attente jusqu'à la soirée pour arriver à la base. J'appelais l'officier de renseignement et lui
  parlais du méli-mélo. Il me dit d'attendre là et qu'il prendrait un avion et me récupèrerait dans un jet T-33.</p>
<p>Dès que je fus dans les airs, sur le trajet du retour, j'appelais l'officier de renseignement sur l'interphone et lui
  demandais ce qui se passait. Qu'avait-il ? Pourquoi tant de mystère ? Il essaya de me le dire, mais l'interphone ne
  fonctionnait pas trop bien et je ne pus entendre ce qu'il disait. Finalement, il me dit d'attendre que nous
  retournions à son bureau et que je pourrais lire le rapport moi-même.</p>
<p>Un rapport ! S'il avait un rapport d'ovni pourquoi ne l'avait-il pas envoyé au <a
  href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">projet Blue Book</a> comme il l'avait fait habituellement ?
</p>
<p>Nous atterrîmes à la base de chasseurs, rendirent nos parachutes, Mae Wests, et casques, et roulèrent jusqu'à son
  bureau. Il y avait plusieurs autres personnes dans le bureau, et elles m'accueillirent avec la question habituelle,
  <q>Quoi de neuf sur le front des soucoupes volantes ?</q> Je parlais avec eux pendant un moment, mais commençais à
  être impatient de découvrir ce qu'il avait dans la tête de l'officier de renseignement. J'allais juste lui poser la
  question du mystérieux rapport lorsqu'il m'emmena d'un côté et demanda doucement de ne pas le mentionner avant que
  tout le monde soit parti.
</p>
<p>Une fois que nous fûmes seuls, l'officier de renseignement ferma la porte, se pencha sur son coffre, et en ressortit
  un gros rapport épais. C'était le formulaire de signalement standard de l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air
    Force</a> utilisé pour l'ensemble des rapports de renseignement, y compris les rapports d'ovnis. L'officier de
  renseignement me dit que c'était la seule copie. Il dit qu'on lui avait demandé de détruire toutes les copies, mais en
  avait sauvé une pour que je la lise.
</p>
<p>Avec une grande curiosité, je pris le rapport et commençais à lire. Qu'était-il arrivé à la base de chasseurs ?
</p>
<p>Vers 10 h du matin, un jour quelques semaines auparavant, un <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">
  radar</a> proche de la base avait repéré une cible non identifiée. C'était une cible bizarre en ce qu'elle arriva très
  vite - près de 700 miles/h - puis ralentit à 100 miles/h environ. Le <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a> montrait qu'elle était située au nord-est du terrain
  d'aviation, au-dessus d'une zone où se trouvaient peu d'installations.
</p>
<p>Malheureusement la station <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a> ne disposait d'aucun
  équipement de détermination d'altitude. Les opérateurs connaissaient la direction de la cible et sa distance de la
  station, mais ne connaissaient pas son altitude. Ils signalèrent la cible, et 2 <a
    href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/f86">F-86</a> furent envoyés.</p>
<p>Le <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a> repéra les <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/f86">F-86</a>
  peu après qu'ils sont en l'air, et avait commencé à les diriger sur la cible lorsque celle-ci commença à s'atténuer
  sur l'écran <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a>. À ce moment plusieurs des opérateurs pensèrent que cette
  atténuation était due à une perte d'altitude rapide de la cible, qui passait sous le rayon du <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a>. Certains des autres opérateurs pensèrent qu'il s'agissait
  d'une cible volant haut et qu'elle s'atténuait simplement parce qu'elle était trop haute.
</p>
<p>Dans le débat qui suivit, les partisans de la théorie du vol élevé gagnèrent, et les <a
  href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/f86">F-86</a> furent instruits de monter à 40000 pieds. Mais avant que les appareils
  puissent atteindre cette altitude, la cible avait été complètement perdue de l'écran <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a>.
</p>
<p>Les <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/f86">F-86</a> continuèrent à chercher dans la zone à 40000 pieds, mais ne
  purent rien voir. Au bout de quelques mn le contrôleur au sol des appareils appela les <a
    href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/f86">F-86</a> et demanda à l'un d'entre eux de descendre à 20 000 pieds, l'autre à
  5000 pieds, et de poursuivre la recherche. Les 2 jets firent une rapide descente, avec 1 <a
    href="/people/pilotes.html">pilote</a> s'arrêtant à 20000 pieds et l'autre se dirigeant vers le pont.
</p>
<p>Le 2nd <a href="/people/pilotes.html">pilote</a>, qui descendait à 5000 pieds, commençait juste à pull out lorsqu'il
  remarqua un éclair dessous et devant lui. Il aplatit un peu sa plongée et se dirigea vers le point où il avait vu la
  lumière. Alors qu'il se rapprochait du point il remarqua soudain ce qu'il pensa d'abord être un <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon">ballon</a>-sonde. Quelques secondes plus tard il réalisa qu'il ne
  pouvait s'agir d'un <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon">ballon</a> parce qu'il restait devant lui.
  Une belle prouesse pour un <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon">ballon</a>, puisqu'il avait
  acquis beaucoup de vitesse dans sa plongée et volait maintenant presque horizontalement à 3000 pieds et voyageait au
  <q> Mach</q>.
</p>
<p>Again the pilot pushed the nose of the F-86 down and started after the object. He closed fairly fast, until he came
  to within an estimated 1000 yards. Now he could get a good look at the object. Although it had looked like a balloon
  from above, a closer view showed that it was definitely round and flat saucer shaped. The pilot described it as being
  <q>like a doughnut without a hole</q>.
</p>
<p>As his rate of closure began to drop off, the pilot knew that the object was picking up speed. But he pulled in
  behind it and started to follow. Now he was right on the deck.
</p>
<p>About this time the pilot began to get a little worried. What should he do? He tried to call his buddy, who was
  flying above him somewhere in the area at 20 000 feet. He called two or three times but could get no answer. Next he
  tried to call the ground controller but he was too low for his radio to carry that far. Once more he tried his buddy
  at 20 000 feet, but again no luck.
</p>
<p>By now he had been following the object for about two minutes and during this time had closed the gap between them to
  approximately 500 yards. But this was only momentary. Suddenly the object began to pull away, slowly at first, then
  faster. The pilot, realizing that he couldn't catch it, wondered what to do next.
</p>
<p>When the object traveled out about 1000 yards, the pilot suddenly made up his mind - he did the only thing that he
  could do to stop the UFO. It was like a David about to do battle with a Goliath, but he had to take a chance. Quickly
  charging his guns, he started shooting. . . . A moment later the object pulled up into a climb and in a few seconds it
  was gone. The pilot climbed to 10000 feet, called the other F-86, and now was able to contact his buddy. They joined
  up and went back to their base.
</p>
<p>As soon as he had landed and parked, the F-86 pilot went into operations to tell his story to his squadron commander.
  The mere fact that he had fired his guns was enough to require a detailed report, as a matter of routine. But the
  circumstances under which the guns actually were fired created a major disturbance at the fighter base that day.
</p>
<p>After the squadron commander had heard his pilot's story, he called the group commander, the colonel, and the
  intelligence officer. They heard the pilot's story.
</p>
<p>For some obscure reason there was a <q>personality clash</q>, the intelligence officer's term, between the pilot and
  the squadron commander. This was obvious, according to the report I was reading, because the squadron commander
  immediately began to tear the story apart and accuse the pilot of <q>cracking up,</q> or of just <q>shooting his guns
    for the hell of it and using the wild story as a cover-up</q>.
</p>
<p>Other pilots in the squadron, friends of the accused pilot - including the intelligence officer and a flight surgeon
  - were called in to "testify." All of these men were aware of the fact that in certain instances a pilot can "flip"
  for no good reason, but none of them said that he had noticed any symptoms of mental crack-up in the unhappy pilot.
</p>
<p>None, except the squadron commander. He kept pounding home has idea - that the pilot was "psycho" - and used a few
  examples of what the report called "minor incidents" to justify his stand.
</p>
<p>Finally the pilot who had been flying with the "accused" man was called in. He said that he had been monitoring the
  tactical radio channel but that he hadn't heard any calls from his buddy's low flying F-86. The squadron commander
  triumphantly jumped on this point, but the accused pilot tended to refute it by admitting he was so jumpy that he
  might not have been on the right channel. But when he was asked if he had checked or changed channels after he had
  lost the object and before he had finally contacted the other F-86, he couldn't remember.
</p>
<p>So ended the pilot's story and his interrogation.
</p>
<p>The intelligence officer wrote up his report of a UFO sighting, but at the last minute, just before sending it, he
  was told to hold it back. He was a little unhappy about this turn of events, so he went in to see why the group
  commander had decided to delay sending the report to Project Blue Book.
</p>
<p>They talked over the possible reactions to the report. If it went out it would cause a lot of excitement, maybe
  unnecessarily. Yet, if the pilot actually had seen what he claimed, it was vitally important to get the report in to
  ATIC immediately. The group commander said that he would make his decision after a talk with his executive officer.
  They decided not to send the report and ordered it destroyed.
</p>
<p>When I finished reading, the intelligence officer's first comment was, <q>What do you think?</q></p>
<p>Since the evaluation of the report seemed to hinge upon conflicts between personalities I didn't know, I could
  venture no opinion, except that the incident made up the most fascinating UFO report I'd ever seen. So I batted the
  intelligence officer's question back to him.
</p>
<p><q>I know the people involved,</q> he replied, <q>and I don't think the pilot was nuts. I can't give you the report,
  because Colonel told me to destroy it. But I did think you should know about it.</q> Later he burned the report.
</p>
<p>The problems involved in this report are typical. There are certain definite facts that can be gleaned from it; the
  pilot did see something and he did shoot at something, but no matter how thoroughly you investigate the incident that
  something can never be positively identified. It might have been a hallucination or it might have been some vehicle
  from outer space; no one will ever know. It was a UFO.
</p>
<p>The UFO story started soon after <time>1947-06-24</time>, when newspapers all over the
  United States carried the first flying saucer report. The story told how nine very bright, disk shaped objects were
  seen by Kenneth Arnold, a Boise, Idaho, businessman, while he was flying his private plane near Mount Rainier, in the
  state of Washington. With journalistic license, reporters converted Arnold's description of the individual motion of
  each of the objects like <q>a saucer skipping across water</q>- into "flying saucer," a name for the objects
  themselves. In the eight years that have passed since Arnold's memorable sighting, the term has become so common that
  it is now in Webster's Dictionary and is known today in most languages in the world.
</p>
<p>For a while after the Arnold sighting the term "flying saucer" was used to describe all disk shaped objects that were
  seen flashing through the sky at fantastic speeds. Before long, reports were made of objects other than disks, and
  these were also called flying saucers. Today the words are popularly applied to anything seen in the sky that cannot
  be identified as a common, everyday object.
</p>
<p>Thus a flying saucer can be a formation of lights, a single light, a sphere, or any other shape; and it can be any
  color. Performance wise, flying saucers can hover, go fast or slow, go high or low, turn 90 degree corners, or
  disappear almost instantaneously.
</p>
<p>Obviously the term "flying saucer" is misleading when applied to objects of every conceivable shape and performance.
  For this reason the military prefers the more general, if less colorful, name: unidentified flying objects. UFO
  (pronounced Yoo-foe) for short.
</p>
<p>Officially the military uses the term "flying saucer" on only two occasions. First in an explanatory sense, as when
  briefing people who are unacquainted with the term "UFO": <q>UFO - you know- flying saucers</q>. And second in a
  derogatory sense, for purposes of ridicule, as when it is observed, <q>He says he saw a flying saucer." </q>
</p>
<p>This second form of usage is the exclusive property of those persons who positively know that all UFO's are nonsense.
  Fortunately, for the sake of good manners if for no other reason, the ranks of this knowing category are constantly
  dwindling. One by one these people drop out, starting with the instant they see their first UFO.
</p>
<p>Some weeks after the first UFO was seen on June 24, 1947, the Air Force established a project to investigate and
  analyze all UFO reports. The attitude toward this task varied from a state of near panic, early in the life of the
  project, to that of complete contempt for anyone who even mentioned the words "flying saucer."
</p>
<p>This contemptuous attitude toward "flying saucer nuts" prevailed from mid 1949 to mid 1950. During that interval many
  of the people who were, or had been, associated with the project believed that the public was suffering from "war
  nerves."
</p>
<p>Early in 1950 the project, for all practical purposes, was closed out; at least it rated only minimum effort. Those
  in power now reasoned that if you didn't mention the words "flying saucers" the people would forget them and the
  saucers would go away. But this reasoning was false, for instead of vanishing, the UFO reports got better and better.
</p>
<p>Airline pilots, military pilots, generals, scientists, and dozens of other people were reporting UFO's, and in
  greater detail than in reports of the past. Radars, which were being built for air defense, began to pick up some very
  unusual targets, thus lending technical corroboration to the unsubstantiated claims of human observers.
</p>
<p>As a result of the continuing accumulation of more impressive UFO reports, official interest stirred. Early in 1951
  verbal orders came down from Major General Charles P. Cabell, then Director of Intelligence for Headquarters, U.S. Air
  Force, to make a study reviewing the UFO situation for Air Force Headquarters.
</p>
<p>I had been back in the Air Force about six months when this happened. During the second world war I had been a B-29
  bombardier and radar operator. I went to India, China, and later to the Pacific, with the original B-29 wing. I flew
  two DCF's, and some Air Medals' worth of missions, got out of the Air Force after the war, and went back to college.
  To keep my reserve status while I was in school, I flew as a navigator in an Air Force Reserve Troop Carrier Wing.
</p>
<p>Not long after I received my degree in aeronautical engineering, the Korean War started, and I went back on active
  duty. I was assigned to the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in Dayton, Ohio.
  ATIC is responsible for keeping track of all foreign aircraft and guided missiles. <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> also had the UFO project.
</p>
<p>I had just finished organizing a new intelligence group when General Cabell's order to review past UFO reports came
  down. Lieutenant Colonel Rosengarten, who received the order at ATIC, called me in and wanted to know if I'd take the
  job of making the review. I accepted.
</p>
<p>When the review was finished, I went to the Pentagon and presented my findings to Major General Samford, who had
  replaced General Cabell as Director of Intelligence.
</p>
<p>ATIC soon got the word to set up a completely new project for the investigation and analysis of UFO reports. Since I
  had made the review of past UFO reports I was the expert, and I got the new job. It was given the code name Project
  Blue Book, and I was in charge of it until late in 1953. During this time members of my staff and I traveled close to
  half a million miles. We investigated dozens of UFO reports, and read and analyzed several thousand more. These
  included every report ever received by the Air Force.
</p>
<p>For the size of the task involved Project Blue Book was always under- staffed, even though I did have ten people on
  my regular staff plus many paid consultants representing every field of science. All of us on Project Blue Book had
  Top Secret security clearances so that security was no block in our investigations. Behind this organization was a
  reporting network made up of every Air Force base intelligence officer and every Air Force radar station in the world,
  and the Air Defense Command's Ground Observer Corps. This reporting net sent Project Blue Book reports on every
  conceivable type of UFO, by every conceivable type of person.
</p>
<center>
  <p>8.The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects</p>
</center>
<p>What did these people actually see when they reported that they had observed a UFO? Putting aside truly
  unidentifiable flying objects for the present, this question has several answers.
</p>
<p>In many instances it has been positively proved that people have reported balloons, airplanes, stars, and many other
  common objects as UFO's. The people who make such reports don't recognize these common objects because something in
  their surroundings temporarily assumes an unfamiliar appearance.
</p>
<p>Unusual lighting conditions are a common cause of such illusions. A balloon will glow like a "ball of fire" just at
  sunset. Or an airplane that is not visible to the naked eye suddenly starts to reflect the sun's rays and appears to
  be a "silver ball." Pilots in F-94 jet interceptors chase Venus in the daytime and fight with balloons at night, and
  people in Los Angeles see weird lights.
</p>
<p>On October 8, 1954, many Los Angeles newspapers and newscasters carried an item about a group of flying saucers,
  bright lights, flying in a V formation. The lights had been seen from many locations over Southern California. Pilots
  saw them while bringing their airplanes into Los Angeles International Airport, Air Force pilots flying out of Long
  Beach saw them, two CBS reporters in Hollywood gave an eyewitness account, and countless people called police and
  civil defense officials. All of them excitedly reported lights they could not identify. The next day the Air Force
  identified the UFO's; they were Air Force airplanes, KC-97 aerial tankers, refueling B-47 jet bombers in flight. The
  reason for the weird effect that startled so many Southern Californians was that when the refueling is taking place a
  floodlight on the bottom of the tanker airplane lights up the bomber that is being refueled. The airplanes were flying
  high, and slowly, so no sound was heard; only the bright floodlights could be seen. Since most people, even other
  pilots, have never seen a night aerial refueling operation and could not identify the odd lights they saw, the lights
  became UFO's.
</p>
<p>In other instances common everyday objects look like UFO's because of some odd quirk in the human mind. A star or
  planet that has been in the sky every day of the observer's life suddenly "takes off at high speed on a highly erratic
  flight path." Or a vapor trail from a high flying jet - seen a hundred times before by the observer - becomes a flying
  saucer.
</p>
<p>Some psychologists explain such aberrations as being akin to the crowd behavior mechanism at work in the "bobby sox
  craze." Teen-agers don't know why they squeal and swoon when their current fetish sways and croons. Yet everybody else
  is squealing, so they squeal too. Maybe that great comedian, Jimmy Durante, has the answer: "Everybody wants to get
  into the act." I am convinced that a certain percentage of UFO reports come from people who see flying saucers because
  others report seeing them.
</p>
<p>But this "will to see" may have deeper roots, almost religious implications, for some people. Consciously or
  unconsciously, they want UFO's to be real and to come from outer space. These individuals, frightened perhaps by
  threats of atomic destruction, or lesser fears - who knows what - act as if nothing that men can do can save the
  earth. Instead, they seek salvation from outer space, on the forlorn premise that flying saucer men, by their very
  existence, are wiser and more advanced than we. Such people may reason that a race of men capable of interplanetary
  travel have lived well into, or through, an atomic age. They have survived and they can tell us their secret of
  survival. Maybe the threat of an atomic war unified their planet and allowed them to divert their war effort to one of
  social and technical advancement. To such people a searchlight on a cloud or a bright star is an interplanetary
  spaceship.
</p>
<p>If all the UFO reports that the Air Force has received in the past eight years could be put in this "psychological
  quirk" category, Project Blue Book would never have been organized. It is another class of reports that causes the Air
  Force to remain interested in UFO's. This class of reports are called "Unknowns."
</p>
<p>In determining the identity of a UFO, the project based its method of operation on a well known psychological
  premise. This premise is that to get a reaction from one of the senses there must be a stimulus. If you think you see
  a UFO you must have seen something. Pure hallucinations are extremely rare.
</p>
<p>For anything flying in the air the stimulus could be anything that is normally seen in the air. Balloons, airplanes,
  and astronomical bodies are the commoner stimuli. Birds and insects are common also, but usually are seen at such
  close range that they are nearly always recognized. Infrequently observed things, such as sundogs, mirages, huge
  fireballs, and a host of other unusual flying objects, are also known stimuli.
</p>
<p>On Project Blue Book our problem was to identify these stimuli. We had methods for checking the location, at any
  time, of every balloon launched anywhere in the United States. To a certain degree the same was true for airplanes.
  The UFO observer's estimate of where the object was located in the sky helped us to identify astronomical bodies. Huge
  files of UFO characteristics, along with up-to-the-minute weather data, and advice from specialists, permitted us to
  identify such things as sun dogs, paper caught in updrafts, huge meteors, etc.
</p>
<p>This determination of the stimuli that triggered UFO sightings, while not an insurmountable task, was a long, tedious
  process. The identification of known objects was routine, and caused no excitement. The excitement and serious
  interest occurred when we received UFO reports in which the observer was reliable and the stimuli could not be
  identified. These were the reports that challenged the project and caused me to spend hours briefing top U.S.
  officials. These were the reports that we called "Unknowns."
</p>
<p>Of the several thousand UFO reports that the Air Force has received since 1947, some 15 to 20 per cent fall into this
  category called unknown. This means that the observer was not affected by any determinable psychological quirks and
  that after exhaustive investigation the object that was reported could not be identified. To be classed as an unknown,
  a UFO report also had to be "good", meaning that it had to come from a competent observer and had to contain a
  reasonable amount of data.
</p>
<p>Reports are often seen in the newspapers that say: "Mrs. Henry Jones, of 5464 South Elm, said that 10:00 A.M. she was
  shaking her dust mop out of the bedroom window when she saw a flying saucer"; or "Henry Armstrong was driving between
  Grundy Center and Rienbeck last night when he saw a light. Henry thinks it was a flying saucer." This is not a good
  UFO report.
</p>
<p>This type of UFO report, if it was received by Project Blue Book, was stamped "Insufficient Data for Evaluation" and
  dropped into the dead file, where it became a mere statistic.
</p>
<p>Next to the "Insufficient Data" file was a file marked "C.P." This meant crackpot. Into this file went all reports
  from people who had talked with flying saucer crews, who had inspected flying saucers that had landed in the United
  States, who had ridden in flying saucers, or who were members of flying saucer crews. By Project Blue Book standards,
  these were not "good" UFO reports either.
</p>
<p>But here is a "good" UFO report with an "unknown" conclusion:
</p>
<p>On July 24, 1952, two Air Force colonels, flying a B-25, took off from Hamilton Air Force Base, near San Francisco,
  for Colorado Springs, Colorado. The day was clear, not a cloud in the sky.
</p>
<p>The colonels had crossed the Sierra Nevada between Sacramento and Reno and were flying east at 11,000 feet on "Green
  3," the aerial highway to Salt Lake City. At 3:40 P.M. they were over the Carson Sink area of Nevada, when one of the
  colonels noticed three objects ahead of them and a little to their right. The objects looked like three F-86's flying
  a tight V formation. If they were F-86's they should have been lower, according to civil air regulations, but on a
  clear day some pilots don't watch their altitude too closely.
</p>
<p>In a matter of seconds the three aircraft were close enough to the B-25 to be clearly seen. They were not F-86's.
  They were three bright silver, delta wing craft with no tails and no pilot's canopies. The only thing that broke the
  sharply defined, clean upper surface of the triangular wing was a definite ridge that ran from the nose to the tail.
</p>
<p>In another second the three deltas made a slight left bank and shot by the B-25 at terrific speed. The colonels
  estimated that the speed was at least three times that of an F-86. They got a good look at the three deltas as the
  unusual craft passed within 400 to 800 yards of the B-25.
</p>
<p>When they landed at Colorado Springs, the two colonels called the intelligence people at Air Defense Command
  Headquarters to make a UFO report. The suggestion was offered that they might have seen three F-86's. The colonels
  promptly replied that if the objects had been F-86's they would have easily been recognized as such. The colonels knew
  what F-86's looked like.
</p>
<p>Air Defense Command relayed the report to Project Blue Book. An investigation was started at once.
</p>
<p>Flight Service, which clears all military aircraft flights, was contacted and asked about the location of aircraft
  near the Carson Sink area at 3:40 P.M. They had no record of the presence of aircraft in that area.
</p>
<p>Since the colonels had mentioned delta wing aircraft, and both the Air Force and the Navy had a few of this type, we
  double-checked. The Navy's deltas were all on the east coast, at least all of the silver ones were. A few deltas
  painted the traditional navy blue were on the west coast, but not near Carson Sink. The Air Force's one delta was
  temporarily grounded.
</p>
<p>Since balloons once in a while can appear to have an odd shape, all balloon flights were checked for both standard
  weather balloons and the big 100 foot diameter research balloons. Nothing was found.
</p>
<p>A quick check on the two colonels revealed that both of them were command pilots and that each had several thousand
  hours of flying time. They were stationed at the Pentagon. Their highly classified assignments were such that they
  would be in a position to recognize anything that the United States knows to be flying anywhere in the world.
</p>
<p>Both men had friends who had "seen flying saucers" at some time, but both had openly voiced their skepticism. Now,
  from what the colonels said when they were interviewed after landing at Colorado Springs, they had changed their
  opinions.
</p>
<p>Nobody knows what the two colonels saw over Carson Sink. However, it is always possible to speculate. Maybe they just
  thought they were close enough to the three objects to see them plainly. The objects might have been three F-86's:
  maybe Flight Service lost the records. It could be that the three F-86's had taken off to fly in the local area of
  their base but had decided to do some illegal sight-seeing. Flight Service would have no record of a flight like this.
  Maybe both of the colonels had hallucinations.
</p>
<p>There is a certain mathematical probability that any one of the above speculative answers is correct - correct for
  this one case. If you try this type of speculation on hundreds of sightings with "unknown" answers, the probability
  that the speculative answers are correct rapidly approaches zero.
</p>
<p>Maybe the colonels actually did see what they thought they did, a type of craft completely foreign to them.
</p>
<p>Another good UFO report provides an incident in which there is hardly room for any speculation of this type. The
  conclusion is more simply, "Unknown," period.
</p>
<p>On January 20, 1952, at seven twenty in the evening, two master sergeants, both intelligence specialists, were
  walking down a street on the Fairchild Air Force Base, close to Spokane, Washington.
</p>
<p>Suddenly both men noticed a large, bluish white, spherical shaped object approaching from the east. They stopped and
  watched the object carefully, because several of these UFO's had been reported by pilots from the air base over the
  past few months. The sergeants had written up the reports on these earlier sightings.
</p>
<p>The object was traveling at a moderately fast speed on a horizontal path. As it passed to the north of their position
  and disappeared in the west, the sergeants noted that it had a long blue tail. At no time did they hear any sound.
  They noted certain landmarks that the object had crossed and estimated the time taken in passing these landmarks. The
  next day they went out and measured the angles between these landmarks in order to include them in their report.
</p>
<p>When we got the report at ATIC, our first reaction was that the master sergeants had seen a large meteor. From the
  evidence I had written off, as meteors, all previous similar UFO reports from this air base.
</p>
<p>The sergeants' report, however, contained one bit of information that completely changed the previous picture. At the
  time of the sighting there had been a solid 6,000-foot-thick overcast at 4,700 feet. And meteors don't go that low.
</p>
<p>A few quick calculations gave a rather fantastic answer. If the object was just at the base of the clouds it would
  have been 10,000 feet from the two observers and traveling 1,400 miles per hour.
</p>
<p>But regardless of the speed, the story was still fantastic. The object was no jet airplane because there was no
  sound. It was not a searchlight because there were none on the air base. It was not an automobile spotlight because a
  spotlight will not produce the type of light the sergeants described. As a double check, however, both men were
  questioned on this point. They stated firmly that they had seen hundreds of searchlights and spotlights playing on
  clouds, and that this was not what they saw.
</p>
<p>Beyond these limited possibilities the sergeants' UFO discourages fruitful speculation. The object remains
  unidentified.
</p>
<p>The UFO reports made by the two colonels and the two master sergeants are typical of hundreds of other good UFO
  reports which carry the verdict, "Conclusion unknown."
</p>
<p>Some of these UFO reports have been publicized, but many have not. Very little information pertaining to UFO's was
  withheld from the press - if the press knew of the occurrence of specific sightings. Our policy on releasing
  information was to answer only direct questions from the press. If the press didn't know about a given UFO incident,
  they naturally couldn't ask questions about it. Consequently such stories were never released. In other instances,
  when the particulars of a UFO sighting were released, they were only the bare facts about what was reported. Any
  additional information that might have been developed during later investigations and analyses was not released.
</p>
<p>There is a great deal of interest in UFO's and the interest shows no signs of diminishing. Since the first flying
  saucer skipped across the sky in the summer of 1947, thousands of words on this subject have appeared in every
  newspaper and most magazines in the United States. During a six-month period in 1952 alone 148 of the nation's leading
  newspapers carried a total of over 16,000 items about flying saucers.
</p>
<p>During July 1952 reports of flying saucers sighted over Washington, D.C., cheated the Democratic National Convention
  out of precious head- line space.
</p>
<p>The subject of flying saucers, which has generated more unscientific behavior than any other topic of modern times,
  has been debated at the meetings of professional scientific societies, causing scientific tempers to flare where
  unemotional objectivity is supposed to reign supreme.
</p>
<p>Yet these thousands of written words and millions of spoken words - all attesting to the general interest - have
  generated more heat than light. Out of this avalanche of print and talk, the full, factual, true story of UFO's has
  emerged only on rare occasions. The general public, for its interest in UFO's, has been paid off in misinformation.
</p>
<p>Many civilian groups must have sensed this, for while I was chief of Project Blue Book I had dozens of requests to
  speak on the subject of UFO's. These civilian requests had to be turned down because of security regulations.
</p>
<p>I did give many official briefings, however, behind closed doors, to certain groups associated with the government -
  all of them upon request.
</p>
<p>The subject of UFO's was added to a regular series of intelligence briefings given to students at the Air Force's
  Command and Staff School, and to classes at the Air Force's Intelligence School.
</p>
<p>I gave briefings to the technical staff at the Atomic Energy Commission's Los Alamos laboratory, where the first
  atomic bomb was built. The theater where this briefing took place wouldn't hold all of the people who tried to get in,
  so the briefing was recorded and replayed many times. The same thing happened at AEC's Sandia Base, near Albuquerque.
</p>
<p>Many groups in the Pentagon and the Office of Naval Research requested UFO briefings. Civilian groups, made up of
  some of the nation's top scientists and industrialists, and formed to study special military problems, worked in a UFO
  briefing. Top Air Force commanders were given periodic briefings.
</p>
<p>Every briefing I gave was followed by a discussion that lasted anywhere from one to four hours.
</p>
<p>In addition to these, Project Blue Book published a classified monthly report on UFO activity. Requests to be put on
  distribution for this report were so numerous that the distribution had to be restricted to major Air Force Command
  Headquarters.
</p>
<p>This interest was not caused by any revolutionary information that was revealed in the briefings or reports. It
  stemmed only from a desire to get the facts about an interesting subject.
</p>
<p>Many aspects of the UFO problem were covered in these official briefings. I would give details of many of the better
  reports we received, our conclusions about them, and how those conclusions were reached. If we had identified a UFO,
  the audience was told how the identification was made. If we concluded that the answer to a UFO sighting was
  "Unknown," the audience learned why we were convinced it was unknown.
</p>
<p>Among the better sightings that were described fully to interested government groups were: the complete story of the
  Lubbock Lights, including the possible sighting of the same V-shaped light formations at other locations on the same
  night; the story of a group of scientists who detected mysterious nuclear radiation when UFO's were sighted; and all
  of the facts behind such famous cases as the Mantell Incident, the Florida scoutmaster who was burned by a "flying
  saucer," and headline capturing sightings at Washington, D.C.
</p>
<p>I showed them what few photographs we had, the majority of which everyone has seen, since they have been widely
  published in magazines and newspapers. Our collection of photographs was always a disappointment as far as positive
  proof was concerned because, in a sense, if you've seen one you've seen them all. We had no clear pictures of a
  saucer, just an assortment of blurs, blotches, and streaks of light.
</p>
<p>The briefings included a description of how Project Blue Book operated and a survey of the results of the many
  studies that were made of the mass of UFO data we had collected. Also covered were our interviews with a dozen North
  American astronomers, the story of the unexplained green fireballs of New Mexico, and an account of how a committee of
  six distinguished United States scientists spent many hours attempting to answer the question, "Are the UFO's from
  outer space?"
</p>
<p>Unfortunately the general public was never able to hear these briefings. For a long time, contrary to present
  thinking in military circles, I have believed that the public also is entitled to know the details of what was covered
  in these briefings (less, of course, the few items pertaining to radar that were classified "Secret," and the names of
  certain people). But withholding these will not alter the facts in any way.
</p>
<p>A lot has already been written on the subject of UFO's, but none of it presents the true, complete story. Previous
  forays into the UFO field have been based on inadequate information and have been warped to fit the personal biases of
  the individual writers. Well-meaning though these authors may be, the degree to which their books have misinformed the
  public is incalculable.
</p>
<p>It is high time that we let the people know.
</p>
<p>The following chapters present the true and complete UFO story, based on what I learned about UFO's while I was chief
  of Project Blue Book, the Air Force's project for the investigation and analysis of UFO reports. Here is the same
  information that I gave to Secretary of the Air Force, Thomas K. Finletter, to the Air Force commanders, to scientists
  and industrialists. This is what the Air Force knows about unidentified flying objects.
</p>
<p>You may not agree with some of the official ideas or conclusions - neither did a lot of people I briefed - but this
  is the story.
