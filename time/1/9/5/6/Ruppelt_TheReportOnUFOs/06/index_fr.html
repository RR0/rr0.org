<p>The Grudge Report was supposedly not for general distribution. A few copies were sent to the Air Force Press Desk in
  the Pentagon and reporters and writers could come in and read it. But a good many copies did get into circulation. The
  Air Force Press Room wasn't the best place to sit and study a 600 page report, and a quick glance at the report showed
  that it required some study - if no more than to find out what the authors were trying to prove - so several dozen
  copies got into circulation. I know that these "liberated" copies of the Grudge Report had been thoroughly studied
  because nearly every writer who came to ATIC during the time that I was in charge of Project Blue Book carried a
  copy. </p>
<p>Since the press had some questions about the motives behind releasing the Grudge Report, it received very little
  publicity while the writers put out feelers. Consequently in early 1950 you didn't read much about flying saucers.
</p>
<p>Evidently certain people in the Air Force thought this lull in publicity meant that the UFO's had finally died
  because Project Grudge was junked. All the project files, hundreds of pounds of reports, memos, photos, sketches, and
  other assorted bits of paper were unceremoniously yanked out of their filing cabinets, tied up with string, and
  chucked into an old storage case. I would guess that many reports ended up as "souvenirs" because a year later, when I
  exhumed these files, there were a lot of reports missing.
</p>
<p>About this time the official Air Force UFO project had one last post death muscular spasm. The last bundle of reports
  had just landed on top of the pile in the storage case when ATIC received a letter from the Director of Intelligence
  of the Air Force. In official language it said, "What gives?" There had been no order to end Project Grudge. The
  answer went back that Project Grudge had not been disbanded; the project functions had been transferred and it was no
  longer a "special" project. From now on UFO reports would be processed through normal intelligence channels along with
  other intelligence reports. </p>
<p>To show good faith ATIC requested permission to issue a new Air Force wide bulletin which was duly mimeographed and
  disseminated. In essence it said that Air Force Headquarters had directed ATIC to continue to collect and evaluate
  reports of unidentified flying objects. It went on to explain that most UFO reports were trash. It pointed out the
  findings of the Grudge Report in such strong language that by the time the recipient of the bulletin had finished
  reading it, he would be ashamed to send in a report. To cinch the deal the bulletins must have been disseminated only
  to troops in Outer Mongolia because I never found anyone in the field who had ever received a copy.
</p>
<p>As the Air Force UFO investigating activity dropped to nil, the press activity skyrocketed to a new peak. A dozen
  people took off to dig up their own UFO stories and to draw their own conclusions.
</p>
<p>After a quiet January, True again clobbered the reading public. This time it was a story in the March 1950 issue and
  it was entitled, "How Scientists Tracked Flying Saucers." It was written by none other than the man who was at that
  time in charge of a team of Navy scientists at the super hush-hush guided missile test and development area, White
  Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico. He was Commander R. B. McLaughlin, an Annapolis graduate and a Regular Navy officer.
  His story had been cleared by the military and was in absolute, 180 degree, direct contradiction to every press
  release that had been made by the military in the past two years. Not only did the commander believe that he had
  proved that UFO's were real but that he knew what they were. "I am convinced," he wrote in the True article, "that
  it," referring to a UFO he had seen at White Sands, "was a flying saucer, and further, that these disks are spaceships
  from another planet, operated by animate, intelligent beings."
</p>
<p>On several occasions during 1948 and 1949, McLaughlin or his crew at the White Sands Proving Ground had made good UFO
  sightings. The best one was made on April 24, 1949, when the commander's crew of engineers, scientists, and
  technicians were getting ready to launch one of the huge 100-foot-diameter skyhook balloons. It was 10:30 AM. on an
  absolutely clear Sunday morning. Prior to the launching, the crew had sent up a small weather balloon to check the
  winds at lower levels. One man was watching the balloon through a theodolite, an instrument similar to a surveyor's
  transit built around a 25 power telescope, one man was holding a stop watch, and a third had a clipboard to record the
  measured data. The crew had tracked the balloon to about 10,000 feet when one of them suddenly shouted and pointed off
  to the left. The whole crew looked at the part of the sky where the man was excitedly pointing, and there was a UFO.
  "It didn't appear to be large," one of the scientists later said, "but it was plainly visible. It was easy to see that
  it was elliptical in shape and had a 'whitish silver color.'" After taking a split second to realize what they were
  looking at, one of the men swung the theodolite around to pick up the object, and the timer reset his stop watch. For
  sixty seconds they tracked the UFO as it moved toward the east. In about fifty-five seconds it had dropped from an
  angle of elevation of 45 degrees to 25 degrees, then it zoomed upward and in a few seconds it was out of sight. The
  crew heard no sound and the New Mexico desert was so calm that day that they could have heard "a whisper a mile away."
</p>
<p>When they reduced the data they had collected, McLaughlin and crew found out that the UFO had been traveling 4
  degrees per second. At one time during the observed portion of its flight, the UFO had passed in front of a range of
  mountains that were visible to the observers. Using this as a check point, they estimated the size of the UFO to be 40
  feet wide and 100 feet long, and they computed that the UFO had been at an altitude of 296,000 feet, or 56 miles, when
  they had first seen it, and that it was traveling 7 miles per second.
</p>
<p>This wasn't the only UFO sighting made by White Sands scientists. On April 5, 1948, another team watched a UFO for
  several minutes as it streaked across the afternoon sky in a series of violent maneuvers. The disk shaped object was
  about a fifth the size of a full moon.
</p>
<p>On another occasion the crew of a C-47 that was tracking a skyhook balloon saw two similar UFO's come loping in from
  just above the horizon, circle the balloon, which was flying at just under 90,000 feet, and rapidly leave. When the
  balloon was recovered it was ripped.
</p>
<p>I knew the two pilots of the C-47; both of them now believe in flying saucers. And they aren't alone; so do the
  people of the Aeronautical Division of General Mills who launch and track the big skyhook balloons. These scientists
  and engineers all have seen UFO's and they aren't their own balloons. I was almost tossed out of the General Mills
  offices into a cold January Minneapolis snowstorm for suggesting such a thing but that comes later in our history of
  the UFO.
</p>
<p>I don't know what these people saw. There has been a lot of interest generated by these sightings because of the
  extremely high qualifications and caliber of the observers. There is some legitimate doubt as to the accuracy of the
  speed and altitude figures that McLaughlin's crew arrived at from the data they measured with their theodolite. This
  doesn't mean much, however. Even if they were off by a factor of 100 per cent, the speeds and altitudes would be
  fantastic, and besides they looked at the UFO through a 25 power telescope and swore that it was a flat, oval- shaped
  object. Balloons, birds, and airplanes aren't flat and oval shaped.
</p>
<p>Astrophysicist Dr. Donald Menzel, in a book entitled Flying Saucers, says they saw a refracted image of their own
  balloon caused by an atmospheric phenomenon. Maybe he is right, but the General Mills people don't believe it. And
  their disagreement is backed up by years of practical experience with the atmosphere, its tricks and its illusions.
</p>
<p>When the March issue of True magazine carrying Commander McLaughlin's story about how the White Sands Scientists had
  tracked UFO's reached the public, it stirred up a hornets' nest. Donald Keyhoe's article in the January True had
  converted many people but there were still a few heathens. The fact that government scientists had seen UFO's, and
  were admitting it, took care of a large percentage of these heathens. More and more people were believing in flying
  saucers.
</p>
<p>The Navy had no comment to make about the sightings, but they did comment on McLaughlin. It seems that several months
  before, at the suggestion of a group of scientists at White Sands, McLaughlin had carefully written up the details of
  the sightings and forwarded them to Washington. The report contained no personal opinions, just facts. The comments on
  McLaughlin's report had been wired back to White Sands from Washington and they were, "What are you drinking out
  there?" A very intelligent answer- and it came from an admiral in the Navy's guided missile program.
</p>
<p>By the time his story was published, McLaughlin was no longer at White Sands; he was at sea on the destroyer Bristol.
  Maybe he answered the admiral's wire.
</p>
<p>The Air Force had no comment to make on McLaughlin's story. People at ATIC just shrugged and smiled as they walked by
  the remains of Project Grudge, and continued to "process UFO reports through regular intelligence channels."
</p>
<p>Au début de <a href="../../../0/index.html">1950</a> les ovnis descendirent au Mexique. Les journaux étaient remplis
  de signalements. Des touristes revenaient avec plus d'histoires de soucoupes que hand tooled, genuine leather purses.
  Time rapportait que les pickpockets faisaient des affaires fabuleuses working the sky gazing crowds that gathered when
  a plativolo was seen. Le Département de la Défense Nationale du Mexique rapporta qu'il y avait eu certains bons
  signalements mais que les histoires de découverte de soucoupes écrasées n'étaient pas vraies.</p>
<p>Le 8 mars une des meilleures observations d'ovnis eu lieu juste au-dessus de l'<a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a>.
</p>
<p>Vers le milieu de matinée ce jour-là un avion de ligne de la TWA arrivait pour atterrir à l'Aéroport Municipal de
  Dayton. Alors que le pilote faisait des rotations pour entrer dans le schéma du traffic, lui et son copilote virent
  une lumière brillante stationner au large au sud-est. Le pilote appela les opérateurs de la tour à l'aéroport pour
  leur parler de la lumière, mais avant qu'il puisse dire quoi que ce soit, les opérateurs de la tour lui dirent qu'ils
  la regardaient aussi. Ils avaient appelé le bureau des opérations de la Garde Nationale Aérienne de l'Ohio, qui était
  situé à l'aéroport, et pendant que les opérateur de la tour parlaient, un pilote de la Garde Aérienne courait vers un
  F-51, trainant ses parachute, casque et masque à oxygène.</p>
<p>Je connaissais le pilote, et il me dit plus tard : <q>je voulais trouver une fois pour toute de quoi il retournait à
  propos de ces signalements de screwy de soucoupes volantes.</q></p>
<p>Tandis que le F-51 chauffait, les opérateur de la tour appelèrent l'<a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> et leur parlèrent de l'ovni et de l'endroit où on pouvait le
  voir. Les gens de l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> se précipitèrent dehors et il était là - une
  lumière extrêmement brillante, bien plus brillante et plus grande qu'une étoile. Quoi qu'elle fut, elle était haut
  parce que every once in a while it would be blanked out by the thick, high, nuages épars qui se trouvaient dans la
  zone. Tandis que le groupe de gens se tenaient devant l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> à
  regarder la lumière, quelqu'un entra en courant et appela le labo radar à <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html">Wright Field</a> pour voir s'ils avaient un radar quelconque
  <q>allumé</q>. Les gens du labo dirent qu'ils n'en avaient pas, mais qu'ils pouvaient en avoir un opérationnel en
  vitesse. Ils dirent qu'ils chercheraient au sud-est sur le terrain avec leur <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a> et suggérèrent que l'<a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> envoie plus de gens. Au moment où les gens de l'<a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> arrivaient dans le labo radar le radar était allumé et avait
  une cible à la même position que la lumière que tout le monde regardait. Le radar repérait également le F-51 du Garde
  Aérien et un F-51 qui avait été envoyé depuis <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html">Wright-Patterson</a>. Les
  pilotes du 51' de la Garde Aérienne et du 51' de <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html">Wright-Patterson</a>
  pouvaient tous les 2 voir l'ovni, et se dirigeaient après lui. Le sergent-chef qui opérait le radar appella les F-51
  sur la radio, les eut ensembles et commença à les dirigier vers la cible. Alors que les 2 avions grimpaient ils
  continuaient à converser avec l'opérateur radar pour être sûrs que tous étaient après la même chose. Pendant plusieurs
  minutes ils pouvaient clairement voir l'ovni, mais lorsqu'ils atteignirent 15000 pieds environ, les nuages arrivèrent
  et ils le perdirent. Les pilotes prirent une décision rapide ; comme le <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a> montrait qu'ils s'approchaient de la cible,
  ils décidèrent de se disperser pour éviter de se rentrer l'un dans l'autre et de monter à travers les nuages. Ils
  partirent aux instruments et en quelques secondes étaient dans le nuage. C'était bien pire qu'ils ne l'avaient prévu ;
  le nuage était épais, et les avions se givraient rapidement. Un F-51 est loin d'être un bon vaisseau aux instruments,
  mais ils restèrent dans leur ascension jusqu'à ce que le radar appelle et dise qu'ils étaient près de la cible ; en
  fait, presque dessus. Les pilotes eurent une autre conférence radio en vitesse et décidèrent qu'avec une météo aussi
  mauvaise ils feraient mieux de redescendre. Si un ovni, ou quelque chose, était dans les nuages, ils le percuteraient
  avant de pouvoir le voir. Ils prirent donc une sage décision ; ils laissèrent tomber les nez de leurs avions et
  plongèrent sur le chemin du retour vers le ciel clair. Ils firent quelques tours pendant un moment mais les nuages ne
  se brisaient pas. En quelques minutes le sergent-chef sur le radar signala que la cible s'atténuait rapidement. Les
  F-51 partirent et atterrirent.
</p>
<p>Lorsque la cible s'atténua sur le <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a>, certaines personnes
  sortirent dehors pour chercher l'ovni à l'?il nu, mais il était masqué par les nuages, et les nuages
  restèrent pendant 1 h. Lorsqu'il finit par faire clair pendant quelques minutes, l'ovni était parti.</p>
<p>Une conférence se tient à l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> cet après-midi-là. Elle comprend
  <span class="people" title="Roy L. James">Roy James</span>, spécialiste en électronique et expert en ovnis <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a> de l'<a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a>. <span class="people" title="Roy L. James">Roy</span> avait été
  au labo radar et avait vu l'ovni sur l'écran mais ni les pilotes de F-51 ni le sergent-chef qui opéraient le radar
  n'étaient à la conférence. Les archives montrent qu'à cette réunion une décision unanime avait été atteinte quant à
  l'identité des ovnis. La lumière brillante était <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus">Vénus</a> puisque <a
      href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus">Vénus</a> était au sud-est en milieu de matinée le 8 mars <a
      href="../../../0/index.html">1950</a>, et le retour <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a> avait été causé par le nuage chargé de glace
  que les pilotes de F-51 avaient rencontré. Des nuages chargés de glace peuvent provoquer un retour <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a>. Le groupe de spécialistes en renseignement
  à la réunion décidèrent que c'était confirmé par le fait qu'alors que les F-51 approchaient du centre du nuage leur
  retour radar semblait s'approcher de la cible ovni sur l'écran <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a>. Ils étaient près de l'ovni et près de la
  glace, donc l'ovni devait être la glace.</p>
<p>Le cas était clos.</p>
<p>I had read the report of this sighting but I hadn't paid too much attention to it because it had been "solved." But
  one day almost two years later I got a telephone call at my office at Project Blue Book. It was a master sergeant, the
  master sergeant who had been operating the radar at the lab. He'd just heard that the Air Force was again seriously
  investigating UFO's and he wanted to see what had been said about the Dayton Incident. He came over, read the report,
  and violently disagreed with what had been decided upon as the answer. He said that he'd been working with radar
  before World War II; he'd helped with the operational tests on the first microwave warning radars developed early in
  the war by a group headed by Dr. Luis Alvarez. He said that what he saw on that radarscope was no ice cloud; it was
  some type of aircraft. He'd seen every conceivable type of weather target on radar, he told me; thunderstorms, ice
  laden clouds, targets caused by temperature inversions, and the works. They all had similar characteristics - the
  target was "fuzzy" and varied in intensity. But in this case the target was a good, solid return and he was convinced
  that it was caused by a good, solid object. And besides, he said, when the target began to fade on his scope he had
  raised the tilt of the antenna and the target came back, indicating that whatever it was, it was climbing. Ice laden
  clouds don't climb, he commented rather bitterly.
</p>
<p>Nor did the pilot of one of the F-51's agree with the ATIC analysis. The pilot who had been leading the two ship
  flight of F-51's on that day told me that what he saw was no planet. While he and his wing man were climbing, and
  before the clouds obscured it, they both got a good look at the UFO, and it was getting bigger and more distinct all
  the time. As they climbed, the light began to take on a shape; it was definitely round. And if it had been Venus it
  should have been in the same part of the sky the next day, but the pilot said that he'd looked and it wasn't there.
  The ATIC report doesn't mention this point.
</p>
<p>I remember asking him a second time what the UFO looked like; he said, "huge and metallic" - shades of the Mantell
  Incident.
</p>
<p>The Dayton Incident didn't get much of a play from the press because officially it wasn't an unknown and there's
  nothing intriguing about an ice cloud and Venus. There were UFO reports in the newspapers, however.
</p>
<p>One story that was widely printed was about a sighting at the naval air station at Dallas, Texas. Just before noon on
  March 16, Chief Petty Officer Charles Lewis saw a disk shaped UFO come streaking across the sky and buzz a high flying
  B-36. Lewis first saw the UFO coming in from the north, lower than the B-36; then he saw it pull up to the big bomber
  as it got closer. It hovered under the B-36 for an instant, then it went speeding off and disappeared. When the press
  inquired about the incident, Captain M. A. Nation, commander of the air station, vouched for his chief and added that
  the base tower operators had seen and reported a UFO to him about ten days before.
</p>
<p>This story didn't run long because the next day a bigger one broke when the sky over the little town of Farmington,
  New Mexico, about 170 miles northwest of Albuquerque, was literally invaded by UFO's. Every major newspaper carried
  the story. The UFO's had apparently been congregating over the four comers area for two days because several people
  had reported seeing UFO's on March 15 and 16. But the seventeenth was the big day, every saucer this side of Polaris
  must have made a successful rendezvous over Farmington, because on that day most of the town's 3,600 citizens saw the
  mass fly-by. The first reports were made at 10:15 A.M.; then for an hour the air was full of flying saucers. Estimates
  of the number varied from a conservative 500 to "thousands." Most all the observers said the UFO's were saucer shaped,
  traveled at almost unbelievable speeds, and didn't seem to have any set flight path. They would dart in and out and
  seemed to avoid collisions only by inches. There was no doubt that they weren't hallucinations because the mayor, the
  local newspaper staff, ex-pilots, the highway patrol, and every type of person who makes up a community of 3,600 saw
  them.
</p>
<p>I've talked to several people who were in Farmington and saw this now famous UFO display of St. Patrick's Day, 1950.
  I've heard dozens of explanations - cotton blowing in the wind, bugs' wings reflecting sunlight, a hoax to put
  Farmington on the map, and real honest-to-goodness flying saucers. One explanation was never publicized, however, and
  if there is an explanation, it is the best. Under certain conditions of extreme cold, probably 50 to 60 degrees below
  zero, the plastic bag of a skyhook balloon will get very brittle, and will take on the characteristics of a huge light
  bulb. If a sudden gust of wind or some other disturbance hits the balloon, it will shatter into a thousand pieces. As
  these pieces of plastic float down and are carried along by the wind, they could look like thousands of flying
  saucers.
</p>
<p>On St. Patrick's Day a skyhook balloon launched from Holloman AFB, adjacent to the White Sands Proving Ground, did
  burst near Farmington, and it was cold enough at 60,000 feet to make the balloon brittle. True, the people at
  Farmington never found any piece of plastic, but the small pieces of plastic are literally as light as feathers and
  could have floated far beyond the city.
</p>
<p>The next day, on March 18, the Air Force, prodded by the press, shrugged and said, "There's nothing to it," but they
  had no explanation.
</p>
<p>True magazine came through for a third time when their April issue, which was published during the latter part of
  March 1950, carried a roundup of UFO photos. They offered seven photos as proof that UFO's existed. It didn't take a
  photo interpretation expert to tell that all seven could well be of doubtful lineage, nevertheless the collection of
  photos added fuel to the already smoldering fire. The U.S. public was hearing a lot about flying saucers and all of it
  was on the pro side. For somebody who didn't believe in the things, the public thought that the Air Force was being
  mighty quiet.
</p>
<p>The subject took on added interest on the night of March 26, when a famous news commentator said the UFO's were from
  Russia.
</p>
<p>The next night Henry J. Taylor, in a broadcast from Dallas, Texas, said that the UFO's were Uncle Sam's own. He
  couldn't tell all he knew, but a flying saucer had been found on the beach near Galveston, Texas. It had USAF
  markings.
</p>
<p>Two nights later a Los Angeles television station cut into a regular program with a special news flash; later in the
  evening the announcer said they would show the first photos of the real thing, our military's flying saucer. The
  photos turned out to be of the Navy XF-5-U, a World War II experimental aircraft that never flew.
</p>
<p>The public was now thoroughly confused.
</p>
<p>By now the words "flying saucer" were being batted around by every newspaper reporter, radio and TV newscaster,
  comedian, and man on the street. Some of the comments weren't complimentary, but as Theorem I of the publicity racket
  goes, "It doesn't make any difference what's said as long as the name's spelled right."
</p>
<p>Early in April the publication that is highly revered by so many, U.S. News and World Report, threw in their lot. The
  UFO's belonged to the Navy. Up popped the old non flying XF-5-U again.
</p>
<p>Events drifted back to normal when Edward R. Murrow made UFO's the subject of one of his TV documentaries. He took
  his viewers around the U.S., talked to Kenneth Arnold, of original UFO fame, by phone and got the story of Captain
  Mantell's death from a reporter "who was there." Sandwiched in between accounts of actual UFO sightings were the pro
  and con opinions of top Washington brass, scientists, and the man on the street.
</p>
<p>Even the staid New York Times, which had until now stayed out of UFO controversy, broke down and ran an editorial
  entitled, "Those Flying Saucers - Are They or Aren't They?"
</p>
<p>All of this activity did little to shock the military out of their dogma. They admitted that the UFO investigation
  really hadn't been discontinued. "Any substantial reports of any unusual aerial phenomena would be processed through
  normal intelligence channels," they told the press.
</p>
<p>Ever since July 4, 1947, ten days after the first flying saucer report, airline pilots had been reporting that they
  had seen UFO's. But the reports weren't frequent - maybe one every few months. In the spring of 1950 this changed,
  however, and the airline pilots began to make more and more reports - good reports. The reports went to ATIC but they
  didn't receive much attention. In a few instances there was a semblance of an investigation but it was halfhearted.
  The reports reached the newspapers too, and here they received a great deal more attention. The reports were
  investigated, and the stories checked and rechecked. When airline crews began to turn in one UFO report after another,
  it was difficult to believe the old "hoax, hallucination, and misidentification of known objects" routine. In April,
  May, and June of 1950 there were over thirty five good reports from airline crews.
</p>
<p>One of these was a report from a Chicago and Southern crew who were flying a DC-3 from Memphis to Little Rock,
  Arkansas, on the night of March 31. It was an exceptionally clear night, no clouds or haze, a wonderful night to fly.
  At exactly nine twenty-nine by the cockpit clock the pilot, a Jack Adams, noticed a white light off to his left. The
  copilot, G. W. Anderson, was looking at the chart but out of the corner of his eye he saw the pilot lean forward and
  look out the window, so he looked out too. He saw the light just as the pilot said, "What's that?"
</p>
<p>The copilot's answer was classic: "No, not one of those things."
</p>
<p>Both pilots had only recently voiced their opinions regarding the flying saucers and they weren't complimentary.
</p>
<p>As they watched the UFO, it passed across the nose of their DC-3 and they got a fairly good look at it. Neither the
  pilot nor the copilot was positive of the object's shape because it was "shadowy" but they assumed it was disk shaped
  because of the circular arrangement of eight or ten "portholes," each one glowing from a strong bluish white light
  that seemed to come from the inside of whatever it was that they saw. The UFO also had a blinking white light on top,
  a fact that led many people to speculate that this UFO was another airliner. But this idea was quashed when it was
  announced that there were no other airliners in the area. The crew of the DC-3, when questioned on this possibility,
  were definite in their answers. If it had been another airplane, they could have read the number, seen the passengers,
  and darn near reached out and slugged the pilot for getting so close to them.
</p>
<p>Un mois plus tard environ, au-dessus du nord de l'Indiana, la TWA treated tous les passagers de l'un de leurs vols de
  <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/dc3">DC-3</a> to a view d'un ovni qui ressemblait à un <q>gros
    glob de métal fondu.</q></p>
<p>La réponse officielle à cet incident est que l'énorme ovni rouge-orangé n'était rien d'autre que la lumière des
  nombreux haut-fourneaux du nord de l'Indiana se reflètant sur une couche de brume. Cela aurait pu l'être, mais les
  pilotes disent que non.</p>
<p>There were similar sightings in North Korea two years later - and FEAF Bomber Command had caused a shortage of blast
  furnaces in North Korea.
</p>
<p>UFO sightings by airline pilots always interested me as much as any type of sighting. Pilots in general should be
  competent observers simply because they spend a large part of their lives looking around the sky. And pilots do look;
  one of the first things an aviation cadet is taught is to "Keep your head on a swivel"; in other words, keep looking
  around the sky. Of all the pilots, the airline pilots are the cream of this group of good observers. Possibly some
  second lieutenant just out of flying school could be confused by some unusual formation of ground lights, a meteor, or
  a star, but airline pilots have flown thousands of hours or they wouldn't be sitting in the left seat of an airliner,
  and they should be familiar with a host of unusual sights.
</p>
<p>One afternoon in February 1953 I had an opportunity to further my study of UFO sightings by airline pilots. I had
  been out at Air Defense Command Headquarters in Colorado Springs and was flying back East on a United Airlines DC-6.
  There weren't many passengers on the airplane that afternoon but, as usual, the captain came strolling back through
  the cabin to chat. When he got to me he sat down in the next seat. We talked a few minutes; then I asked him what he
  knew about flying saucers. He sort of laughed and said that a dozen people a week asked that question, but when I told
  him who I was and why I was interested, his attitude changed. He said that he'd never seen a UFO but he knew a lot of
  pilots on United who had. One man, he told me, had seen one several years ago. He'd reported it but he had been
  sloughed off like the rest. But he was so convinced that he'd seen something unusual that he'd gone out and bought a
  Leica camera with a 105 mm. telephoto lens, learned how to use it, and now he carried it religiously during his
  flights.
</p>
<p>There was a lull in the conversation, then the captain said, "Do you really want to get an opinion about flying
  saucers?"
</p>
<p>I said I did.
</p>
<p>"O.K.," I remember his saying, "how much of a layover do you have in Chicago?"
</p>
<p>I had about two hours.
</p>
<p>"All right, as soon as we get to Chicago I'll meet you at Caffarello's, across the street from the terminal building.
  I'll see who else is in and I'll bring them along."
</p>
<p>I thanked him and he went back up front.
</p>
<p>I waited around the bar at Caffarello's for an hour. I'd just about decided that he wasn't going to make it and that
  I'd better get back to catch my flight to Dayton when he and three other pilots came in. We got a big booth in the
  coffee shop because he'd called three more off duty pilots who lived in Chicago and they were coming over too. I don't
  remember any of the men's names because I didn't make any attempt to. This was just an informal bull session and not
  an official interrogation, but I really got the scoop on what airline pilots think about UFO's.
</p>
<p>First of all they didn't pull any punches about what they thought about the Air Force and its investigation of UFO
  reports. One of the men got right down to the point: "If I saw a flying saucer flying wing tip formation with me and
  could see little men waving - even if my whole load of passengers saw it - I wouldn't report it to the Air Force."
  Another man cut in, "Remember the thing Jack Adams said he saw down by Memphis?" I said I did. </p>
<p>"He reported that to the Air Force and some red-hot character met him in Memphis on his next trip. He talked to Adams
  a few minutes and then told him that he'd seen a meteor. Adams felt like a fool. Hell, I know Jack Adams well and he's
  the most conservative guy I know. If he said he saw something with glowing portholes, he saw something with glowing
  portholes - and it wasn't a meteor."
</p>
<p>Even though I didn't remember the pilots' names I'll never forget their comments. They didn't like the way the Air
  Force had handled UFO reports and I was the Air Force's "Mr. Flying Saucer." As quickly as one of the pilots would set
  me up and bat me down, the next one grabbed me off the floor and took his turn. But I couldn't complain too much; I'd
  asked for it. I think that this group of seven pilots pretty much represented the feelings of a lot of the airline
  pilots. They weren't wide-eyed space fans, but they and their fellow pilots had seen something and whatever they'd
  seen weren't hallucinations, mass hysteria, balloons, or meteors.
</p>
<p>Three of the men at the Caffarello conference had seen UFO's or, to use their terminology, they had seen something
  they couldn't identify as a known object. Two of these men had seen odd lights closely following their airplanes at
  night. Both had checked and double-checked with CAA, but no other aircraft was in the area. Both admitted, however,
  that they hadn't seen enough to class what they'd seen as good UFO sighting. But the third man had a lulu.
</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, this pilot was flying for TWA. One day in March 1952 he, his copilot, and a third person who
  was either a pilot dead-heading home or another crew member, I don't recall which, were flying a C-54 cargo airplane
  from Chicago to Kansas City. At about 2:30 P.M. the pilot was checking in with the CAA radio at Kirksville, Missouri,
  flying 500 feet on top of a solid overcast. While he was talking he glanced out at his No.2 engine, which had been
  losing oil. Directly in line with it, and a few degrees above, he saw a silvery, disk shaped object. It was too far
  out to get a really good look at it, yet it was close enough to be able definitely to make out the shape.
</p>
<p>The UFO held its relative position with the C-54 for five or six minutes; then the pilot decided to do a little
  on-the-spot investigating himself. He started a gradual turn toward the UFO and for about thirty seconds he was
  getting closer, but then the UFO began to make a left turn. It had apparently slowed down because they were still
  closing on it. About this time the copilot decided that the UFO was a balloon; it just looked as if the UFO was
  turning. The pilot agreed halfway - and since the company wasn't paying them to intercept balloons, they got back on
  their course to Kansas City. They flew on for a few more minutes with "the darn thing" still off to their left. If it
  was a balloon, they should be leaving it behind, the pilot recalled thinking to himself; if they made a 45 degree
  right turn, the "balloon" shouldn't stay off the left wing; it should drop way behind. So they made a 45 degree right
  turn, and although the "balloon" dropped back a little bit, it didn't drop back far enough to be a balloon. It seemed
  to put on speed to try to make a turn outside of the C-54's turn. The pilot continued on around until he'd made a
  tight 360 degree turn, and the UFO had followed, staying outside. They could not judge its speed, not knowing how far
  away it was, but to follow even a C-54 around in a 360 degree turn and to stay outside all of the time takes a mighty
  speedy object. </p>
<p>This shot the balloon theory right in the head. After the 360 degree turn the UFO seemed to be gradually losing
  altitude because it was getting below the level of the wings. The pilot decided to get a better look. He asked for
  full power on all four engines, climbed several thousand feet, and again turned into the UFO. He put the C-54 in a
  long glide, headed directly toward it. As they closed in, the UFO seemed to lose altitude a little faster and "sank"
  into the top of the overcast. Just as the C-54 flashed across the spot where the UFO had disappeared, the crew saw it
  rise up out of the overcast off their right wing and begin to climb so fast that in several seconds it was out of
  sight.
</p>
<p>Both the pilot and copilot wanted to stay around and look for it but No.2 engine had started to act up soon after
  they had put on full power for the climb, and they decided that they'd better get into Kansas City.
</p>
<p>I missed my Dayton flight but I heard a good UFO story.
</p>
<p>What had the two pilots and their passenger seen? We kicked it around plenty that afternoon. It was no balloon. It
  wasn't another airplane because when the pilot called Kirksville Radio he'd asked if there were any airplanes in the
  area. It might possibly have been a reflection of some kind except that when it "sank" into the overcast the pilot
  said it looked like something sinking into an overcast - it just didn't disappear as a reflection would. Then there
  was the sudden reappearance off the right wing. These are the types of things you just can't explain.
</p>
<p>What did the pilots think it was? Three were sold that the UFO's were interplanetary spacecraft, one man was
  convinced that they were some U.S. "secret weapon," and three of the men just shook their heads. So did I. We all
  agreed on one thing - this pilot had seen something and it was something highly unusual. </p>
<p>The meeting broke up about 9:00 P.M. I'd gotten the personal and very candid opinion of seven airline captains, and
  the opinions of half a hundred more airline pilots had been quoted. I'd learned that the UFO's are discussed often.
  I'd learned that many airline pilots take UFO sightings very seriously. I learned that some believe they are
  interplanetary, some think they're a U.S. weapon, and many just don't know. But very few are laughing off the good
  sightings. </p>
<p>By May 1950 the flying saucer business had hit a new all-time peak. The Air Force didn't take any side, they just
  shrugged. There was no attempt to investigate and explain the various sightings. Maybe this was because someone was
  afraid the answer would be "Unknown." Or maybe it was because a few key officers thought that the eagles or stars on
  their shoulders made them leaders of all men. If they didn't believe in flying saucers and said so, it would be like
  calming the stormy Sea of Galilee. "It's all a bunch of damned nonsense," an Air Force colonel who was controlling the
  UFO investigation said. "There's no such thing as a flying saucer." He went on to say that all people who saw flying
  saucers were jokers, crackpots, or publicity hounds. Then he gave the airline pilots who'd been reporting UFO's a
  reprieve. "They were just fatigued," he said. "What they thought were spaceships were windshield reflections."
</p>
<p>This was the unbiased processing of UFO reports through normal intelligence channels.
</p>
<p>But the U.S. public evidently had more faith in the "crackpot" scientists who were spending millions of the public's
  dollars at the White Sands Proving Grounds, in the "publicity mad" military pilots, and the "tired, old" airline
  pilots, because in a nationwide poll it was found that only 6 per cent of the country's 150,697,361 people agreed with
  the colonel and said, "There aren't such things."
</p>
<p>Ninety-four per cent had different ideas.
