<p>Le 25 juin <a href="../../../0/index.html">1950</a>, the North Korean armies swept down across the 38th parallel and
  the Korean War was on - the UFO was no longer a news item. But the lady, or gentleman, who first said, "Out of sight
  is out of mind," had never reckoned with the UFO. </p>
<p>On September 8, 1950, the UFO's were back in the news. On that day it was revealed, via a book entitled Behind the
  Flying Saucers, that government scientists had recovered and analyzed three different models of flying saucers. And
  they were fantastic - just like the book. They were made of an unknown super-duper metal and they were manned by
  little blue uniformed men who ate concentrated food and drank heavy water. The author of the book, Frank Scully, had
  gotten the story directly from a millionaire oilman, Silas Newton. Newton had in turn heard the story from an employee
  of his, a mysterious "Dr. Gee," one of the government scientists who had helped analyze the crashed saucers.
</p>
<p>The story made news, Newton and "Dr. Gee" made fame, and Scully made money.
</p>
<p>A little over two years later Newton and the man who was reportedly the mysterious "Dr. Gee" again made the news. The
  Denver district attorney's office had looked into the pair's oil business and found that the pockets they were trying
  to tap didn't contain oil. According to the December 6, 1952, issue of the Saturday Review, the D.A. had charged the
  two men with a $50,000 con game. One of their $800,000 electronic devices for their oil explorations turned out to be
  a $4.00 piece of war surplus junk.
</p>
<p>Another book came out in the fall of 1950 when Donald Keyhoe expanded his original UFO story that had first appeared
  in the January 1950 issue of True magazine. Next to Scully's book Keyhoe's book was tame, but it convinced more
  people. Keyhoe had based his conjecture on fact, and his facts were correct, even if the conjecture wasn't.
</p>
<p>Neither the seesaw advances and retreats of the United Nations troops in Korea nor the two flying saucer books seemed
  to have any effect on the number of UFO reports logged into ATIC, however. By official count, seventy-seven came in
  the first half of 1950 and seventy-five during the latter half. The actual count could have been more because in 1950,
  UFO reports were about as popular as sand in spinach, and I would guess that at least a few wound up in the "circular
  file."
</p>
<p>In early January 1951 I was recalled to active duty and assigned to Air Technical Intelligence Center as an
  intelligence officer. I had been at ATIC only eight and a half hours when I first heard the words "flying saucer"
  officially used. I had never paid a great deal of attention to flying saucer reports but I had read a few, especially
  those that had been made by pilots. I'd managed to collect some 2,000 hours of flying time and had seen many odd
  things in the air, but I'd always been able to figure out what they were in a few seconds. I was convinced that if a
  pilot, or any crew member of an airplane, said that he'd seen something that he couldn't identify he meant it - it
  wasn't a hallucination. But I wasn't convinced that flying saucers were spaceships.</p>
<p>My interest in UFO's picked up in a hurry when I learned that ATIC was the government agency that was responsible for
  the UFO project. And I was really impressed when I found out that the person who sat three desks down and one over
  from mine was in charge of the whole UFO show. So when I came to work on my second morning at ATIC and heard the words
  "flying saucer report" being talked about and saw a group of people standing around the chief of the UFO project's
  desk I about sprung an eardrum listening to what they had to say. It seemed to be a big deal, except that most of them
  were laughing. It must be a report of hoax or hallucination, I remember thinking to myself, but I listened as one of
  the group told the others about the report.
</p>
<p>The night before a Mid Continent Airlines DC-3 was taxiing out to take off from the airport at Sioux City, Iowa, when
  the airport control tower operators noticed a bright bluish white light in the west. The tower operators, thinking
  that it was another airplane, called the pilot of the DC-3 and told him to be careful since there was another airplane
  approaching the field. As the DC-3 lined up to take off, both the pilots of the airliner and the tower operators saw
  the light moving in, but since it was still some distance away the DC-3 was given permission to take off. As it rolled
  down the runway getting up speed, both the pilot and the copilot were busy, so they didn't see the light approaching.
  But the tower operators did, and as soon as the DC-3 was airborne, they called and told the pilot to be careful. The
  copilot said that he saw the light and was watching it. Just then the tower got a call from another airplane that was
  requesting landing instructions and the operators looked away from the light.
</p>
<p>In the DC-3 the pilot and copilot had also looked away from the light for a few seconds. When they looked back, the
  bluish white light had apparently closed in because it was much brighter and it was dead ahead. In a split second it
  closed in and flashed by their right wing, so close that both pilots thought that they would collide with it. When it
  passed the DC-3, the pilots saw more than a light - they saw a huge object that looked like the "fuselage of a B-29."
</p>
<p>When the copilot had recovered he looked out his side window to see if he could see the UFO and there it was, flying
  formation with them. He yelled at the pilot, who leaned over and looked just in time to see the UFO disappear.
</p>
<p>The second look confirmed the Mid Continent crew's first impression - the object looked like a B-29 without wings.
  They saw nothing more, only a big "shadowy shape" and the blulsh-white light - no windows, no exhaust. </p>
<p>The tower had missed the incident because they were landing the other airplane and the pilot and the copilot didn't
  have time to call them and tell them about what was going on. All the tower operators could say was that seconds after
  the UFO had disappeared the light that they had seen was gone.
</p>
<p>When the airliner landed in Omaha, the crew filed a report that was forwarded to the Air Force. But this wasn't the
  only report that was filed; a full colonel from military intelligence had been a passenger on the DC-3. He'd seen the
  UFO too, and he was mighty impressed.
</p>
<p>I thought that this was an interesting report and I wondered what the official reaction would be. The official
  reaction was a great big, deep belly laugh.
</p>
<p>This puzzled me because I'd read that the Air Force was seriously investigating all UFO reports.
</p>
<p>I continued to eavesdrop on the discussions about the report all day since the UFO expert was about to "investigate"
  the incident. He sent out a wire to Flight Service and found that there was a B-36 somewhere in the area of Sioux City
  at the time of the sighting, and from what I could gather he was trying to blame the sighting on the B-36. When
  Washington called to get the results of the analysis of the sighting, they must have gotten the B-36 treatment because
  the case was closed.
</p>
<p>I'd only been at ATIC two days and I certainly didn't class myself as an intelligence expert, but it didn't take an
  expert to see that a B-36, even one piloted by an experienced idiot, could not do what the UFO had done - buzz a DC-3
  that was in an airport traffic pattern.
</p>
<p>I didn't know it at the time but a similar event had occurred the year before. On the night of May 29, 1950, the crew
  of an American Airlines DC-6 had just taken off from Washington National Airport, and they were about seven miles west
  of Mount Vernon when the copilot suddenly looked out and yelled, "Watch it - watch it." The pilot and the engineer
  looked out to see a bluish white light closing in on them from dead ahead. The pilot racked the DC-6 up in a tight
  right turn while the UFO passed by on the left "from eleven to seven o'clock" and a little higher than the airliner.
  During this time the UFO passed between the full moon and DC-6 and the crew could see the dark silhouette of a
  "wingless B-29." Its length was about half the diameter of the full moon, and it had a blue flame shooting out the
  tail end.
</p>
<p>Seconds after the UFO had passed by the DC-6, the copilot looked out and there it was again, apparently flying
  formation off their right wing. Then in a flash of blue flame it was gone - streaking out ahead of the airliner and
  making a left turn toward the coast.
</p>
<p>The pilot of the DC-6, who made the report, had better than 15,000 hours' flying time.
</p>
<p>I didn't hear anything about UFO's, or flying saucers, as they were then known, for several weeks but I kept them in
  mind and one day I asked one of the old hands at ATIC about them - specifically I wanted to know about the Sioux City
  Incident. Why had it been sloughed off so lightly? His answer was typical of the official policy at that time. "One of
  these days all of these crazy pilots will kill themselves, the crazy people on the ground will be locked up, and there
  won't be any more flying saucer reports."
</p>
<p>But after I knew the people at ATIC a little better, I found that being anti saucer wasn't a unanimous feeling. Some
  of the intelligence officers took the UFO reports seriously. One man, who had been on Project Sign since it was
  organized back in 1947, was convinced that the UFO's were interplanetary spaceships. He had questioned the people in
  the control tower at Godman AFB when Captain Mantell was killed chasing the UFO, and he had spent hours talking to the
  crew of the DC-3 that was buzzed near Montgomery, Alabama, by a "cigar shaped UFO that spouted blue flame." In
  essence, he knew UFO history from A to Z because he had "been there."
</p>
<p>I think that it was this controversial thinking that first aroused my interest in the subject of UFO's and led me to
  try to sound out a few more people.
</p>
<p>The one thing that stood out to me, being unindoctrinated in the ways of UFO lore, was the schizophrenic approach so
  many people at ATIC took. On the surface they sided with the belly laughers on any saucer issue, but if you were alone
  with them and started to ridicule the subject, they defended it or at least took an active interest. I learned this
  one day after I'd been at ATIC about a month.
</p>
<p>A belated UFO report had come in from Africa. One of my friends was reading it, so I asked him if I could take a look
  at it when he had finished. In a few minutes he handed it to me.
</p>
<p>When I finished with the report I tossed it back on my friend's desk, with some comment about the whole world's being
  nuts. I got a reaction I didn't expect; he wasn't so sure the whole world was nuts - maybe the nuts were at ATIC.
  "What's the deal?" I asked him. "Have they really thoroughly checked out every report and found that there's nothing
  to any of them?"</p>
<p>He told me that he didn't think so, he'd been at ATIC a long time. He hadn't ever worked on the UFO project, but he
  had seen many of their reports and knew what they were doing. He just plain didn't buy a lot of their explanations.
  "And I'm not the only one who thinks this," he added.
</p>
<p>"Then why all of the big show of power against the UFO reports?" I remember asking him.
</p>
<p>"The powers-that-be are anti flying saucer," he answered about half bitterly, "and to stay in favor it behooves one
  to follow suit."
</p>
<p>As of February 1951 this was the UFO project.
</p>
<p>The words "flying saucer" didn't come up again for a month or two. I'd forgotten all about the two words and was
  deeply engrossed in making an analysis of the performance of the Mig-15. The Mig had just begun to show up in Korea,
  and finding out more about it was a hot project.
</p>
<p>Then the words "flying saucer" drifted across the room once more. But this time instead of belly laughter there was a
  note of hysteria.
</p>
<p>It seems that a writer from Life magazine was doing some research on UFO's and rumor had it that Life was thinking
  about doing a feature article. The writer had gone to the Office of Public Information in the Pentagon and had
  inquired about the current status of Project Grudge. To accommodate the writer, the OPI had sent a wire out to ATIC:
  What is the status of Project Grudge?
</p>
<p>Back went a snappy reply: Everything is under control; each new report is being thoroughly analyzed by our experts;
  our vast files of reports are in tiptop shape; and in general things are hunky-dunky. All UFO reports are hoaxes,
  hallucinations, and the misidentification of known objects.
</p>
<p>Another wire from Washington: Fine, Mr. Bob Ginna of Life is leaving for Dayton. He wants to check some reports.
</p>
<p>Bedlam in the raw.
</p>
<p>Other magazines had printed UFO stories, and other reporters had visited ATIC, but they had always stayed in the
  offices of the top brass. For some reason the name Life, the prospects of a feature story, and the feeling that this
  Bob Ginna was going to ask questions caused sweat to flow at ATIC.
</p>
<p>Ginna arrived and the ATIC UFO "expert" talked to him. Ginna later told me about the meeting. He had a long list of
  questions about reports that had been made over the past four years and every time he asked a question, the "expert"
  would go tearing out of the room to try to find the file that had the answer. I remember that day people spent a lot
  of time ripping open bundles of files and pawing through them like a bunch of gophers. Many times, "I'm sorry, that's
  classified," got ATIC out of a tight spot. </p>
<p>Ginna, I can assure you, was not at all impressed by the "efficiently operating UFO project." People weren't buying
  the hoax, hallucination, and misidentification stories quite as readily as the Air Force believed.
</p>
<p>Where it started or who started it I don't know, but about two months after the visit from Life's representative the
  official interest in UFO's began to pick up. Lieutenant Jerry Cummings, who had recently been recalled to active duty,
  took over the project.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Cummings is the type of person who when given a job to do does it. In a few weeks the operation of the UFO
  project had improved considerably. But the project was still operating under political, economic, and manpower
  difficulties. Cummings' desk was right across from mine, so I began to get a UFO indoctrination via bull sessions.
  Whenever Jerry found a good report in the pile - and all he had to start with was a pile of papers and files - he'd
  toss it over for me to read.
</p>
<p>Some of the reports were unimpressive, I remember. But a few were just the opposite. Two that I remember Jerry's
  showing me made me wonder how the UFO's could be sloughed off so lightly. The two reports involved movies taken by Air
  Force technicians at White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico.
</p>
<p>The guided missile test range at White Sands is fully instrumented to track high, fast-moving objects - the guided
  missiles. Located over an area of many square miles there are camera stations equipped with cinetheodolite cameras and
  linked together by a telephone system.
</p>
<p>On April 27, 1950, a guided missile had been fired, and as it roared up into the stratosphere and fell back to earth,
  the camera crews had recorded its flight. All the crews had started to unload their cameras when one of them spotted
  an object streaking across the sky. By April 1950 every person at White Sands was UFO conscious, so one member of the
  camera crew grabbed a telephone headset, alerted the other crews, and told them to get pictures. Unfortunately only
  one camera had film in it, the rest had already been unloaded, and before they could reload, the UFO was gone. The
  photos from the one station showed only a smudgy dark object. About all the film proved was that something was in the
  air and whatever it was, it was moving.
</p>
<p>Alerted by this first chance to get a UFO to "run a measured course," the camera crews agreed to keep a sharper
  lookout. They also got the official O.K. to "shoot" a UFO if one appeared.</p>
<p>Almost exactly a month later another UFO did appear, or at least at the time the camera crews thought that it was a
  UFO. This time the crews were ready - when the call went out over the telephone net that a UFO had been spotted, all
  of the crews scanned the sky. Two of the crews saw it and shot several feet of film as the shiny, bright object
  streaked across the sky.
</p>
<p>As soon as the missile tests were completed, the camera crews rushed their film to the processing lab and then took
  it to the Data Reduction Group. But once again the UFO had eluded man because there were apparently two or more UFO's
  in the sky and each camera station had photographed a separate one. The data were no good for triangulation.
</p>
<p>The records at ATIC didn't contain the analysis of these films but they did mention the Data Reduction Group at White
  Sands. So when I later took over the UFO investigation I made several calls in an effort to run down the actual film
  and the analysis. The files at White Sands, like all files, evidently weren't very good, because the original reports
  were gone. I did contact a major who was very cooperative and offered to try to find the people who had worked on the
  analysis of the film. His report, after talking to two men who had done the analysis, was what I'd expected - nothing
  concrete except that the UFO's were unknowns. He did say that by putting a correction factor in the data gathered by
  the two cameras they were able to arrive at a rough estimate of speed, altitude, and size. The UFO was "higher than
  40,000 feet, traveling over 2,000 miles per hour, and it was over 300 feet in diameter." He cautioned me, however,
  that these figures were only estimates, based on the possibly erroneous correction factor; therefore they weren't
  proof of anything - except that something was in the air.
</p>
<p>The people at White Sands continued to be on the alert for UFO's while the camera stations were in operation because
  they realized that if the flight path of a UFO could be accurately plotted and timed it could be positively
  identified. But no more UFO's showed up.
</p>
<p>One day Lieutenant Cummings came over to my desk and dropped a stack of reports in front of me. "All radar reports,"
  he said, "and I'm getting more and more of them every day."
</p>
<p>Radar reports, I knew, had always been a controversial point in UFO history, and if more and more radar reports were
  coming in, there was no doubt that an already controversial issue was going to be compounded.
</p>
<p>To understand why there is always some disagreement whenever a flying saucer is picked up on radar, it is necessary
  to know a little bit about how radar operates.
</p>
<p>Basically radar is nothing but a piece of electronic equipment that "shouts" out a radio wave and "listens" for the
  echo. By "knowing" how fast the radio, or radar, wave travels and from which direction the echo is coming, the radar
  tells the direction and distance of the object that is causing the echo. Any "solid" object like an airplane, bird,
  ship, or even a moisture laden cloud can cause a radar echo. When the echo comes back to the radar set, the radar
  operator doesn't have to listen for it and time it because this is all done for him by the radar set and he sees the
  "answer" on his radarscope - a kind of a round TV screen. What the radar operator sees is a bright dot, called a
  "blip" or a "return." The location of the return on the scope tells him the location of the object that was causing
  the echo. As the object moves through the sky, the radar operator sees a series of bright dots on his scope that make
  a track. On some radar sets the altitude of the target, the object causing the echo, can also be measured.
</p>
<p>Under normal conditions the path that the radar waves take as they travel through the air is known. Normal conditions
  are when the temperature and relative humidity of the air decrease with an increase in altitude. But sometimes a
  condition will occur where at some level, instead of the temperature and/or relative humidity decreasing with
  altitude, it will begin to increase. This layer of warm, moist air is known as an inversion layer, and it can do all
  kinds of crazy things to a radar wave. It can cause part of the radar wave to travel in a big arc and actually pick up
  the ground many miles away. Or it can cause the wave to bend down just enough to pick up trucks, cars, houses, or
  anything that has a surface perpendicular to the ground level.
</p>
<p>One would immediately think that since the ground or a house isn't moving, and a car or truck is moving only 40, 50,
  or 60 miles an hour, a radar operator should be able to pick these objects out from a fast-moving target. But it isn't
  as simple as that. The inversion layer shimmers and moves, and one second the radar may be picking up the ground or a
  truck in one spot and the next second it may be picking up something in a different spot. This causes a series of
  returns on the scope and can give the illusion of extremely fast or slow speeds.
</p>
<p>These are but a few of the effects of an inversion layer on radar. Some of the effects are well known, but others
  aren't. The 3rd Weather Group at Air Defense Command Headquarters in Colorado Springs has done a lot of work on the
  effects of weather on radar, and they have developed mathematical formulas for telling how favorable weather
  conditions are for "anomalous propagation," the two-bit words for false radar targets caused by weather.
</p>
<p>The first problem in analyzing reports of UFO's being picked up on radar is to determine if the weather conditions
  are right to give anomalous propagation. This can be determined by putting weather data into a formula. If they are,
  then it is necessary to determine whether the radar targets were real or caused by the weather. This is the difficult
  job. In most cases the only answer is the appearance of the target on the radar-scope. Many times a weather target
  will be a fuzzy and indistinct spot on the scope while a real target, an airplane for example, will be bright and
  sharp. This question of whether a target looked real is the cause of the majority of the arguments about radar
  detected UFO's because it is up to the judgment of the radar operator as to what the target looked like. And whenever
  human judgment is involved in a decision, there is plenty of room for an argument.
</p>
<p>Pendant tout le début de l'été <a href="../../../1/index.html">1951</a> le lieutenant <a
    href="/people/c/CummingsJerry">Cummings</a> <q>combattit le syndicat</q>, essayant de rendre l'ovni
  respectable. All the time I was continuing to get my indoctrination. Puis un jour avec la vitesse d'un shotgun
  wedding, la respectabilité longtemps attendue arriva. La date était le 12 septembre <a href="../../../1/index.html">1951</a>,
  et l'heure exacte <time>15:04</time>.</p>
<p>Ce jour à cette heure-là une téléscripteuse de la <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html">base aérienne de
  Wright-Patterson</a> commença à taper un message. 36 pouces de papier sortirent de la la machine avant que l'opérateur
  découpe la copie, l'estampille <em>Operational Immediate</em>, et la donne à un messager special pour qu'il la
  transmette à l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a>. Le lieutenant Cummings eut le message. Le
  rapport venait du centre <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar/index.html">radar</a> du Corps des Signaux
  de l'Armée à Fort Monmouth, dans le New Jersey, et était chaud bouillant.</p>
<p><a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/FortMonmouth/index.html">L'incident</a> avait commencé 2 jours plus tôt,
  le 10 septembre, à <time>11:10</time>, alors qu'un opérateur apprenti faisait une démonstration à un groupe de brass
  en visite à l'école <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar/index.html">radar</a>. Il fit une démonstration
  du dispositif sous contrôle manuel pendant un moment, repérant un traffic aérien local, pui annonça qu'il allait faire
  la démonstration du repérage automatique, lors duquel le dispositif est fixé sur une cible et la suit sans aide de
  l'opérateur. Le dispositif put suivre des objets volant à des vitesses de jet.</p>
<p>L'opérateur repéra un objet à 12 000 yards environ au sud-est de la station, volant bas vers le nord. Il tenta de
  basculer le dispositif en repérage automatique. Il n'y réussit pas, essaya à nouveau, toujours sans succès. Il se
  tourna vers son public de VIPs, embarrassé.</p>
<p><q>Ca va trop vite pour le dispositif</q>, dit-il. <q>Ca veut dire que ça va plus vite qu'un jet !</q></p>
<p>Tout un lot de sourcils importants se soulevèrent. Qu'est-ce qui vole plus vite qu'un jet ?</p>
<p>L'objet fut à portée radar pendant 3 mn et l'opérateur continua d'essayer, sans succès, de passer en repérage
  automatique. La cible finit par sortir de l'écran, laissa l'opérateur au visage rougi se parler à lui-même.</p>
<p>Les techniciens radar de Fort Monmouth avaient vérifié la météo - il n'y avait pas la moindre indication d'une couche
  d'inversion.</p>
<p>25 mn plus tard le pilote d'un jet d'entraînement T-33, transportant un major de l'Air Force comme passager et volant
  à 20 000 pieds au-dessus de Point Pleasant (New Jersey), repéra un objet à l'apparence de disque argenté mat, loin
  en-dessous de lui. Il le décrivit comme faisant 30 à 50 pieds de diamètre et descendant vers Sandy Hook depuis une
  altitude de 1 mile à peu près. Il banked the T-33 over and started down after it. As he shot down, he reported, the
  object stopped its descent, hovered, then sped south, made a 120 degree turn, and vanished out to sea.</p>
<p>L'incident de Fort Monmouth rebascula alors vers le groupe <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar/index.html">radar</a>. A <time>15:15</time> ils reçurent un appel
  excité, presque frénétique de quartiers-généraux pour repérer une cible élevée et au nord - qui se trouvait là où le
  1er objet "plus rapide qu'un jet" avait disparu - et de le repérer vite. Ils got a fix on it et rapportèrent qu'il se
  déplaçait lentement à 93 000 pieds. Ils purent aussi le voir visuellement sous la forme d'un speck argenté.</p>
<p>Qu'est-ce qui vole à 18 miles au-dessus de la terre ?</p>
<p>Le matin suivant 2 dispositifs <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar/index.html">radar</a> repérèrent une
  autre cible qui ne put être suivie automatiquement. Elle montait, restait stable, montait à nouveau, partait dans une
  plongée. Lorsqu'elle montait elle partait presque à la verticale.</p>
<p>La sensation de 2 jours se termina cet après-midi-là lorsque le <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar/index.html">radar</a> repéra un autre objet non-identifié en
  déplacement lent et le suivit pendant plusieurs mn.</p>
<p>Une copie du message était aussi allée à Washington. Avant que Jerry n'ai pu digérer les 36 pouces de faits, le
  nouveau chef de l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a>, le colonel Frank Dunn, eut un appel
  téléphonique. Il venait du bureau du Directeur du Renseignement de l'Air Force, le géneral major (aujourd'hui général
  lieutenant) <a href="/people/c/CabellCharlesPearre/index.html">C. P. Cabell</a>. Le général <a
      href="/people/c/CabellCharlesPearre/index.html">Cabell</a> voulait que quelqu'un de l'<a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> vienne au New Jersey - vite - et détermine ce qui se passait.
  Aussitôt que les rapports avaient été examinés en profondeur, le général dit qu'il voulait un rapport personnel
  complet. Rien n'est aussi expéditif qu'un appel téléphonique d'un officier général, et donc en quelques heures le
  lieutenant <a href="/people/c/CummingsJerry">Cummings</a> et le lieutenant-colonel <a
      href="/people/r/RosengartenNR">N. R. Rosengarten</a> étaient dans un avion de ligne pour le New Jersey.</p>
<p>Les 2 officiers travaillèrent jour et nuit à interroger les opérateurs radar, leurs instructeurs, et les techniciens
  de <a href="/org/us/state/nj/FortMonmouth/index.html">Fort Monmouth</a>. Le pilote qui avait pris en chasse l'ovni
  dans le T-33 d'entraînement et son passager furent envoyés à New York, et parlèrent à <a
      href="/people/c/CummingsJerry">Cummings</a> and <a href="/people/r/RosengartenNR">Rosengarten</a>.
  Toutes les autres stations radar de la zone furent vérifiées, mais leurs radars n'avaient rien repéré d'inhabituel.

<p>Vers <time>04:00</time> le 2nd matin après leur arrivée, l'enquête était terminée, dira plus tard <a
    href="/people/c/CummingsJerry">Cummings</a>. Lui et le lieutenant-colonel <a
    href="/people/r/RosengartenNR">Rosengarten</a> ne purent avoir un vol pour quitter New York à temps pour les
  amener au <a href="/org/us/state/wa/pentagone/index.html">Pentagone</a> pour <time>10:00</time>, heure qui avait été
  fixée pour
  leur rapport, et ils chartered donc un avion et partirent à la capitale briefer le général.</p>
<p>Le général <a href="/people/c/CabellCharlesPearre/index.html">Cabell</a> presided over the meeting, and it was
  attended by his entire staff plus Lieutenant Cummings, Lieutenant Colonel Rosengarten, and a special representative
  from Republic Aircraft Corporation. The man from Republic supposedly represented a group of top U.S. industrialists
  and scientists who thought that there should be a lot more sensible answers coming from the Air Force regarding the
  UFO's. The man was at the meeting at the personal request of a general officer.</p>
<p>Chaque mot de la réunion de 2 heures fut enregistré on a wire recorder. L'enregistrement était si chaud qu'il fut
  détruit par la suite, mais pas avant que je l'ai écouté plusieurs fois. Je ne peux pas dire tout ce qui a été dit
  mais, pour dire le moins, ça ne suivait pas exactement le ton des communiqués de presse officiels de l'Air Force -
  nombre des gens présents à la réunion n'étaient pas aussi convaincus que la réponse en terme de <q><a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/canular/index.html">canulars</a>, hallucinations et <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/index.html">méprises</a></q> était aussi catégorique que le rapport <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge/index.html">Grudge</a> et les communiqués précédés l'avaient dit.</p>
<p>Vers le fin de la conférence de 2 h un général demanda au lieutenant <a
    href="/people/c/CummingsJerry">Cummings</a> de passer en revue l'activité de l'enquête sur les ovnis sur
  l'année et demie passée. Peut-être était-ce juste un manque de sommeil, ou peut-être était-ce juste <a
      href="/people/c/CummingsJerry">Cummings</a>, mais le général eut la réponse directe - for all practical purposes
  the project was dead. Puis <a href="/people/c/CummingsJerry">Cummings</a> proceeded to elaborate on the
  details, the attitude at ATIC, the opposition to his reorganizing the project, and the methods of processing reports.
  Lieutenant <a href="/people/c/CummingsJerry">Cummings</a> didn't miss a point. He later told me that all of the
  generals and about three fourths of the full colonels present at the meeting turned the shade of purple normally
  associated with rage while a sort of sickly grin graced the faces of the remaining few. Then one of the generals on
  the purple- faced team glared at the sickly grin team and cut loose.</p>
<p>La 1ère chose que le général voulait savoir était, <q>Who in hell has been giving me these reports that every decent
  flying saucer sighting is being investigated?</q></p>
<p>Then others picked up the questioning.
</p>
<p><q>"What happened to those 2 reports that General sent in from Saudi Arabia? He saw those 2 flying saucers
  himself." </q></p>
<p><q>"And who released this big report, anyway?"</q> another person added, picking up a copy of the Grudge Report and
  slamming it back down on the table.
</p>
<p>Le lieutenant <a href="/people/c/CummingsJerry">Cummings</a> et le lieutenant-colonel <a
    href="/people/r/RosengartenNR">Rosengarten</a> revinrent à l'<a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> avec ordre de mettre en place un nouveau projet et rapporter au
  général <a href="/people/c/CabellCharlesPearre/index.html">Cabell</a> lorsqu'il serait prêt. But <a
      href="/people/c/CummingsJerry">Cummings</a> didn't get a chance to do much work on the new revitalized
  Project <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge/index.html">Grudge</a> - it was to keep the old name - because
  in a few days he was a civilian. He'd been released from active duty because he was needed back at Cal Tech, where
  he'd been working on an important government project before his recall to active duty.</p>
<p>The day after <a href="/people/c/CummingsJerry">Cummings</a> got his separation orders, Lieutenant Colonel <a
    href="/people/r/RosengartenNR">Rosengarten</a> called me into his office. The colonel was chief of the Aircraft
  and Missiles branch and one of his many responsibilities was Project Grudge. He said that he knew that I was busy as
  group leader of my regular group but, if he gave me enough people, could I take Project Grudge? All he wanted me to do
  was to get it straightened out and operating; then I could go back to trying to outguess the Russians. He threw in a
  few comments about the good job I'd done straightening out other foul-up projects. Good old "Rosy." With my ego
  sufficiently inflated, I said yes.</p>
<p>On many later occasions, when I'd land at home in Dayton just long enough for a clean clothes resupply, or when the
  telephone would ring at 2:00 A.M. to report a new "hot" sighting and wake up the baby, Mrs. Ruppelt and I have soundly
  cussed my ego.
</p>
<p>I had had the project only a few days when a minor flurry of good UFO reports started. It wasn't supposed to happen
  because the day after I'd taken over Project Grudge I'd met the ex-UFO "expert" in the hall and he'd nearly doubled up
  with laughter as he said something about getting stuck with Project Grudge. He predicted that I wouldn't get a report
  until the newspapers began to play up flying saucers again. "It's all mass hysteria," he said.
</p>
<p>The first hysterical report of the flurry came from the Air Defense Command. On September 23, 1951, at seven
  fifty-five in the morning, two F-86's on an early patrol were approaching Long Beach, California, coming in on the
  west leg of the Long Beach Radio range. All of a sudden the flight leader called his ground controller - high at
  twelve o'clock he and his wing man saw an object. It was in a gradual turn to its left, and it wasn't another
  airplane. The ground controller checked his radars but they had nothing, so the ground controller called the leader of
  the F-86's back and told him to go after the object and try to identify it. The two airplanes started to climb.
</p>
<p>By this time the UFO had crossed over them but it was still in a turn and was coming back. Several times they tried
  to intercept, but they could never climb up to it. Once in a while, when they'd appear to be getting close, the UFO
  would lazily move out of range by climbing slightly. All the time it kept orbiting to the left in a big, wide circle.
  After about ten minutes the flight leader told the ground controller, who had been getting a running account of the
  unsuccessful intercept, that their fuel was low and that they'd have to break off soon. They'd gotten a fairly good
  look at the UFO, the flight leader told the ground controller, and it appeared to be a silver airplane with highly
  swept back wings. The controller acknowledged the message and said that he was scrambling all his alert airplanes from
  George AFB. Could the two F-86's stay in the area a few more minutes? They stayed and in a few minutes four more
  F-86's arrived. They saw the UFO immediately and took over.
</p>
<p>The two F-86's with nearly dry tanks went back to George AFB.
</p>
<p>For thirty more minutes the newly arrived F-86's worked in pairs trying to get up to the UFO's altitude, which they
  estimated to be 55,000 feet, but they couldn't make it. All the time the UFO kept slowly circling and speeding up only
  when the F-86's seemed to get too close. Then they began to run out of fuel and asked for permission to break off the
  intercept.
</p>
<p>By this time one remaining F-86 had been alerted and was airborne toward Long Beach. He passed the four homeward
  bound F-86's as he was going in, but by the time he arrived over Long Beach the UFO was gone.
</p>
<p>All the pilots except one reported a "<q>silver airplane with highly swept back wings</q>." One pilot said the UFO
  looked round and silver to him.
</p>
<p>The report ended with a comment by the local intelligence officer. He'd called Edwards AFB, the big Air Force test
  base north of Los Angeles, but they had nothing in the air. The officer concluded that the UFO was no airplane. In
  1951 nothing we had would fly higher than the F-86.
</p>
<p>This was a good report and I decided to dig in. First I had some more questions I wanted to ask the pilots. I was
  just in the process of formulating this set of questions when three better reports came in. They automatically got a
  higher priority than the Long Beach Incident.
