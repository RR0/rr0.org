<p>Lorsque 4 professeurs de collège, un géologue, un chimiste, un physicien et un ingénieur en pétrole, rapportent avoir
  vu le même ovni en 14 occasions différentes, l'événement peut être classé comme, au moins, inhabituel. Ajoutez les
  faits que des centaines d'autres personnes ont virent ces ovnis et qu'ils furent photographiés, et qu'histoire devient
  encore meilleure. Ajoutez quelques faits de plus - que ces ovnis furent repérés au radar et que quelques personnes
  eurent un aperçu de près de l'un d'entre eux, et l'histoire commence à convaincre même les <a
      href="../../../../../../../analyse/Scepticisme.html">sceptiques</a> les plus ardents.
</p>
<p>Ce fut la situation le jour où les signalements des <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Lubbock">Lumières de
  Lubbock</a> arrivèrent à l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a>. En fait les <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Lubbock">Lumières de Lubbock</a>, comme les appele le <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">projet Blue Book</a>, impliquèrent de nombreux rapports largement
  répandus. Certains de ces incidents sont connus du public, mais ceux qui ajoutèrent de l'emphase et de l'intrigue au
  cas et aboutirent à ce que des centaines d'heures soient passées à analyser les rapports n'ont jamais été relatés
  auparavant. Nous avons recueilli tous ces rapports sous le même titre parce qu'ils apparaissait y avoir un lien entre
  eux.
</p>
<p>Le 1er mot sur les observations attint l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> fin
  <time>1951-09</time>, lorsque la préposée au courrier lâcha les lettres dans mon panier "arrivées". Une des lettres
  venait d'Albuquerque, au Nouveau Mexique, 1 était d'une petite ville dans l'état de Washington, où je savais qu'était
  située une station <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a> du Commandement de Défense
  Aérienne, et l'autre de la base aérienne de Reese à Lubbock, au Texas.
</p>
<p>J'ouvris la lettre de d'Albuquerque d'abord. C'était un rapport de 34ème Défense Aérienne à la <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/base/KirtlandAFB.html">base aérienne de Kirtland</a>. Le rapport disant que la suit du 25 août
  <a href="../../../1/index.html">1951</a>, un employé de la super secrète Sandia Corporation de la <a
      href="/org/us/AEC.html">Commission à l'Energie Atomique</a> et sa femme avaient vu un ovni. Vers le crépuscule ils
  étaient assis dans le jardin de leur maison sur les périphéries d'Albuquerque. Ils contemplaient le ciel de la nuit,
  commentant sa beauté, lorsqu'ils furent tous 2 startled à la vue d'un énorme avion volant vite et silencieusement
  au-dessus de leur maison. L'avion n'avait été en vue que quelques secondes mais ils en avaient eut un bonne apperçu
  car il était très bas. Il estimèrent entre 800 à 1000 pieds. Il était de la forme d'une <q>aile volante</q> et de 1
  fois 1/2 la taille d'un B-36. L'aile était sharply swept back, almost like a V. Both the husband and wife had seen
  B-36's over their home many times. They couldn't see the color of the UFO but they did notice that there were dark
  bands running across the wing from front to back. On the aft edge of the wings there were six to eight pairs of soft,
  glowing, bluish lights. The aircraft had passed over their house from north to south.
</p>
<p>The report went on to say that an investigation had been made immediately. Since the object might have been a
  conventional airplane, air traffic was checked. A commercial airlines Constellation was 50 miles west of Albuquerque
  and an Air Force B-25 was south of the city, but there had been nothing over Albuquerque that evening. The man's back
  ground was checked. He had a "Q" security clearance. This summed up his character, oddballs don't get "Q" clearances.
  No one else had reported the UFO, but this could be explained by the fact the <a href="/org/us/AEC.html">AEC</a>
  employee and his wife lived in such a location that anything passing over their home from north to south wouldn't pass
  over or near very many other houses. A sketch of the UFO was enclosed in the report.
</p>
<p>I picked up the letter from Lubbock next. It was a thick report, and from the photographs that were attached, it
  looked interesting. I thumbed through it and stopped at the photos. The first thing that struck me was the similarity
  between these photos and the report I'd just read. They showed a series of lights in a V shape, very similar to those
  described as being on the aft edge of the "flying wing" that was reported from Albuquerque. This was something unique,
  so I read the report in detail.
</p>
<p>La nuit du <time>1951-08-25 ~21:20</time>, juste <time>P20M</time> après l'observation d'Albuquerque, 4 professeurs
  de collège du Collège Technologique du Texas à Lubbock avaient observé une formation de lumières soft, glowing, bluish
  green passer au-dessus de leur maison. Plusieurs heures plus tard ils virent un groupe similaire de lumière et dans
  les 2 semaines suivantes en virent au moins 10 de plus. Le 31 août un photographe amateur avait pris 5 photos des
  lumières. Egalement le 31, 2 femmes avaient vu un grand objet <q>couleur aluminum</q>, <q>en forme de poire</q> en
  survol près d'une route au nord de Lubbock. Le report went into the details of these sightings and enclosed a set of
  the photos that had been taken.
</p>
<p>This report, in itself, was a good UFO report, but the similarity to the Albuquerque sighting, both in the
  description of the object and the time that it was seen, was truly amazing.
</p>
<p>I almost overlooked the report from the radar station because it was fairly short. It said that early on the morning
  of August 26, only a few hours after the Lubbock sighting, two different radars had shown a target traveling 900 miles
  per hour at 13000 pieds on a northwesterly heading. The target had been observed for 6 mn and an F-86 jet interceptor
  had been scrambled but by the time the F-86 had climbed into the air the target was gone. The last paragraph in the
  report was rather curt and to the point. It was apparently in anticipation of the comments the report would draw. It
  said that the target was not caused by weather. The officer in charge of the radar station and several members of his
  crew had been operating radar for seven years and they could recognize a weather target. This target was real.
</p>
<p>I quickly took out a map of the United States and drew in a course line between Lubbock and the radar station. A UFO
  flying between these two points would be on a northwesterly heading and the times it was seen at the two places gave
  it a speed of roughly 900 miles/h.
</p>
<p>This was by far the best combination of UFO reports I'd ever read and I'd read every one in the Air Force's files.
</p>
<p>The first thing I did after reading the reports was to rush a set of the Lubbock photos to the intelligence officer
  of the 34th Air Division in Albuquerque. I asked him to show the photos to the AEC employee and his wife without
  telling them what they were. I requested an answer by wire. Later the next day I received my answer: <q>"Observers
    immediately said that this is what they saw on the night of 25 August. Details by airmail</q>." The details were a
  sketch the man and his wife had made of a wing around the photo of the Lubbock Lights. The number of lights in the
  photo and the number of lights the two observers had seen on the wing didn't tally, but they explained this by saying
  that they could have been wrong in their estimate.
</p>
<p>The next day I flew to Lubbock to see if I could find an answer to all of these mysterious happenings.
</p>
<p>I arrived in Lubbock about 5:00 P.M. and contacted the intelligence officer at Reese AFB. He knew that I was on my
  way and had already set up a meeting with the four professors. Right after dinner we met them.
</p>
<p>If a group had been hand-picked to observe a UFO, we couldn't have picked a more technically qualified group of
  people. They were:
</p>
<p>Dr. W. I. Robinson, Professor of Geology.
</p>
<p>Dr. A. G. Oberg, Professor of Chemical Engineering.
</p>
<p>Professor W. L. Ducker, Head of the Petroleum Engineering Department.
</p>
<p>Dr. George, Professor of Physics.
</p>
<p>This is their story:
</p>
<p>On the evening of August 25 the four men were sitting in Dr. Robinson's back yard. They were discussing micro
  meteorites and drinking tea. They jokingly stressed this point. At nine twenty a formation of lights streaked across
  the sky directly over their heads. It all happened so fast that none of them had a chance to get a good look. One of
  the men mentioned that he had always admonished his students for not being more observant; now he was in that spot. He
  and his colleagues realized they could remember only a few details of what they had seen. The lights were a weird
  bluish green color and they were in a semicircular formation. They estimated that there were from fifteen to thirty
  separate lights and that they were moving from north to south. Their one wish at this time was that the lights would
  reappear. They did; about an hour later the lights went over again. This time the professors were a little better
  prepared. With the initial shock worn off, they had time to get a better look. The details they had remembered from
  the first flight checked. There was one difference; in this flight the lights were not in any orderly formation, they
  were just in a group.
</p>
<p>The professors reasoned that if the UFO's appeared twice they might come back. Come back they did. The next night and
  apparently many times later, as the professors made twelve more observations during the next few weeks. For these
  later sightings they added two more people to their observing team.
</p>
<p>Being methodical, as college professors are, they made every attempt to get a good set of data. They measured the
  angle through which the objects traveled and timed them. The several flights they checked traveled through 90 degrees
  of sky in three seconds, or 30 degrees per second. The lights usually suddenly appeared 45 degrees above the northern
  horizon, and abruptly went out 45 degrees above the southern horizon. They always traveled in this north-to-south
  direction. Outside of the first flight, in which the objects were in a roughly semicircular formation, in none of the
  rest of the flights did they note any regular pattern. 2 or 3 flights were often seen in one night.
</p>
<p>They had tried to measure the altitude, with no success. First they tried to compare the lights to the height of
  clouds but the clouds were never near the lights, or vice versa. Next they tried a more elaborate scheme. They
  measured off a base line perpendicular to the objects' usual flight path. Friends of the professors made up two teams.
  Each of the two teams was equipped with elevation measuring devices, and one team was stationed at each end of the
  base line. The 2 teams were linked together by two-way radios. If they sighted the objects they would track and time
  them, thus getting the speed and altitude.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately neither team ever saw the lights. But the lights never seemed to want to run the course. The wives of
  some of the watchers claimed to have seen them from their homes in the city. This later proved to be a clue.
</p>
<p>The professors were not the sole observers of the mysterious lights. For two weeks hundreds of other people for miles
  around Lubbock reported that they saw the same lights. The professors checked many of these reports against the times
  of the flights they had seen and recorded, and many checked out close. They attempted to question these observers as
  to the length of time they had seen the lights and angles at which they had seen them, but the professors learned what
  I already knew, people are poor observers.
</p>
<p>Naturally there has been much discussion among the professors and their friends as to the nature of the lights. A few
  simple mathematical calculations showed that if the lights were very high they would be traveling very fast. The
  possibility that they were some natural phenomena was, of course, discussed and seriously considered. The professors
  did a lot of thinking and research and decided that if they were natural phenomena they were something altogether new.
  Dr. George, who has since died, studied the phenomena of the night sky during his years as a professor at the
  University of Alaska, and he had never seen or heard of anything like this before.
</p>
<p>This was the professors' story. It was early in the morning when we returned to Reese AFB. I sat up a few more hours
  unsuccessfully trying to figure out what they had seen.
</p>
<p>The next day I again met the intelligence officer and we went to talk to Carl Hart, Jr., the amateur photographer who
  had taken the pictures of the lights. Hart was a freshman at Texas Tech. His story was that on the night of August 31
  he was lying in his bed in an upstairs room of the Hart home. He, like everyone else in Lubbock, had heard about the
  lights but he had never seen them. It was a warm night and his bed was pushed over next to an open window. He was
  looking out at the clear night sky, and had been in bed about a half hour, when he saw a formation of the lights
  appear in the north, cross an open patch of sky, and disappear over his house. Knowing that the lights might reappear
  as they had done in the past, he grabbed his loaded Kodak 35, set the lens and shutter at f 3.5 and one tenth of a
  second, and went out into the middle of the back yard. Before long his vigil was rewarded when the lights made a
  second pass. He got two pictures. A third formation went over a few minutes later and he got three more pictures. The
  next morning bright and early Hart said he took the roll of unexposed film to a friend who ran a photo finishing shop.
  He explained that he did all of his film processing in this friend's lab. He told the friend about the pictures and
  they quickly developed them.
</p>
<p>I stopped Hart at this point and asked why he didn't get more excited about what could be the biggest news photos of
  the century. He said that the lights had appeared to be so dim that he was sure he didn't have anything on the
  negatives; had he thought that he did have some good pictures he would have awakened his friend to develop the
  negatives right away.
</p>
<p>When he developed the negatives and saw that they showed an image, his friend suggested that he call the newspaper.
  At first the paper wasn't interested but then they decided to run the photos. I later found out that they had done
  some checking of their own.
</p>
<p>We went with Hart into his back yard to re-enact what had taken place. He described the lights as being the same
  dull, glowing bluish green color as those seen by the professors. The formation was different, however. The lights
  Hart saw were always flying in a perfect V. He traced the path from where they appeared over some trees in the north,
  through an open patch of sky over the back yard, to a point where they disappeared over the house. From the flight
  path he pointed out, the lights had crossed about 120 degrees of open sky in four seconds. This 30-degree-per-second
  angular velocity corresponded to the professors' measured angular velocity.
</p>
<p>We made arrangements to borrow Hart's negatives, thanked him for his information, and left.
</p>
<p>Armed with a list of names of other observers of the mysterious lights, the intelligence officer and I started out to
  try to get a cross-section account of the other UFO sightings in the Lubbock area. All the stories about the UFO's
  were the same; various types of formations of dull bluish green lights, generally moving north to south. A few people
  had variations. One lady saw a flying venetian blind and another a flying double boiler. One point of interest was
  that very few claimed to have seen the lights before reading the professors' story in the paper, but this could get
  back to the old question, "Do people look up if they have no reason to do so?"
</p>
<p>We talked to observers in nearby towns. Their stories were the same. Two of them, tower operators at an airport,
  reported that they had seen the lights on several occasions.
</p>
<p>It was in one of these outlying towns, Lamesa, that we talked to an old gentleman, about eighty years old, who gave
  us a good lead. He had seen the lights and he had identified them. Ever since he had read the story in the papers he
  had been looking. One evening he and his wife were in their yard looking for the lights. All of a sudden two or three
  appeared. They were in view for several seconds, then they were gone. In a few minutes the lights did a repeat
  performance. The man admitted he had been scared. He broke off his story of the lights and launched into his
  background as a native Texan, with range wars, Indians, and stage coaches under his belt. What he was trying to point
  out was that despite the range wars, Indians, and stagecoaches, he had been scared. His wife had been scared too. We
  had some difficulty getting back to the lights but we finally made it. The third time they came around, he said, one
  of the lights emitted a sound. It said, "<q>Plover</q>." The old gentleman had immediately identified it as a plover,
  a water bird about the size of a quail. Later that night, and on several other occasions, they had seen the same
  thing. After a few more hair-raising but interesting stories of the old west Texas, we left.
</p>
<p>Our next stop was the federal game warden's office in Lubbock. We got the low-down on plovers. We explained our
  interest and the warden was very helpful. He had been around west Texas all of his life so he was familiar with
  wildlife. The oily white breast of a plover could easily reflect light, but plovers usually didn't travel in more than
  pairs, or three at the most. He had never seen or heard of them traveling in a flock of fifteen to thirty but, of
  course, this wasn't impossible. Ducks, yes, but probably not plovers. He did say that for some unknown reason there
  were more than the usual number of plovers in the area that fall.
</p>
<p>I was anxious to get the negatives that Hart had lent us back to the photo lab at Wright Field, but I had one more
  call to make. I wanted to talk to the two ladies who had seen a strange object hovering near their car, but I also
  wanted to write my report before I left Lubbock. Two Air Force special investigators from Reese AFB offered to talk to
  the ladies, so I stayed at the air base and finished my report.
</p>
<p>That night when the investigators came back, I got the story. They had spent the whole day talking to the ladies and
  doing a little discreet checking into their backgrounds.
</p>
<p>The two ladies, a mother and her daughter, had left their home in Matador, Texas, 70 miles northeast of Lubbock,
  about twelve thirty P.M. on August 31. They were driving along in their car when they suddenly noticed "<q>a pear
    shaped</q>" object about 150 yards ahead of them. It was just off the side of the road, about 120 feet in the air.
  It was drifting slowly to the east, "less than the speed required to take off in a Cub airplane." They drove on down
  the road about 50 more yards, stopped, and got out of the car. The object, which they estimated to be the size of a
  B-29 fuselage, was still drifting along slowly. There was no sign of any exhaust blast and they heard no noise, but
  they did see a "porthole" in the side of the object. In a few seconds the object began to pick up speed and rapidly
  climb out of sight. As it climbed it seemed to have a tight spiraling motion.
</p>
<p>The investigation showed that the 2 ladies were "<q>solid citizens</q>," with absolutely no talents, or reasons, for
  fabricating such a story. The daughter was fairly familiar with aircraft. Her husband was an Air Force officer then in
  Korea, and she had been living near air bases for several years. The ladies had said that the object was
  "<q>drifting</q>" to the east, which possibly indicated that it was moving with the wind, but on further investigation
  it was found that it was moving into the wind.
</p>
<p>The two investigators had worked all day and hadn't come up with the slightest indication of an answer.
</p>
<p>This added the final section to my now voluminous report on the Lubbock affair.
</p>
<p>The next morning as I rode to the airport to catch an airliner back to Dayton I tried to put the whole puzzle
  together. It was hard to believe that all I'd heard was real. Did a huge flying wing pass over Albuquerque and travel
  250 miles to Lubbock in about fifteen minutes? This would be about 900 miles per hour. Did the radar station in
  Washington pick up the same thing? I'd checked the distances on the big wall map in flight operations just before
  leaving Reese AFB. It was 1300 miles from Lubbock to the radar site. From talking to people, we decided that the
  lights were apparently still around Lubbock at 23 h 20 and the radar picked them up just after midnight. They would
  have had to be traveling about 780 miles per hour. This was fairly close to the vitesse de 900 miles/h clocked by the
  2 radars. The photos of the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Lubbock">Lumières de Lubbock</a> checked with
  the description of what the AEC employee and his wife had seen in Albuquerque. Nobody in Lubbock, however, had
  reported seeing a "<q>flying wing</q>" with lights. All of this was swimming around in my mind when I stepped out of
  the staff car at the Lubbock airport.
</p>
<p>My plane had already landed so I checked in at the ticket counter, picked up a morning paper, and ran out and got
  into the airplane. I sat down next to a man wearing a Stetson hat and cowboy boots. I soon found out he was a retired
  rancher from Lubbock.
</p>
<p>On the front page of the paper was an account of a large meteor that had flashed across New Mexico, west Texas and
  Oklahoma the night before. According to the newspaper account, it was very spectacular and had startled a good many
  people in Lubbock. I was interested in the story because I had seen this meteor. It was a spectacular sight and I
  could easily understand how such things could be called UFO's. My seat partner must have noticed that I was reading
  the story of the meteor because he commented that a friend of his, the man who had brought him to the airport, had
  seen it. We talked about the meteor. This led to a discussion of other odd happenings and left a perfect opening for
  him to bring up the Lubbock Lights. He asked me if I'd heard about them. I said that I had heard a few vague stories.
  I hoped that this would stave off any detailed accounts of stories I had been saturated with during the past 5 days,
  but it didn't. I heard all the details all over again.
</p>
<p>As he talked on, I settled back in my seat waiting for a certain thing to happen. Pretty soon it came. The rancher
  hesitated and the tone of his voice changed to a half proud, half apologetic tone. I'd heard this transition many
  times in the past few months; he was going to tell about the UFO that he had seen. He was going to tell how he had
  seen the bluish green lights. I was wrong; what he said knocked me out of my boredom.
</p>
<p>The same night that the college professors had seen their formation of lights his wife had seen something. Nobody in
  Lubbock knew about the story, not even their friends. He didn't want anyone to think he and his wife were crazy. He
  was telling me only because I was a stranger. Just after dark his wife had gone outdoors to take some sheets off the
  clothesline. He was inside the house reading the paper. Suddenly his wife had rushed into the house, as he told the
  story, "<q>as white as the sheets she was carrying</q>." As close as he could remember, he said, this was about ten
  minutes before the professors made their first sighting. He stopped at this point to tell me about his wife, she
  wasn't prone to be "<q>flighty</q>" and she "<q>never made up tales</q>." This character qualification was also
  standard for UFO storytellers. The reason his wife was so upset was that she had seen a large object glide swiftly and
  silently over the house. She said it looked like "<q>an airplane without a body</q>." On the back edge of the wing
  were pairs of glowing bluish lights. The Albuquerque sighting! He said he didn't have any idea what his wife had seen
  but he thought that it was an interesting story.
</p>
<p>It was an interesting story. It hit me right between the eyes. I knew the rancher and his wife couldn't have possibly
  heard the Albuquerque couple's story, only they and a few Air Force people knew about it. The chances of two identical
  stories being made up were infinitesimal, especially since neither of them fitted the standard Lubbock Light
  description. I wondered how many other people in Lubbock, Albuquerque, or any where in the Southwest had seen a
  similar UFO during this period and hesitated to mention it.
</p>
<p>I tried to get a few more facts from the rancher but he'd told me all he knew. At Dallas I boarded an airliner to
  Dayton and he went on to Baton Rouge, never knowing what he'd added to the story of the <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Lubbock">Lumières de Lubbock</a>.
</p>
<p>On the way to Dayton I figured out a plan of attack on the thousands of words of notes I'd taken. The best thing to
  do, I decided, was to treat each sighting in the Lubbock Light series as a separate incident. All of them seemed to be
  dependent upon each other for importance. If the objects that were reported in several of the incidents could be
  identified, the rest would merely become average UFO reports. The photographs taken by Carl Hart, Jr., became number
  one on the agenda.
</p>
<p>As soon as I reached Dayton I took Hart's negatives to the Photo Reconnaissance Laboratory at Wright Field. This
  laboratory, staffed by the Air Force's top photography experts, did all of our analysis of photographs. They went
  right to work on the negatives and soon had a report.
</p>
<p>There had originally been five negatives, but when we asked to borrow them Hart could only produce 4. The negatives
  were badly scratched and dirty because so many people had handled them, so it was difficult to tell the actual
  photographic images from the dust spots and scratches. The first thing that the lab did was to look at each spot on
  the negatives to see if it was an actual photographic image. They found that the photos showed an inverted V formation
  of lights. In each photo the individual image of a light was badly blurred due to motion of the camera, but by careful
  scrutiny of each blurred image they were able to determine that the original lights that Hart had photographed were
  circular, near pinpoint sources of light. Like a bright star, or a distant light bulb. Next they made enlargements
  from the negatives and carefully plotted the position of each light in the formation.
</p>
<p>In each photograph the individual lights in the formation shifted position according to a definite pattern.
</p>
<p>One additional factor that was brought out in the report was that although the photos were taken on a clear night no
  images of the stars could be found in the background. This proved one thing, the lights, which were overexposed in the
  photograph, were a great deal brighter than the stars, or the lights affected the film more than the light from the
  stars.
</p>
<p>This was all that the photos showed. It was impossible to determine the size of each image of the group, speed, or
  altitude.
</p>
<p>The next thing was to try to duplicate what Hart said he had done. I enlisted the aid of several friends and we tried
  to photograph a moving light. When we were talking to Hart in Lubbock, he had taken us to his back yard, where he had
  shot the pictures. He had traced the flight path of lights across the sky. We had him estimate the speed by following
  an imaginary flight of lights across the sky. It came out to about four seconds. We had a camera identical to the one
  that Hart had used and set up a light to move at the same speed as the UFO's had flown. We tried to take photographs.
  In four seconds we could get only 2 poor shots. These were badly blurred, much worse than Hart's, due to the
  one-tenth-of-a-second shutter speed. We repeated our experiment several times, each time with the same results. This
  made a lot of people doubt the authenticity of Hart's photos.
</p>
<p>With the completed photo lab report in my hands, I was still without an answer. The report was interesting but didn't
  prove anything. All I could do was to get opinions from as qualified sources as I could find. A physiologist at the
  Aeromedical Laboratory knocked out the timing theory immediately by saying that if Hart had been excited he could have
  easily taken three photos in four seconds if we could get two in four seconds in our experiment. Several professional
  photographers, one of them a top Life photographer, said that if Hart was familiar with his camera and was familiar
  with panning action shots, his photos would have shown much less blur than ours. I recalled what I heard about Hart's
  having photographed sporting events for the Lubbock newspaper. This would have called for a good panning technique.
</p>
<p>The photographs didn't tally with the description of the lights that the professors had seen; in fact, they were
  firmly convinced that they were of "home manufacture." The professors had reported soft, glowing lights yet the photos
  showed what should have been extremely bright lights. Hart reported a perfect formation while the professors, except
  for the first flight, reported an unorderly group. There was no way to explain this disagreement in the arrangement of
  the lights. Of course, it wasn't impossible that on the night that Hart saw the lights they were flying in a V
  formation. The first time the professors saw them they were flying in a semicircle.
</p>
<p>The intensity of the lights was difficult to explain. Again I went to the people in the Photo Reconnaissance
  Laboratory. I asked them if there was any possible situation that could cause this. They said yes. An intensely bright
  light source which had a color far over in the red end of the spectrum, bordering on infrared, could do it. The eye is
  not sensitive to such a light, it could appear dim to the eye yet be "bright" to the film. I asked them what kind of a
  light source would cause this. There were several things, if you want to speculate, they said, extremely high
  temperatures for one. But this was as far as they would go. We have nothing in this world that flies that appears dim
  to the eye yet will show bright on film, they said.
</p>
<p>This ended the investigation of the photographs, and the investigation ended at a blank wall. My official conclusion,
  which was later given to the press, was that "The photos were never proven to be a hoax but neither were they proven
  to be genuine." There is no definite answer.
</p>
<p>The emphasis of the investigation was now switched to the professors sighting. The meager amount of data that they
  had gathered seemed to be accurate but it was inconclusive as far as getting a definite answer was concerned. They had
  measured two things, how much of the sky the objects had crossed in a certain time and the angle from one side of the
  formation to the other. These figures didn't mean a great deal, however, since the altitude at which the formation of
  lights was flying was unknown. If you assumed that the objects were flying at an altitude of 10 000 pieds you could
  easily compute that they were traveling about 3600 miles/h, ou 5 à 6 fois la vitesse du son. The formation would have
  been about 1750 pieds de large. If each light was a separate object it could have been in the neighborhood of 100
  pieds de diamètre. These figures were only a guess since nobody knew if the lights were at, above, or below 10 000
  pieds. If they had been higher they would have been going faster and have been larger. If lower than 10 000 pieds,
  slower and smaller.
</p>
<p>The only solid lead that had developed while the Reese AFB intelligence officer and I were investigating the
  professors' sightings was that the UFO's were birds reflecting the city lights; specifically plover. The old cowboy
  from Lamesa had described something identical to what the professors described and they were plover. Secondly,
  whenever the professors left the vicinity of their homes to look for the lights they didn't see them, yet their wives,
  who stayed at home, did see them. If the "lights" were birds they would be flying low and couldn't be seen from more
  than a few hundred feet. While in Lubbock I'd noticed several main boulevards lighted with the bluish mercury vapor
  lights. I called the intelligence officer at Reese AFB and he airmailed me a city map of Lubbock with the
  mercury-vapor-lighted streets marked. The place where the professors had made their observations was close to one of
  these streets. The big hitch in this theory was that people living miles from a mercury-vapor-lighted boulevard had
  also reported the lights. How many of these sightings were due to the power of suggestion and how many were authentic
  I didn't know. If I could have found out, it would have been possible to plot the sightings in Lubbock, and if they
  were all located close to the lighted boulevards, birds would be an answer. This, however, it was impossible to do.
</p>
<p>The fact that the lights didn't make any perceivable sound seemed as if it might be a clue. Birds or light phenomena
  wouldn't make any sound, but how about some object of appreciable size traveling at or above them speed of sound? Jet
  airplanes don't fly as fast as the speed of sound but they, make a horrible roar. Artillery shells, which are going
  much faster than aircraft, whine as they go through the air. I knew that a great deal of the noise from a jet is due
  to the heated air rushing out of the tail pipe, but I didn't know exactly how much of the noise this caused. If a jet
  airplane with a silent engine could be built, how much noise would it make? How far could it be heard? To get the
  answer I contacted National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Laboratory at Langley AFB, a government agency which
  specializes in aeronautical research. They didn't know. Neither they nor anybody else had ever done any research on
  this question. Their opinion was that such an aircraft could not be heard 5000 or 10 000 feet away. Aerodynamicists at
  Wright Field's Aircraft Laboratory agreed.
</p>
<p>I called the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratories at Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Maryland, to find out why artillery
  shells whine. These people develop and test all kinds of shells so they would have an answer if anybody did. They said
  that the majority of the whine of an artillery shell is probably caused by the flat back end of the shell. If a
  perfectly streamlined shell could be used it would not have any perceivable whine.
</p>
<p>What I found out, or didn't find out, about the sound of an object moving at several times the speed of sound was
  typical of nearly every question that came up regarding UFO's. We were working in a field where there were no definite
  answers to questions. In some instances we were getting into fields far advanced above the then present levels of
  research. In other instances we were getting into fields where no research had been done at all. It made the problem
  of UFO analysis one of getting opinions. All we could do was hope the opinions we were getting were the best.
</p>
<p>My attempts to reach a definite conclusion as to what the professors had seen met another blank wall. I had no more
  success than I'd had trying to reach a conclusion on the authenticity of the photographs.
</p>
<p>A thorough analysis of the reports of the flying wings seen by the retired rancher's wife in Lubbock and the AEC
  employee and his wife in Albuquerque was made. The story from the two ladies who saw the aluminum colored pear shaped
  object hovering near the road near Matador, Texas, was studied, checked, and rechecked. Another blank wall on all
  three of these sightings.
</p>
<p>By the time I got around to working on the report from the radar station in Washington State, the data of the weather
  conditions that existed on the night of the sighting had arrived. I turned the incident folder over to the electronics
  specialists at <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a>. They made the analysis and determined that the
  targets were caused by weather, although it was a borderline case. They further surmised that since the targets had
  been picked up on two radars, if I checked I'd find out that the two targets looked different on the two radarscopes.
  This is a characteristic of a weather target picked up on radars operating on different frequencies. I did check. I
  called the radar station and talked to the captain who was in charge of the crew the night the target had been picked
  up.
</p>
<p>The target looked the same on both scopes. This was one of the reasons it had been reported, the captain told me. If
  the target hadn't been the same on both scopes, he wouldn't have made the report since he would have thought he had a
  weather target. He asked me what ATIC thought about the sighting. I said that Captain James thought it was weather.
  Just before the long-distance wires between Dayton and Washington melted, I caught some comment about people sitting
  in swivel chairs miles from the closest radarscope. . . . I took it that he didn't agree the target was caused by
  weather. But that's the way it officially stands today.
</p>
<p>Although the case of the Lubbock Lights is officially dead, its memory lingers on. There have never been any more
  reliable reports of "<q>flying wings</q>" but lights somewhat similar to those seen by the professors have been
  reported. In about 70 per cent of these cases they were proved to be birds reflecting city lights.
</p>
<p>The known elements of the case, the professors' sightings and the photos, have been dragged back and forth across
  every type of paper upon which written material appears, from the cheapest, coarsest pulp to the slick Life pages.
  Saucer addicts have studied and offered the case as all conclusive proof, with photos, that UFO's are interplanetary.
  Dr. <a href="/people/m/MenzelDonaldH/index.html">Donald Menzel</a> of Harvard studied the case and ripped the
  sightings to shreds in Look, Time, and his book, Flying Saucers, with the theory that the professors were merely
  looking at refracted city lights. But none of these people even had access to the full report. This is the first time
  it has ever been printed.
</p>
<p>The only other people outside <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">projet Blue Book</a> who have studied
  the complete case of the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Lubbock">Lumières de Lubbock</a> were a group
  who, due to their associations with the government, had complete access to our files. And these people were not pulp
  writers or wide-eyed fanatics, they were scientists, rocket experts, nuclear physicists, and intelligence experts.
  They had banded together to study our UFO reports because they were convinced that some of the UFO's that were being
  reported were interplanetary spaceships and the Lubbock series was one of these reports.
</p>
<p>The fact that the formations of lights were in different shapes didn't bother them; in fact, it convinced them all
  the more that their ideas of how a spaceship might operate were correct.
</p>
<p>Ce groupe de scientifiques pensait que les vaisseaux spatiaux, ou du moins la partie de vaisseaux spatiaux qui venait
  relativement près de la terre, devait avoir une congfiguration d'aile highly swept back. And they believed that for
  propulsion and control the craft had a series of small jet orifices all around its edge. Various combinations of these
  small jets would be turned on to get various flight attitudes. The lights that the various observers saw differed in
  arrangement because the craft was flying in different flight attitudes.
</p>
<p>(3 ans plus tard le gouvernement canadien annonça que c'était exactement la manière dont ils avaient prévu de
  contrôler <a href="/org/ca/company/avro/Avrocar/index.html">la soucoupe volante qu'ils essayaient de construire</a>.
  Ils durent abandonner leurs projets de développement de l'appareil semblable à une soucoupe, mais le projet a
  maintenant été repris en main par l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">U.S. Air Force</a>).
</p>
<p>Ceci est l'histoire complète des <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Lubbock">Lumières de Lubbock</a> telle
  qu'elle est donnée dans les fichiers de l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a>, une des collection
  d'observations d'ovni la plus intéressante et la plus controversée jamais signalée au <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">projet Blue Book</a>. Officiellement l'ensemble des observations, à
  l'exception de l'ovni qui fut repéré au <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a>, sont
  inconnues.
</p>
<p>Personnellement j'ai pensé que les lumières des professeurs auraient pu être un type d'oiseaux réfléchissant la
  lumière des lampadaires à vapeur de mercure, mais j'avais tort. Elles n'étaient pas des oiseaux, elles n'étaient pas
  une lumière réfractée, mais elles n'étaient pas des vaisseaux spatiaux. Les lumières que les professeurs avaient vu -
  la colonne vertébrale de la série des Lumières de Lubbock - ont été identifiée catégoriquement identifiées comme étant
  un phénomène naturel très courant et facilement explicable.
</p>
<p>Il est très malheureux que je ne puisse divulguer exactement la manière dont la réponse fut trouvée parce que c'est
  une histoire intéressante sur la manière dont un scientifique met en place une instrumentation complète pour dépister
  les lumières et la manière dont il a passé plusieurs mois à tester théorie après théorie jusqu'à ce qu'il touche
  finalement la réponse. Raconter l'histoire mènerait à son identité et, en échange de cette histoire, j'ai promis à
  l'homme un anonymat complet. Mais il m'a pleinement convaincu qu'il avait la réponse, et après avoir entendu des
  centaines d'explication d'ovnis, je ne suis pas facile convaincable.
</p>
<p>With the most important phase of the Lubbock Lights "solved" - the sightings by the professors- the other phases
  become only good UFO reports.
