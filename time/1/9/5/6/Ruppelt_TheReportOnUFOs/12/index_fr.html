<p>No<sub> </sub>flying saucer report in the history of the UFO ever won more world acclaim than the Washington National
  Sightings.
</p>
<p>When radars at the Washington National Airport and at Andrews AFB, both close to the nation's capital, picked up
  UFO's, the sightings beat the Democratic National Convention out of headline space. They created such a furor that I
  had inquiries from the office of the President of the United States and from the press in London, Ottawa, and Mexico
  City. A junior sized riot was only narrowly averted in the lobby of the Roger Smith Hotel in Washington when I refused
  to tell U.S. newspaper reporters what I knew about the sightings.
</p>
<p>Besides being the most highly publicized UFO sightings in the Air Force annals, they were also the most monumentally
  fouled-up messes that repose in the files. Although the Air Force said that the incident had been fully investigated,
  the Civil Aeronautics Authority wrote a formal report on the sightings, and numerous magazine writers studied them,
  the complete story has never fully been told. The pros have been left out of the con accounts, and the cons were
  neatly overlooked by the pro writers.
</p>
<p>For a year after the twin sightings we were still putting little pieces in the puzzle.
</p>
<p>In some aspects the Washington National Sightings could be classed as a surprise - we used this as an excuse when
  things got fouled up --- but in other ways they weren't. A few days prior to the incident a scientist, from an agency
  that I can't name, and I were talking about the build-up of reports along the east coast of the United States. We
  talked for about two hours, and I was ready to leave when he said that he had one last comment to make - a prediction.
  From his study of the UFO reports that he was getting from Air Force Headquarters, and from discussions with his
  colleagues, he said that he thought that we were sitting right on top of a big keg full of loaded flying saucers. "<q>Within
    the next few days</q>," he told me, and I remember that he punctuated his slow, deliberate remarks by hitting the
  desk with his fist, "<q>they're going to blow up and you're going to have the granddaddy of all UFO sightings. The
    sighting will occur in Washington or New York</q>," he predicted, "<q>probably Washington</q>."
</p>
<p>The trend in the UFO reports that this scientist based his prediction on hadn't gone unnoticed. We on Project Blue
  Book had seen it, and so had the people in the Pentagon; we all had talked about it.
</p>
<p>On July 10 the crew of a National Airlines plane reported a light "<q>too bright to be a lighted balloon and too slow
  to be a big meteor</q>" while they were flying south at 2000 feet near Quantico, Virginia, just south of Washington.
</p>
<p>On July 13 another airliner crew reported that when they were 60 miles southwest of Washington, at 11,000 feet, they
  saw a light below them. It came up to their level, hovered off to the left for several minutes, and then it took off
  in a fast, steep climb when the pilot turned on his landing lights.
</p>
<p>On July 14 the crew of a Pan American airliner enroute from New York to Miami reported eight UFO's near Newport News,
  Virginia, about 130 miles south of Washington.
</p>
<p>Two nights later there was another sighting in exactly the same area but from the ground. At 9:00 P.M. a high ranking
  civilian scientist from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Laboratory at Langley AFB and another man were
  standing near the ocean looking south over Hampton Roads when they saw two amber colored lights, "much too large to be
  aircraft lights," off to their right, silently traveling north. Just before the two lights got abreast of the two men
  they made a 180 degree turn and started back toward the spot where they had first been seen. As they turned, the two
  lights seemed to "<q>jockey for position in the formation</q>." About this time a third light came out of the west and
  joined the first two; then as the three UFO's climbed out of the area toward the south, several more lights joined the
  formation. The entire episode had lasted only three minutes.</p>
<p>The only possible solution to the sighting was that the two men had seen airplanes. We investigated this report and
  found that there were several B-26's from Langley AFB in the area at the time of the sighting, but none of the B-26
  pilots remembered being over Hampton Roads. In fact, all of them had generally stayed well south of Norfolk until
  about 10:30 P.M. because of thunderstorm activity northwest of Langley. Then there were other factors - the observers
  heard no sound and they were away from all city noises, aircraft don't carry just one or two amber lights, and the
  distance between the two lights was such that had they been on an airplane the airplane would have been huge or very
  close to the observers. And last, but not least, the man from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics was a
  very famous aerodynamicist and of such professional stature that if he said the lights weren't airplanes they weren't.
</p>
<p>This then was the big build-up to the first Washington national sighting and the reason why my friend predicted that
  the Air Force was sitting on a big powder keg of loaded flying saucers.
</p>
<p>When the keg blew the best laid schemes of the mice and men at ATIC, they went the way best laid schemes are supposed
  to. The first one of the highly publicized Washington national sightings started, according to the CAA's logbook at
  the airport, at 11:40 P.M. on the night of July 19 when two radars at National Airport picked up eight unidentified
  targets east and south of Andrews AFB. The targets weren't airplanes because they would loaf along at 100 to 130 miles
  an hour then suddenly accelerate to "fantastically high speeds" and leave the area. During the night the crews of
  several airliners saw mysterious lights in the same locations that the radars showed the targets; tower operators also
  saw lights, and jet fighters were brought in.
</p>
<p>But nobody bothered to tell Air Force Intelligence about the sighting. When reporters began to call intelligence and
  ask about the big sighting behind the headlines, INTERCEPTORS CHASE FLYING SAUCERS OVER WASHINGTON, D.C., they were
  told that no one had ever heard of such a sighting. In the next edition the headlines were supplemented by, AIR FORCE
  WON'T TALK.
</p>
<p>Thus intelligence was notified about the first Washington national sighting.
</p>
<p>J'entendis parler de l'observation vers 10 h le lundi matin lorsque le cColonel <a href="/people/BowerDonald.html">Donald
  Bower</a> et moi-même got off an airliner from Dayton and I bought a newspaper in the lobby of the Washington National
  Airport Terminal Building. I called the Pentagon from the airport and talked to Major Dewey Fournet, but all he knew
  was what he'd read in the papers. He told me that he had called the intelligence officer at Bolling AFB and that he
  was making an investigation. We would get a preliminary official report by noon.
</p>
<p>Il était environ 13 h lorsque le major <a href="../../../../../../../four">Fournet</a> m'appela et dit que l'officier
  de renseignement de Bolling était à son bureau avec le rapport préliminaire sur les observations. Je trouvais le
  colonel <a href="/people/BowerDonald.html">Bower</a>, nous partîmes au bureau du major <a
      href="/people/FourneyDeweyJ/index.html">Fournet</a> et assitèrent au briefing de l'officier de renseignement.</p>
<p>The officer started by telling us about the location of the radars involved in the incident. Washington National
  Airport, which is located about three miles south of the heart of the city, had two radars. One was a long-range radar
  in the Air Route Traffic Control section. This radar had 100 mile range and was used to control all air traffic
  approaching Washington. It was known as the ARTC radar. The control tower at National Airport had a shorter range
  radar that it used to control aircraft in the immediate vicinity of the airport. Boiling AFB, he said, was located
  just east of National Airport, across the Potomac River. Ten miles farther east, in almost a direct line with National
  and Bolling, was Andrews AFB. It also had a short-range radar. All of these airfields were linked together by an
  intercom system.
</p>
<p>Then the intelligence officer went on to tell about the sighting.
</p>
<p>When a new shift took over at the ARTC radar room at National Airport, the air traffic was light so only one man was
  watching the radarscope. The senior traffic controller and the six other traffic controllers on the shift were out of
  the room at eleven forty, when the man watching the radarscope noticed a group of seven targets appear. From their
  position on the scope he knew that they were just east and a little south of Andrews AFB. In a way the targets looked
  like a formation of slow airplanes, but no formations were due in the area. As he watched, the targets loafed along at
  100 to 130 miles an hour; then in an apparent sudden burst of speed two of them streaked out of radar range. These
  were no airplanes, the man thought, so he let out a yell for the senior controller. The senior controller took one
  look at the scope and called in two more of the men. They all agreed that these were no airplanes. The targets could
  be caused by a malfunction in the radar, they thought, so a technician was called in - the set was in perfect working
  order.
</p>
<p>The senior controller then called the control tower at National Airport; they reported that they also had
  unidentified targets on their scopes, so did Andrews. And both of the other radars reported the same slow speeds
  followed by a sudden burst of speed. One target was clocked at 7,000 miles an hour. By now the targets had moved into
  every sector of the scope and had flown through the prohibited flying areas over the White House and the Capitol.
</p>
<p>Several times during the night the targets passed close to commercial airliners in the area and on two occasions the
  pilots of the airliners saw lights that they couldn't identify, and the lights were in the same spots where the radar
  showed UFO's to be. Other pilots to whom the ARTC radar men talked on the radio didn't see anything odd, at least
  that's what they said, but the senior controller knew airline pilots and knew that they were very reluctant to report
  UFO's.
</p>
<p>The first sighting of a light by an airline pilot took place shortly after midnight, when an ARTC controller called
  the pilot of a Capital Airlines flight just taking off from National. The controller asked the pilot to keep watch for
  unusual lights or anything. Soon after the pilot cleared the traffic pattern, and while ARTC was still in contact with
  him, he suddenly yelled, "There's one - off to the right - and there it goes." The controller had been watching the
  scope, and a target that had been off to the right of the Capitaliner was gone.
</p>
<p>During the next fourteen minutes this pilot reported six more identical lights.
</p>
<p>About two hours later another pilot, approaching National Airport from the south, excitedly called the control tower
  to report that a light was following him at "eight o'clock level." The tower checked their radar-scope and there was a
  target behind and to the left of the airliner. The ARTC radar also had the airliner and the UFO target. The UFO tagged
  along behind and to the left of the airliner until it was within four miles of touchdown on the runway. When the pilot
  reported the light was leaving, the two radarscopes showed that the target was pulling away from the airliner.
</p>
<p>Once during the night all three radars, the two at Washington and the one at Andrews AFB, picked up a target three
  miles north of the Riverdale Radio beacon, north of Washington. For thirty seconds the three radar operators compared
  notes about the target over the intercom, then suddenly the target was gone - and it left all three radarscopes
  simultaneously.
</p>
<p>But the clincher came in the wee hours of the morning, when an ARTC traffic controller called the control tower at
  Andrews AFB and told the tower operators that ARTC had a target just south of their tower, directly over the Andrews
  Radio range station. The tower operators looked and there was a "huge fiery orange sphere" hovering in the sky
  directly over their range station.
</p>
<p>Not too long after this excitement had started, in fact just after the technician had checked the radar and found
  that the targets weren't caused by a radar malfunction, ARTC had called for Air Force interceptors to come in and look
  around. But they didn't show, and finally ARTC called again - then again. Finally, just about daylight, an F-94
  arrived, but by that time the targets were gone. The F-94 crew searched the area for a few minutes but they couldn't
  find anything unusual so they returned to their base.
</p>
<p>So ended phase one of the Washington National Sightings.
</p>
<p>The Bolling AFB intelligence officer said he would write up the complete report and forward it to ATIC.
</p>
<p>That afternoon things bustled in the Pentagon. Down on the first floor Al Chop was doing his best to stave off the
  press while up on the fourth floor intelligence officers were holding some serious conferences. There was talk of
  temperature inversions and the false targets they could cause; but the consensus was that a good radar operator could
  spot inversion- caused targets, and the traffic controllers who operated the radar at Washington National Airport
  weren't just out of radar school. Every day the lives of thousands of people depended upon their interpretation of the
  radar targets they saw on their scopes. And you don't get a job like this unless you've spent a good many years
  watching a luminous line paint targets on a good many radarscopes. Targets caused by inversions aren't rare - in the
  years that these men had been working with radar they had undoubtedly seen every kind of target, real or false, that
  radar can detect. They had told the Bolling AFB intelligence officer that the targets they saw were caused by the
  radar waves' bouncing off a hard, solid object. The Air Force radar operator at Andrews backed them up; so did two
  veteran airline pilots who saw lights right where the radar showed a UFO to be.
</p>
<p>Then on top of all this there were the reports from the Washington area during the previous two weeks - all good -
  all from airline pilots or equally reliable people.
</p>
<p>To say the least, the sighting at Washington National was a jolt.
</p>
<p>Besides trying to figure out what the Washington National UFO's were, we had the problem of what to tell the press.
  They were now beginning to put on a squeeze by threatening to call a congressman - and nothing chills blood faster in
  the military. They wanted some kind of an official statement and they wanted it soon. Some people in intelligence
  wanted to say just, "We don't know," but others held out for a more thorough investigation. I happened to be in this
  latter category. Many times in the past I had seen what first seemed to be a good UFO report completely fall apart
  under a thorough investigation. I was for stalling the press and working all night if necessary to go into every
  aspect of the sighting. But to go along with the theme of the Washington National Sightings - confusion - there was a
  lot of talk but no action and the afternoon passed with no further investigation.
</p>
<p>Finally about 4:00 P.M. it was decided that the press, who still wanted an official comment, would get an official
  "No comment" and that I would stay in Washington and make a more detailed investigation.
</p>
<p>J'appelais le lieutenant Andy Flues, qui était en charge du <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Projet
  Blue Book</a> pendant que j'étais parti, pour lui dire que I was staying over and je découvris qu'ils étaient dans un
  appartement de luxe de retour à Dayton. Les rapports se déversaient des machines télétype au rythme de 30 par jour et
  nombre d'entre eux étaient aussi bons, sinon meilleurs, que <a href="../../../../../../../1952-07-26_Washington.html">l'incident
    de Washington</a>. Je parlais de ceci avec le colonel <a href="/people/BowerDonald.html">Bower</a> et nous décidions
  que even though things were popping back at ATIC the Washington sighting, from the standpoint of national interest,
  was more important.
</p>
<p>Feeling like a national martyr because I planned to work all night if

  necessary, I laid the course of my investigation. I would go to Washington National Airport, Andrews AFB, airlines
  offices, the weather bureau, and a half dozen other places scattered all over the capital city. I called the
  transportation section at the Pentagon to get a staff car but it took me only seconds to find out that the regulations
  said no staff cars except for senior colonels or generals. Le colonel <a href="/people/BowerDonald.html">Bower</a>
  essaya - même chose. Le général <a href="/people/SamfordJohnA/index.html">Samford</a> et le général Garland étaient
  partis, et je ne pouvais donc pas les avoir pour essayer de mettre la pression pour faire sortir une voiture du
  personnel du hillbilly qui attribuait les véhicules. Je me rendis dans le bureau des finance - pouvais-je louer une
  voiture et le faire passer comme frais de voyage ? Non - les bus de la ville sont disponibles. Mais je ne connaissais
  pas le système de bus et cela me prendrait des heures pour me rendre à tous les endroits que je devais visiter,
  plaidais-je. Vous pouvez prendre un taxi si vous voulez le payer hors de votre indemnité journalière fut la réponse. 9
  dollars par jour comme indemnité et je devais payer pour une chambre d'hotel, les repas, et les courses de taxi dans
  tout le District de Columbia. A côté de cela, me dit la demoiselle des finances, mes réservations de voyage pour
  Washington ne couvraient qu'une visite au Pentagone. De plus, dit-elle, j'étais supposé être sur le chemin du retour à
  Dayton en ce moment même, et if I didn't go through all the red tape of getting the orders amended I couldn't collect
  any per diem and technically I'd be AWOL. I couldn't talk to the finance officer, the lady informed me, because he
  always left at 4:30 to avoid the traffic and it was now exactly five o'clock and she was quitting.
</p>
<p>A five one je décidais que si les soucoupes were buzzing Pennsylvania Avenue en formation je ne pourrais pas moins
  m'en préoccuper. J'appelais le colonel <a href="/people/BowerDonald.html">Bower</a>, expliquais mes problèmes, et dit
  that I was through. He concurred, and I caught the next airliner to Dayton.
</p>
<p>A mon retour je dropped in pour voir le capitaine <span class="people" title="Roy L. James">Roy James</span> de la
  branche <a href="../../../../../../../enquete/indice/radar/index.html">radar</a> et lui parlais de l'observation. Il
  dit que ça lui faisait penser à des cibles radar qui auraient été provoquées par la météo mais comme il n'avait pas
  tous les détails il ne pouvaient naturellement pas faire d'évaluation définitive.</p>
<p>The good UFO reports that Lieutenant Flues had told me about when I called him from Washington had tripled in number
  before I got around to looking at them. Our daily take had risen to forty a day, and about a third of them were
  classified as unknowns.
</p>
<p>More amber red lights like those seen on July 18 had been observed over the Guided Missile Long Range Proving Ground
  at Patrick AFB, Florida. In Uvalde, Texas, a UFO described as "a large, round, silver object that spun on its vertical
  axis" was seen to cross 100 degrees of afternoon sky in forty eight seconds. During part of its flight it passed
  between two towering cumulus clouds. At Los Alamos and Holyoke, Massachusetts, jets had chased UFO's. In both cases
  the UFO's had been lost as they turned into the sun.
</p>
<p>In two night encounters, one in New Jersey and one in Massachusetts, F-94's tried unsuccessfully to intercept
  unidentified lights reported by the Ground Observer Corps. In both cases the pilots of the radar nosed jet
  interceptors saw a light; they closed in and their radar operators got a lock-on. But the lock-ons were broken in a
  few seconds, in both cases, as the light apparently took violent evasive maneuvers.
</p>
<p>Copies of these and other reports were going to the Pentagon, and I was constantly on the phone or having
  teleconferences with Major Fournet.
</p>
<p>When the second Washington National Sighting came along, almost a week to the hour from the first one, by a stroke of
  luck things weren't too fouled up. The method of reporting the sighting didn't exactly follow the official reporting
  procedures that are set forth in Air Force Letter 200-5, dated 5 April 1952, Subject: Reporting of Unidentified Flying
  Objects - but it worked.
</p>
<p>I first heard about the sighting about ten o'clock in the evening when I received a telephone call from Bob Ginna,
  Life magazine's UFO expert. He had gotten the word from Life's Washington News Bureau and wanted a statement about
  what the Air Force planned to do. I decided that instead of giving a mysterious "no comment" I would tell the truth:
  "I have no idea what the Air Force is doing; in all probability it's doing nothing." When he hung up, I called the
  intelligence duty officer in the Pentagon and I was correct, intelligence hadn't heard about the sighting. I asked the
  duty officer to call Major Fournet and ask him if he would go out to the airport, which was only two or three miles
  from his home. When he got the call from the duty officer Major Fournet called Lieutenant Holcomb; they drove to the
  ARTC radar room at National Airport and found Al Chop already there. So at this performance the UFO's had an official
  audience; Al Chop, Major Dewey Fournet, and Lieutenant Holcomb, a Navy electronics specialist assigned to the Air
  Force Directorate of Intelligence, all saw the radar targets and heard the radio conversations as jets tried to
  intercept the UFO's.
</p>
<p>En étant à Dayton, à 380 miles de distance, il n'y avait pas grand chose que je pouvais faire, mais j'appelais le
  capitaine <span class="people" title="Roy L. James">Roy James</span> pensant qu'il voudrait peut-être parler au
  téléphone aux gens qui voyaient les ovnis sur les écrans <a
      href="../../../../../../../enquete/indice/radar/index.html">radar</a>. Mais le capitaine <a
      href="/people/j/JamesRoyL/">James</a> n'aimait particulièrement pas les ovnis - en particulier le samedi soir.</p>
<p>Vers 5 h le dimanche matin le major <a href="/people/FourneyDeweyJ/index.html">Fournet</a> appela et me raconta
  l'hustoire de la 2nde observation à l'Aéroport National de Washington :
</p>
<p>Vers 22 h 30 le 26 juillet les mêmes opérateur radar qui avaient vu les ovnis la semaine auparavant repérèrent
  plusieurs des mêmes cibles en déplacement lent. Cette fois les mystérieux appareils, si c'est ce qu'ils étaient, se
  dispersaient selon un arc autour de Washington depuis Herndon (Virginie) jusqu'à la <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/base/AndrewsAFB.html">base aérienne d'Andrews</a>. Cette fois il n'y eu pas d'hésitation à
  suivre les cibles. A la minute où elles apparurent sur le gros écran radar de 24 pouces, 1 des contrôleurs plaça un
  marqueur en plastique représentant un cible non identifiée près de chaque blip sur l'écran. Lorsque toutes les cibles
  furent attentivement marquées, 1 des contrôleurs appela la tour et la station radar de la <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/base/AndrewsAFB.html">base de Andrews</a> - ils avaient aussi les cibles inconnues.</p>
<p>By 11:30 P.M. four or five of the targets were continually being tracked at all times, so once again a call went out
  for jet interceptors. Once again there was some delay, but by midnight two F-94's from New Castle County AFB were
  airborne and headed south. The reporters and photographers were asked to leave the radar room on the pretext that
  classified radio frequencies and procedures were being used in vectoring the interceptors. All civilian air traffic
  was cleared out of the area and the jets moved in.
</p>
<p>When I later found out that the press had been dismissed on the grounds that the procedures used in an intercept were
  classified, I knew that this was absurd because any ham radio operator worth his salt could build equipment and listen
  in on any intercept. The real reason for the press dismissal, I learned, was that not a few people in the radar room
  were positive that this night would be the big night in UFO history - the night when a pilot would close in on and get
  a good look at a UFO and they didn't want the press to be in on it.
</p>
<p>But just as the two '94's arrived in the area the targets disappeared from the radarscopes. The two jets were
  vectored into the areas where the radar had shown the last target plots, but even though the visibility was excellent
  they could see nothing. The two airplanes stayed around a few minutes more, made a systematic search of the area, but
  since they still couldn't see anything or pick up anything on their radars they returned to their base.
</p>
<p>A few minutes after the F-94's left the Washington area, the unidentified targets were back on the radarscopes in
  that same area.
</p>
<p>What neither Major Fournet nor I knew at this time was that a few minutes after the targets left the radarscopes in
  Washington people in the area around Langley AFB near Newport News, Virginia, began to call Langley Tower to report
  that they were looking at weird bright lights that were "rotating and giving off alternating colors." A few minutes
  after the calls began to come in, the tower operators themselves saw the same or a similar light and they called for
  an interceptor.
</p>
<p>An F-94 in the area was contacted and visually vectored to the light by the tower operators. The F-94 saw the light
  and started toward it, but suddenly it went out, "like somebody turning off a light bulb." The F-94 crew continued
  their run and soon got a radar lock-on, but it was broken in a few seconds as the target apparently sped away. The
  fighter stayed in the area for several more minutes and got two more lock-ons, only to have them also broken after a
  few seconds.
</p>
<p>A few minutes after the F-94 over Newport News had the last lock-on broken, the targets came back on the scopes at
  Washington National.
</p>
<p>With the targets back at Washington the traffic controller again called Defense Command, and once again two F-94's
  roared south toward Washington. This time the targets stayed on the radarscopes when the airplanes arrived.
</p>
<p>The controllers vectored the jets toward group after group of targets, but each time, before the jets could get close
  enough to see anything more than just a light, the targets had sped away. Then one stayed put. The pilot saw a light
  right where the ARTC radar said a target was located; he cut in the F-94's afterburner and went after it, but just
  like the light that the F-94 had chased near Langley AFB, this one also disappeared. All during the chase the radar
  operator in the F-94 was trying to get the target on his set but he had no luck.
</p>
<p>After staying in the area about twenty minutes, the jets began to run low on fuel and returned to their base. Minutes
  later it began to get light, and when the sun came up all the targets were gone.
</p>
<p>Early Sunday morning, in an interview with the press, the Korean veteran who piloted the F-94, Lieutenant William
  Patterson, said:</p>
<p>I tried to make contact with the bogies below 1,000 feet, but they [the radar controllers] vectored us around. I saw
  several bright lights. I was at my maximum speed, but even then I had no closing speed. I ceased chasing them because
  I saw no chance of overtaking them. I was vectored into new objects. Later I chased a single bright light which I
  estimated about 10 miles away. I lost visual contact with it about 2 miles.
</p>
<p>When Major Fournet finished telling me about the night's activity, my first question was, "How about the radar
  targets, could they have been caused by weather?"
</p>
<p>I knew that Lieutenant Holcomb was a sharp electronics man and that Major Fournet, although no electronics
  specialist, was a crackerjack engineer, so their opinion meant a lot.
</p>
<p>Dewey said that everybody in the radar room was convinced that the targets were very probably caused by solid
  metallic objects. There had been weather targets on the scope too, he said, but these were common to the Washington
  area and the controllers were paying no attention to them.
</p>
<p>And this something solid could poke along at 100 miles an hour or outdistance a jet, I thought to myself.
</p>
<p>I didn't ask Dewey any more because he'd been up all night and wanted to get to bed.
</p>
<p>Monday morning Major Ed Gregory, another intelligence officer at ATIC, and I left for Washington, but our flight was
  delayed in Dayton so we didn't arrive until late afternoon. On the way through the terminal building to get a cab
  downtown, I picked up the evening papers. Every headline was about the UFO's:
</p>
<p>FIERY OBJECTS OUTRUN JETS OVER CAPITAL - INVESTIGATION VEILED IN SECRECY FOLLOWING VAIN CHASE
</p>
<p>JETS ALERTED FOR SAUCER - INTERCEPTORS CHASE LIGHTS IN D.C. SKIES
</p>
<p>EXPERT HERE TO PUSH STUDY AS OBJECTS IN SKIES REPORTED AGAIN
</p>
<p>I jokingly commented about wondering who the expert was. In a half hour I found out - I was. When Major Gregory and I
  walked into the lobby of the Roger Smith Hotel to check in, reporters and photographers rose from the easy chairs and
  divans like a covey of quail. They wanted my secrets, but I wasn't going to tell nor would I pose for pictures while I
  wasn't telling anything. Newspaper reporters are a determined lot, but Greg ran interference and we reached the
  elevator without even a "no comment."
</p>
<p>The next day was one of confusion. After the first Washington sighting the prevailing air in the section of the
  Pentagon's fourth floor, which is occupied by Air Force Intelligence, could be described as excitement, but this day
  it was confusion. There was a maximum of talk and a minimum of action. Everyone agreed that both sightings should be
  thoroughly investigated, but nobody did anything. Major Fournet and I spent the entire morning "just leaving" for
  somewhere to investigate "something." Every time we would start to leave, something more pressing would come up.
</p>
<p>About 10:00 A.M. the President's air aide, Brigadier General Landry, called intelligence at President Truman's
  request to find out what was going on. Somehow I got the call. I told General Landry that the radar target could have
  been caused by weather but that we had no proof.
</p>
<p>To add to the already confused situation, new UFO reports were coming in hourly. We kept them quiet mainly because we
  weren't able to investigate them right away, or even confirm the facts. And we wanted to confirm the facts because
  some of the reports, even though they were from military sources, were difficult to believe.
</p>
<p>Prior to the Washington sightings in only a very few of the many instances in which radar had picked up UFO targets
  had the targets themselves supposedly been seen visually. Radar experts had continually pointed out this fact to us as
  an indication that maybe all of the radar targets were caused by freak weather conditions. "If people had just seen a
  light, or an object, near where the radar showed the UFO target to be, you would have a lot more to worry about,"
  radar technicians had told me many times.
</p>
<p>Now people were seeing the same targets that the radars were picking up, and not just at Washington.
</p>
<p>On the same night as the second Washington sighting we had a really good report from California. An ADC radar had
  picked up an unidentified target and an F-94C had been scrambled. The radar vectored the jet interceptor into the
  target, the radar operator in the '94 locked-on to it, and as the airplane closed in the pilot and RO saw that they
  were headed directly toward a large, yellowish orange light. For several minutes they played tag with the UFO. Both
  the radar on the ground and the radar in the F-94 showed that as soon as the airplane would get almost within gunnery
  range of the UFO it would suddenly pull away at a terrific speed. Then in a minute or two it would slow down enough to
  let the F-94 catch it again.
</p>
<p>When I talked to the F-94 crew on the phone, the pilot said that they felt as if this were just a big aerial
  cat-and-mouse game - and they didn't like it - at any moment they thought the cat might have pounced.
</p>
<p>Needless to say, this was an unknown.
</p>
<p>About midmorning on Tuesday, July 29th, Major General <a href="/people/SamfordJohnA/index.html">John Samford</a> sent
  word down that he would hold a press conference that afternoon in an attempt to straighten out the UFO situation with
  the press.
</p>
<p>Donald Keyhoe reports on the press conference and the events leading up to it in detail in his book, Flying Saucers
  from Outer Space. He indicates that before the conference started, General Samford sat behind his big walnut desk in
  Room 3A138 in the Pentagon and battled with his conscience. Should he tell the public "the real truth" - that our
  skies are loaded with spaceships? No, the public might panic. The only answer would be to debunk the UFO's.
</p>
<p>This bit of reporting makes Major Keyhoe the greatest journalist in history. This beats wire tapping. He reads minds.
  And not only that, he can read them right through the walls of the Pentagon. But I'm glad that Keyhoe was able to read
  the General's mind and that he wrote the true and accurate facts about what he was really thinking because I spent
  quite a bit of time talking to the General that day and he sure fooled me. I had no idea he was worried about what he
  should tell the public.
</p>
<p>When the press conference, which was the largest and longest the Air Force had held since World War II, convened at
  4:00 P.M., General Samford made an honest effort to straighten out the Washington National Sightings, but the cards
  were stacked against him before he started. He had to hedge on many answers to questions from the press because he
  didn't know the answers. This hedging gave the impression that he was trying to cover up something more than just the
  fact that his people had fouled up in not fully investigating the sightings. Ils avaient amené le capitaine <span
      class="people" title="Roy L. James">Roy James</span> de l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a>
  pour prendre en charge l'ensemble des demandes <a
      href="../../../../../../../enquete/indice/radar/index.html">radar</a>. James ne fit pas beaucoup mieux parce qu'il
  venait juste d'arriver à Washington ce matin-là et n'en connaissait pas beaucoup plus sur les observations qu'il n'en
  avait lu dans les journaux. Le major <a href="/people/FourneyDeweyJ/index.html">Dewey Fournet</a> et le lieutenant
  Holcomb, qui avaient été à l'aéroport lors des observations, étaient particulièrement remarquables par leur absence,
  en particuluer depuis qu'il était de notoriété publique dans la presse qu'ils n'étaient pas convaincus que les ovnis
  repérés sur les <a href="../../../../../../../enquete/indice/radar/index.html">radars</a> étaient des cibles météo.
</p>
<p>But somehow out of this chaotic situation came exactly the result that was intended - the press got off our backs.
  Captain James's answers about the possibility of the radar targets' being caused by temperature inversions had been
  construed by the press to mean that this was the Air Force's answer, even though today the twin sightings are still
  carried as unknowns.
</p>
<p>The next morning headlines from Bangor to Bogota read:
</p>
<p>AIR FORCE DEBUNKS SAUCERS AS JUST NATURAL PHENOMENA
</p>
<p>The Washington National Sightings proved one thing, something that many of us already knew: in order to forestall any
  more trouble similar to what we'd just been through we always had to get all of the facts and not try to hide them. A
  great deal of the press's interest was caused by the Air Force's reluctance to give out any information, and the
  reluctance on the part of the Air Force was caused by simply not having gone out to find the answers.
</p>
<p>But had someone gone out and made a more thorough investigation a few big questions would have popped up and taken
  some of the intrigue out of the two reports. It took me a year to put the question marks together because I just
  picked up the information as I happened to run across it, but it could have been collected in a day of concentrated
  effort.
</p>
<p>There was some doubt about the visual sighting of the "large fiery-orange-colored sphere" that the tower operators at
  Andrews AFB saw when the radar operators at National Airport told them they had a target over the Andrews Radio range
  station. When the tower operators were later interrogated they completely changed their story and said that what they
  saw was merely a star. They said that on the night of the sighting they "had been excited." (According to astronomical
  charts, there were no exceptionally bright stars where the UFO was seen over the range station, however. And I heard
  from a good source that the tower men had been "persuaded" a bit.)
</p>
<p>Then the pilot of the F-94C changed his mind even after he'd given the press and later told me his story about vainly
  trying to intercept unidentified lights. In an official report he says that all he saw was a ground light reflecting
  off a layer of haze.
</p>
<p>Another question mark arose about the lights that the airline pilots saw. Months after the sighting I heard from one
  of the pilots whom the ARTC controllers called to learn if he could see a UFO. This man's background was also
  impressive, he had been flying in and out of Washington since 1936. This is what he had to say:
</p>
<p>The most outstanding incident happened just after a take-off one night from Washington National. The tower man
  advised us that there was a UFO ahead of us on the take-off path and asked if we would aid in tracking it down. We
  were given headings to follow and shortly we were advised that we had passed the UFO and would be given a new heading.
  None of us in the cockpit had seen anything unusual. Several runs were made; each time the tower man advised us we
  were passing the UFO we noticed that we were over one certain section of the Potomac River, just east of Alexandria.
  Finally we were asked to visually check the terrain below for anything which might cause such an illusion. We looked
  and the only object we could see where the radar had a target turned out to be the Wilson Lines moonlight steamboat
  trip to Mount Vernon. Whether there was an altitude gimmick on the radar unit at the time I do not know but the radar
  was sure as hell picking up the steamboat.
</p>
<p>The pilot went on to say that there is such a conglomeration of lights around the Washington area that no matter
  where you look you see a ''mysterious light.''
</p>
<p>Then there was another point: although the radars at Washington National and Andrews overlap, and many of the targets
  appeared in the overlap area, only once did the three radars simultaneously pick up a target.
</p>
<p>The investigation brought out a few more points on the pro side too. We found out that the UFO's frequently visited
  Washington. On May 23 fifty targets had been tracked from 8:00 P.M. till midnight. They were back on the Wednesday
  night between the two famous Saturday night sightings, the following Sunday night, and again the night of the press
  conference; then during August they were seen eight more times. On several occasions military and civilian pilots saw
  lights exactly where the radar showed the UFO's to be.
</p>
<p>On each night that there was a sighting there was a temperature inversion but it was never strong enough to affect
  the radar the way inversions normally do. On each occasion I checked the strength of the inversion according to the
  methods used by the Air Defense Command Weather Forecast Center.
</p>
<p>Then there was another interesting fact: hardly a night passed in June, July, and August in 1952 that there wasn't an
  inversion in Washington, yet the slow moving, "solid" radar targets appeared on only a few nights.
</p>
<p>But the one big factor on the pro side of the question is the people involved - good radar men - men who deal in
  human lives. Each day they use their radar to bring thousands of people into Washington National Airport and with a
  responsibility like this they should know a real target from a weather target.
</p>
<p>So the Washington National Airport Sightings are still unknowns.
</p>
<p>Had the press been aware of some of the other UFO activity in the United States during this period, the Washington
  sightings might not have been the center of interest. True, they could be classed as good reports but they were not
  the best that we were getting. In fact, less than six hours after the ladies and gentlemen of the press said "Thank
  you" to General Samford for his press conference, and before the UFO's could read the newspapers and find out that
  they were natural phenomena, one of them came down across the Canadian border into Michigan. The incident that
  occurred that night was one of those that even the most ardent skeptic would have difficulty explaining. I've heard a
  lot of them try and I've heard them all fail.</p>
<p>At nine forty on the evening of the twenty-ninth an Air Defense Command radar station in central Michigan started to
  get plots on a target that was coming straight south across Saginaw Bay on Lake Huron at 625 miles an hour. A quick
  check of flight plans on file showed that it was an unidentified target.
</p>
<p>Three F-94's were in the area just northeast of the radar station, so the ground controller called one of the F-94's
  and told the pilot to intercept the unidentified target. The F-94 pilot started climbing out of the practice area on
  an intercept heading that the ground controller gave him. When the F-94 was at 20,000 feet, the ground controller told
  the pilot to turn to the right and he would be on the target. The pilot started to bring the F-94 around and at that
  instant both he and the radar operator in the back seat saw that they were turning toward a large bluish white light,
  "many times larger than a star." In the next second or two the light "took on a reddish tinge, and slowly began to get
  smaller, as if it were moving away." Just then the ground controller called and said that he still had both the F-94
  and the unidentified target on his scope and that the target had just made a tight 180 degree turn. The turn was too
  tight for a jet, and at the speed the target was traveling it would have to be a jet if it were an airplane. Now the
  target was heading back north. The F-94 pilot gave the engine full power and cut in the afterburner to give chase. The
  radar operator in the back seat got a good radar lock-on. Later he said, "It was just as solid a lock-on as you get
  from a B-36." The object was at 4 miles range and the F-94 was closing slowly. For thirty seconds they held the
  lock-on; then, just as the ground controller was telling the pilot that he was closing in, the light became brighter
  and the object pulled away to break the lock-on. Without breaking his transmission, the ground controller asked if the
  radar operator still had the lock-on because on the scope the distance between two blips had almost doubled in one
  sweep of the antenna. This indicated that the unknown target had almost doubled its speed in a matter of seconds.
</p>
<p>For ten minutes the ground radar followed the chase. At times the unidentified target would slow down and the F-94
  would start to close the gap, but always, just as the F-94 was getting within radar range, the target would put on a
  sudden burst of speed and pull away from the pursuing jet. The speed of the UFO - for by this time all concerned had
  decided that was what it was - couldn't be measured too accurately because its bursts of speed were of such short
  duration; but on several occasions the UFO traveled about 4 miles in one ten second sweep of the antenna, or about
  1,400 miles an hour. </p>
<p>The F-94 was getting low on fuel, and the pilot had to break off the chase a minute or two before the UFO got out of
  range of the ground radar. The last few plots on the UFO weren't too good but it looked as if the target slowed down
  to 200 to 300 miles an hour as soon as the F-94 turned around.
</p>
<p>What was it? It obviously wasn't a balloon or a meteor. It might have been another airplane except that in 1952 there
  was nothing flying, except a few experimental airplanes that were far from Michigan, that could so easily outdistance
  an F-94. Then there was the fact that radar clocked it at 1,400 miles an hour. The F-94 was heading straight for the
  star Capella, which is low on the horizon and is very brilliant, but what about the radar contacts? Some people said
  "Weather targets," but the chances of a weather target's making a 180 degree turn just as an airplane turns into it,
  giving a radar lock-on, then changing speed to stay just out of range of the airplane's radar, and then slowing down
  when the airplane leaves is as close to nil as you can get.
</p>
<p>What was it? A lot of people I knew were absolutely convinced this report was the key - the final proof. Even if all
  of the thousands of other UFO reports could be discarded on a technicality, this one couldn't be. These people
  believed that this report in itself was proof enough to officially accept the fact that UFO's were interplanetary
  spaceships. And when some people refused to believe even this report, the frustration was actually pitiful to see.
</p>
<p>As the end of July approached, there was a group of officers in intelligence fighting hard to get the UFO
  "recognized." At ATIC, Project Blue Book was still trying to be impartial - but sometimes it was difficult.
