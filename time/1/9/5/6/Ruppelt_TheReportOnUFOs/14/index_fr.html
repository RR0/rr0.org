<p>Ce fut peu après que nous ayons écrit a finish to the Case of the Scoutmaster that I went into Washington to give
  another briefing on the latest UFO developments. Several reports had come in during early August that had been read
  with a good deal of interest in the military and other governmental agencies. By late August 1952 several groups in
  Washington were following the UFO situation very closely.
</p>
<p>The sighting that had stirred everyone up came from Haneda AFB, now Tokyo International Airport, in Japan. Since the
  sighting came from outside the U.S., we couldn't go out and investigate it, but the intelligence officers in the Far
  East Air Force had done a good job, so we had the complete story of this startling account of an encounter with a UFO.
  Only a few minor questions had been unanswered, and a quick wire to FEAF brought back these missing data. Normally it
  took up to three months to get routine questions back and forth, but this time the exchange of wires took only a
  matter of hours.
</p>
<p>Several months after the sighting I talked to one of the FEAF intelligence officers who had investigated it, and in
  his estimation it was one of the best to come out of the Far East.
</p>
<p>The first people to see the UFO were two control tower operators who were walking across the ramp at the air base
  heading toward the tower to start the midnight shift. They were about a half hour early so they weren't in any big
  hurry to get up into the tower - at least not until they saw a large brilliant light off to the northeast over Tokyo
  Bay. They stopped to look at the light for a few seconds thinking that it might be an exceptionally brilliant star,
  but both men had spent many lonely nights in a control tower when they had nothing to look at except stars and they
  had never seen anything like this bright before. Besides, the light was moving. The two men had lined it up with the
  corner of a hangar and could see that it was continually moving closer and drifting a little off to the right.
</p>
<p>In a minute they had run across the ramp, up the several hundred steps to the tower, and were looking at the light
  through 7x50 binoculars. Both of the men, and the two tower operators whom they were relieving, got a good look at the
  UFO. The light was circular in shape and had a constant brilliance. It appeared to be the upper portion of a large,
  round, dark shape which was about four times the diameter of the light itself. As they watched, the UFO moved in
  closer, or at least it appeared to be getting closer because it became more distinct. When it moved in, the men could
  see a second and dimmer light on the lower edge of the dark, shadowy portion.
</p>
<p>In a few minutes the UFO had moved off to the east, getting dimmer and dimmer as it disappeared. The four tower men
  kept watching the eastern sky, and suddenly the light began to reappear. It stayed in sight a few seconds, was gone
  again, and then for the third time it came back, heading toward the air base.
</p>
<p>This time one of the tower operators picked up a microphone, called the pilot of a C-54 that was crossing Tokyo Bay,
  and asked if he could see the light. The pilot didn't see anything unusual.
</p>
<p>At 11:45 P.M., according to the logbook in the tower, one of the operators

  called a nearby radar site and asked if they had an unidentified target on their scopes. They did.
</p>
<p>The FEAF intelligence officers who investigated the sighting made a special effort to try to find out if the radar's
  unidentified target and the light were the same object. They deduced that they were since, when the tower operators
  and the radar operators compared notes over the telephone, the light and the radar target were in the same location
  and were moving in the same direction.
</p>
<p>For about five minutes the radar tracked the UFO as it cut back and forth across the central part of Tokyo Bay,
  sometimes traveling so slowly that it almost hovered and then speeding up to 300 miles an hour. All of this time the
  tower operators were watching the light through binoculars. Several times when the UFO approached the radar station -
  once it came within 10 miles - a radar operator went outside to find out if he could see the light but no one at the
  radar site ever saw it. Back at the air base the tower operators had called other people and they saw the light. Later
  on the tower man said that he had the distinct feeling that the light was highly directional, like a spotlight.
</p>
<p>Some of the people who were watching thought that the UFO might be a lighted balloon; so, for the sake of comparison,
  a lighted weather balloon was released. But the light on the balloon was much more "yellowish" than the UFO and in a
  matter of seconds it had traveled far enough away that the light was no longer visible. This gave the observers a
  chance to compare the size of the balloon and the size of the dark, shadowy part of the UFO. Had the UFO been 10 miles
  away it would have been 50 feet in diameter.
</p>
<p>Three minutes after midnight an F-94 scrambled from nearby Johnson AFB came into the area. The ground controller sent
  the F-94 south of Yokohama, up Tokyo Bay, and brought him in "behind" the UFO. The second that the ground controller
  had the F-94 pilot lined up and told him that he was in line for a radar run, the radar operator in the rear seat of
  the F-94 called out that he had a lock-on. His target was at 6,000 yards, 10 degrees to the right and 10 degrees below
  the F-94. The lockon was held for ninety seconds as the ground controller watched both the UFO and the F-94 make a
  turn and come toward the ground radar site. Just as the target entered the "ground clutter" - the permanent and solid
  target near the radar station caused by the radar beam's striking the ground - the lock-on was broken. The target
  seemed to pull away swiftly from the jet interceptor. At almost this exact instant the tower operators reported that
  they had lost visual contact with the UFO. The tower called the F-94 and asked if they had seen anything visually
  during the chase - they hadn't. The F-94 crew stayed in the area ten or fifteen more minutes but couldn't see anything
  or pick up any more targets on their radar.
</p>
<p>Soon after the F-94 left the area, both the ground radar and the tower operators picked up the UFO again. In about
  two minutes radar called the tower to say that their target had just "broken into three pieces" and that the three
  "pieces," spaced about a quarter of a mile apart, were leaving the area, going northeast. Seconds later tower
  operators lost sight of the light.
</p>
<p>The FEAF intelligence officers had checked every possible angle but they could offer nothing to account for the
  sighting.
</p>
<p>There were lots of opinions, weather targets for example, but once again the chances of a weather target's being in
  exactly the same direction as a bright star and having the star appear to move with the false radar target aren't too
  likely - to say the least. And then the same type of thing had happened twice before inside of a month's time, once in
  California and once in Michigan.
</p>
<p>As one of the men at the briefing I gave said, "It's incredible, and I can't believe it, but those boys in FEAF are
  in a war - they're veterans - and by damn, I think they know what they're talking about when they say they've never
  seen anything like this before."
</p>
<p>I could go into a long discourse on the possible explanations for this sighting; I heard many, but in the end there
  would be only one positive answer - the UFO could not be identified as something we knew about. It could have been an
  interplanetary spaceship. Many people thought this was the answer and were all for sticking their necks out and
  establishing a category of conclusions for UFO reports and labeling it spacecraft. But the majority ruled, and a UFO
  remained an unidentified flying object.
</p>
<p>On my next trip to the Pentagon I spent the whole day talking to Major Dewey Fournet and two of his bosses, Colonel
  W. A. Adams and Colonel Weldon Smith, about the UFO subject in general. One of the things we talked about was a new
  approach to the UFO problem - that of trying to prove that the motion of a UFO as it flew through the air was
  intelligently controlled.
</p>
<p>I don't know who would get credit for originating the idea of trying to analyze the motion of the UFO's. It was one
  of those kinds of ideas that are passed around, with everyone adding a few modifications. We'd been talking about
  making a study of this idea for a long time, but we hadn't had many reports to work with; but now, with the mass of
  data that we had accumulated in June and July and August, the prospects of such a study looked promising.
</p>
<p>The basic aim of the study would be to learn whether the motion of the reported UFO's was random or ordered. Random
  motion is an unordered, helter-skelter motion very similar to a swarm of gnats or flies milling around. There is no
  apparent pattern or purpose to their flight paths. But take, for example, swallows flying around a chimney - they
  wheel, dart, and dip, but if you watch them closely, they have a definite pattern in their movements - an ordered
  motion. The definite pattern is intelligently controlled because they are catching bugs or getting in line to go down
  the chimney.
</p>
<p>By the fall of 1952 we had a considerable number of well documented reports in which the UFO's made a series of
  maneuvers. If we could prove that these maneuvers were not random, but ordered, it would be proof that the UFO's were
  things that were intelligently controlled.
</p>
<p>During our discussion Major Fournet brought up two reports in which the UFO seemed to know what it was doing and
  wasn't just aimlessly darting around. One of these was the recent sighting from Haneda AFB, Japan, and the other was
  the incident that happened on the night of July 29, when an F-94 attempted to intercept a UFO over eastern Michigan.
  In both cases radar had established the track of the UFO.
</p>
<p>In the Haneda Incident, according to the sketch of the UFO's track, each turn the UFO made was constant and the
  straight "legs" between the turns were about the same length. The sketch of the UFO's flight path as it moved back and
  forth over Tokyo Bay reminded me very much of the "crisscross" search patterns we used to fly during World War II when
  we were searching for the crew of a ditched airplane. The only time the UFO seriously deviated from this pattern was
  when the F-94 got on its tail.
</p>
<p>The Michigan sighting was even better, however. In this case there was a definite reason for every move that the UFO
  made. It made a 180 degree turn because the F-94 was closing on it head on. It alternately increased and decreased its
  speed, but every time it did this it was because the F-94 was closing in and it evidently put on speed to pull out
  ahead far enough to get out of range of the F-94's radar. To say that this motion was random and that it was just a
  coincidence that the UFO made the 180 degree turn when the F-94 closed in head on and that it was just a coincidence
  that the UFO speeded up every time the F-94 began to get within radar range is pushing the chance of coincidence
  pretty hard.
</p>
<p>The idea of the motion analysis study sounded interesting to me, but we were so busy on Project Blue Book we didn't
  have time to do it. So Major Fournet offered to look into it further and I promised him all the help we could give
  him.
</p>
<p>In the meantime my people in Project Blue Book were contacting various scientists in the U.S., and indirectly in
  Europe, telling them about our data, and collecting opinions. We did this in two ways. In the United States we briefed
  various scientific meetings and groups. To get the word to the other countries, we enlisted the gratis aid of
  scientists who were planning to attend conferences or meetings in Europe. We would brief these European bound
  scientists on all of the aspects of the UFO problem so they could informally discuss the problem with their European
  colleagues.
</p>
<p>The one thing about these briefings that never failed to amaze me, although it happened time and time again, was the
  interest in UFO's within scientific circles. As soon as the word spread that Project Blue Book was giving official
  briefings to groups with the proper security clearances, we had no trouble in getting scientists to swap free advice
  for a briefing. I might add that we briefed only groups who were engaged in government work and who had the proper
  security clearances solely because we could discuss any government project that might be of help to us in pinning down
  the UFO. Our briefings weren't just squeezed in either; in many instances we would arrive at a place to find that a
  whole day had been set aside to talk about UFO's. And never once did I meet anyone who laughed off the whole subject
  of flying saucers even though publicly these same people had jovially sloughed off the press with answers of
  "hallucinations," "absurd," or "a waste of time and money." They weren't wild eyed fans but they were certainly
  interested.
</p>
<p>Colonel S. H. Kirkland and I once spent a whole day briefing and talking to the Beacon Hill Group, the code name for
  a collection of some of the world's leading scientists and industrialists. This group, formed to consider and analyze
  the toughest of military problems, took a very serious interest in our project and gave much good advice. At Los
  Alamos and again at Sandia Base our briefings were given in auditoriums to standing room only crowds. In addition I
  gave my briefings at National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics laboratories, at Air Research and Development
  centers, at Office of Naval Research facilities and at the Air Force University. Then we briefed special groups of
  scientists.
</p>
<p>Normally scientists are a cautious lot and stick close to proven facts, keeping their personal opinions confined to
  small groups of friends, but when they know that there is a sign on a door that says "Classified Briefing in
  Progress," inhibitions collapse like the theories that explain all the UFO's away. People say just what they
  think.</p>
<p>I could jazz up this part of the UFO story as so many other historians of the UFO have and say that Dr. So-and-So
  believes that the reported flying saucers are from outer space or that Dr. Whosita is firmly convinced that Mars is
  inhabited. I talked to plenty of Dr. So-and-So's who believed that flying saucers were real and who were absolutely
  convinced that other planets or bodies in the universe were inhabited, but we were looking for proven facts and not
  just personal opinions.
</p>
<p>However, some of the questions we asked the scientists had to be answered by personal opinions because the exact
  answers didn't exist. When such questions came up, about all we could do was to try to get the largest and most
  representative cross section of personal opinions upon which to base our decisions. In this category of questions
  probably the most frequently discussed was the possibility that other celestial bodies in the universe were populated
  with intelligent beings. The exact answer to this is that no one knows. But the consensus was that it wouldn't be at
  all surprising.
</p>
<p>All the briefings we were giving added to our work load because UFO reports were still coming in in record amounts.
  The lack of newspaper publicity after the Washington sightings had had some effect because the number of reports
  dropped from nearly 500 in July to 175 in August, but this was still far above the normal average of twenty to thirty
  reports a month.
</p>
<p>September 1952 started out with a rush, and for a while it looked as if UFO sightings were on the upswing again. For
  some reason, we never could determine why, we suddenly began to get reports from all over the southeastern United
  States. Every morning, for about a week or two, we'd have a half dozen or so new reports. Georgia and Alabama led the
  field. Many of the reports came from people in the vicinity of the then new super-hush-hush Atomic Energy Commission
  facility at Savannah River, Georgia. And many were coming from the port city of Mobile, Alabama. Our first thought,
  when the reports began to pour in, was that the news papers in these areas were possibly stirring things up with scare
  stories, but our newspaper clipping service covered the majority of the southern papers, and although we kept looking
  for publicity, none showed up. In fact, the papers only barely mentioned one or two of the sightings. As they came in,
  each of the sighting reports went through our identification process; they were checked against all balloon flights,
  aircraft flights, celestial bodies, and the MO file, but more than half of them came out as unknowns.
</p>
<p>When the reports first began to come in, I had called the intelligence officers at all of the major military
  installations in the Southeast unsuccessfully trying to find out if they could shed any light on the cause of the
  sightings. One man, the man who was responsible for UFO reports made to Brookley AFB, just outside of Mobile, Alabama,
  took a dim view of all of the proceedings. "They're all nuts," he said. </p>
<p>About a week later his story changed. It seems that one night, about the fourth night in a row that UFO's had been
  reported near Mobile, this man and several of his assistants decided to try to see these famous UFO's; about 10:00
  P.M., the time that the UFO's were usually reported, they were gathered around the telephone in the man's office at
  Brookley AFB. Soon a report came in. The first question that the investigator who answered the phone asked was, "Can
  you still see it?"
</p>
<p>The answer was "Yes," so the officer took off to see the UFO.
</p>
<p>The same thing happened twice more, and two more officers left for different locations. The fourth time the phone
  rang the call was from the base radar station. They were picking up a UFO on radar, so the boss himself took off. He
  saw the UFO in air out over Mobile Bay and he saw the return of the UFO on the radarscope.
</p>
<p>The next morning he called me at ATIC and for over an hour he told me what had happened. Never have I talked to four
  more ardent flying saucer believers.
</p>
<p>We did quite a bit of work on the combination radar visual sighting at Brookley. First of all, radar visual sightings
  were the best type of UFO sightings we received. There are no explanations for how radar can pick up a UFO target that
  is being watched visually at the same time. Maybe I should have said there are no proven explanations on how this can
  happen, because, like everything else associated with the UFO, there was a theory. During the Washington National
  Sightings several people proposed the idea that the same temperature inversion layer that was causing the radar beam
  to bend down and pick up a ground target was causing the target to appear to be in the air. They went on to say that
  we couldn't get a radar visual sighting unless the ground target was a truck, car, house, or something else that was
  lighted and could be seen at a great distance. The second reason the Brookley AFB sighting was so interesting was that
  it knocked this theory cold.
</p>
<p>The radar at Brookley AFB was so located that part of the area that it scanned was over Mobile Bay. It was in this
  area that the UFO was detected. We thought of the theory that the same inversion layer that bent the radar beam also
  caused the target to appear to be in the air, and we began to do a little checking. There was a slight inversion but,
  according to our calculations, it wasn't enough to affect the radar. More important was the fact that in the area
  where the target appeared there were no targets to pick up - let alone lighted targets. We checked and rechecked and
  found that at the time of the sighting there were no ships, buoys, or anything else that would give a radar return in
  the area of Mobile Bay in which we were interested.
</p>
<p>Although this sighting wasn't as glamorous as some we had, it was highly significant because it was possible to show
  that the UFO couldn't have been a lighted surface target.
</p>
<p>While we were investigating the sighting we talked to several electronics specialists about our radar visual
  sightings. One of the most frequent comments we heard was, "Why do all of these radar visual sightings occur at
  night?"
</p>
<p>The answer was simple: they don't. On August 1, just before dawn, an ADC radar station outside of Yaak, Montana, on
  the extreme northern border of the United States, picked up a UFO. The report was very similar to the sighting at
  Brookley except it happened in the daylight and, instead of seeing a light, the crew at the radar station saw a "dark,
  cigar shaped object" right where the radar had the UFO pinpointed.
</p>
<p>What these people saw is a mystery to this day.
</p>
<p>Late in September I made a trip out to Headquarters, ADC to brief General Chidlaw and his staff on the past few
  months' UFO activity.
</p>
<p>Our plans for periodic briefings, which we had originally set up with ADC, had suffered a bit in the summer because
  we were all busy elsewhere. They were still giving us the fullest co-operation, but we hadn't been keeping them as
  thoroughly read in as we would have liked to. I'd finished the briefing and was eating lunch at the officers' club
  with Major Verne Sadowski, Project Blue Book's liaison officer in ADC Intelligence, and several other officers. I had
  a hunch that something was bothering these people. Then finally Major Sadowski said, "Look, Rupe, are you giving us
  the straight story on these UFO's?"
</p>
<p>I thought he meant that I was trying to spice things up a little, so I said that since he had copies of most of our
  reports and had read them, he should know that I was giving them the facts straight across the board.
</p>
<p>Then one of the other officers at the table cut in, "That's just the point, we do have the reports and we have read
  them. None of us can understand why Intelligence is so hesitant to accept the fact that something we just don't know
  about is flying around in our skies - unless you are trying to cover up something big."
</p>
<p>Everyone at the table put in his ideas. One radar man said that he'd looked over several dozen radar reports and that
  his conclusion was that the UFO's couldn't be anything but interplanetary spaceships. He started to give his reasons
  when another radar man leaped into the conversation.</p>
<p>This man said that he'd read every radar report, too, and that there wasn't one that couldn't be explained as a
  weather phenomenon - even the radar visual sightings. In fact, he wasn't even convinced that we had ever gotten such a
  thing as radar visual sighting. He wanted to see proof that an object that was seen visually was the same object that
  the radar had picked up. Did we have it?
</p>
<p>I got back into the discussion at this point with the answer. No, we didn't have proof if you want to get technical
  about the degree of proof needed. But we did have reports where the radar and visual bearings of the UFO coincided
  almost exactly. Then we had a few reports where airplanes had followed the UFO's and the maneuvers of the UFO that the
  pilot reported were the same as the maneuvers of the UFO that was being tracked by radar.
</p>
<p>A lieutenant colonel who had been sitting quietly by interjected a well chosen comment. "It seems the difficulty that
  Project Blue Book faces is what to accept and what not to accept as proof."
</p>
<p>The colonel had hit the proverbial nail on its proverbial head.
</p>
<p>Then he went on, "Everyone has a different idea of what proof really is. Some people think we should accept a new
  model of an airplane after only five or ten hours of flight testing. This is enough proof for them that the airplane
  will fly. But others wouldn't be happy unless it was flight tested for five or ten years. These people have set an
  unreasonably high value on the word 'proof.' The answer is somewhere in between these two extremes."
</p>
<p>But where is this point when it comes to UFO's?
</p>
<p>There was about a thirty second pause for thought after the colonel's little speech. Then someone asked, "What about
  these recent sightings at Mainbrace?"
</p>
<p>In late September 1952 the NATO naval forces had held maneuvers off the coast of Europe; they were called Operation
  Mainbrace. Before they had started someone in the Pentagon had half seriously mentioned that Naval Intelligence should
  keep an eye open for UFO's, but no one really expected the UFO's to show up. Nevertheless, once again the UFO's were
  their old unpredictable selves - they were there.
</p>
<p>On September 20, a U.S. newspaper reporter aboard an aircraft carrier in the North Sea was photographing a carrier
  take-off in color when he happened to look back down the flight deck and saw a group of pilots and flight deck crew
  watching something in the sky. He went back to look and there was a silver sphere moving across the sky just behind
  the fleet of ships. The object appeared to be large, plenty large enough to show up in a photo, so the reporter shot
  several pictures. They were developed right away and turned out to be excellent. He had gotten the superstructure of
  the carrier in each one and, judging by the size of the object in each successive photo, one could see that it was
  moving rapidly.
</p>
<p>The intelligence officers aboard the carrier studied the photos. The object looked like a balloon. From its size it
  was apparent that if it were a balloon, it would have been launched from one of the ships, so the word went out on the
  TBS radio: "Who launched a balloon?"
</p>
<p>The answer came back on the TBS: "Nobody."
</p>
<p>Naval Intelligence double checked, triple checked and quadruple checked every ship near the carrier but they could
  find no one who had launched the UFO.
</p>
<p>We kept after the Navy. The pilots and the flight deck crew who saw the UFO had mixed feelings - some were sure that
  the UFO was a balloon while others were just as sure that it couldn't have been. It was traveling too fast, and
  although it resembled a balloon in some ways it was far from being identical to the hundreds of balloons that the crew
  had seen the aerologists launch.
</p>
<p>We probably wouldn't have tried so hard to get a definite answer to the Mainbrace photos if it hadn't been for the
  events that took place during the rest of the operation, I explained to the group of ADC officers.
</p>
<p>The day after the photos had been taken six RAF pilots flying a formation of jet fighters over the North Sea saw
  something coming from the direction of the Mainbrace fleet. It was a shiny, spherical object, and they couldn't
  recognize it as anything "friendly" so they took after it. But in a minute or two they lost it. When they neared their
  base, one of the pilots looked back and saw that the UFO was now following him. He turned but the UFO also turned, and
  again it outdistanced the Meteor in a matter of minutes.
</p>
<p>Then on the third consecutive day a UFO showed up near the fleet, this time over Topcliffe Aerodrome in England. A
  pilot in a Meteor was scrambled and managed to get his jet fairly close to the UFO, close enough to see that the
  object was "round, silvery, and white" and seemed to "rotate around its vertical axis and sort of wobble." But before
  he could close in to get a really good look it was gone.
</p>
<p>It was these sightings, I was told by an RAF exchange intelligence officer in the Pentagon, that caused the RAF to
  officially recognize the UFO.
</p>
<p>By the time I'd finished telling about the Mainbrace Sightings, it was after the lunch hour in the club and we were
  getting some get-the-hell-out of-here looks from the waiters, who wanted to clean up the dining room. But before I
  could suggest that we leave, Major Sadowski repeated his original question - the one that started the whole
  discussion- "Are you holding out on us?"
</p>
<p>I gave him an unqualified "No." We wanted more positive proof, and until we had it, UFO's would remain unidentified
  flying objects and no more.
</p>
<p>The horizontal shaking of heads illustrated some of the group's thinking. We had plans for getting more positive
  proof, however, and I said that just as soon as we returned to Major Sadowski's office I'd tell them what we
  contemplated doing.
</p>
<p>We moved out onto the sidewalk in front of the club and, after discussing a few more sightings, went back into the
  security area to Sadowski's office and I laid out our plans.
</p>
<p>First of all, in November or December the U.S. was going to shoot the first H-bomb during Project Ivy. Although this
  was Top Secret at the time, it was about the most poorly kept secret in history - everybody seemed to know all about
  it. Some people in the Pentagon had the idea that there were beings, earthly or otherwise, who might be interested in
  our activities in the Pacific, as they seemed to be in Operation Mainbrace. Consequently Project Blue Book had been
  directed to get transportation to the test area to set up a reporting net, brief people on how to report, and analyze
  their reports on the spot.
</p>
<p>Secondly, Project Blue Book was working on plans for an extensive system to track UFO's by instruments. Brigadier
  General Garland, who had been General Samford's Deputy Director for Production and who had been riding herd on the UFO
  project for General Samford, was now chief at ATIC, having replaced Colonel Dunn, who went to the Air War College.
  General Garland had long been in favor of trying to get some concrete information, either positive or negative, about
  the UFO's. This planned tracking system would replace the defraction grid cameras that were still being developed at
  ATIC.
</p>
<p>Thirdly, as soon as we could we were planning to gather together a group of scientists and let them spend a full week
  or two studying the UFO problem.
</p>
<p>When I left ADC, Major Sadowski and crew were satisfied that we weren't just sitting around twiddling our UFO
  reports.
</p>
<p>During the fall of 1952 reports continued to drop off steadily. By December we were down to the normal average of
  thirty per month, with about 20 percent of these falling into the "Unknown" category.
</p>
<p>Our proposed trip to the Pacific to watch for UFO's during the H-bomb test was canceled at the last minute because we
  couldn't get space on an airplane. But the crews of Navy and Air Force security forces who did go out to the tests
  were thoroughly briefed to look for UFO's, and they were given the procedures on how to track and report them. Back at
  Dayton we stood by to make quick analysis of any reports that might come in - none came. Nothing that fell into the
  UFO category was seen during the entire Project Ivy series of atomic shots.

<p>By December work on the planning phase of our instrumentation program was completed. During the two months we had
  been working on it we had considered everything from giving Ground Observer Corps spotters simple wooden tracking
  devices to building special radars and cameras. We had talked over our problems with the people at Wright Field who
  knew about missile tracking equipment, and we had consulted the camera technicians at the Air Force Aerial
  Reconnaissance Laboratory. Astronomers explained their equipment and the techniques to use, and we went to Rome, New
  York, and Boston to enlist the aid of the people who develop the Air Force's electronic equipment.
</p>
<p>Our final plan called for visual spotting stations to be established all over northern New Mexico. We'd picked this
  test location because northern New Mexico still consistently produced more reports than any other area in the U.S.
  These visual spotting stations would be equipped with a sighting device similar to a gun sight on a bomber. All the
  operator would have to do would be to follow the UFO with the tracking device, and the exact time and the UFO's
  azimuth and elevation angles would be automatically recorded. The visual spotting stations would all be tied together
  with an interphone system, so that as soon as the tracker at one station saw something he could alert the other
  spotters in the area. If two stations tracked the same object, we could immediately compute its speed and altitude.
</p>
<p>This visual spotting net would be tied into the existing radar defense net in the Albuquerque-Los Alamos area. At
  each radar site we proposed that a long focal length camera be synchronized to the turning radar antenna, so that any
  time the operator saw a target he could press a button and photograph the portion of the sky exactly where the radar
  said a UFO was located. These cameras would actually be astronomical telescopes, so that even the smallest light or
  object could be photographed.
</p>
<p>In addition to this photography system we proposed that a number of sets of instruments be set out around the area.
  Each set would contain instruments to measure nuclear radiation, any disturbances in the earth's magnetic field, and
  the passage of a body that was giving off heat. The instruments would continually be sending their information to a
  central "UFO command post," which would also get reports directly from the radars and the visual spotting
  stations.</p>
<p>This instrumentation plan would cost about $250,000 because we planned to use as much surplus equipment as possible
  and tie it into existing communications systems, where they already existed. After the setup was established, it would
  cost about $25,000 a year to operate. At first glance this seemed like a lot of money, but when we figured out how
  much the UFO project had cost the Air Force in the past and how much it would probably cost in the future, the price
  didn't seem too bad - especially if we could solve the UFO problem once and for all.
</p>
<p>The powers-that-be at ATIC O.K.'d the plan in December and it went to Washington, where it would have to be approved
  by General Samford before it went to ADC and then back to the Pentagon for higher Air Force official blessing. From
  all indications it looked as if we would get the necessary blessings.
</p>
<p>But the majority of the effort at Project Blue Book during the fall of 1952 had gone toward collecting together all
  of the bits and pieces of data that we had accumulated over the past year and a half. We had sorted out the best of
  the "Unknowns" and made studies of certain aspects of the UFO problem, so that when we could assemble a panel of
  scientists to review the data we could give them the over-all picture, not just a basketful of parts.
</p>
<p>Everyone who knew about the proposed panel meeting was eager to get started because everyone was interested in
  knowing what this panel would have to say. Although the group of scientists wouldn't be empowered to make the final
  decision, their recommendations were to go to the President if they decided that the UFO's were real. And any
  recommendations made by the group of names we planned to assemble would carry a lot of weight.
</p>
<p>In the Pentagon and at ATIC book was being made on what their recommendations would be. When I put my money down, the
  odds were 5 to 3 in favor of the UFO.
