<p>D�but <time>1953-01</time> les <a href="/people/scientifiques.html">scientifiques</a> qui se trouvaient �tre membres
  de <a href="../../../../../../../analyse/Projet/Robertson.html">notre panel d'experts</a> avaient �t� contact�s et
  �taient d'accord pour s'asseoir et juger les ovnis. A notre tour, nous f�mes d'accord pour leur donner tous les
  d�tails sur les ovnis.</p>
<p>Nous avions pour eux nos meilleurs rapports � lire, et nous allions leur montrer les 2 <a
    href="../../../../../../../enquete/indice/film/index.html">films</a> que des officiers de renseignement avaient
  consid�r� comme la <q>preuve cat�gorique</q> - le <a href="../../../../../../../enquete/dossier/Tremonton/index.html">film

<p>Lorsque cette haute cour s'assembla le matin du 12 janvier, la 1�re chose qu'elle re�u fut ses ordres ; 1 des 3 verdicts suivants aurait �t� acceptable :</p>
<ol>
  <li>Tous les signalements d'ovnis sont explicables en terme d'objets connus ou de ph�nom�nes naturels ;
  par cons�quent l'enqu�te devrait cesser de mani�re permanente.  </li>
  <li>Les signalements d'ovnis ne contiennent pas suffisamment de donn�es sur lesquelles baser une une conclusion finale. Le <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">projet Blue Book</a> devrait �tre poursuivi dans l'espoir d'obtenir de meilleurs donn�es.</li>
  <li>Les ovnis sont des vaisseaux spatiaux interplan�taires.</li>
</ol>
<p>Le verdict �crit, dit-on au groupe, serait communiqu� au <a href="/org/us/NSC.html">Conseil National de S�curit�</a>,
  un conseil constitu� des directeurs de l'ensemble des <a href="/org/orgsRenseignement.html">agences de
    renseignement</a> U.S., et de l� il irait au pr�sident des <a href="/org/us/index.html">Etats-Unis</a> -- s'ils
  devaient d�cider que les ovnis �taient des vaisseaux spatiaux interplan�taires.</p>
<p>A cause des r�glements militaires, les noms des membres du panel, comme les noms de tant d'autres gens associ�s �
  l'histoire des ovnis, ne peuvent �tre r�v�l�s. 2 des hommes s'�taient fait un nom en tant que physiciens op�rationnels
  - ils pouvaient transformer la th�orie la plus �lev�e � des fins pratiques. <a
      href="/people/a/AlvarezLuisW/index.html">Un de ces hommes</a> avait d�velopp� le <a
      href="../../../../../../../enquete/indice/radar/index.html">radar</a> qui nous tira d'un grand gouffre au d�but de
  la 2nde guerre mondiale, et l'autre avait �t� l'un des p�res de la bombe H. Un autre des membres du panel est
  aujourd'hui le conseiller civil en chef de l'un de nos plus hauts commandants militaires, et un autre �tait un <a
      href="/people/astronomes.html">astronome</a> dont le combat non publi� pour faire reconna�tre les ovnis est
  respect� � travers les cercles <a href="/people/scientifiques.html">scientifiques</a>. Il y avait un homme connu pour
  sa physique th�orique et ses math�matiques, et un autre qui avait r�alis� les premi�res op�rations de recherche
  pendant la 2nde guerre mondiale. Le 6�me membre du panel avait �t� distingu� par l'<em>American Rocket Society</em> et
  l'<em>International Astronautical Federation</em> pour son travail ayant fait bouger le voyage spatial du domaine de
  Buck Rogers au point d'une quasi-realit� et qui est aujourd'hui un expert en fus�es.</p>
<p>C'�tait une collection impressionnate du meilleur talent scientifique.</p>
<p>Au cours des 2 premiers jours de la rencontre je passais en revue nos conclusions pour les scientifiques. Depuis juin <a href="../../../../4/7/index.html">1947</a>, lorsque le 1er signalement d'ovni fut fait,
l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> avait analys� 1593 signalements d'ovnis. En fait 4400 environ avait �t� re�us,
mais tous sauf 1593 n'�taient pas �ligibles � une analyse. D'apr�s nos �tudes, nous estim�rent que l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> ne re�ut les signalements que de 10 % des observations d'ovnis qui furent faites aux <a href="/org/us/index.html">Etats-Unis</a>, et par cons�quent en 5 ans 1/2 quelque chose comme 44 000 observations d'ovnis furent faites.</p>
<p>Sur les  1593 rapports qui ont �t� analys�s par le <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">projet Blue Book</a>, et nous avons �tudi� et �valu� tout rapport dans les fichiers de l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a>, nous sommes parvenus � en expliquer un grand nombre. La d�composition effective �tait comme suit :

<p>En utilisant les termes "Connu," "Probable," et "Possible," nous avons pu diff�rencier � quel point nous �tions cat�goriques sur nos conclusions. Mais m�me dans les cas "Possibles" nous �tions, dans nos esprits, s�rs que nous avions identifi� l'ovni signal�.</p>
<p>Et qui avait fait ces signalements ? Des <a href="/people/pilotes.html">pilotes</a> et �quipages a�riens en firent 17,1 % depuis le ciel. Scientists and engineers made 5.7 per cent, airport control
tower operators made an even 1.0 per cent of the reports, and 12.5 per
cent of the total were radar reports. The remaining 63.7 per cent were
made by military and civilian observers in general.</p>
<p>The reports that we were interested in were the 26.94 per cent or 429
"Unknowns," so we had studied them in great detail. We studied the reported
colors of the UFO's, the shapes, the directions they were traveling, the
times of day they were observed, and many more details,
but we could find no significant pattern or trends. We did find that
the most often reported shape was elliptical and that the most often reported
color was white or "metallic." About the same number of UFO's were reported
as being seen in daytime as at night, and the direction of travel equally
covered the sixteen cardinal headings of the compass.</p>
<p>Seventy per cent of the "Unknowns" had been seen visually from the air;
12 per cent had been seen visually from the ground; 10 per cent had been
picked up by ground or airborne radar; and 8 per cent were combination
visual radar sightings.
</p><p>In the over-all total of 1,593 sightings women made two reports for
every one made by a man, but in the "Unknowns" the men beat out women ten
to one.
</p><p>There were two other factors we could never resolve, the frequency of
the sightings and their geographical distribution. Since the first flurry
of reports in July of 1947, each July brought a definite peak in reports;
then a definite secondary peak occurred just before each Christmas. We
plotted these peaks in sightings against high tides, world-wide atomic
tests, the positions of the moon and planets, the general cloudiness over
the United States, and a dozen and one other things, but we could never
say what caused more people to see UFO's at certain times of the year.
</p><p>Then the UFO's were habitually reported from areas around "technically
interesting" places like our atomic energy installations, harbors, and
critical manufacturing areas. Our studies showed that such vital military
areas as Strategic Air Command and Air Defense Command bases, some A-bomb
storage areas, and large military depots actually produced fewer reports
than could be expected from a given area in the United States. Large population
centers devoid of any major "technically interesting" facilities also produced
few reports.
</p><p>According to the laws of normal distribution, if UFO's are not intelligently
controlled vehicles, the distribution of reports should have been similar
to the distribution of population in the United States - it wasn't.
</p><p>Our study of the geographical locations of sightings also covered other
countries. The U.S. by no means had a curb on the UFO market
</p><p>In all of our "Unknown" reports we never found one measurement of size,
speed, or altitude that could be considered to be even fairly accurate.
We could say only that some of the UFO's had been traveling pretty fast.
</p>
<p>As far as radar was concerned, we had reports of fantastic speeds -
up to 50,000 miles an hour - but in all of these instances there was some
doubt as to exactly what caused the target. The highest speeds reported
for our combination radar visual sightings, which we considered to be
the best type of sighting in our files, were 700 to 800 miles an hour.
</p>
<p>We had never picked up any "hardware" - any whole saucers, pieces, or
parts - that couldn't be readily identified as being something very earthly.
We had a contract with a materials testing laboratory, and they would analyze
any piece of material that we found or was sent to us. The tar covered
marble, aluminum broom handle, cow manure, slag, pieces of plastic balloon,
and the what-have-you that we did receive and analyze only served to give
the people in our material lab some practice and added nothing but laughs
to the UFO project.
</p><p>The same went for the reports of "contacts" with spacemen. Since 1952
a dozen or so people have claimed that they have talked to or ridden with
the crews of flying saucers. They offer affidavits, pieces of material,
photographs, and other bits and pieces of junk as proof. We investigated
some of these reports and could find absolutely no fact behind the stories.
</p><p>We had a hundred or so photos of flying saucers, both stills and movies.
Many were fakes some so expert that it took careful study by photo interpreters
to show how the photos had been faked. Some were the crudest of fakes,
automobile hub caps thrown into the air, homemade saucers suspended by
threads, and just plain retouched negatives. The rest of the still photos
had been sent in by well meaning citizens who couldn't recognize a light
flare of flaw in the negative, or who had chanced to get an excellent photo
of a sundog or mirage.
</p><p>But the movies that were sent in to us were different. In the first
place, it takes an expert with elaborate equipment to fake a movie. We
had or knew about four strips of movie film that fell into the "Unknown"
category. Two were the cinetheodolite movies that had been taken at White
Sands Proving Ground in April and May of 1950, one was the Montana Movie
and the last was the Tremonton Movie. These latter two had been subjected
to thousands of hours of analysis, and since we planned to give the panel
of scientists more thorough reports on them on Friday, I skipped over their
details and went to the next point I wanted to cover - theories.
</p>
<p>Periodically throughout the history of the UFO people have come up with
widely publicized theories to explain all UFO reports. The one that received
the most publicity was the one offered by Dr. Donald Menzel of Harvard
University. Dr. Menzel, writing in Time, Look, and later in his Flying
Saucers, claimed that all UFO reports could be explained as various types
of light phenomena. We studied this theory thoroughly because it did seem
to have merit. Project Bear's physicists studied it. ATIC's scientific
consultants studied it and discussed it with several
leading European physicists whose specialty was atmospheric physics.
In general the comments that Project Blue Book received were, "He's given
the subject some thought but his explanations are not the panacea."</p>
<p>And there were other widely publicized theories. One man said that they
were all skyhook balloons, but we knew the flight path of every skyhook
balloon and they were seldom reported as UFO's. Their little brothers,
the weather balloons, caused us a great deal more trouble.
</p><p>The Army Engineers took a crack at solving the UFO problem by making
an announcement that a scientist in one of their laboratories had duplicated
a flying saucer in his laboratory. Major Dewey Fournet checked into this
one. It had all started out as a joke, but it was picked up as fact and
the scientist was stuck with it. He gained some publicity but lost prestige
because other scientists wondered just how competent the man really was
to try to pass off such an answer.
</p><p>All in all, the unsolicited assistance of theorists didn't help us a
bit, I told the panel members. Some of them were evidently familiar with
the theories because they nodded their heads in agreement.
</p><p>The next topic I covered in my briefing was a question that came up
quite frequently in discussions of the UFO: Did UFO reports actually start
in 1947? We had spent a great deal of time trying to resolve this question.
Old newspaper files, journals, and books that we found in the Library of
Congress contained many reports of odd things being seen in the sky as
far back as the Biblical times. The old Negro spiritual says, "Ezekiel
saw a wheel 'way up in the middle of the air." We couldn't substantiate
Ezekiel's sighting because many of the very old reports of odd things observed
in the sky could be explained as natural phenomena that weren't fully understood
in those days.
</p><p>The first documented reports of sightings similar to the UFO sightings
as we know them today appeared in the newspapers of 1896. In fact, the
series of sightings that occurred in that year and the next had many points
of similarity with the reports of today.
</p><p>The sightings started in the San Francisco Bay area on the evening of
November 22, 1896, when hundreds of people going home from work saw a large,
dark, "cigar shaped object with stubby wings" traveling northwest across
Oakland.
</p><p>Within hours after the mystery craft had disappeared over what is now
the northern end of the Golden Gate Bridge, the stories of people in other
northern California towns began to come in on the telegraph wires. The
citizens of Santa Rosa, Sacramento, Chico, and Red Bluff- several thousand
of them saw it.
</p>
<p>I tried to find out if the people in these outlying communities saw
the
UFO before they heard the news from the San Francisco area or afterward,
but trying to run down the details of a fifty-six-year-old UFO report is
almost hopeless. Once while I was on a trip to Hamilton AFB I called the
offices of the San Francisco Chronicle and they put me in touch with a
retired employee who had worked on a San Francisco paper in 1896. I called
the old gentleman on the phone and talked to him for a long time. He had
been a copy boy at the time and remembered the incident, but time had canceled
out the details. He did tell me that he, the editor of the paper, and the
news staff had seen "the ship," as he referred to the UFO. His story, even
though it was fifty six years old, smacked of others I'd heard when he
said that no one at the newspaper ever told anyone what they had seen;
they didn't want people to think that they were "crazy."</p>
<p>On November 30 the mystery ship was back over the San Francisco area
and those people who had maintained that people were being fooled by a
wag in a balloon became believers when the object was seen moving into
the wind.
</p><p>For four months reports came in from villages, cities, and farms in
the West; then the Midwest, as the airship "moved eastward." In early April
of 1897 people in Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Illinois
reported seeing it. On April 10 it was reported to be over Chicago. Reports
continued to come in to the newspapers until about April 20; then it, or
stories about it, were gone. Literally thousands of people had seen it
before the last report clicked in over the telegraph wires.
</p><p>A study of the hundreds of newspaper accounts of this sighting that
rocked the world in the late 1890's was interesting because the same controversies
that arose then exist now. Those who hadn't seen the stubby winged, cigar
shaped "craft" said, "Phooey," or the nineteenth- century version thereof.
Those who had seen it were almost ready to do battle to uphold their integrity.
Some astronomers loudly yelled, "Venus," "Jupiter," and "Alpha Orionis"
while others said, "We saw it." Thomas Edison, the man of science of the
day, disclaimed any knowledge of the mystery craft. "I prefer to devote
my time to objects of commercial value," he told a New York Herald reporter.
"At best airships would only be toys."
</p><p>Thomas - you goofed on that prediction.
</p><p>I had one more important point to cover before I finished my briefing
and opened the meeting to a general question-and-answer session.
</p>
<p>During the past year and a half we had had several astronomers visit
Project Blue Book, and they were not at all hesitant to give us their opinions
but they didn't care to say much about what their colleagues were thinking,
although they did indicate that they were thinking. We decided
that the opinions and comments of astronomers would be of value, so
late in 1952 we took a poll. We asked an astronomer, whom we knew to be
unbiased about the UFO problem and who knew every outstanding astronomer
in the United States, to take a trip and talk to his friends. We asked
him not to make a point of asking about the UFO but just to work the subject
into a friendly conversation. This way we hoped to get a completely frank
opinion. To protect his fellow astronomers, our astronomer gave them all
code names and he kept the key to the code.
</p>
<p>The report we received expressed the detailed opinions of forty five
recognized authorities. Their opinions varied from that of Dr. C, who regarded
the UFO project as a "silly waste of money to investigate an even sillier
subject," to Dr. L, who has spent a great deal of his own valuable time
personally investigating UFO reports because he believes that they are
something "real." Of the forty five astronomers who were interviewed, 36
per cent were not at all interested in the UFO reports, 41 per cent were
interested to the point of offering their services if they were ever needed,
and 23 per cent thought that the UFO's were a much more serious problem
than most people recognized.
</p><p>None of the astronomers, even during a friendly discussion, admitted
that he thought the UFO's could be interplanetary vehicles. All of those
who were interested would only go so far as to say, "We don't know what
they are, but they're something real."
</p><p>During the past few years I have heard it said that if the UFO's were
really "solid objects" our astronomers would have seen them. Our study
shed some light on this point - astronomers have seen UFO's. None of them
has ever seen or photographed anything resembling a UFO through his telescope,
but 11 per cent of the forty five men had seen something that they couldn't
explain. Although, technically speaking, these sightings were no better
than hundreds of others in our files as far as details were concerned,
they were good because of the caliber of the observer. Astronomers know
what is in the sky.
</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that out of the representative cross section
of astronomers, five of them, or 11 per cent, had sighted UFO's. For a
given group of people this is well above average. To check this point,
the astronomer who was making our study picked ninety people at random
-  people he met while traveling - and got them into a conversation
about flying saucers. These people were his "control group," to borrow
a term from the psychologists. Although the percentage of people who were
interested in UFO's was higher for the control group than for the group
of astronomers, only 41 per cent of the astronomers were interested while
86 per cent of the control group were interested; 11 per cent of the
astronomers had seen UFO's, while only about 1 per cent of the control
group had seen one. This seemed to indicate that as a group astronomers
see many more UFO's than the average citizen.
</p>
<p>When I finished my briefing, it was too late to start the question-
and- answer session, so the first day's meeting adjourned. But promptly
at nine o'clock the next morning the group was again gathered, and from
the looks of the list of questions some of them had, they must have been
thinking about UFO's all night.
</p><p>One of the first questions was about the results of photography taken
by the pairs of huge "meteorite patrol" cameras that are located in several
places throughout North America. Did they ever photograph a UFO? The cameras,
which are in operation almost every clear night, can photograph very dim
lights, and once a light is photographed its speed and altitude can be
very accurately established. If there were any objects giving off light
as they flew through our atmosphere, there is a chance that these cameras
might have photographed them. But they hadn't.
</p><p>At first this seemed to be an important piece of evidence and we had
just about racked this fact up as a definite score against the UFO when
we did a little checking. If the UFO had been flying at an altitude of
100 miles, the chances of its being picked up by the cameras would be good,
but the chances of photographing something flying any lower would be less.
</p><p>This may account for the fact that while our "inquiring astronomer"
was at the meteorite patrol camera sites, he talked to an astronomer who
had seen a UFO while operating one of the patrol cameras.
</p><p>Many people have asked why our astronomers haven't seen anything through
their big telescopes. They are focused light years away and their field
of vision is so narrow that even if UFO's did exist and littered the atmosphere
they wouldn't be seen.
</p><p>Another question the panel had was about Orson Welles' famous War of
the Worlds broadcast of October 1938, which caused thousands of people
to panic. Had we studied this to see if there were any similarities between
it and the current UFO reporting?
</p><p>We had.
</p><p>Our psychologist looked into the matter and gave us an opinion - to
make a complete study and get a positive answer would require an effort
that would dwarf the entire UFO project. But he did have a few comments.
There were many documented cases in which a series of innocent circumstances
triggered by the broadcast had caused people to completely lose all sense
of good judgment - to panic. There were some similar reports in our UFO
files.
</p>
<p>But we had many reports in which people reported UFO's and obviously
hadn't panicked. Reports from pilots who had seen mysterious lights
at night and, thinking that they might be a cockpit reflection, had turned
off all their cockpit lights. Or the pilots who turned and rolled their
airplanes to see if they could change the angle of reflection and get rid
of the UFO. Or those pilots who climbed and dove thousands of feet and
then leveled out to see if the UFO would change its relative position to
the airplane. Or the amateur astronomer who made an excellent sighting
and before he reluctantly reported it as a UFO had talked to a half dozen
professional astronomers and physicists in hopes of finding an explanation.
All of these people were thinking clearly, questioning themselves as to
what the sightings could be; then trying to answer their questions. These
people weren't panicked.
</p>
<p>The question-and-answer period went on for a full day as the scientists
dug into the details of the general facts I had given them in my briefing.
</p><p>The following day and a half was devoted to reviewing and discussing
fifty
of our best sighting reports that we had classed as "Unknowns."
</p><p>The next item on the agenda, when the panel had finished absorbing all
of the details of the fifty selected top reports, was a review of a very
hot and very highly controversial study. It was based on the idea that
Major Dewey Fournet and I had talked about several months before - an analysis
of the motions of the reported UFO's in an attempt to determine whether
they were intelligently controlled. The study was hot because it wasn't
official and the reason it wasn't official was because it was so hot. It
concluded that the UFO's were interplanetary spaceships. The report had
circulated around high command levels of intelligence and it had been read
with a good deal of interest. But even though some officers at command
levels just a notch below General Samford bought it, the space behind the
words "Approved by" was blank - no one would stick his neck out and officially
send it to the top.
</p><p>Dewey Fournet, who had completed his tour of active duty in the Air
Force and was now a civilian, was called from Houston, Texas, to tell the
scientists about the study since he had worked very closely with the group
that had prepared it.
</p>
<p>The study covered several hundred of our most detailed UFO reports.
By a very critical process of elimination, based on the motion of the reported
UFO's, Fournet told the panel how he and any previous analysis by Project
Blue Book had been disregarded and how those reports that could have been
caused by any one of the many dozen known objects - balloons, airplanes,
astronomical bodies, etc., were sifted out. This sifting took quite a toll,
and the study ended up with only ten or twenty reports that fell into the
"Unknown" category. Since such critical methods of
evaluation had been used, these few reports proved beyond a doubt that
the UFO's were intelligently controlled by persons with brains equal to
or far surpassing ours.
</p>
<p>The next step in the study, Fournet explained, was to find out where
they came from. "Earthlings" were eliminated, leaving the final answer
- spacemen.
</p><p>Both Dewey and I had been somewhat worried about how the panel would
react to a study with such definite conclusions. But when he finished his
presentation, it was obvious from the tone of the questioning that the
men were giving the conclusions serious thought. Fournet's excellent reputation
was well known.
</p><p>On Friday morning we presented the feature attractions of the session,
the Tremonton Movie and the Montana Movie. These two bits of evidence represented
the best photos of UFO's that Project Blue Book had to offer. The scientists
knew about them, especially the Tremonton Movie, because since late July
they had been the subject of many closed door conferences. Generals, admirals,
and GS-16's had seen them at "command performances", and they had been
flown to Kelly AFB in Texas to be shown to a conference of intelligence
officers from all over the world. Two of the country's best military photo
laboratories, the Air Force lab at Wright Field and the Navy's lab at Anacostia,
Maryland, had spent many hours trying to prove that the UFO's were balloons,
airplanes, or stray light reflections, but they failed - the UFO's were
true unknowns. The possibility that the movie had been faked was considered
but quickly rejected because only a Hollywood studio with elaborate equipment
could do such a job and the people who filmed the movies didn't have this
kind of equipment.
</p><p>The Montana Movie had been taken on August 15, 1950, by Nick Mariana,
the manager of the Great Falls baseball team. It showed two large bright
lights flying across the blue sky in an echelon formation. There were no
clouds in the movie to give an indication of the UFO's speed, but at one
time they passed behind a water tower. The lights didn't show any detail;
they appeared to be large circular objects.
</p><p>Mariana had sent his movies to the Air Force back in 1950, but in 1950
there was no interest in the UFO so, after a quick viewing, Project Grudge
had written them off as "the reflections from two F-94 jet fighters that
were in the area."
</p>
<p>In 1952, at the request of the Pentagon, I reopened the investigation
of the Montana Movie. Working through an intelligence officer at the Great
Falls AFB, I had Mariana reinterrogated and obtained a copy of his movie,
which I sent to the photo lab.
</p>
<p>When the photo lab got the movie, they had a little something to work
with because the two UFO's had passed behind a reference point, the water
tower. Their calculations quickly confirmed that the objects were not birds,
balloons, or meteors. Balloons drift with the wind and the wind was not
blowing in the direction that the two UFO's were traveling. No exact speeds
could be measured, but the lab could determine that the lights were traveling
too fast to be birds and too slow to be meteors.
</p><p>This left airplanes as the only answer. The intelligence officer at
Great Falls had dug through huge stacks of files and found that only two
airplanes, two F-94's, were near the city during the sighting and that
they had landed about two minutes afterwards. Both Mariana and his secretary,
who had also seen the UFO's, had said that the two jets had appeared in
another part of the sky only a minute or two after the two UFO's had disappeared
in the southeast. This in itself would eliminate the jets as candidates
for the UFO's, but we wanted to double check. The two circular lights didn't
look like F-94's, but anyone who has done any flying can tell you that
an airplane so far away that it can't be seen can suddenly catch the sun's
rays and make a brilliant flash.
</p><p>First we studied the flight paths of the two F-94's. We knew the landing
pattern that was being used on the day of the sighting, and we knew when
the two F-94's landed. The two jets just weren't anywhere close to where
the two UFO's had been. Next we studied each individual light and both
appeared to be too steady to be reflections.
</p><p>We drew a blank on the Montana Movie - it was an unknown.
</p><p>We also drew a blank on the Tremonton Movie, a movie that had been taken
by a Navy Chief Photographer, Warrant Officer Delbert C. Newhouse, on July
2, 1952.
</p><p>Our report on the incident showed that Newhouse, his wife, and their
two children were driving to Oakland, California, from the east coast on
this eventful day. They had just passed through Tremonton, Utah, a town
north of Salt Lake City, and had traveled about 7 miles on U.S. Highway
30S when Mrs. Newhouse noticed a group of objects in the sky. She pointed
them out to her husband; he looked, pulled over to the side of the road,
stopped the car, and jumped out to get a better look. He didn't have to
look very long to realize that something highly unusual was taking place
because in his twenty one years in the Navy and 2,000 hours' flying time
as an aerial photographer, he'd never seen anything like this. About a
dozen shiny disk like objects were "milling around the sky in a rough formation."
</p>
<p>Newhouse had his movie camera so he turned the turret around to a 3
inch telephoto lens and started to photograph the UFO's. He held the camera
still and took several feet of film, getting all of the bright objects
in one photo. All of the UFO's had stayed in a compact group from the
time the Newhouse family had first seen them, but just before they disappeared
over the western horizon one of them left the main group and headed east.
Newhouse swung his camera around and took several shots of it, holding
his camera steady and letting the UFO pass through the field of view before
it disappeared in the east.
</p>
<p>When I received the Tremonton films I took them right over to the Wright
Field photo lab, along with the Montana Movie, and the photo technicians
and I ran them twenty or thirty times. The two movies were similar in that
in both of them the objects appeared to be large circular lights - in neither
one could you see any detail. But, unlike the Montana Movie, the lights
in the Tremonton Movie would fade out, then come back in again. This fading
immediately suggested airplanes reflecting light, but the roar of a king-sized
dogfight could have been heard for miles and the Newhouse family had heard
no sound. We called in several fighter pilots and they watched the UFO's
circling and darting in and out in the cloudless blue sky. Their unqualified
comment was that no airplane could do what the UFO's were doing.
</p><p>Balloons came under suspicion, but the lab eliminated them just as quickly
by studying the kind of a reflection given off by a balloon - it is a steady
reflection since a balloon is spherical. Then, to further scuttle the balloon
theory, clusters of balloons are tied together and don't mill around. Of
course, the lone UFO that took off to the east by itself was the biggest
argument against balloons.
</p><p>Newhouse told an intelligence officer from the Western Air Defense Forces
that he had held his camera still and let this single UFO fly through the
field of view, so the people in the lab measured its angular velocity.
Unfortunately there were no clouds in the sky, nor was he able to include
any of the ground in the pictures, so our estimates of angular velocity
had to be made assuming that the photographer held his camera still. Had
the lone UFO been 10 miles away it would have been traveling several thousand
miles an hour.
</p><p>After studying the movies for several weeks, the Air Force photo lab
at Wright Field gave up. All they had to say was, "We don't know what they
are but they aren't airplanes or balloons, and we don't think they are
birds."
</p><p>While the lab had been working on the movies at Wright Field, Major
Fournet had been talking to the Navy photo people at Anacostia; they thought
they had some good ideas on how to analyze the movies, so as soon as we
were through with them I sent them to Major Fournet and he took them over
to the Navy lab.
</p>
<p>The Navy lab spent about two months studying the films and had just
completed their analysis. The men who had done the work were on hand
to brief the panel of scientists on their analysis after the panel had
seen the movies.
</p>
<p>We darkened the room and I would imagine that we ran each film ten times
before every panel member was satisfied that he had seen and could remember
all of the details. We ran both films together so that the men could compare
them.
</p><p>The Navy analysts didn't use the words "interplanetary spacecraft" when
they told of their conclusions, but they did say that the UFO's were intelligently
controlled vehicles and that they weren't airplanes or birds. They had
arrived at this conclusion by making a frame-by-frame study of the motion
of the lights and the changes in the lights' intensity.
</p><p>When the Navy people had finished with their presentation, the scientists
had questions. None of the panel members were trying to find fault with
the work the Navy people had done, but they weren't going to accept the
study until they had meticulously searched for every loophole. Then they
found one.
</p><p>In measuring the brilliance of the lights, the photo analysts had used
an instrument called a densitometer. The astronomer on the panel knew all
about measuring the density of an extremely small photographic image with
a densitometer because he did it all the time in his studies of the stars.
And the astronomer didn't think that the Navy analysts had used the correct
technique in making their measurements. This didn't necessarily mean that
their data were all wrong, but it did mean that they should recheck their
work.
</p>
<p>When the discussion of the Navy's report ended, one of the scientists
asked to see the Tremonton Movie again; so I had the projectionists run
it several more times. The man said that he thought the UFO's could be
sea gulls soaring on a thermal current. He lived in Berkeley and said that
he'd seen gulls high in the air over San Francisco Bay. We had thought
of this possibility several months before because the area around the Great
Salt Lake is inhabited by large white gulls. But the speed of the lone
UFO as it left the main group had eliminated the gulls. I pointed this
out to the physicist. Sa r�ponse fut que le warrant officer de la Marine aurait pu penser avoir tenu droite sa cam�ra... il aurait pu avoir "se d�caler avec l'action"  inconsciemment, ce qui aurait disqualifi� tous les calculs. Je fus d'accord avec ceci, mais je ne pus �tre d'accord sur le fait qu'il s'agissait de mouettes.</p>
<p>Mais plusieurs mois plus tard je me trouvais � San Francisco � attendre un avion de ligne pour Los Angeles et
  j'observais des mouettes montant dans un ciel sans <a href="../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/nuage/index.html">nuages</a>.
  Elles were "riding a thermal," et �taient si haut que vous ne pouviez pas les voir tant qu'elles ne s'inclinaient pas
  d'une certaine fa�on ; puis elles appar�rent comme un �clair lumineux blanc, bien plus grand que celui que l'on
  pourrait attendre de mouettes de mer. Il y avait une forte ressemblance avec les ovnis du films de Tremonton. Mais je
  ne suis pas s�r que ce soit la r�ponse.</p>
<p>La pr�sentation des 2 films mit fin � la partie <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Projet Blue
  Book</a> de la r�union. En 5 jours nous avions fourni au panel de <a
    href="/people/scientifiques.html">scientifiques</a> tout d�tail pertinent de l'histoire des ovnis, et il leur
  revenait de nous dire s'ils �taient r�els -- un type de v�hicule volant � travers notre atmosph�re. S'ils �taient
  r�els, alors ils auraient d� �tre des vaisseaux spatiaux parce que personne � la r�union ne pensa une 2nde fois � la
  possibilit� que les ovnis puissent �tre un appareil U.S. super secret ou un d�veloppement sovi�tique. Les <a
      href="/people/scientifiques.html">scientifiques</a> savaient tout ce qui se passait aux U.S. et ils savaient
  qu'aucun pays au monde n'avait d�velopp� sa technologie suffisamment loin pour construire un appareil qui afficherait
  des performances semblables � celles signal�es chez les ovnis. De plus, nous d�pensions des milliards de dollars dans
  la recherche et d�veloppement et la fourniture d'avions qui titillaient tout juste la vitesse du son. Il serait <a
      href="../../../../../../../analyse/absurde/">absurde</a> de penser que ces milliards qui �taient d�pens�s pour
  couvrir l'existence d'une arme de type ovni. Et il serait tout aussi <a href="../../../../../../../analyse/absurde/">absurde</a>
  de penser que les britanniques, fran�ais, russes ou tout autre pays puisse �tre si avanc�s par rapport � nous qu'ils
  puissent avoir un ovni.</p>
<p>Les <a href="/people/scientifiques.html">scientifiques</a> pass�rent les 2 jours suivants � consid�rer une
  conclusion. Ils relirent les rapports et regard�rent les 2 films encore et encore, ils appel�rent d'autres <a
      href="/people/scientifiques.html">scientifiques</a> pour contre-v�rifier certaines id�es qu'ils avaient, et ils
  discut�rent du probl�me entre eux. Puis ils r�dig�rent leurs conclusions et chaque homme signa le document. Le 1er
  paragraphe dit :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>We as a group do not believe that it is impossible for some other celestial body to be inhabited by intelligent
    creatures. Nor is it impossible that these creatures could have reached such a state of development that they could
    visit the earth. However, there is nothing in all of the so-called "flying saucer" reports that we have read that
    would indicate that this is taking place. </q></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Tremonton Movie had been rejected as proof but the panel did leave
the door open a crack when they suggested that the Navy photo lab redo
their study. But the Navy lab never rechecked their report, and it was
over a year later before new data came to light.
</p>
<p>After I got out of the Air Force I met Newhouse and talked to him for
two hours. I've talked to many people who have reported UFO's, but few
impressed me as much as Newhouse. I learned that when he and his family
first saw the UFO's they were close to the car, much closer than when he
took the movie. To use Newhouse's own words, "If they had been the size
of a B-29 they would have been at 10,000 feet altitude." And the Navy man
and his family had taken a good look at the objects - they
looked like "two pie pans, one inverted on the top of the other!" He
didn't just think the UFO's were disk shaped; he knew that they were; he
had plainly seen them. I asked him why he hadn't told this to the intelligence
officer who interrogated him. He said that he had. Then I remembered that
I'd sent the intelligence officer a list of questions I wanted Newhouse
to answer. The question "What did the UFO's look like?" wasn't one of them
because when you have a picture of something you don't normally ask what
it looks like. Why the intelligence officer didn't pass this information
on to us I'll never know.</p>
<p>The Montana Movie was rejected by the panel as positive proof because
even though the two observers said that the jets were in another part of
the sky when they saw the UFO's and our study backed them up, there was
still a chance that the two UFO's could have been the two jets. We couldn't
prove the UFO's were the jets, but neither could we prove they weren't.
</p><p>The controversial study of the UFO's' motions that Major Fournet had
presented was discarded. All of the panel agreed that if there had been
some permanent record of the motion of the UFO's, a photograph of a UFO's
flight path or a photograph of a UFO's track on a radarscope, they could
have given the study much more weight. But in every one of the ten or twenty
reports that were offered as proof that the UFO's were intelligently controlled,
the motions were only those that the observer had seen. And the human eye
and mind are not accurate recorders. How many different stories do you
get when a group of people watch two cars collide at an intersection?
</p><p>Each of the fifty of our best sightings that we gave the scientists
to study had some kind of a loophole. In many cases the loopholes were
extremely small, but scientific evaluation has no room for even the smallest
of loopholes and we had asked for a scientific evaluation.
</p><p>When they had finished commenting on the reports, the scientists pointed
out the seriousness of the decision they had been asked to make. They said
that they had tried hard to be objective and not to be picayunish, but
actually all we had was circumstantial evidence. Good circumstantial evidence,
to be sure, but we had nothing concrete, no hardware, no photos showing
any detail of a UFO, no measured speeds, altitudes, or sizes - nothing
in the way of good, hard, cold, scientific facts. To stake the future course
of millions of lives on a decision based upon circumstantial evidence would
be one of the gravest mistakes in the history of the world.
</p>
<p>In their conclusions they touched upon the possibility that the UFO's
might be some type of new or yet undiscovered natural phenomenon. They
explained that they hadn't given this too much credence; however, if the
UFO's were a new natural phenomenon, the reports of their general appearance
should follow a definite pattern - the UFO reports didn't.
</p>
<p>This ended the section of the panel's report that covered their conclusions.
The next section was entitled, "Recommendations." I fully expected that
they would recommend that we as least reduce the activities of Project
Blue Book if not cancel it entirely. I didn't like this one bit because
I was firmly convinced that we didn't have the final answer. We needed
more and better proof before a final yes or no could be given.
</p><p>The panel didn't recommend that the activities of Blue Book be cut back,
and they didn't recommend that it be dropped. They recommended that it
be expanded. Too many of the reports had been made by credible observers,
the report said, people who should know what they're looking at - people
who think things out carefully. Data that was out of the circumstantial
- evidence class was badly needed. And the panel must have been at least
partially convinced that an expanded effort would prove something interesting
because the expansion they recommended would require a considerable sum
of money. The investigative force of Project Blue Book should be quadrupled
in size, they wrote, and it should be staffed by specially trained experts
in the fields of electronics, meteorology, photography, physics, and other
fields of science pertinent to UFO investigations. Every effort should
be made to set up instruments in locations where UFO sightings are frequent,
so that data could be measured and recorded during a sighting. In other
locations around the country military and civilian scientists should be
alerted and instructed to use every piece of available equipment that could
be used to track UFO's.
</p><p>And lastly, they said that the American public should be told every
detail of every phase of the UFO investigation - the details of the sightings,
the official conclusions, and why the conclusions were made. This would
serve a double purpose; it would dispel any of the mystery that security
breeds and it would keep the Air Force on the ball - sloppy investigations
and analyses would never occur.
</p><p>When the panel's conclusions were made known in the government, they
met with mixed reactions. Some people were satisfied, but others weren't.
Even the opinions of a group of the country's top scientists couldn't overcome
the controversy that had dogged the UFO for five years. Some of those who
didn't like the decision had sat in on the UFO's trial as spectators and
they felt that the "jury" was definitely prejudiced - afraid to stick their
necks out. They could see no reason to continue to assume that the UFO's
weren't interplanetary vehicles.
