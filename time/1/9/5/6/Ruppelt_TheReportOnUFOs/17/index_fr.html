<p>Que sont les ovnis ? Alors que les scientifiquent étaient à Washington (D.C.), à réfléchir sur les ovnis, les ovnis
  ne restaient pas assis sans rien faire à attendre de trouver ce qu'ils étaients - ils étaient dehors à faire un peu de
  "lobbying" pour la cause - gardant l'intérêt stirred up. </p>
<p>Et ils faisaient un bon boulot, eux aussi.</p>
<p>Il était juste quelques minutes avec minuit <time>1953-01-28</time>, lorsqu'un message flashed à Wright-Patterson
  pour le <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">projet Blue Book</a>. Il était envoyé "Operational Immediate," et
  avec donc une prise en charge en priorité ; je le lisais vers <time>12:30 A.M.</time>. Un pilote avait pris en chasse
  un ovni.</p>
<p>Le rapport ne comportait pas beaucoup de détails, mais il sonnait bien. Il donnait le nom du pilote et indiquait
  qu'il pouvait être joint à la base aérienne de Moody. Je passais un appel longue distance, trouvais le pilote, et
  allumais mon magnétophone avait d'avoir son histoire mot pour mot.</p>
<p>Il me dit qu'il avait volé sur un <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/aeronef/f86">F-86</a> en vol de
  navigation "alternée" de la base aérienne de Moody jusqu'à celle de Lawson puis à celle de Robins, pour enfin revenir
  à Moody - toutes en Georgie. A exactement <time>21:35</time> il était à 6000 pieds, en direction de la base de Lawson
  sur la première partie de son vol. Il se souvenait avoir regardé en bas et vu les lumières d'Albany (Georgie) ; il
  avait alors regardé à nouveau en haut et vu cette lumière blanche brillante à <q>hauteur de 10 h.</q> C'était une
  lumière d'une brillance inhabituelle, et il dit avoir pensé que c'était pour cela qu'elle était si remarquable parmi
  les étoiles. Il continua de voler pendant quelques minutes en la regardant alors qu'il dépassait Albany. Il considéra
  que ce devait être une étoile extrêmement brillante ou alors un autre avion -- sauf qu'elle n'y ressemblait pas. Elle
  avait une forme vraiment trop circulaire.</p>
<p>C'était une belle nuit pour voler et he had to get in so much time anyway, so he thought he'd try to get a little
  closer to it. If it was an airplane, chances were he could close in and if it was a star, he should be able to climb
  up to 30 000 feet and the light shouldn't change its relative position. He checked his oxygen supply, increased the
  r.p.m. of the engine, and started to climb. In three or four minutes it was obvious that he was getting above the
  light, and he watched it; it had moved in relation to the stars. It must be an airplane then, he'd decided - an
  airplane so far away that he couldn't see its red and green wing tip lights.</p>
<p>Since he'd gone this far, he decided that he'd get closer and make sure it was an airplane; so he dropped the nose of
  the F-86 and started down. As the needle on the machmeter nudged the red line, he saw that he was getting closer
  because the light was getting bigger, but still he couldn't see any lights other than the one big white one. Then it
  wasn't white any longer; it was changing color. In about a two second cycle it changed from white to red, then back to
  white again. It went through this cycle two or three times, and then before he could realize what was going on, he
  told me, the light changed in shape to a perfect triangle. Then it split into two triangles, one above the other. By
  this time he had leveled off and wasn't closing in any more. In a flash the whole thing was gone. He used the old
  standard description for a disappearing UFO: <q>"It was just like someone turning off a light - it's there, then it's
    gone." </q></p>
<p>I asked him what he thought he'd seen. He'd thought about flying saucers, he said, but he "<q>just couldn't swallow
  those stories</q>." He thought he had a case of vertigo and the more he thought about it, the surer he was that this
  was the answer. He'd felt pretty foolish, he told me, and he was glad that he was alone.
</p>
<p>Up ahead he saw the sprawling lights of Fort Benning and Lawson AFB, his turning point on the flight, and he'd
  started to turn but then he'd checked his fuel. The climb had used up quite a bit, so he changed his mind about going
  to Robins AFB and started straight back to Moody.
</p>
<p>He called in to the ground station to change his flight plan, but before he could say anything the ground radio
  operator asked him if he'd seen a mysterious light.
</p>
<p>Well - he'd seen a light.
</p>
<p>Then the ground operator proceeded to tell him that the UFO chase had been watched on radar. First the radar had the
  UFO target on the scope, and it was a UFO because it was traveling much too slowly to be an airplane. Then the radar
  operators saw the F-86 approach, climb, and make a shallow dive toward the UFO. At first the F-86 had closed in on the
  UFO, but then the UFO had speeded up just enough to maintain a comfortable lead. This went on for two or three
  minutes; then it had moved off the scope at a terrific speed. The radar site had tried to call him, the ground station
  told the F-86 pilot, but they couldn't raise him so the message had to be relayed through the tower.
</p>
<p>Rack up two more points for the UFO - another unknown and another confirmed believer.
</p>
<p>Two or three weeks after the meeting of the panel of scientists in Washington I received word that Project Blue Book
  would follow the recommendations that the panel had made. I was to start implementing the plan right away. Our
  proposal for setting up instruments had gone to the Pentagon weeks before, so that was already taken care of. We
  needed more people, so I drew up a new organizational cable that called for more investigators and analysts and sent
  it through to <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a>'s personnel section.
</p>
<p>About this time in the history of the UFO the first of a series of snags came up. The scientists had strongly
  recommended that we hold nothing back - give the public everything. Accordingly, when the press got wind of the
  Tremonton Movie, which up until this time had been a closely guarded secret, I agreed to release it for the newsmen to
  see. I wrote a press release which was O.K.'d by General Garland, then the chief of ATIC, and sent it to the Pentagon.
  It told what the panel had said about the movies, <q>"until proved otherwise there is no reason why the UFO's couldn't
    have been sea gulls.</q>" Then the release went on to say that we weren't sure exactly what the UFO's were, the sea
  gull theory was only an opinion. When the Pentagon got the draft of the release they screamed,<q> "No!</q>" No movie
  for the press and no press release. The sea gull theory was too weak, and we had a new publicity policy as of now -
  don't say anything.
</p>
<p>This policy, incidentally, is still in effect. The January 7, <a href="../../../5/index.html">1955</a>, issue of the
  Air Force Information Services Letter said, in essence, people in the Air Force are talking too much about UFO's -
  shut up. The old theory that if you ignore them they'll go away is again being followed.
</p>
<p>Inside of a month the UFO project took a few more hard jolts. In December of 1952 I'd asked for a transfer. I'd
  agreed to stay on as chief of Blue Book until the end of February so that a replacement could be obtained and be
  broken in. But no replacement showed up. And none showed up when Lieutenant Rothstien's tour of active duty ended,
  when Lieutenant Andy Flues transferred to the Alaskan Air Command, or when others left. When I left the UFO project
  for a two month tour of temporary duty in Denver, Lieutenant Bob Olsson took over as chief. His staff consisted of
  Airman First Class Max Futch. Both men were old veterans of the UFO campaign of '52, but two people can do only so
  much.
</p>
<p>Lorsque je revins à l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> en <span class="mois">juillet</span> <a
  href="../../../3/index.html">1953</a> et repris un autre travail, le lieutenant Olsson venait juste de quitter l'<a
  href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a> et le Al/c Futch y était maintenant. Il dit qu'il se sentait comme le
  Président de l'Antarctique une année sans expédition. En quelques jours j'avais à nouveau le <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook/index.html">projet Blue Book</a>, comme tâche supplémentaire cette
  fois, et j'avais pour ordres de <q>le monter</q>.</p>
<p>Pendant que j'étais parti, notre plan d'instrumentation avait été rejeté. Des quartiers-généraux supérieurs avaient
  tranché contre l'établissement d'un réseau de stations de repérage manuelles, caméras astronomiques liées à des
  radars, et le reste de ce que l'on avait proposé comme instrumentation. Le général Garland avait défendu le plan becs
  et ongles et avec archarnement, mais il avait perdu. Il fut décidé que des caméras avec des grilles de diffraction sur
  les objectifs, celles qui étaient développées depuis 1 an, suffiraient.</p>
<p>Le programme de caméras avait débuté comme un projet de première priorité, mais il perdit rapidement de son élan
  lorsque nous testâmes ces instruments largement connus et découvrirent qu'ils ne photographieraient pas de manière
  satisfaisante un éclat d'une puissance d'un million de bougies à 450 yards. Les caméras étaient très bien en
  elles-mêmes, mais combinées avec des grilles, elles n'étaient pas bonnes. Cependant, il avait été dit au lieutenant
  Olsson de les envoyer, et donc il les envoya.</p>
<p>Le 1ʳᵉ chose que je fis lorsque je retournais au <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">project Blue
  Book</a> fut d'aller voir les rapports qui étaient arrivés pendant que j'étais absent. Il y avait plusieurs bons
  rapports mais 1 seul était exceptionnel. Il avait eu lieu à la base aérienne de Luke (Arizona), the Air Force's
  advanced fighter bomber school that is named after the famous "balloon buster" of World War I, Lieutenant Frank Luke,
  Jr. It was a sighting that produced some very interesting photographs.</p>
<p>There were only a few high cirrus clouds in the sky late on the morning of March 3 when a pilot took off from Luke in
  an F-84 jet to log some time. He had been flying F-51's in Korea and had recently started to check out in the jets. He
  took off, cleared the traffic pattern, and started climbing toward Blythe Radio, about 130 miles west of Luke. He'd
  climbed for several minutes and had just picked up the coded letters BLH that identified Blythe Radio when he looked
  up through the corner glass in the front part of his canopy - high at about two o'clock he saw what he thought was an
  airplane angling across his course from left to right leaving a long, thin vapor trail. He glanced down at his
  altimeter and saw that he was at 23000 feet. The object that was leaving the vapor trail must really be high, he
  remembered thinking, because he couldn't see any airplane at the head of it. He altered his course a few degrees to
  the right so that he could follow the trail and increased his rate of climb. Before long he could tell that he was
  gaining on the object, or whatever was leaving the vapor trail, because he was under the central part of it. But he
  still couldn't see any object. This was odd, he thought, because vapor trails don't just happen; something has to
  leave them. His altimeter had ticked off another 12000 feet and he was now at 35000. He kept on climbing, but soon the
  '84 began to mush; it was as high as it would go. The pilot dropped down 1000 feet and continued on - now he was below
  the front of the trail, but still no airplane. This bothered him too. Nothing that we have flies over 55000 feet
  except a few experimental airplanes like the D-558 or those of the "X" series, and they don't stray far from Edwards
  AFB in California. He couldn't be more than 15,000 feet from the front of the trail, and you can recognize any kind of
  an airplane 15000 feet away in the clear air of the sub stratosphere. He looked and he looked and he looked. He rocked
  the F-84 back and forth thinking maybe he had a flaw in the Plexiglas of the canopy that was blinking out the
  airplane, but still no airplane. Whatever it was, it was darn high or darn small. It was moving about 300 miles an
  hour because he had to pull off power and "S" to stay under it.</p>
<p>He was beginning to get low on fuel about this time so he hauled up the nose of the jet, took about 30 feet of gun
  camera film, and started down. When he landed and told his story, the film was quickly processed and rushed to the
  projection room. It showed a weird, thin, forked vapor trail - but no airplane.
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Olsson and Airman Futch had worked this one over thoroughly. The photo lab confirmed that the trail was
  definitely a vapor trail, not a freak cloud formation. But Air Force Flight Service said, "<q>No other airplanes in
    the area</q>," and so did Air Defense Command, because minutes after the F-84 pilot broke off contact, the "object"
  had passed into an ADIZ - Air Defense Identification Zone - and radar had shown nothing.
</p>
<p>There was one last possibility: Blue Book's astronomer said that the photos looked exactly like a meteor's smoke
  trail. But there was one hitch:
</p>
<p>the pilot was positive that the head of the vapor trail was moving at about 300 miles an hour. He didn't know exactly
  how much ground he'd covered, but when he first picked up Blythe Radio he was on Green S airway, about 30 miles west
  of his base, and when he'd given up the chase he'd gotten another radio bearing, and he was now almost up to Needles
  Radio, 70 miles north of Blythe. He could see a lake, Lake Mojave, in the distance.
</p>
<p>Could a high altitude jet stream wind have been blowing the smoke cloud? Futch had checked this - no. The winds above
  20,000 feet were the usual westerlies and the jet stream was far to the north.
</p>
<p>Several months later I talked to a captain who had been at Luke when this sighting occurred. He knew the F-84 pilot
  and he'd heard him tell his story in great detail. I won't say that he was a confirmed believer, but he was
  interested. "<q>I never thought much about these reports before</q>," he said, "<q>but I know this guy well. He's not
    nuts. What do you think he saw?" </q></p>
<p>I don't know what he saw. Maybe he didn't travel as far as he thought he did. If he didn't, then I'd guess that he
  saw a meteor's smoke trail. But if he did know that he'd covered some 80 miles during the chase, I'd say that he saw a
  UFO - a real one. And I find it hard to believe that pilots don't know what they're doing.
</p>
<p>During the summer of 1953, UFO reports dropped off considerably. During May, June, and July of 1952 we'd received 637
  good reports. During the same months in 1953 we received only seventy six. We had been waiting for the magic month of
  July to roll around again because every July there had been the sudden and unexplained peak in reporting; we wanted to
  know if it would happen again. It didn't - only twenty one reports came in, to make July the lowest month of the year.
  But July did bring new developments.
</p>
<p>Project Blue Book got a badly needed shot in the arm when an unpublicized but highly important change took place:
  another intelligence agency began to take over all field investigations.
</p>
<p>Ever since I'd returned to the project, the orders had been to build it up - get more people - do what the panel
  recommended. But when I'd asked for more people, all I got was a polite "So sorry." So, I did the next best thing and
  tried to find some organization already in being which could and would help us. I happened to be expounding my
  troubles one day at Air Defense Command Headquarters while I was briefing General Burgess, ADC's Director of
  Intelligence, and he told me about his 4602nd Air Intelligence Squadron, a specialized intelligence unit that had
  recently become operational. Maybe it could help - he'd see what he could work out, he told me.
</p>
<p>Now in the military all commitments to do something carry an almost standard time factor. "<q>I'll expedite it</q>,"
  means nothing will happen for at least two weeks. "<q>I'll do it right away</q>," means from a month to six weeks. An
  answer like, "I'll see what I can work out," requires writing a memo that explains what the person was going to see if
  he could work out, and sealing it in a time capsule for preservation so that when the answer finally does come through
  the future generation that receives it will know how it all started. But I underestimated the efficiency of the Air
  Defense Command. Inside of two weeks General Burgess had called General Garland, they'd discussed the problem, and I
  was back in Colorado Springs setting up a program with Colonel White's 4602nd.
</p>
<p>The 4602nd's primary function is to interrogate captured enemy airmen during wartime; in peacetime all that they can
  do is participate in simulated problems. Investigating UFO reports would supplement these problems and add a factor of
  realism that would be invaluable in their training. The 4602nd had field teams spread out all over the United States,
  and these teams could travel anywhere by airplane, helicopter, canoe, jeep, or skis on a minute's notice. The field
  teams had already established a working contact with the highway patrols, sheriffs' offices, police, and the other
  military in their respective areas, so they were in an excellent position to collect facts about a UFO report. Each
  member of the field teams had been especially chosen and trained in the art of interrogation, and each team had a
  technical specialist. We couldn't have asked for a better ally.
</p>
<p>Project Blue Book was once more back in business. Until the formal paper work went through, our plan was that
  whenever a UFO report worth investigating came in we would call the 4602nd and they would get a team out right away.
  The team would make a thorough investigation and wire us their report. If the answer came back "Unknown," we would
  study the details of the sighting and, with the help of Project Bear, try to find the answer.
</p>
<p>A few weeks after the final plans had been made with the 4602nd, I again bade farewell to Project Blue Book. In a
  simple ceremony on the poop deck of one of the flying saucers that I frequently have been accused of capturing, before
  a formation of the three-foot-tall green men that I have equally as frequently been accused of keeping prisoner, I
  turned my command over to Al/c Max Futch and walked out the door into civilian life with separation orders in hand.
</p>
<p>The UFO's must have known that I was leaving because the day I found out that officers with my specialty, technical
  intelligence, were no longer on the critical list and that I could soon get out of the service, they really put on a
  show. The show they put on is still the best UFO report in the Air Force files.
</p>
<p>J'entendis parler de l'observation pour la 1ʳᵉ fois vers 2 h le matin du 13 août <a
  href="../../../3/index.html">1953</a>,
  lorsque Max Futch m'appela de l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a>. Quelques minutes auparavant un
  télégramme était arrivé avec une priorité juste inférieure à celle réservée à flashing the word que les U.S. avaient
  été attaqués. Max avait été appelé via l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> par le OD pour voir le
  rapport, et il pensait que je devais le voir. J'hésitais un peu à m'habiller et sortir pour me rendre à la base, et
  demandais à Max ce qu'il pensait du signalement. Sa réponse classique restera dans l'histoire des ovnis : <q>Capitaine,</q>
  dit Max de son ton traînant, typique de la Louisiane, <q>vous savez que depuis 1 an j'ai lu tout signalement de
    soucoupe volante qui arrive et que je n'ai jamais vraiment cru à ces choses.</q> Puis il hésita et ajouta, si
  rapidement que je pus difficilement le comprendre, <q>mais vous devriez lire ce télégramme.</q> La vitesse avec
  laquelle il poussa cette dernière phrase fut en elle-même suffisante à me convaincre. Lorsque Max parlait rapidement,
  quelque chose était important.
</p>
<p>Une demi-heure plus tard j'étais à l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> - juste à temps pour
  prendre un appel du <a href="/org/us/region/wa/arlington/pentagon/index.html">Pentagone</a>. Quelqu'un d'autre était
  sorti de
  son lit pour lire sa copie du wire.</p>
<p>Je pris les ordres d'urgence que j'avais toujours gardé dans mon bureau et attrapa le 1er avion de ligne de Dayton
  pour Rapid City (Dakota du Sud). Je n'appelais pas le 4602ᵉ parce que je voulais enquêter sur celui-ci personellement.
  Je parlais à tous ceux impliqués dans l'incident et rassemblait les morceaux d'une histoire stupéfiante.
</p>
<p>Peu après l'obscurité la nuit du 12, la station radar du <a href="/org/us/dod/af/adc/index.html"> Commandement de la
  Défense Aérienne</a> de la base d'Ellsworth, juste à l'Est de Rapid City, avait reçu un appel du centre de filtrage
  local du <a href="/org/us/dod/af/goc/index.html">Corps d'Observateurs au Sol</a>. Une jeune femme en poste
  d'observation à Black Hawk, à environ 10 miles à l'Ouest de Ellsworth, avait signalé une lumière extrêmement brillante
  bas sur l'horizon, off to the Nord-Est. Le radar avait scruté une zone à l'Ouest, travaillant avec un chasseur à
  réaction dans certaines patrouilles d'entraînement, mais lorsqu'ils eurent le signalement ils déplaçèrent le secteur
  scruté au quadrant Nord-Est. Il y avait une cible exactement à l'endroit où la demoiselle avait signalé que la lumière
  était. The warrant officer, qui était le contrôleur en service pour la nuit, me dit qu'il avait étudié la cible
  pendant plusieurs minutes. Il savait comment la météo pouvait affecter le radar mais cette cible était <q>bien
    définie, solide et brillante.</q> Elle semblait se déplacer, mais très lentement. He called for an altitude reading,
  et l'homme sur le radar de recherche d'altitude vérifia son écran. Il avait aussi une cible - elle était à 16000
  pieds.
</p>
<p>L'adjudant-chef décrocha le téléphone et demanda au centre de filtrage de le mettre en contact avec la personne ayant
  repéré l'objet. Ils le firent, et 2 personnes comparèrent leurs notes sur la position de l'ovni pendant plusieurs
  minutes. Mais juste au milieu d'une phrase la jeune femme s'interromp soudain et dit :<q> Il commence à bouger - il se
    déplace vers le Sud-Ouest vers Rapid. </q></p>
<p>Le contrôleur pose le regard sur son écran et voit la cible commencer à prendre de la vitesse et se déplacer vers le
  Sud-Ouest. Il hurle à 2 de ses hommes de courrir dehors et de jeter un œil. En 1 s ou 2 l'un d'entre eux en arrière
  qu'ils peuvent voir une grande lumière blanc-bleu se déplacer rapidement vers Rapid City. Le contrôleur regarde à
  nouveau son écran - la cible se déplaçait vers Rapid City. Alors que les 3 parties regardaient la lumière et kept up a
  steady cross conversation of the description, the UFO swiftly made a wide sweep around Rapid City and returned to its
  original position in the sky.
</p>
<p>A master sergeant. who had seen and heard the happenings told me that in all his years of duty - combat radar
  operations in both Europe and Korea - he'd never been so completely awed by anything. When the warrant officer had
  yelled down at him and asked him what he thought they should do, he'd just stood there. <q>After all</q>, he told me,
  <q>what in hell could we do - they're bigger than all of us.</q></p>
<p>But the warrant officer did do something. He called to the F-84 pilot he had on combat air patrol west of the base
  and told him to get ready for an intercept. He brought the pilot around south of the base and gave him a course
  correction that would take him right into the light, which was still at 16000 pieds. By this time the pilot had it
  spotted. He made the turn, and when he closed to within about 3 miles of the target, it began to move. The controller
  saw it begin to move, the spotter saw it begin to move and the pilot saw it begin to move - all at the same time.
  There was now no doubt that all of them were watching the same object.
</p>
<p>Once it began to move, the UFO picked up speed fast and started to climb, heading north, but the F-84 was right on
  its tall. The pilot would notice that the light was getting brighter, and he'd call the controller to tell him about
  it. But the controller's answer would always be the same, <em><q>Roger</q><q></q></em><q>, nous pouvons le voir sur
    l'écran.</q></p>
<p>There was always a limit as to how near the jet could get, however. The controller told me that it was just as if the
  UFO had some kind of an automatic warning radar linked to its power supply. When something got too close to it, it
  would automatically pick up speed and pull away. The separation distance always remained about 3 miles.
</p>
<p>The chase continued on north - out of sight of the lights of Rapid City and the base - into some very black night.
</p>
<p>When the UFO and the F-84 got about 120 miles to the north, the pilot checked his fuel; he had to come back. And when
  I talked to him, he said he was damn glad that he was running out of fuel because being out over some mighty desolate
  country alone with a UFO can cause some worry.
</p>
<p>Both the UFO and the F-84 had gone off the scope, but in a few minutes the jet was back on, heading for home. Then 10
  or 15 miles behind it was the UFO target also coming back.
</p>
<p>While the UFO and the F-84 were returning to the base - the F-84 was planning to land - the controller received a
  call from the jet interceptor squadron on the base. The alert pilots at the squadron had heard the conversations on
  their radio and didn't believe it. "<q>Who's nuts up there?"</q> was the comment that passed over the wire from the
  pilots to the radar people. There was an F-84 on the line ready to scramble, the man on the phone said, and one of the
  pilots, a World War II and Korean veteran, wanted to go up and see a flying saucer. The controller said, "<q>O.K.,
    go." </q></p>
<p>In a minute or two the F-84 was airborne and the controller was working him toward the light. The pilot saw it right
  away and closed in. Again the light began to climb out, this time more toward the northeast. The pilot also began to
  climb, and before long the light, which at first had been about 30 degrees above his horizontal line of sight, was now
  below him. He nosed the '84 down to pick up speed, but it was the same old story - as soon as he'd get within 3 miles
  of the UFO, it would put on a burst of speed and stay out ahead.
</p>
<p>Even though the pilot could see the light and hear the ground controller telling him that he was above it, and
  alternately gaining on it or dropping back, he still couldn't believe it - there must be a simple explanation. He
  turned off all of his lights - it wasn't a reflection from any of the airplane's lights because there it was. A
  reflection from a ground light, maybe. He rolled the airplane - the position of the light didn't change. A star - he
  picked out three bright stars near the light and watched carefully. The UFO moved in relation to the three stars.
  Well, he thought to himself, if it's a real object out there, my radar should pick it up too; so he flipped on his
  radar ranging gun sight. In a few seconds the red light on his sight blinked on - something real and solid was in
  front of him. Then he was scared. When I talked to him, he readily admitted that he'd been scared. He'd met MD 109's,
  FW 190's and ME 262's over Germany and he'd met MIG-21's over Korea but the large, bright, bluish white light had
  scared him - he asked the controller if he could break off the intercept.
</p>
<p>This time the light didn't come back.
</p>
<p>When the UFO went off the scope it was headed toward Fargo, North Dakota, so the controller called the Fargo filter
  center. "Had they had any reports of unidentified lights?" he asked. They hadn't.
</p>
<p>But in a few minutes a call came back. Spotter posts on a southwest- northeast line a few miles west of Fargo had
  reported a fast moving, bright bluish white light.
</p>
<p>This was an unknown - the best.
</p>
<p>The sighting was thoroughly investigated, and I could devote pages of detail on how we looked into every facet of the
  incident; but it will suffice to say that in every facet we looked into we saw nothing. Nothing but a big question
  mark asking what was it.
</p>
<p>When I left Project Blue Book and the Air Force I severed all official associations with the UFO. But the UFO is like
  hard drink; you always seem to drift back to it. People I've met, people at work, and friends of friends are
  continually asking about the subject. In the past few months the circulation manager of a large Los Angeles newspaper,
  one of Douglas Aircraft Company's top scientists, a man who is guiding the future development of the super secret
  Atlas intercontinental guided missile, a movie star, and a German rocket expert have called me and wanted to get
  together to talk about UFO's. Some of them had seen one.
</p>
<p>I have kept up with the activity of the UFO and Project Blue Book over the past two years through friends who are
  still in intelligence. Before Max Futch got out of the Air Force and went back to law school he wrote to me quite
  often and a part of his letters were always devoted to the latest about the UFO's.
</p>
<p>Then I make frequent business trips to ATIC, and I always stop in to see Captain Charles Hardin, who is now in charge
  of Blue Book, for a "What's new?" I always go to ATIC with the proper security clearances so I'm sure I get a straight
  answer to my question.</p>
<p>Since I left ATIC, the UFO's haven't gone away and neither has the interest. There hasn't been too much about them in
  the newspapers because of the present Air Force policy of silence, but they're with us. That the interest is still
  with us is attested to by the fact that in late 1953 Donald Keyhoe's book about UFO's, Flying Saucers From Outer
  Space, immediately appeared on best seller lists. The book was based on a few of our good UFO reports that were
  released to the press. To say that the book is factual depends entirely upon how one uses the word. The details of the
  specific UFO sightings that he credits to the Air Force are factual, but in his interpretations of the incidents he
  blasts way out into the wild blue yonder.
</p>
<p>During the past two years the bulk of the UFO activity has taken place in Europe. I might add here that I have never
  seen any recent official UFO reports or studies from other countries; all of my information about the European Flap
  came from friends. But when these friends are in the intelligence branches of the U.S. Air Force, the RAF, and the
  Royal Netherlands Air Force, the data can be considered at least good.
</p>
<p>The European Flap started in the summer of 1953, when reports began to pop up in England and France. Quality wise
  these first reports weren't too good, however. But then, like a few reports that occurred early in the stateside Big
  Flap of 1952, sightings began to drift in that packed a bit of a jolt. Reports came in that had been made by personal
  friends of the brass in the British and French Air Forces. Then some of the brass saw them. Corners of mouths started
  down.
</p>
<p>In September several radar sites in the London area picked up unidentified targets streaking across the city at
  altitudes of from 44,000 to 68,000 feet. The crews who saw the targets said, "<q>Not weather</q>," and some of these
  crews had been through the bloody Battle of Britain. They knew their radar.
</p>
<p>In October the crew of a British European Airways airliner reported that a "strange aerial object" had paced their
  twin-engined Elizabethan for thirty minutes. Then on November 3, about two thirty in the afternoon, radar in the
  London area again picked up targets. This time two Vampire jets were scrambled and the pilots saw a "strange aerial
  object" The men at the radar site saw it too; through their telescope it looked like a <q>"flat, white-coloured tennis
    ball." </q></p>
<p>The flap continued into 1954. In January those people who officially keep track of the UFO's pricked up their ears
  when the report of two Swedish airline pilots came in. The pilots had gotten a good look before the UFO had streaked
  into a cloud bank. It looked like a discus with a hump in the middle.
</p>
<p>On through the spring reports poured out of every country in Europe. Some were bad, some were good.
</p>
<p>On July 3, 1954, at eight fifteen in the morning, the captain, the officers and 463 passengers on a Dutch ocean liner
  watched a <q>"greenish colored, saucer shaped object about half the size of a full moon</q>" as it sped across the sky
  and disappeared into a patch of high clouds.
</p>
<p>There was one fully documented and substantiated case of a "landing" during the flap. On August 25 two young ladies
  in Mosjoen, Norway, made every major newspaper in the world when they encountered a "saucer- man." They said that they
  were picking berries when suddenly a dark man, with long shaggy hair, stepped out from behind some bushes. He was
  friendly; he stepped right up to them and started to talk rapidly. The two young ladies could understand English but
  they couldn't understand him. At first they were frightened, but his smile soon "disarmed" them. He drew a few
  pictures of flying saucers and pointed up in the sky. "He was obviously trying to make a point," one of the young
  ladies said.
</p>
<p>A few days later it was discovered that the man from "outer space" was a lost USAF helicopter pilot who was flying
  with NATO forces in Norway.
</p>
<p>As I've always said, "Ya gotta watch those Air Force pilots - especially those shaggy haired ones from Brooklyn."
</p>
<p>The reporting spread to Italy, where thousands of people in Rome saw a strange cigar shaped object hang over the city
  for forty minutes. Newspapers claimed that Italian Air Force radar had the UFO on their scopes, but as far as I could
  determine, this was never officially acknowledged.
</p>
<p>In December a photograph of two UFO's over Taormina, Sicily, appeared in many newspapers. The picture showed three
  men standing on a bridge, with a fourth running up with a camera. All were intently watching two disk shaped objects.
  The photo looked good, but there was one flaw, the men weren't looking at the UFO's; they were looking off to the
  right of them. I'm inclined to agree with Captain Hardin of Blue Book - the photographer just fouled up on his double
  exposure.
</p>
<p>Sightings spread across southern Europe, and at the end of October, the Yugoslav Government expressed official
  interest. Belgrade newspapers said that a "<q>thoughtful inquiry</q>" would be set up, since reports had come from
  "control tower operators, weather stations and hundreds of farmers." But the part of the statement that swung the most
  weight was, "<q>Scientists in astronomical observatories have seen these strange objects with their own eyes." </q>
</p>
<p>During 1954 and the early part of 1955 my friends in Europe tried to keep me up-to-date on all of the better reports,
  but this soon approached a full time job. Airline pilots saw them, radar picked them up, and military pilots chased
  them. The press took sides, and the controversy that had plagued the U.S. since 1947 bloomed forth in all its
  confusion. </p>
<p>Un ex-Air Chief Marshal de la <a href="/org/uk/mod/RAF.html">RAF</a>, <a href="/people/d/DowdingHugh/index.html">Lord
  Dowding</a>, went to bat for the UFO's. The Netherlands Air Chief of Staff said they can't be. <span class="people">Herman Oberth</span>,
  the father of the German rocket development, said that the UFO's were definitely interplanetary vehicles.
</p>
<p>In Belgium a senator put the screws on the Secretary of Defense - he wanted an answer. The Secretary of Defense
  questioned the idea that the saucers were "real" and said that the military wasn't officially interested. In France a
  member of parliament received a different answer - the French military was interested. The French General Staff had
  set up a committee to study UFO reports.
</p>
<p>In Italy, Clare Boothe Luce, American Ambassador to Italy, said that she had seen a UFO and had no idea what it could
  be.
</p>
<p>Halfway around the world, in Australia, the UFO's were busy too. At Canberra Airport the pilot of an RAAF Hawker Sea
  Fury and a ground radar station teamed up to get enough data to make an excellent radar visual report.
</p>
<p>In early 1955 the flap began to die down about as rapidly as it had flared up, but it had left its mark - many more
  believers. Even the highly respected British aviation magazine, Aeroplane, had something to say. One of the editors
  took a long, hard look at the over-all UFO picture and concluded, "<q>Really, old chaps- I don't know." </q></p>
<p>Probably the most unique part of the whole European Flap was the fact that the Iron Curtain countries were having
  their own private flap. The first indications came in October 1954, when Rumanian newspapers blamed the United States
  for launching a drive to induce a "<q>flying saucer psychosis</q>" in their country. The next month the Hungarian
  Government hauled an "expert" up in front of the microphone so that he could explain to the populace that UFO's don't
  really exist because, "<q>all 'flying saucer' reports originate in the bourgeois countries, where they are invented by
    the capitalist warmongers with a view to drawing the people's attention away from their economic difficulties." </q>
</p>
<p>Next the U.S.S.R. itself took up the cry along the same lines when the voice of the Soviet Army, the newspaper Red
  Star, denounced the UFO's as, you guessed it, capitalist propaganda.
</p>
<p>In 1955 the UFO's were still there because the day before the all important May Day celebration, a day when the
  Soviet radio and TV are normally crammed with programs plugging the glory of Mother Russia to get the peasants in the
  mood for the next day, a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences had to get on the air to calm the people's fears. He
  left out Wall Street and Dulles this time - UFO's just don't exist.
</p>
<p>It was interesting to note that during the whole Iron Curtain Flap, not one sighting or complimentary comment about
  the UFO's was made over the radio or in the newspapers; yet the flap continued. The reports were obviously being
  passed on by word of mouth. This fact seems to negate the theory that if the newspaper reporters and newscasters would
  give up the UFO's would go away. The people in Russia were obviously seeing something.
</p>
<p>While the European Flap was in progress, the UFO's weren't entirely neglecting the United States. The number of
  reports that were coming into Project Blue Book were below average, but there were reports. Many of them would
  definitely be classed as good, but the best was a report from a photo reconnaissance B-29 crew that encountered a UFO
  almost over Dayton.
</p>
<p>About 11:00 A.M. on May 24, 1954, an RB-29 equipped with some new aerial cameras took off from Wright Field, one of
  the two airfields that make up Wright-Patterson AFB, and headed toward the Air Force's photographic test range in
  Indiana. At exactly twelve noon they were at 16,000 feet, flying west, about 15 miles northwest of Dayton. A major, a
  photo officer, was in the nose seat of the '29. All of the gun sights and the bombsight in the nose had been taken
  out, so it was like sitting in a large picture window - except you just can't get this kind of a view anyplace else.
  The major was enjoying it. He was leaning forward, looking down, when he saw an extremely bright circular shaped
  object under and a little behind the airplane. It was so bright that it seemed to have a mirror finish. He couldn't
  tell how far below him it was but he was sure that it wasn't any higher than 6,000 feet above the ground, and it was
  traveling fast, faster than the B-29. It took only about six seconds to cross a section of land, which meant that it
  was going about 600 miles an hour.
</p>
<p>The major called the crew and told them about the UFO, but neither the pilot nor the copilot could see it because it
  was now directly under the B-29. The pilot was just in the process of telling him that he was crazy when one of the
  scanners in an aft blister called in; he and the other scanner could also see the UFO.
</p>
<p>Being a photo ship, the RB-29 had loaded cameras - so the logical thing to do would be to take a picture, but during
  a UFO sighting logic sometimes gets shoved into the background. In this case, however, it didn't, and the major
  reached down, punched the button on the intervalometer, and the big vertical camera in the aft section of the airplane
  clicked off a photo before the UFO sped away.
</p>
<p>The photo showed a circular shaped blob of light exactly as the major had described it to the RB-29 crew. It didn't
  show any details of the UFO because the UFO was too bright; it was completely overexposed on the negative. The
  circular shape wasn't sharp either; it had fuzzy edges, but this could have been due to two things: its extreme
  brightness, or the fact that it was high, close to the RB-29, and out of focus. There was no way of telling exactly
  how high it was but if it were at 6,000 feet, as the major estimated, it would have been about 125 feet in diameter.
</p>
<p>Working with people from the photo lab at Wright-Patterson, Captain Hardin from Project Blue Book carried out one of
  the most complete investigations in UFO history. They checked aircraft flights, rephotographed the area from high and
  low altitude to see if they could pick up something on the ground that could have been reflecting light, and made a
  minute ground search of the area. They found absolutely nothing that could explain the round blob of light, and the
  incident went down as an unknown.
</p>
<p>Like all good "Unknown" UFO reports, there are as many opinions as to what the bright blob of light could have been
  as there are people who've seen the photo. "<q>Some kind of light phenomenon</q>" is the frequent opinion of those who
  don't believe. They point out that there is no shadow of any kind of a circular object showing on the ground - no
  shadow, nothing "solid." But if you care to take the time you can show that if the object, assuming that this is what
  it was, was above 4,000 feet the shadow would fall out of the picture.
</p>
<p>Then all you get is a blank look from the light phenomenon theorists.
</p>
<p>With the sighting from the RB-29 and the photograph, all of the other UFO reports that Blue Book has collected and
  all of those that came out of the European Flap, the big question - the key question - is: What have the last two
  years of UFO activity brought out? Have there been any important developments?
</p>
<p>Some good reports have come in and the Air Force is sitting on them. During 1954 they received some 450 reports, and
  once again July was the peak month. In the first half of 1955 they had 189. But I can assure you that these reports
  add nothing more as far as proof is concerned. The quality of the reports has improved, but they still offer nothing
  more than the same circumstantial evidence that we presented to the panel of scientists in early 1953. There have been
  no reports in which the speed or altitude of a UFO has been measured, there have been no reliable photographs that
  show any details of a UFO, and there is no hardware. There is still no real proof.
</p>
<p>So a public statement that was made in 1952 still holds true: "<q>The possibility of the existence of interplanetary
  craft has never been denied by the Air Force, but UFO reports offer absolutely no authentic evidence that such
  interplanetary spacecraft do exist." </q></p>
<p>But with the UFO, what is lacking in proof is always made up for in opinions. To get a qualified opinion, I wrote to
  a friend, Frederick C. Durant. Mr. Durant, who is presently the director of a large Army Ordnance test station, is
  also a past president of the American Rocket Society and president of the International Astronautical Federation. For
  those who are not familiar with these organizations, the American Rocket Society is an organization established to
  promote interest and research in space flight and lists as its members practically every prominent scientist and
  engineer in the professional fields allied to aeronautics. The International Astronautical Federation is a world-wide
  federation of such societies.
</p>
<p>Mr. Durant has spent many hours studying UFO reports in the Project Blue Book files and many more hours discussing
  them with scientists the world over - scientists who are doing research and formulating the plans for space flight. I
  asked him what he'd heard about the UFO's during the past several years and what he thought about them. This was his
  reply:
</p>
<p><q>This past summer at the Annual Congress of the IAF at Innsbruck, as well as previous Congresses (Zurich, 1953,
  Stuttgart, 1952, and London, 1951), none of the delegates representing the rocket and space flight societies of all
  the countries involved had strong feelings on the subject of saucers. Their attitude was essentially the same as
  professional members of the American Rocket Society in this country. In other words, there appear to be no confirmed
  saucer fans in the hierarchy of the professional societies. </q></p>
<p>I continue to follow the subject of UFO's primarily because of my being requested for comment on the interplanetary
  flight aspects. My personal feelings have not changed in the past four years, although I continue to keep an objective
  outlook.
</p>
<p>There are many other prominent scientists in the world whom I met while I was chief of Project Blue Book who, I'm
  sure, would give the same answer - they've not been able to find any proof, but they continue to keep an objective
  outlook. There are just enough big question marks sprinkled through the reports to keep their outlook objective.
</p>
<p>I know that there are many other scientists in the world who, although they haven't studied the Air Force's UFO
  files, would limit their comment to a large laugh followed by an "<q>It can't be</q>." But "<q>It can't be's</q>" are
  dangerous, if for no other reason than history has proved them so. Not more than a hundred years ago two members of
  the French Academy of Sciences were unseated because they supported the idea that "<q>stones had fallen from the
    sky</q>." Other distinguished members of the French Academy examined the stones, "<q>It can't be - stones don't fall
    from the sky</q>," or words to that effect. "<q>These are common rocks that have been struck by lightning."</q></p>
<p>Today we know that the "<q>stones from the sky</q>" were meteorites.
</p>
<p>Not more than fifty years ago Dr. Simon Newcomb, a world famous astronomer and the first American since Benjamin
  Franklin to be made an associate of the Institute of France, the hierarchy of the world science, said, "<q>It can't
    be</q>." Then he went on to explain that flight without gas bags would require the discovery of some new material or
  a new force in nature.
</p>
<p>And at the same time Rear Admiral George W. Melville, then Chief Engineer for the U.S. Navy, said that attempts to
  fly heavier-than-air vehicles was absurd.
</p>
<p>Just a little over ten years ago there was another "<q>it can't be</q>." Ex President Harry S. Truman recalls in the
  first volume of the Truman Memoirs what Admiral William D. Leahy, then Chief of Staff to the President, had to say
  about the atomic bomb. "<q>That is the biggest fool thing we have ever done</q>," he is quoted as saying. "<q>the bomb
    will never go off, and I speak as an expert in explosives." </q></p>
<p>Personally, I don't believe that "it can't be." I wouldn't class myself as a "believer," exactly, because I've seen
  too many UFO reports that first appeared to be unexplainable fall to pieces when they were thoroughly investigated.
  But every time I begin to get skeptical I think of the other reports, the many reports made by experienced pilots and
  radar operators, scientists, and other people who know what they're looking at. These reports were thoroughly
  investigated and they are still unknowns. Of these reports, the radar visual sightings are the most convincing. When a
  ground radar picks up a UFO target and a ground observer sees a light where the radar target is located, then a jet
  interceptor is scrambled to intercept the UFO and the pilot also sees the light and gets a radar lock on only to have
  the UFO almost impudently outdistance him, there is no simple answer. We have no aircraft on this earth that can at
  will so handily outdistance our latest jets.
</p>
<p>The Air Force is still actively engaged in investigating UFO reports, although during the past six months there have
  been definite indications that there is a movement afoot to get Project Blue Book to swing back to the old Project
  Grudge philosophy of analyzing UFO reports - write them all off, regardless. But good UFO reports cannot be written
  off with such answers as fatigued pilots seeing a balloon or star, "green" radar operators with only fifteen years'
  experience watching temperature inversion caused blips on their radarscopes; or <q>"a mild form of mass hysteria or
    war nerves</q>." Using answers like these, or similar ones, to explain the UFO reports is an expedient method of
  getting the percentage of unknowns down to zero, but it is no more valid than turning the hands of a clock ahead to
  make time pass faster. Twice before the riddle of the UFO has been "solved," only to have the reports increase in both
  quantity and quality.</p>
<p>I wouldn't want to hazard a guess as to what the final outcome of the UFO investigation will be, but I am sure that
  within a few years there will be a proven answer. The earth satellite program, which was recently announced, research
  progress in the fields of electronics, nuclear physics, astronomy, and a dozen other branches of the sciences will
  furnish data that will be useful to the UFO investigators. Methods of investigating and analyzing UFO reports have
  improved a hundred fold since 1947 and they are continuing to be improved by the diligent work of Captain Charles
  Hardin, the present chief of Project Blue Book, his staff, and the 4602nd Air Intelligence Squadron. Slowly but surely
  these people are working closer to the answer - closer to the proof.
</p>
<p>Maybe the final proven answer will be that all of the UFO's that have been reported are merely misidentified known
  objects. Or maybe the many pilots, radar specialists, generals, industrialists, scientists, and the man on the street
  who have told me, "I wouldn't have believed it either if I hadn't seen it myself," knew what they were talking about.
  Maybe the earth is being visited by interplanetary spaceships.
</p>
<p>Seul le temps le dira.</p>
