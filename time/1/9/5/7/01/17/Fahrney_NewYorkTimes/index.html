<p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 (AP) ? A retired rear admiral, once head of the Navy's guided-missile program, said today
  reliable reports indicated that <q>there are objects coming into our atmosphere at very high speeds.</q></p>
<p>Admiral <span class="people">Delmer S. Fahrney</span> told a news conference that <q>no agency in this country or
  Russia is able to duplicate at this time the speeds and accelerations which radars and observers indicate these flying
  objects are to achieve</q>.</p>
<p>There are signs that <q>an intelligence directs such objects because the way they fly</q>, the admiral went on. </p>
<p><q>They are not entirely actuacted by automatic equipment</q>, he said. <q>The way they change position in formations
  and override each other would indicate that their motion is directed</q>. </p>
<p>An Air Force spokesman said that service was still investigating all reports but had found no concrete evidence that
  there were flying saucers. He said that a majority of the reports had been found upon checking to have some logical
  explanation, but that a percentage remained unexplained.</p>
<p>Admiral <span class="people">Fahrney</span> called a news conference following an organizational meeting of a new
  private groupe, the <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">National Aerial Committee on Aerial Phenomena</a>, of
  which he is board chairman. </p>
