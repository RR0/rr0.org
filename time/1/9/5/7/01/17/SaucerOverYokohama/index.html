<p>The first photograph of a UFO in Japan was taken by <span class="people">Yusuke J. Matsumura</span> on January 17,
  outside his house in <span class="place" title="1687 Hama Isogo Ku, Yokohama">Yokohama</span>. He used a Primoflex,
  Automat (Japanese Rollei-Automat) camera.</p>
<p>At 10:47 a. m., Mr. Matsumura stepped out of the door of his house, with the intention of going to Tokyo. Then he saw
  a flash in the heavens. There appeared a metallic silvery object low down in the sky and very near to his house, as
  can be seen from the photograph on this page. He estimated the saucer to be approximately 20-30 ft in diameter. It
  hovered in the same position for about 2 minutes at an altitude of about 70 ft. Then it shot off at a very high speed
  (about March 1.5-2), at an angle of 70 degrees with the horizon, facing south-east.</p>
