<p>IMPORTANT ADDITIONS TO <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap">NICAP</a> BOARD and SPECIAL ADVISORS PANEL to be announced soon;
  also a prominent citizen to succeed Admiral <a href="/people/f/FahrneyDelmerS">D. S. Fahrney</a>, forced by his wife's
  illness and his heavy business pressures to withdraw as chairman. Admiral <a
      href="/people/f/FahrneyDelmerS">Fahrney</a> states : "I will continue an interested member of the organization."
</p>
<p>RUMOR <a href="/org/us/dod/navy">NAVY</a> FORCED <a href="/people/f/FahrneyDelmerS">FAHRNEY</a> TO QUITE, reported by
  some <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap">NICAP</a> members, refuted by a telegram to Major <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE">D.
    E. Keyhoe</a>, Director: "I sincerely believe that serious, factual investigations by <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap">NICAP</a>
  should continue and I have faith in your leadership to carry out this program. Also, I am under no compulsion to
  resign, this being due solely to personal reasons. Best wishes for the success of <a
      href="/org/us/asso/nicap">NICAP</a>. (Signed) Admiral <a
      href="/people/f/FahrneyDelmerS">Delmer S. Fahrney</a>, USN, Ret."</p>
<p>HEAD OF <a href="/org/us/nasa/NACA.html">NACA</a> BACKS DOWN ON <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/FlyingSaucers.html">FLYING
  SAUCER</a> CLAIM. On March 14 Dr. <a href="/people/d/DrydenHughL">Hugh Dryden</a>, Director <a
    href="/org/us/nasa/NACA.html">National Advisory Committee fo Aeronautics</a>, was publicly quoted: "Flying saucers
  do not exist." In answer Director <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE">Keyhoe</a> wrote Dr. <a
      href="/people/d/DrydenHughL">Dryden</a>: "If you can provide absolute proof that UFO's are non-existent, I shall
  request the Board to dissolve this Committee at once."</p>
<p>In reply Dr. <a href="/people/d/DrydenHughL">Dryden</a> said he had denied reports that the Nazis had a flying saucer
  in <time>1945</time>. (Keyhoe had already denied this story.) Next day, interviewed by WIP Philadelphia, Dr. <a
      href="/people/d/DrydenHughL">Dryden</a> was asked if important information on other flying saucer possibilities
  was withheld by the Government. Dr. <a
      href="/people/d/DrydenHughL">Dryden</a>: "No comment." In a second <a
      href="/org/us/asso/nicap">NICAP</a> letter he was asked if he still denied existence of <u>all</u> flying saucers,
  or merely the German rumor. Replying by telegram, Dr. <a
      href="/people/d/DrydenHughL">Dryden</a> flatly refused to answer.</p>
<p>NEW, IMPORTANT INFORMATION—now being included in first issue of NICAP magazine—is reason for advance of
  mailing date. This issue will contain: Dramatic inside stories on recent UFO sightings, with details kept from the
  press. New documentary proof of censorship. A revolutionary plan to reveal the mass of UFO sighting reports and other
  official information now withheld from the public. Special reports on important unpublished sightings, revealed to <a
      href="/org/us/asso/nicap">NICAP</a> by commercial, private and armed forces <a
      href="/people/pilotes.html">pilots</a>, airport tower operators and other reputable observers—including
  cases where witnesses were ordered or requested not to talk.</p>
<p>In addition to important news items, the No. 1 issue will fully report on NICAP operations, affiliation with existing
  UFO groups, setting up new NICAP clubs and local evaluation units. Questions asked by NICAP members will be answered,
  either in specific articles or in a special department answering questions of wide interest to members and prospective
  members. Although we are still short of editorial help, we expect to mail the magazine the first week in May and
  thereafter on a precise monthly schedule. (All memberships now in effect will be extended to cover a one-year period
  and twelve issues of the magazine.)</p>
<p>MANY MEMBERS ARE SENDING NICAP NAMES OF PROSPECTS. Make yourself a Membership Committee of One and extend to your
  friends the invitation to join <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap">NICAP</a>. <u>Send us list of names !</u></p>
<p>Meantime, I with to thank you for your patience and the help you are giving us by sending items for this first issue.
  I believe you will find it well worth the enforced delay. Sincerely,</p>
<p>DEK:RHC DIRECTOR OF NICAP </p>
