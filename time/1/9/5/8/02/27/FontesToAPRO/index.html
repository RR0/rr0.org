  précise de la situation au Brésil à cette époque. Les faits relatés par ses 2 visiteurs militaires ne sont pas
  forcément exacts dans la mesure où ils ne sont pas de première main, mais proviennent des services secrets américains.
  Ces derniers ne semblent pas avoir toujours fait preuve d'une franchise parfaite, même avec leurs alliés. Cependant,
  un certain nombre de faits mentionnés dans ce document, amplement vérifiés depuis, ne pouvaient pas être connus du
  docteur Fontès, qui par ailleurs, semble avoir été un parfait honnête homme. </p>
<p LANG="en-GB">Dear Coral :</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">I am going to tell you in this letter the facts related with the startling information reported at the
  end of my last letter concerning the secret truth about flying saucers. But first I want you to understand that, in
  spite of the knowledge you are going to have about the UAO-problem, I believe our task and purposes must be the same
  we had before. We are part of free peoples. Knowledge of secret information concealed by Governments and Armed Forces
  of our countries is not enough, in my opinion, to satisfy ourselves when this information is hidden from the people
  &ndash; the one who have the right to know about it. We have no justification to freeze our lips, like Russians
  peasants at the sight of a commissar, accepting reasons derived from the empty and meaningless judgement of anonymous
  intelligence officers. They, these faceless creatures who have usurped our rights, cannot be permitted to have a free
  hand on matters so important for our future &ndash; for all of us.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">Secrecy is something which does not breed security but fear. I have not the slightest interest in what
  the military might say about this. They do not report anything to us, the people, but to theirs commanders &ndash; who
  report to nobody (the President of Brazil, for example, knows very little about the whole matter ; the same can be
  said regarding civilian authorities and scientists, at least in my country). Is this the right thing? Can the military
  take decisions that may affect the future of the whole humankind? Can they be trusted to be given the whole
  responsibility on UAO-matters? Obviously not. At least in free countries on this side of the Iron Curtain. So, we have
  to continue our fight against the censors at any cost. Our Mg will be a powerful weapon against their vicious tactics
  to conceal the truth. You do not realize, Coral, how much of my hopes are concentrated on your book. I am going to get
  the credit for the Mg story, thanks to your wonderful integrity (I cannot tell you how very grateful I am). But even
  that it was not so (if I had not loyal and sincere friends like you, like Jim, like our chemist at Holloman and APRO
  members who already know), I think that my material still would be given to help. As you and Horacio Gonzales have
  done, giving your information to Keyhoe who used it in an unethical way. It is funny but I never thought that you
  might be like him. I trusted you and your group from the very first and decided to send my samples for APRO since the
  beginning. The possibility of sending them to Keyhoe and NICAP was never considered. I am not disappointed. You were
  the right people and we are going to get the credit together, Coral. Please, do it so. There is a part for you, too,
  and I feel you should get it.</p>
<p><SPAN LANG="en-GB">Your   decision  to  send  the  Mg  samples  to  that  theoretical   physicist  was  a  wise  one. If  they  publicly  state  that  they   found  the  stuff  to  be  extra-terrestrial, we  are  with  our   case  closed. There  is, however, a  danger &ndash; he  will  attempt  to   interest </SPAN><SPAN
    LANG="en-GB"><U>a</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>sufficient</U></SPAN><SPAN
    LANG="en-GB"> </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>number</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>of</U></SPAN><SPAN
    LANG="en-GB"> </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>scientists</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> in  it. If  one  of  these  scientists  already  knows  the  truth,  we  are  lost?</SPAN>
</p>
<p><SPAN LANG="en-GB">He   will  report  the  matter  to  the  authorities  immediately  and   our  friend  will  be  put  under  security  restrictions  at  once.  Of  course, if  no  report  about  the  tests  is  released  we  will   understand  what  happened. But  I  fear  something  worse : a   false  statement  forced  by  the  censors &ndash; to  distort  the   truth  and  to  send  us  in  the  wrong  way. Because  of  this   possibility, we  have  to  take  measures  to  avoid  it. So, if   they  say  that  the  Mg  is  not  extra-terrestrial, or  that  they   didn't  find  enough  evidence  to  be  sure  it  is, we  cannot   take  such  kind  of  report  without  a  check. The  only  thing  we   have  to  do  is  to  repeat  the  analysis  at  some  other  place.  A  mass  spectrography  could  be  done, for  example, through  Lex   Mebane. He  is  a  chemist, you  know, and  does  not  work  for  the   Government. I  might  send  the  sample. Another  thing  you  can   do  is  to  alert  our  physicist  to  be  careful  in  choosing  the   other  scientists ; and  to  give  us  a  warning (using  a </SPAN><SPAN
    LANG="en-GB"><U>code</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>word</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> previously  selected) that  something  is  wrong. Can  you  do  this  ? Please, do  not  think  I  am  seeing  ghosts  in  the  air. I   didn't  understand  very  much  in  the  past  the  careful   measures  you  had  taken  to  avoid  censors'  interference  with   some  of  your  letters (for  me). I  know  now  that  you  were   right &ndash; anything  can  happen.</SPAN>
</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">Thank you for the kind words you used in your letter about myself. It seems that you are thinking I am
  better than many people. Thanks again, but you are wrong : I have my limitations, too. I know it?</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">Dr. Maffei was finally found by Auriphebo Simoes just two days ago. The Campinas incident shall be
  clarified now, I believe. At least I hope so. I will keep you informed about the subject.</p>
<p><SPAN LANG="en-GB">So   was  Mr.  Cleto  Nunes  at  first  sight. He  seemed  to  have  no   hurry  to  discuss  the  matters  that  had  brought  him  to  my   presence. Chatting  casually  about  seemingly  trivial, unrelated   UAO-topics, we  gradually  relaxed (Martins  and  I) and  because   more  expansive. Then  Nunes  became  more  friendly  and  began  to   explain  why  he  was  interested  on  flying  saucers. He  said  the   following : "I  am  interested  since  1949  when  I  saw  a   flying  saucer  coming  out  from  the  deeps  of  the  sea (?),  climb  up  through  the  air  at  high  speed  and  disappear  in  a   few  seconds  on  the  horizon. I  saw  enough  of  it  to  know  it   was  an  alien  craft  of  some  new  type. As  I  have  a  brother   in  the  Air  Force, I  wrote  a  full  account  of  my  experience   and  gave  it  to  him. He  delivered  it  to  the  authorities  who   called  me  for  a  personal  report. It  seems  that  my  sighting   was  one  of  the  first  in  Brazil  and  obviously  attracted  much   curiosity. I  had  become  curious  too, and &ndash; since  that   occasion &ndash; I  am  trying  to  follow  the  AF  investigations  on   the  field. N  1952, I  knew  about  Adamski's  first  book  and   go  it. It  impressed  me  deeply  and  enlarged  my  interest  on   UFOs, chiefly  about  "contact-cases&rdquo; &ndash; which  I  began  to   investigate  particularly. I  have  already  many  such  cases  in   my  files  and  I  am  convinced  that, although  different  in  some   aspects, all  of  them  share  the  same  general  characteristics.  These  similarities  are  enough, in  my  opinion, to  prove  they   are  true. But  now  you  came, my  dear  fellows, with  your   hostility  theory. I  was  disturbed  because  I  knew  you  were   wrong. So, I  decided  to  meet  you  and  I  am  going  to </SPAN><SPAN
    LANG="en-GB"><U>prove</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> that  UFOs  are  friendly. You  may  try  to  prove  it  otherwise &ndash;  if  you  can.&rdquo;</SPAN>
</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">This opening was totally unexpected for us. We had imagined something very different. So, the
  "mysterious&rdquo; Mr. Nunes was one more "believer&rdquo;, a kind of flying saucer cultist. I remembered that I had,
  at that moment, an impulse to finish the talk and him to go away. Martins seemed also to be worried. But the man had
  been so courteous and pleasant that we had no choice. At least he was not a mystic and we could try a scientifical
  approach to the problem. And so it was done. We talked freely for twenty minutes.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">Then Nunes made his mistake. It was a question he asked: "What proof you have of UFO hostility against
  Brazilian airplanes ? Do you know about some case of aircraft crash, here, caused by a flying saucer ? Have you any
  direct evidence, or have you only theories ?&rdquo;</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">It was a direct question. I looked at his face and noted with surprise that a fine spotting of moisture
  brightened his upper lip. Only then did I recognize the strain and effort he had invested into the attempt to convince
  us. There was also a slight tremor in his fingers that only as a doctor I was able to see. Under that relaxed
  appearance he was very tense and excited. Why ? There could be only an answer : he was a mind-prober, playing a
  skilled game to make us confident and then take advantage to win our defenses.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">He win the first play.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">Gradually I let my body relax, wondering about the next move. He had already heard all our arguments
  regarding the pattern outlined through the UAO's reconnaissance of our planet. He also knew about one case of
  hostility (in our opinion) : the crash of the Pan-America "President&rdquo; in the middle of amazonic forest, in 1952,
  destroyed by an explosion of unknown origin. We had told him about the conclusions of the technicians that searched
  the wreckage of the airliner (which had not been published). But only that?</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">As a physician I had to learn the ways to get through people's psychological defenses, to explore the
  deep-down motives of psycho-somatic illness and find the hidden psychic conflicts that cause so many functional
  symptoms. All doctors, to make a complete study of their patients, have to know how to examine their bodies and how to
  probe their minds, too. Mind and body are not two differents entities, but two poles of the same unit &ndash; the
  pacient. I was sure that such a training would be great help in a situation like that. I also knew that in a game of
  that kind with so many things to be considered, each with a different value &ndash; in fact one set of values for
  offense, and another for defense &ndash; only a brilliant player could keep them all in mind (if he knew about his
  opponent alertness, of course). Not knowing about my plans to play the same game against him, Nunes would be unable to
  cope with a concealed offensive strategy. It would be easy to defeat him, I concluded.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">I was right.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">He began to give, unknowingly, the answers we needed to confirm many things we had already guessed. He
  did not suspected that, disguised as statements, very important questions were presented together with casual or
  unimportant ones, every time there was an opportunity to do so. The following will give a better picture of the game
  :</p>
<p LANG="en-GB"> "Q. What the Air Force doesn't know : on the same night of the "President&rdquo; disaster a solitary
  UFO was sighted in the same region, at least from one town very close to the route it traveling (the airliner). See
  this telegram from Dores do Indaia, Minas Gerais. What do you think about this ? (I showed him the telegram)</p>
<p>"<SPAN LANG="en-GB">A. </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>We</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> already  know  about  it. The  Air  Force  received  many  reports   from  different  places  about  this  UFO, described  as  "a   bright-red  fireball  with  erratic  maneuvers&rdquo;. But  such  a   thing  doesn't  prove  your  point. No  one  witnessed  any   hostile  maneuver  against  the  plane ; at  least  there  was  no   reports  about  it.</SPAN>
</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">(I agreed with him. The ones that might have witnessed the scene were dead and couldn't report anything.
  They were the passengers and crew of the airliner, killed in the crash)</p>
<p LANG="en-GB"> "Q. You said that US Armed Forces are not interested on flying saucers and even don't believe in their
  existence. On the other side, American officers from the American</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">Military Mission had been seen (together with Brazilian officers) in the investigation of several
  November's military sightings. Perhaps you don't know about it, but I can show you at least three such cases. How do
  you explain that ?</p>
<p LANG="en-GB"> "A. Yes, I know about the fact. They are really very interested on our sightings. I can't explain it.
  Maybe they are doing a personal investigation : maybe they like it as a "hobby&rdquo; &ndash; a good thing to do when
  you are in a foreign country. What counts, in fact, is the official attitude of US Air Force. This is my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">We talked for three hours. Mr. Cleto Nunes answered many questions like the ones above. I had to give
  him some information too, of course, to keep him relaxed and interested &ndash; but nothing really important. From
  what he said, it became apparent that he had followed the AF investigation of the more important military sightings in
  the 1954 "flap&rdquo; ; that he knew personally many of the witnesses : that he had many "friends&rdquo;, many
  "fellows&rdquo;, who had investigated "this case&rdquo;, "that incident&rdquo;, etc, etc. : that he had been present
  at meetings with AF's high-staff officers to discuss UAO-problems.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">To show him that I wasn't suspecting anything, I reacted to that last statement with the question that
  was to be expected from a person off the track : "How could they have permitted your presence at meetings about
  "classified matters&rdquo; ? You are a civilian, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">He explained that such a privilege had been granted, in his opinion, because his brother was a
  Lieut.-Colonel in the AF and because he had reported one of the first Brazilian case. I "believed it&rdquo;, of
  course.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">He showed interest in our opinion about the possibility of UAO bases in the bottom of the seas (?). One
  of his "friends&rdquo; had soon, from a high place (probably from a plane), a flying saucer emerging from the waters
  of the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon (this lagoon is placed in the center of Rio's south districts). He wanted to know if
  we had any similar incident in our files (we had not). He also showed us his collection of newspaper clippings about
  UAOs, which seemed to be very complete. And there was an amazing photo of a luminous egg-shaped object, taken by
  another of his friends. This UFO looked like an orange star at naked-eye and was seen in the negative as a small point
  of light ; but enlarged 40 times it appeared as seen in the photo. I asked for a copy of it and offered in exchange
  the photos taken by Dr. Grecco (which I an enclosing for you too). He was interested and agreed with my
  proposition.</p>
<p><SPAN LANG="en-GB">At   the  end, he  said  a  strange  thing : "I  would  like  to  take   a  look  at  the  fragments  you  have  of  the </SPAN><SPAN
    LANG="en-GB"><U>small</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> flying  disk  which  exploded  near  Ubatuba&rdquo;. This  time  I   couldn't  control  my  surprise. Why  the  word  "small&rdquo; ? I   asked  for  an  explanation  and he  told  me  that  he  had  known   it  from  the  letter  received  by  Mr. Ibrahim  Sued. He  was  not   telling  the  truth, the  letter  said  nothing  about  the  disk's   size. I  also  observed  another  strange  thing : he  wanted  to   see  only  the  samples, the  report  of  the  analysis  did  not   attract  his  interest  any  time. Why ? Because  he  already  knew   what  was  in  the  samples, in  my  opinion. I  believe  he  was   only  checking  if  my  samples  were  similar  to  the  ones  he   had  seen  elsewhere.</SPAN>
</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">Anyway, two days after our interview Mr. Nunes travelled to S&atilde;o Paulo city. He said to Martins he
  was going to meet his "brother&rdquo; at the AF Base of Cumbica. In my opinion, he was going to report that my samples
  of the Ubatuba's disk were genuine. Incidentally, Cumbica is one of the two AF Bases close to the Ubatuba area.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">I liked the pleasant Mr. Nunes. We can't be friends because we are fighting in opposing fields. It is a
  pity? He really is an AF Intelligence Officer, not a civilian. A very good friend I have in the AF unknowingly checked
  the matter at my request. There is no doubt about that.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">I have now the copy of his photo. He gave me it a few days ago. He does not realise what I know about it
  : that it is a "classified photo of an UFO&rdquo;. No one knows about it outside the AF.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">It seems that I was the winner of the second play. But the game is not finished yet. They are going to
  try another play as soon as possible. I am expecting it?</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">I began to understand that my opponent was more dangerous than he seemed. Always he appeared to be
  watching. Somehow I felt the impression that he knew I was trying to get information from him and was pleased with the
  thing. I sweated and tried another approach. He began to watch me with amusement and started to play down the whole
  saucer business. When he explained how he was informed that the Russians had built jet-powered flying saucers two
  years ago &ndash; and that one of those craft probably was searching for US guided missiles in the Trindade Island and
  had been spotted and photographed &ndash; I saw that he was teasing me. Then I decided to play my last card.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">I laughed at those words. "You are loosing your time, Commander Brand&atilde;o. I am not such a fool? If
  you want to conceal the truth about flying saucers, please try a better "explanation&rdquo;, not this one. It seems
  that you didn't learn anything from Dr. Menzel's book on the subject. Or from the top-secret reports you have received
  from the US Navy.&rdquo;</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">"I never received any report of this kind&rdquo;, he said. "Who told you such a lie ?&rdquo;</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">"I forgot his name. I know it is not a lie, and I also understand your position. You can't release
  classified information to civilians. But, on the other side, I am not here to hear hollow explanations that don't mean
  anything at all. The Navy is free to draw what conclusions it likes about UAOs. They are not entitled, however, to
  treat civilian questions as a mere nuisance &ndash; as you are doing with my questions. I want you to understand on
  thing : I already know the answers you are trying to conceal. As well as the Navy, I know that flying saucers are
  craft from another planet, that they have little men in them and that they mean to do us harm. Is that clear
  ?&rdquo;</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">He said nothing. Then I thanked him for showing me the photos and let myself out.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">I was beaten.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">?????????????????????..?</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">The same day two men came to my office. The time was 6 : 30 p.m. My nurse had left a few minutes before
  &ndash; and I was alone. They showed their credentials : they were intelligence officers from the Navy. They said that
  they were there because of my visit to the Navy Ministry, that morning. Their attitude appeared to be friendly, but
  their first words gave me the feeling they were trying to scare me somehow.</p>
<p>"<SPAN LANG="en-GB">You   know  too  much  about  things  you  weren't  entitled  to  know&rdquo;,  said  one  of  them. "We  don't  like  that. Besides, your   activities  concerning  those  fragments  you  possess  are </SPAN><SPAN
    LANG="en-GB"><U>very</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> undesirable  and  might  be  dangerous  to  you. We  would  like  to   warn  you  to  stop  all  your  investigations  connected  with   these  fragments. We  request  also  the  samples  in  your  hands   to  be  delivered  to  us  as  soon  as  possible?&rdquo;</SPAN>
</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">I interrupted him at that moment. I was not frightened, but angry &ndash; and trying hard to control my
  temper. "My dear friend&rdquo;, I said, "I'm afraid you don't have any conception of what country is this. This is a
  free country and you aren't entitled to say what I can or can't do. If you came here to throat me, you can stop now
  and get out through that door. And tell your military chiefs I have no fear of their ridiculous menaces. I also have
  friends in the armed in the armed forces and elsewhere, and I know they have no power to interfere legally with my
  activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p><SPAN LANG="en-GB">He   changed  his  attitude  instantly. "You  misunderstood  my   words&rdquo;, he  answered. "I  am  only  giving  you  an  advice. You   may  follow  it  or  not, of  course. I  want  you  to  understand   that  our  visit  is </SPAN><SPAN
    LANG="en-GB"><U>unofficial</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> and </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>private</U></SPAN><SPAN
    LANG="en-GB">.  It  seems  that  you  have  discovered  highly  important   information  regarding  flying  saucers, but  we  think  you  don't   know  the  whole  picture. We  are  going  to  place  at  your   disposal  certain  information  and  advice  of  great  interest  to   you. In  exchange, we  want  your  cooperation  on  certain  matters.  As  a  civilian  investigator, you  certainly  have  many  sources   of  information  which  avoid  to  report  anything  to  the   military, on  the  subject. We  request  your  help  to  correct   this  situation, reporting  all  information  received  to  us &ndash;  chiefly  about  sightings  and  landings  of  UFOs  in  our  country.  Our  organization  is  a  small  one  and  we  need  civilian  help.  In  some  other  countries  the  situation  is  different  and  they   can  refuse  civilian  cooperation &ndash; you  probably  know  it ; it   is  perhaps  the  reason  of  your  surprise  and  your  hostile   attitude. You  can  relax  now.&rdquo;</SPAN>
</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">I decided to accept his explanation and discuss the information they wanted to report. I am not
  convinced, however, that I misunderstood his first words. On the contrary, I believe they wouldn't use this friendly
  approach if they had me scared since the first moment. But that tactic failed and they had to change their method to a
  more kind attitude.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">In discussions which lasted for almost two hours they disclosed the following information about the
  flying saucer problem :</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">(1) They told me that all governments and military authorities through the world know that flying
  saucers exist &ndash; and that they are craft from another planet. They have absolute proof of both things.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">(2) As a matter of fact, six flying disks already crashed on this earth and were captured and taken
  apart by military forces and scientists of the countries involved &ndash; under the most rigid and ruthless security
  restrictions to keep the matter absolutely secret. One of those disks crashed in the Sahara desert but was too much
  destroyed to be of some use. Three others crashed in the United States, two of them in very good conditions. The fifth
  crashed somewhere in the British Islands, and the last one came down at one of the Scandinavian countries ; these two
  were almost undamaged too. All these six disks were small craft &ndash; 32, 72 or 99 feet in diameter. In all of them
  were found bodies of members of their crews. They were "little men&rdquo; and ranged in height from about 32 to 46
  inches. They were dead in all cases, killed in the disasters. The examination of the bodies showed they were
  definitely "humanoid&rdquo; &ndash; but obviously not from this planet. In some cases the cause of the crash was
  determined with accuracy : it wasn't apparent in the other. All ships had the general shape of a saucer with a cabin
  on the top ; all of them were made of a very light metal which was assembled in segments that fitted in deep grooves
  and were pinned together around the base. There was no sign of this on the outer surface of the ships. Some of the
  craft had portholes made of an unknown type of glass : many kinds of unknown materials were found inside the
  ships.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">(3) Examination of instruments and devices found aboard these disks showed that they are propelled by an
  extremely powerful electro-magnetic field. Evidence shows it is a rotating and oscillating high voltage
  electro-magnetic field. Such a kind of field obviously produces some type of gravity effect yet not understood.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">(4) All ships were carefully dismantled and studied. Unfortunately the more important problem was not
  solved : how these fields were produced and what was the source of the tremendous amount of electric energy released
  through these fields. No clues were found in any of the disks examined. Apparently they got their power from nowhere.
  There is, on the other hand, evidence that large UFOs use some type of atomic engines as power-source suggests thet
  they are able to transmit electric power through radio beams as we now send it through wires. Some of the devices
  found inside of the small disks could well serve to receive and to concentrate the electric power coming this way. If
  this is right, a nuclear power-plant operated on a ship or satellite of large dimensions, placed outside our
  atmosphere, could feed electrical power to a whole fleet of smaller craft operating inside our atmosphere. None of
  there UFOs of greater size was captured till now.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">(5) Our scientists could built a ship propelled by a similar rotating and oscillating electro-magnetic
  field &ndash; if they know some method to change the energy released into a nuclear-reactor directly into electric
  power. The problem is not solved yet.</p>
<p><SPAN LANG="en-GB">(6)  These  visitors  from  outer  space  are  dangerous  when  approached   and  definitely  hostile  when  attacked. We  have  already  lost   many  planes  attempting  to  shot  down  one  of  them. We  have  no   defense  against  them  till  now. They  outperform  easily  any  of   our  fighters, which  have  no  chance  against  them. Guided   missiles  are  also  useless : they  can  fly  still  faster  than   any  of  them  and  can  even  maneuver  around  them, as  if  they   were  toys ; or  they  can  interfere  with  their  electric   instruments  and  make  them  useless  soon  after  launched ; or, if   they  like, they  can  explode  them  before  they  reach  their   proximities. They  have  produced  the  crash  of  military  planes  (propeller  or  jet  type) and  airliners  by  stalling  their   engines  through  interference  with  their  electric  systems (we   don't  know  yet  if  this  is  a  side  effect  of  their   powerful  magnetic  field, or  the  result  of  some  kind  of   weapon &ndash; possibly  a  high  frequency  beam  of  some  sort. They   have  also  a  horribly  destructive  long-range  weapon  which  has   been  used  mercilessly  against  our  jet-fighters. In  one  case,  for  example, an  US  Navy  interceptor  with  a  crew  of  two,  scrambled  to  go  after  an  UFO. Their  mission  was, as  usual, to   make  it  land  or  to  shot  down  it &ndash; if  necessary. They  used   their  guns. The  answer  was  immediate  and  terrifying :  instantly  all  metallic  parts  of  their  planes  was   disintegrated, disrupted  into  thousands  of  fragments, and  they   found  themselves  suddenly  seated  in  the  air (non-metallic   pieces  or  objects  weren't  affected  by  the  phenomenon) ; one   of  them  was  killed  but  the  other  lived  to  tell  the  story. </SPAN><SPAN

</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">(7) They have not showed, till now, any interest in contacting us. They are obviously preparing a
  planet-wide huge military operation to interfere against us. We don't know what kind of operation will be this. There
  are, however, three possibilities : (a) total war followed by mass-landings, to destroy our power, slave the remnant
  of our people and colonize the planet ; (b) police-action to stop our plans for the conquest of space, and to avoid
  our dangerous progress in the field of atomic-weapons ; this would involve mass-landings at strategic points with
  occupation by force of limited areas of vital interest for their purposes ; (c) "friendly interference&rdquo;
  (followed by military intimidation) to make us agree with their plans for us &ndash; whatever they can be &ndash;
  avoiding open war or any other kind of direct interferences ; patrolling and eventual police-action only outside our
  atmosphere.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">(8) All military authorities and governments through the world are informed about the situation. There
  is an exchange of information through intelligence services and top-secret military conferences are held periodically
  to discuss new developments on the subject. The Brazilian Navy, for example, receives monthly classified reports from
  the US Navy and send back to them any information available here. A similar contact exists among our Army and Air
  Force and several (similar) military organizations on other countries. Here in Brazil only the persons who work in the
  problem know the real situation : intelligence officers in the Army, Navy and Air Force ; some high-rank officers in
  the High-Command ; the National Security Council and a few scientists whose activities are connected with it ; and a
  few members of certain civilian organizations doing research for military Projects.</p>
<p><SPAN LANG="en-GB">(9)  All  information  about  the  UFO-subject  from  military  is  not   only  classified  or  reserved  for  official  use : it  is </SPAN><SPAN
    LANG="en-GB"><U>top-secret</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">.  Civilian  authorities  and  military  officers  in  general  are  not   entitled  to  know. Even  our  President  is  not  informed  of  the   whole  truth.</SPAN>
</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">(10) Military authorities through the world agrees that the people is not entitled to know anything
  about the problem. Some military groups believe that such a knowledge would be a tremendous shock &ndash; enough to
  paralyse the life in our countries for many years in the future. On the other side, they believe that flying saucer
  reconnaissance (as it is now) might last other 10 years &ndash; the people couldn't be controlled for so long a time
  and the danger of uncontrolled panic would be high. Besides, the probability of UFO-hostile interference (described on
  item 7) in still estimated as 90 per cent ; there is yet a 10 per cent probability that their hostility is only a
  consequence of our attacks against their ships ; because of this possibility, we are attempting now to make them aware
  that we would like to make a peaceful contact &ndash; so, the orders (now) are to avoid any further attack against
  their craft. This policy has been adopted generally, with the exception of some countries which still have fools in
  their Air Forces &ndash; who think otherwise. We don't know if UFOs will react to these measures recently put under
  operation. We still hope they will.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">(11) To conceal the truth from the public, a carefully planned censorship is under operation for several
  years. The policy to debunk the whole saucer-subject is the better weapon we are using for this purpose. Ridicule is
  an efficient tool against most people who attempt to inform the public but other measures are sometimes necessary.
  Chiefly against persons who possess evidence that, if published, could open the eyes of the people. In some countries,
  force has been used to silence some of them. When this is not possible, all tricks had been used to make their
  evidence useless. In a few cases, infortunately, violence had to be used ; we regret this but we have no choice. We
  are going to keep this thing secret at any cost. We are not interested in the so-called "inalienable rights&rdquo; of
  the people. Right or wrong, we &ndash; the military &ndash; are going to do our job and no one is going to stop
  us.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB"> ..???????????????????</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">So I have come to the end of my story, Coral. You can refuse to believe it. I have no proof to convince
  you. My only evidence is the story in itself, which I reported with all details. There is, of course, the possibility
  that those Navy intelligence officers (I don't know their names, they didn't identify themselves) weren't telling the
  truth. But I could see no useful purpose in doing this. Besides, I already suspected all things they told me. The only
  information that surprised me was the one related with the ultra-sonic weapon to destroy our planes ; I never heard
  anything about it before. I believe it was used against Mantell's plane, if it really exists.</p>
<p><SPAN LANG="en-GB">I   do  not  trust  military  people. They  exchanged  their   information  for  a  small  bit  of  our  Mg. I  told  them  nothing   about  our  plans, of  course. They  got  only  the  sample  they   wanted. They  promised  to  tell  me  about  the  results  of  their   analyses, but  only </SPAN><SPAN
    LANG="en-GB"><U>particularly</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB">.  They  advised  me  not  to  connect  the  Navy  with  anything   regarding  that  sample : they  would  deny  it, they  would  call   me  a  liar  and  ridicule  my  statements &ndash; if  I  tried  to  do   so. Officially, they  are  not  interested, they  emphasized, and  do   not  intend  to  release  any  official  pronouncement  on  this   subject &ndash; or  any  other, connected  with  the  UAO-problem. They   also  warned  me  not  to  publish  the  information  they  had   given  me : "What  we  have  told  you  will  be  denied&rdquo;, said   one  of  them. "We  will  deny  also  that  we  know  you  or  ever   contacted  you. You  will  be  called  a  liar  or, if  you   persist, a  crackpot. As  you  have  nothing  to  prove  you  are   telling  the  truth, no  one  would  believe  you.&rdquo;</SPAN>
</p>
<p><SPAN LANG="en-GB">They   are  right, infortunately. Under  the  circumstances, to  publish   what  they  revealed, knowing  not  only  that  I  would  be   ridiculed, but  also  knowing  who  would  do  the  ridiculing  and   not  having  means  to  fight  their  vicious  attack, is  to  be  a   fool. I  am  not  going  to  be  such  a  fool, of  course. But  I   can  do  other  things  they  aren't  expecting ; for  example, to   pass  their  information  to  people  who  can  use  it, too. At   least  to  understand  certain  attitudes  and  statements  of  the   US  Air  Force, that  only  have  contributed  to  cause  confusion   in  the  field  of  UFO-research : it  is  not  simple  confusion,  but </SPAN><SPAN
    LANG="en-GB"><U>organized</U></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"> </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><U>confusion</U></SPAN><SPAN
    LANG="en-GB">.  Or  to  clear  certain  mysteries  connected  with  UAO-research  and   UAO-investigators.</SPAN>
</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">As the mystery of Al Bender and his strange visitors. He was obviously silenced by intelligence officers
  from the US government, who probably told him the same information I have got &ndash; with the difference that in your
  country they can apply more preasure against the ones who know too much? I read again Gray Barker's book and saw many
  things I didn't see before. I also remembered the story told by Scully about the disks that crashed in your country. I
  believe now that he told the truth. It is evident that the details given to me and the ones described in Scully's book
  are identical &ndash; they belong to the same disks. Unless that book helped my Navy "friends&rdquo; in the
  description of imaginary disks, that exist only in their minds. It could be? But it seems a remote possibility, under
  the circumstances already reported.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">If the things are as bad as they look, Coral, we have only a thing to do : to continue our fight to get
  the truth in the open. I will no submit to the conspiracy of silence, as others seem to have done. I still believe
  that the people, the ones who would be on the receiving and of a possible invasion from space, shall be told. I don't
  think they are unable to stand the truth &ndash; as it was suggested. I believe they will stand it because humans are
  not bent easily. After the first shock, everyone would work to help something in the measures taken against the
  imminent danger. Only the cowards would be paralysed by fear. The great majority would approve the decision to fight
  at any cost, with hope or with no hope. It is better to be dead than to become slaves of animals from another
  planet.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">I don't believe that we have no defense against them. They can smash our aerial defenses with ease, I
  know. But after landing they will have to fight on the ground. Then they will have to fight also against our gravity,
  our atmosphere, our weather and many other things. They will move slowly and will be easy targets. Then we can fight
  them, I believe. But only if we are prepared &ndash; as well as was the English people when Hitler's invasion was
  imminent. How can this be done, however, if no one is alerted ? We should already have stopped our potty "cold war&rdquo;.
  Underground refuges, fortifications, plants, arsenals and other places should have been built everywhere. Power-plants
  should have been insulated with refractive materials to prevent any interference from magnetic fields or
  high-frequency beams. If motors with electric systems can be stalled, diesel motors should be used, at least for
  military purposes. Nylon-suits could protect our bodies against magnetic influences, radiation, heat, or death rays.
  Metallic vehicles, guns and missiles could be protected against sonic disintegration, if coated by fiberglass or other
  sonic absorvers. New weapons and defenses could be found also, by scientists and technicians working in every country
  to solve the problem. And many other things.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">But the military decided to do nothing. If saucers are hostile, they solve the problem by concealing the
  truth from the people. Only that. Why ? Maybe because they are the ones who cannot stand the truth regarding the
  origin of UAO-hostility against us. It is highly probable that their orders to shot down flying saucers changed them
  against us. If so, those man who opened the Pandora box are the ones who are frightened and decided to hide their
  mistakes at any cost &ndash; in spite of the possible consequences for us.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">We have no other alternative than to fight their policy of silence, Coral. As we have done till now.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">Please, forgive this letter. I have written too much &ndash; more than it was necessary perhaps. But I
  had to tell everything. In fact, this is more a report than a letter, an account of things that would be placed better
  in a science-fiction tale than in the real life. With the information included here you can perhaps get some more
  facts from other sources. But be careful in your investigations. I do not wish to get you into trouble.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">Send my regards to Jim and my best wishes for your family. I hope you are enjoying good health, and so
  the Lorenzen family.</p>
<p LANG="en-GB">Sincerely,</p>
<p><SPAN LANG="en-GB">P.S.  I  am  preparing  a  complete  report  about  the  Trindade  Island's   photographies ; I  will  send  it  as  soon </SPAN><SPAN
