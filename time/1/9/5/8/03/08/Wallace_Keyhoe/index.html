    </tr></table><p><strong>Wallace</strong> : Good evening. Tonight we go after a fantastic story, the story that <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/FlyingSaucers.html">flying saucers</a> from other worlds are visiting our planet, just
    as we are exploring outer space with our own rocket and satellites. </p>
    <p>Our guest is former Mariner Air Corps Major <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Donald Keyhoe</a>, who
      has the support of scores of prominent business men, military men and some scientists in his campaign to prove
      that <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/FlyingSaucers.html">flying saucers</a> exist. </p>
    <p>If you're curious to know why major <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Keyhoe</a> charges that United
      States Air Force is deliberately deluding us, what he calls saucers stories debunk, if you want to hear his own
      evidence that the flying saucers are real, and his reaction to the claim of two americains who says the've spoken
      with men from Venus. </p>
    <p>We'll go after those stories in just a moment. My name is Mike Wallace, the cigarette is Parliament. </p>
    <p>(Opening credits)</p>
    <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : We'll meet Major <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Keyhoe</a> in just a
      minute.</p>
    <p> (COMMERCIAL)</p>
    <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : And now to our story. Major <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Donald
      Keyhoe</a> is the director the <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">National Investigations Comittee on Aerial
      Phenomena</a>. As head of this private group, interested in flying saucers, he's repeatedly attacked the United
      States Air Force, and others, for claiming that flying saucers are apparently flight of fancy, and not flight by
      martians or men from the Moon. Independent surveys show that millions of americains do share his believe in these
      celestial saucers.</p>
    <p>Major <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Keyhoe</a>, first of all, let me ask you this: most people in
      the United States, in spite of the fact that I said that millions do believe, I think you will agree that most
      people in the United States <em>don't </em>believe in flying saucers from outer space. They probably hold the view
      of columnist Bob Considine, who wrote that flying saucers are products of, for the most part, quote, <q>prankers,
        half-wits, cranks, publicity hounds, fanatics in general and screwballs</q>, end quote. How do you feel about
      Mr. Considine's charge? </p>
    <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : Well, I know where he got the story:
      he got it from colonel <a href="/people/w/WatsonHaroldErnest/index.html">Watson</a> out of the <a
          href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">Air Technical Intelligence Center</a> in Dayton. In fact, the
      colonel went even a little further and he said that behind every sighting was an idiot, a crackpot or religious
      fanatic. That included a lot of high-ranking Air Force pilots, incidentally, and many airline captains, people who
      are qualified to see these things. But, he's just following on Air Force policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : Well now, you're not suggesting that Bob Considine is in the pay of the Air Force;
      he's an independent newsman with a considerable reputation. </p>
    <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : No I mean the colonel, I mean the
      colonel. No I have a only respect for Bob Considine. </p>
    <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : In spite of the fact that he suggests that pranksters, half-wits and screwballs are
      responsible for the stories about flying saucers. </p>
    <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : Well, I wish I could show him, at
      anytime, a list of about 800 witnesses, some of the big names of aviation including, up to the rank of colonel in
      the Air Force. They're still flying, and they're still carrying passengers; they've never been grounded. They're
      still guiding airliners in the radar men are, night after night in bad weather. If they're screwballs and
      incompetents, why are they still on the job? </p>
    <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : Major <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Keyhoe</a>, where do you think
      flying saucers are coming from?</p>
    <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : I don't know. There's an indication
      that they could be using <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/mars/index.html">Mars</a> as a base. I don't mean
      they originate right there, but every time <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/mars/index.html">Mars</a> has
      approached us, in the last ten years, there's been a noticeable increase in saucer sightings. And that's been
      mentioned officially. In fact, <a href="/org/ca/nrc/projet/Magnet/index.html">the Canadian official project</a>,
      on the basis of that, set up an observation station in <a href="/org/ca/index.html">Canada</a>. </p>
    <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : You say the Canadian official project, what do you mean by the official...? </p>
    <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : There was an official project called "<a
        href="/org/ca/nrc/projet/Magnet/index.html">project Magnet</a>", and they set up an observation at Shirley Bay
      to try to track these things. And... </p>
    <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : What happened to <a href="/org/ca/nrc/projet/Magnet/index.html">the official
      project</a>? You say there was a project.</p>
    <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : Yes. They ran for about a year and
      they had one sighting on the gravimeter, which indicated that something... a very large object had flown over
      there, but they finally decided that they were spending a little bit much money on that, I suppose. </p>
    <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : For certain, they wouldn't have thought that they were spending too much money on it,
      if they believed that that kind of phenomena existed. </p>
    <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : A lot of people on the project are
      still working up there on their own time and certain government officials have still kept the lid on the reports
      in <a href="/org/ca/index.html">Canada</a>, just as they do down here. </p>
    <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : What is your theory...? In other words, you suggest that they come from <a
        href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/mars/index.html">Mars</a> or from other planets, from other solar systems,
      possibly, throughout the universe, is that correct?</p>
    <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : Yes, and there're a lot of scientists
      who've said the same thing. </p>
    <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : What is your theory as to the kind of people who fly these... or the kind of beings
      who fly these saucers? </p>
    <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : Well, that's speculation; Willy Ley
      said recently that it would be like the man next door, the invaders from space, and his reasons, may be good. But
      most of the top scientists have said that the odds are that beings from other worlds would not be like us; some of
      them would be. Dr. Howard Shafly, for instance, said that there probably were at least a hundred million inhabited
      planets in the universe. And <a href="/people/m/MenzelDonaldHoward/index.html">Menzel</a>, who doesn't believe in
      saucers, at all, says, that he goes at higher - even higher. And among those, by - there must, be- the law of
      averages. ---, There is a certain number of planets that would be like the earth, and if evolution started the
      same time, you might have the same type of being. </p>
    <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : What you think of the intentions of these people -- for lack of a better name -- of
      these people who are in these flying saucers? </p>
    <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : Well, there's been no evidence of any
      hostility during the last 10 years, for what we call the modern face, there have been sightings before then. There
      have been some accidents; air force pilots chasing these things; kept a man until he was killed chasing, <a
          href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Mantell/index.html">one in '48</a> and <a
          href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Kinross/index.html">two pilots disappeared chasing one in '53 over
        Lake Superior</a>. But, I think those are just accidents. </p>
    <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : Just accidents. Why don't they try to communicate with us? What's your theory about
      that? </p>
    <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : Well, I'll follow some of the theories
      the Air Forces people have said... they suggested to me back in '<a href="../../../../2/index.html">52</a> and '<a
          href="../../../../3/index.html">53</a>, at which time we were cooperating --, I had a lot of very good friends
      in the Air Force at that time -- and the policy was to give out the information --, They were about the to tell
      the people everything they had. And the theory was then that perhaps these beings were so much different from us
      that communication would be a very hard thing; they might not, for instance, have speech sounds like ours. That's
      one answer. And another thing: they might not be able to exist in our atmosphere. We're going to land on the moon,
      we'll have to wear space suits, or else build air-conditioned buildings up there air pressured. And there could be
      lots of factors like that. </p>
    <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : Well, do you think they're down here, when we do see them, to look at us?</p>
    <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : I think it's probably a long-range
      survey. </p>
    <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : A long-range survey?</p>
    <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : That's right. </p>
    <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : And yet, no attempt, as far as we know in any case, of communication with us. </p>
    <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : There have been claims of
      communication, but those, most of those, have been by individuals. The Air Force has not admitted that there's
      ever been one and I don't know... our committee hasn't found any cases that we would accept as absolutely
      verified. </p>
    <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : All right. Now, let's go at it from another point of view, if I may, the Air Force
      point of view. They agree, undoubtedly, objects have been seen in the sky, but the Air Force has said time and
      time again --, this is a quote from Richard Horner, assistant secretary of the Air Force for research and
      development --, "All, but a small percentage of these reports -- of unidentified flying objects -- have been
      definitely attributed to natural phenomena that are neither mysterious nor dire." End quote. Weather balloons,
      mirages, ordinary sky phenomena like meteors or airplanes themselves. What about that?</p>

        </tr></table><p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : I'll answer that, but
        I'd like to make several points in doing it. In <a href="../../../../../4/7/index.html">1947</a>, the <a
            href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">Air Technical Intelligence Center</a> at Dayton, that's the top
        Air Force intelligence men and scientists under contract, sent the secret documents to the commanding General of
        the Air Force, saying that whatever of these things were, they were real. In <a
            href="../../../../../4/8/index.html">1948</a>, <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a>, the
        same group, sent a top secret estimate to the Commanding General, Roy Vandenburg, that these were interplanetary
        spaceships. In <a href="../../../../2/index.html">1952</a>, there was an intelligence analysis of the manoeuvers
        of these things, as seen by radar, triangulation, radar photographs. And in '<a href="../../../../3/index.html">53</a>,
        the <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/index.html">Central Intelligence Agency</a> and the <a
            href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a> had <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/projet/Robertson/index.html">a
          special panel of scientists</a> meet at the Pentagon, to tell them what to do. And after they got through,
        this group said, <q>You don't have proof that these things exist, not scientific proof, but you have a very
          strong circumstancial case. We suggest you quadruple investigations, set up special observation posts and in
          the meantime release everything you got to the american people</q>. Now, you've got four documents there;
        they've been sitting on all this time. Now, that and they have been spending a lot of money investigating flying
        saucers. If they don't exist, why the money... why did the intelligence team rush out every time there's a
        sighting? </p>
        <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : Now then, you have mentioned four documents that you claim exist. We've heard, in
          the past, that you have claimed that these documents existed. We've seen your litterature in which you talk
          about the existence of those documents. So, we spoke with the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">Air
            Technical Intelligence Center</a> at the Pentagon earlier with this week, and this is what we're told
          officially by them, <q>Three of the four documents major <a
              href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Keyhoe</a> refers to, simply do not exist. The fourth document
            does exist, you can have a copy of it, Mr. Wallace, and you can see that it doesn't say what major <a
                href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Keyhoe</a> claims it says</q>. We have a copy of it and I
          quote to you from the copy. The Air Force document says just this, <q>The panel recommends that the national
            security agencies take immediate steps to strip the UFOs of the special status they have been given and the
            aura of mystery they have unfortunately acquired. We suggest an integrated program designed to reassure the
            public of the total lack of evidence of inimical forces behind the phenomena</q>. And again, as I point out,
          secretary Horner says it's simply ain't so. Now, why? The point really at issue here, it would seem, major <a
              href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Keyhoe</a>, is this: <em>Why </em>do you believe that the Air
          Force says that nothing is going on? Why do you believe that the... ? It's a fairly serious charge that you
          make.</p>
        <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : I know this. </p>
        <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : You make the charge that the United States government is withholding from the
          people of the United States certain very important information. <em>Why</em>? What would their motive be for
          withholding that kind of information from us?</p>
        <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : Well I'll answer that, but I'd
          also like to show you some proofs that they are withholding it. The reason was given to me when they were
          working with me back in '<a href="../../../../2/index.html">52</a> and '<a
              href="../../../../3/index.html">53</a>; it was first that they were afraid of hysteria. Remember the Orson
          Welles show-back... way years back, when he scared people of the hills with the... </p>
        <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : I do. </p>
        <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : ...idea of invading Martians.
          Then, they were also afraid that it would upset organized religion, that was a smaller factor, but there was
          some fear of it. Later, they were afraid that these accidents when the interceptors had chased these things
          and had been lost or had crashed, might be considered a proof of hostility. Now, I would never have put my
          name on anything if it were a matter of personal opinion. I've talked to, and read the reports of, hundreds of
          pilots and radar men, guided missile trackers, who've seen these things. And some of them are very more
          important names. The Air Force says that they've (...) this down to 1.9 percent, but you noticed the word
          current in there, they mean we are currently. Now, I have in my possession a copy of the special report
          fourteen, which is their Bible on this. In the back, it has a table showing that of thirty-two hundred and one
          cases they examined, nineteen and a half percent were unsolved. And they admit they still are unsolved. You
          add up what they're had since then, it makes over twelve percent of the reports and those are mostly from the
          best possible sources.</p>
        <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : Well now, wait just a second; I'll use your figures. The Department of Defense
          released an official bulletin on November 5, <a href="../../../../7/index.html">1957</a>, saying that from
          June of '<a href="../../../../5/index.html">55</a> to June of '<a href="../../../../7/index.html">57</a>, a
          two-year period, just a fraction over two percent of all investigated unidentified flying objects had to be
          listed as unknown. Two percent, so that's your one point nine...</p>
        <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : What's the period, again? </p>
        <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : '<a href="../../../../5/index.html">55</a> to '<a href="../../../../7/index.html">57</a>.
          The rest were undetermined to have been balloons, airplanes, <a
              href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/canular/index.html">hoaxes</a>, and a category about 12 percent,
          called insufficient information, which means that the report was so flimsy that there was simply nothing to
          check on. I must confess that they have... they've certainly shown me no classified material, but they have
          opened their files quite willingly to us in our preparation for this program tonight, and they've given us
          very convincing evidence, major <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Keyhoe</a>, that it is largely...
          I shouldn't say largely, I'll say ninety-nine and forty-four, one hundred percent, a <a
              href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/canular/index.html">hoax</a>. Now, you mentioned...</p>
        <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : A <a
            href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/canular/index.html">hoax</a>?</p>
        <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : Well, let... when I say a <a
            href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/canular/index.html">hoax</a>...</p>
        <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : Are you saying a lot of good
          pilots, <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/canular/index.html">hoax</a>?</p>
        <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : No, no, no, not <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/canular/index.html">hoax</a>,
          just... I thank you for correcting me, not just a <a
              href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/canular/index.html">hoax</a>, but, let's say, misinformation or
          sightings of objects which seem to be one thing but are, in fact, another. I'm glad that you corrected me
          about <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/canular/index.html">hoax</a>, because it is, by no means,
          that much a <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/canular/index.html">hoax</a>. But, you mentioned that
          Dr. <a href="/people/m/MenzelDonaldHoward/index.html">Donald Menzel</a>, who was a professor of astrophysics
          at Harvard before. Now, I think you will agree that he's one of the world's most distinguished
          astrophysicists. Is that not so? </p>
        <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : I think there are others who are
          equally capable, but, do not agree with him. </p>
        <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : He is one of the world's most distinguished astrophysicist; though, I think we can
          agree on that. In any case, he stresses, you see, that pilots are not experts of ---, that they, as well, as
          others, can see flying saucers when it's only, to quote him, <q>the wrapper of somebody's lunch moving around
            on the air</q> end quote. Bug, again, let's come back to the point... the most important point, major <a
              href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Keyhoe</a>, and that is, why, why will the Air Force...? Why
          will the United States government withhold information from United States citizens? For what reason?</p>
        <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : Because they're treating us like
          children, the way they did it with the H-bomb at first, and the way they've been doing with other things. Now,
          I'm not attacking the United States Air Force. I'm attacking a small group in there that has been persistently
          keeping this from the public, just as they've kept other things. For a long time you couldn't even mention the
          idea that we could be hit by missiles from submarines from the gulf or from both coasts very easily. I knew
          that years and years ago tried to get it out, but at the time was discouraged about it. Now then, you
          mentioned this... that this denial of these documents. Now, I'd like to tell you something that happened on
          the Armstrong Circle Theatre. I had requested that those points be in the script and I was discouraged from it
          at, first by their writer. Then later, some of our board of governors insisted that we had those points
          included. So I said, <q>Either, I don't go on or we have those in there</q>. They said all right. So the
          script was completely rewritten. Now those were in the script as it was first rehearsed. But when the second
          rehearsal, came along and the Air Force saw the mimeograph sheet there with Air Force representatives, but
          according to Armstrong's writer said, they would immediately deny it on the air, even though it meant
          denouncing their own former project chief. Now, the source for this is captain <a
              href="/people/r/RuppeltEdwardJ/index.html">Edward Ruppelt</a>, who was the head of <a
              href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook/index.html">project Blue Book</a> for two years. And at that
          time he was considered good enough that he briefed president <a href="/people/t/TrumanHarryS/index.html">Truman</a>
          on these things. He was the top man, rank didn't mean anything, it was the experience that counted. All right,
          he says these things existed; he put it in a book which was cleared by Security and Review, in the Air Force.
          On December 5,<a href="../../../../5/index.html"> 1955</a>, that was cleared. It's in his book. He has never
          been hauled in a court-martial. Now, I have here, and if you'd allow your camera to come in on it; this is a
          sheet from the script of the Armstrong Theather, which was deleted. This was crossed off, and I was told that
          I couldn't say it on the air. Now that was censorship by intimidation. This can be matched up with the other
          sheets from the Armstrong Circle script and any typewriter expert will show you that... They ordered to take
          it out. </p>
        <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : I'm certain that people believe you; the only thing is that, the next morning, I
          do distinctly remember reading a report by you, major <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Keyhoe</a>,
          to the effect that no censorship, no pressure of any kind had been put upon you. </p>
        <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : I'm sorry, Mr. Wallace, that... I
          know that statement almost by heart. I said that <em>CBS </em>and the Armstrong people were not to blame for
          me off the air when I tried to mention the fact that a Senate Committee was working on the secrecy angle. I
          never mentioned this that night to anyone because I had promised that I wouldn't say anything about on the air
          that... the Armstrong people. It was taken out and I will do this: I will ask the United States Air Force to
          have the Marine Corps put me on active duty for a court-martial if that is not the case. </p>

            </tr></table><p><strong>Wallace</strong> : Major <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Keyhoe</a>, I
            understand you have three new reports on file which in your opinion... you have them currently on file,
            they're new reports. These, in your opinion, would convince every person in this country that flying saucers
            are a fact. Is that correct? </p>
            <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : It should convince a lot of
              people because of the names involved. </p>
            <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : Tell us about it. </p>
            <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : I told your interviewer or in
              Washington that I couldn't mention the names because they were too high; one of them is a top scientist in
              this country, whose name would be known to everybody. </p>
            <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : But, why wouldn't he want his...? </p>
            <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : Because he's afraid of
              official ridicule.</p>
            <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : He's afraid of official ridicule? </p>
            <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : That's right. </p>
            <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : More afraid of official ridicule than a possibly alerting the country to a
              serious national danger?</p>
            <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : You'd be surprised how many
              people give us reports and they say, <q>Please keep my name confidential</q>. I'll give you one report
              which came to us, the name has to be left out. In <a href="../../../../1/index.html">1951</a> a UFO
              circled the fleet in Korean waters. It circled it at a high-speed and they launched several planes to try
              to get a close in on it. They got a radar lock on it, that is the radar was guiding the planes toward the
              object. This was picked up by radars on fourteen naval vessels. This object circled about... oh, for a
              half an hour more and then it took off at a speed way over an excessive a thousand miles an hour. This
              report was certified and nine members of our board of government saw it, signed it, and agreed that they
              had seen it, and agreed to the content, too. There is another report that just came in from four top
              missiles designers or engineers at one of the big plants in this country. They saw an elliptical shaped
              object and two small round disk shaped objects flying with it over California, November 11, <a
                  href="../../../../7/index.html">1957</a>, at a speed of at least five thousand miles an hour. These
              men are well-qualified; they know what they see, with broad daylight, not a cloud in the sky. There've
              been cases, even when the Air Force has shot at these things. Now, if there's nothing there and, they
              don't exist, why do they shoot at them? You mentioned Mr. Horner. The day after Mr. Horner said that the
              Air Force was not concealing anything, captain Gregory Oldenburg, a public information officer at Langley
              Field, refused to let an ad be inserted in the Langley Base Flier... their newspaper, which asked that
              anybody interested in UFOs, please communicate and form a little group. He said, <q>I must refuse to do
                this, because the dissemination of information on UFOs is contrary to Air Force policy and Air Force
                Regulation 200 dash 2</q> and I have a copy of it here, in case you want to see it. </p>
            <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : Well, major <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Keyhoe</a>, I must
              say that the Air Force tells us... they don't question your motives, but they do question the accuracy of
              the good deal of your information and for that reason they say you have been, and were they to -- in a
              sense -- throw open, an invitation to all people who sight UFOs, to get in touch with them once again,
              they'd get all kinds of cranks, hoaxers and so forth. And, you see, they run down every one of these
              sightings and it has cost them a tremendous amount of money, to no avail over the past few years.</p>
            <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : That's what they told you.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : That is what they told me. Now, sir, in a moment I'd like to ask you this: in
              the past few years millions of flying saucers enthusiasts have become excited about stories of two men, <a
                  href="/people/a/AdamskiGeorge/index.html">George Adamski</a> and <a
                  href="/people/m/MengerHoward/index.html">Howard Menger</a>; both of them claim to have seen flying
              saucers. <a href="/people/m/MengerHoward/index.html">Menger</a> claimed to have been given ride in one, by
              some creatures from <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus/index.html">Venus</a>. <a
                  href="/people/a/AdamskiGeorge/index.html">Adamski</a> said he chatted with a man from <a
                  href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus/index.html">Venus</a> in the California desert. I'd like to
              get your reaction to those stories. And we'll get major <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Keyhoe</a>'s
              reaction in just sixty seconds. </p>
            <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : All right, major, about <a href="/people/a/AdamskiGeorge/index.html">George
              Adamski</a> and <a href="/people/m/MengerHoward/index.html">Howard Menger</a>, both men claim to have
              talked with men from <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus/index.html">Venus</a>. <a
                  href="/people/m/MengerHoward/index.html">Menger</a> claims that he's even taken a ride on a flying
              saucer. Do you believe them? </p>
            <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : No. </p>
            <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : You think they are hoaxers?</p>
            <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : We do not accept any reports
              of these so called <a href="/people/contactes.html">contactees</a> without more evidence. We've asked them
              to submit their claims and take lie detector tests. We don't throw them out, we simply say <q>We'll give
                you a fair chance</q>. I think that's the least important part of the picture. The most important part
              is the weight of evidence from hundreds of competent people. I'd like to name a few: captain Richard Case,
              American Airlines, captain C. S. Chiles, Eastern Airlines, Captain T. Kravitz, TWA; Robert Dickens, TWA;
              colonel Don J. Blakesly, US Air Force, a wing commander. I could get down a list of people who know what
              they're doing and they're still on duty, they're still flying ... </p>
            <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : Major <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Keyhoe</a>, what would you
              like to see done about flying saucers that is not currently being done? What steps would you like to see
              taken?</p>
            <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : I think the American people
              should write to their congressman and insist that open hearings be held by the Senate Committee... on the
              permanent committee on Government operations, which has been looking into this into 6 months.</p>
            <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : An Air Force spokesman told us this lask week, he said, <q>Members of the
              Senate Subcommittee have talked with us already and they have shown no interest in conducting any hearings
              on this issue</q>. </p>
            <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : I talked with the chief
              investigator within the last two weeks, I gave him a lot of information and I gave him data on one case,
              where an airliner was sent to chase one of these things and the passengers kept in ignorance of this at
              that time. That involves two government agencies, besides the Air Force which has refused to release the
              report. And I'll say this: if you were to get... if the Committee were to get <a
                  href="/people/r/RuppeltEdwardJ/index.html">Ruppelt</a>, major <a
                  href="/people/f/FournetDeweyJ/index.html">Fournet</a>, several colonels, on that time, major-general
              Garland, who was on the project, there would be a big revelation because the Air Force is simply treating
              the american people like children. They don't trust them with the facts. </p>
            <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : You know here is an interesting, I think an interesting question, major. The
              United States and Russia started sending satellites into the sky and we may be hitting the moon with a
              rocket soon, possibly Mars. You believe that creatures from outer space have space stations on Mars?
              What's going to happen when we start firing rockets at the Moon or at Mars? </p>
            <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : That question has already been
              brought up. We except to have a base on the moon within the next five years. It's possible that there is a
              base on there. I don't say that there's any proof of it. I... </p>
            <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : It is possible we're going to start an interplanetary war when we start
              sending our rockets to the Moon and to Mars? </p>
            <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : In <a
                href="../../../../5/index.html">1955</a>, general <a href="/people/m/McArthurDouglas/index.html">Douglas
              MacArthur</a> said the next war would be an interplanetary war and we'd have to unite against people from
              other planets... </p>
            <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : One last question, major <a
                href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Keyhoe</a>: Have you ever seen a flying saucer? </p>
            <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : I've seen and tracked on
              radar, but I take the word of about 800 of the best witnesses in this country and abroad. </p>
            <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : But, you yourself have never seen a flying saucer? </p>
            <p><a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html"><strong>Keyhoe</strong></a> : I've just been a reporter, and
              a careful one. </p>
            <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : Thank you very much, major <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Donald
              Keyhoe</a>. As you've just heard, the flying saucers controversy is deadlocked in contradictory statements
              and interpretation of facts. As for major <a href="/people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Donald Keyhoe</a>
              himself, like most of us, he's never seen a flying saucer, which may just make him like a mystic who's
              never seen a ghost, but one must give him credit, he has much faith. In a moment, I'll bring you a rundown
              on next week's guest, one of the giants of the entertainment business. </p>
            <p>(COMMERCIAL)</p>
            <p><strong>Wallace</strong> : Next week, we go after the story of a giant in show business. You see behind
              me now, he's Oscar Hammerstein II, who's collaborated on some forty musicals including the Rodgers and
              Hammerstein classics "Oklahoma!", "Carousel", "The King and I", and "South Pacific", the last of which is
              soon to be released as a Hollywood film. </p>
            <p>If you're curious to hear Oscar Hammerstein talk about the changing face of show business, about the
              suggestion that his books and lyrics are naive and stickily sentimental. And if you want to hear Oscar
              Hammerstein discuss the controversial social and political beliefs that shape his day's work, we'll go
              after those stories next week. Till then, for Parliament, Mike Wallace, reminding you to help keep the Red
              Cross on the job for us. Give generously. Good night. </p>
