<p>Hi <span class="people" title="Gray Barker">Gray</span>,</p>
<p>Here are the photos of the latest visit Dom and I made to <span class="people" title="Howard Menger">Menger
</span>'s up at Whitehouse, N.J. You can send these on to <span class="people" title="Ray Palmer">Palmer</span>, because
  I have another set for you for the album.</p>
<p>In spurts, this is about the way our visit went. It was July 13th, 1958. (a sunday)</p>
<p>I called Dom up about 1:00 p.m., and asked him if he wanted to go. He said that he would be at my house around 2:30.
  We drove up route 22, until we came to Whitehouse N.J. then stopped in a bar, to ask directions on how to get to <span
      class="people">Menger</span> farm. A group of men started to talk to both of us, about the <span
      class="people">Menger</span>'s, telling us how crazy they both seem to be, will all the talk about space ships,
  etc. One man told us that he just came back from there, as he guided someone, who was just asking the same as we were,
  how to get to the farm. He told us how to get there, explaining that it wasn't too easy, as it was quite out of the
  way. He said, once we found the signs pointing in the direction, it wasn't too hard to find.</p>
<p>We found the first sign, and then followed it for about three miles, to a turn off, as the signs said. We went about
  a mile or so, and saw quite a few cars parked in a field. We parked our car, and walked about a block and a half to
  the house. At the house, there was a stand set up, and the charge to hear <span class="people" title="Howard Menger">Howard</span>
</p> and Connie Menger speak, was $1.50 donation expense charge. <span
    class="people" title="Howard Menger">Howard</span> had set up the speakers, and was talking over a mike, while at
the same time, recording what he was saying. There were about 300 or more people at this meeting, and about 125 cars
parked in the field.</p>
<p>About half of the people were for <span class="people" title="Howard Menger">Howard</span>, and the other half
  against him, as we learned from the questions and answers. <span class="people" title="Howard Menger">Howard</span>
  was speaking about the same he always does, about his trips to the moon, etc. A little later, Connie his wife, spoke,
  and told us that she was really a reincarnated soul of the girl (blond) that <span class="people"
      title="Howard Menger">Howard</span> met, when he was 10 years old. Many people seemed to believe her, and seemed
  for her. A few voices there remarks so everyone could hear, and seemed quite angry over the lies as they called them.
</p>
<p>I spoke to his wife, and she allowed me to talk a few photos of her. She used to be a model at one time, and knew how
  to pose, as you can see by the photos. I asked her, if she could talk <span class="people"
      title="Howard Menger">Howard</span> into making arrangements for me to be on a contact with them, at the next
  meeting. The answer I received was of negative type.</p>
<p>I spoke to <span class="people" title="Howard Menger">Howard</span>, and asked him if he could arrange a meeting with
  me to meet the space men, and also be present when another saucer came around. This also turned out to be negative. It
  seemed to me, that he just didn't know how to answer this question. I told him that I was writing a quite hard story
  about Highbridge, and he said that he was sorry to see I felt like I did. When I told him that I could tone it down,
  he was willing to give me a scoop, with photos, using his space potatoes. He said that he would send them to me within
  a week, as yet I have not received them. I also asked him for some of the photos that he was selling for $8.00 a
  package, but he said that normally he would, but frankly as he put it, I wanted to save them, and use them first for
  my book. This I can see is a very good reason, as I feel I would want to do the same thing, if I was in his place.
  Later he said, he would be glad to give me a set of photos...</p>
<p>A little later on, <span class="people" title="Howard Menger">Howard</span> showed inside the house, the movie of
  what he calls the UFO that appeared on his movie film. The movie was very badly taken, and was taken by <span
      class="people"
      title="Howard Menger">Howard</span> himself. He used the movie camera like he would a paint brush, and it showed
  all over the screen, as the scenes were jumping all over the place, as would happen with a hand-held movie camera,
  held very loosely.</p>
