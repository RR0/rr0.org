<p>"FLYING SAUCERS" REAL, PSYCHOLOGIST JUNG SAYS, headlined the New York Herald Tribune. But famed Swiss Psychologist
  Carl Gustav Jung, 83, long a connoisseur of myths, had said no such thing.</p>
<p>The story came from the A.P.R.O. Bulletin, published by the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization of Alamogordo, N.
  Mex. In its current issue, the Bulletin carried an interview with Jung, whom it described as A.P.R.O.'s consultant in
  psychology. The Bulletin did give the information that the interview was a reprint of an earlier interview that
  appeared in Switzerland's Weltwoche in 1954 (TIME, Oct. 25, 1954). The Bulletin version differs considerably from the
  full Weltwoche one, which may be partially explained by its translation into English for the Flying Saucer Review of
  London, where the Bulletin found it. As a final touch, Gerald S. Clark, assistant public relations director of
  A.P.R.O., edited Dr. Jung's article down to a bare statement of belief in the "reality" of flying saucers, and sent it
  to the Associated Press and United Press International. So Dr. Jung found himself classified as a flying-saucer
  believer.</p>
<p>Psychologist Jung is not. Both in his 1954 article and in a more recent book, A Modern Myth, Jung does not judge or
  attempt to judge the reality or nonreality of UFOs (unidentified flying objects). He thinks that something is being
  seen, including refraction effects, but his interest is in the fantastic, quasi-religious cult that has grown around
  the UFOs. This cult, he thinks, "may be a spontaneous reaction of the subconscious to fear of the apparently insoluble
  political situation in the world that may lead at any moment to catastrophe. At such times eyes turn heavenwards in
  search of help, and miraculous forebodings of a threatening or consoling nature appear from on high."</p>
<p>In ancient times, Dr. Jung explains, the UFOs might be classed as "gods," but the unconscious of modern man has a
  different content. Ancient men saw dragons, other monsters and divine beings in the heavens; modern man sees
  mechanical portents?mysterious spaceships manned by unearthly superhuman creatures.</p>
<p>Stimulated Sightings. Questioned in Switzerland, Dr. Jung was astonished at the misuse of his famous name. While
  investigating the saucer myth, he said, he corresponded with Coral E. Lorenzen, director of A.P.R.O., and
  good-humoredly accepted an honorary membership, but he did not authorize his listing as the Bulletin's consultant in
  psychology.</p>
<p>The flying saucer myth had won a victory nevertheless. Recent publicity has been scarce, and saucer sightings few,
  and the widely printed stories about Jung's belief were just what was needed for another round of "visitors from
  space." When Director Lorenzen was called last week, she did not answer her telephone. She was happily investigating a
  brand-new saucer sighting.</p>
