<p> No theories yet exist which enable a reliable, estimate of the probabilities of </p>
<ol>
  <li> planet formation ; </li>
  <li> origin of life ; </li>
  <li> evolution of societies possessing advanced scientific capabilities. </li>
</ol>
<p>in the absence of such theories, our environment suggests that stars of the main sequence with a lifetime of many
  billions of years can possess planets, that of a small set of such planets two (Earth and very probably Mars) support
  life, that life on one such planet includes a society recently capable of considerable scientific investigation. The
  lifetime of such societies is not known; but it seems unwarranted to deny that among such societies some might
  maintain themselves for times very long compared to the time of human history, perhaps for times comparable with
  geological time. It follows, then, that near some star rather like the Sun there are civilizations with scientific
  interests and with technical possibilities much greater than those now available to us. </p>
<p>To the beings of such a society, our Sun must appear as a likely site for the evolution of a new society. It is
  highly probable that for a long time they will have been expecting the development of science near the Sun. We shall
  assume that long ago they established a channel of communication that would one day become known to us, and that they
  look forward patiently to the answering signals from the Sun which would make known to them that a now society bas
  entered the community of intelligence. What sort of a channel would it be ?</p>
<section>
  <h2>The Optimum Channel</h2>
  <p>Interstellar communication across the galactic plasma without dispersion in direction and flight-time is practical,
    so far as we know, only with electromagnetic waves.</p>
  <p>Since the object of those who operate the source is to find a newly evolved society, we may presume that the
    channel used will be one that places a minimum burden of frequency and angular discrimination on the detector.
    Moreover, the channel must not be highly attenuated in space or in the Earth's atmosphere. Radio frequencies below
    about 1 Mc/s <span class="note">1 Mc/s = 1 megacycle per second = 1 million cycles per second</span>, and all
    frequencies higher than molecular absorption lines near {{30000|number}} Mc./s., up to cosmic-ray gamma energies,
    are suspect of absorption in planetary atmospheres. The bandwidths which seem physically possible in the
    near-visible or gamma-ray domains demand either very great power at the source or very complicated techniques. The
    wide radio band from, say, 1 Mc to 10 Mc/s, remains as the rational choice.</p>
  <p>In the radio region, the source must compete with two backgrounds: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>the emission of its own local star (we assume that the detector's angular resolution is unable to separate
      source from star since the source is likely to lie within a second of arc of its nearby star); </li>
    <li>the galactic emission along the line of sight.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Let us examine the frequency dependence of these backgrounds. A star similar to the quiet Sun would emit a power
    which produces at `n` distance `R` (in metres) a flux of :</p>
  <p>`10^-14f^2`/`R^2` W.m.<sup>-2</sup>(c./n.)<sup>-2</sup></p>
  <p>If this flux is detected by a mirror of diameter `L_d`, the received power is the above flux multiplied by
    `L_d^2`.</p>
  <p>The more or less isotropic part of the galactic background yields a received power equal to :</p>
  <p>`(10^-14.2/f)(lambda/l_d)^2(l_d)^2` W.(c./s.)<sup>-2</sup></p>
  <p>where the first factor arises from the spectrum of the galactic continuum, the second from the angular resolution,
    and the third from the area of the detector. Thus a minimum in sparious background is defined by equating these two
    terms. The minimum lies at :</p>
  <p>`fmin ~~ 10^4(R/l_d)^(c-4)` c./s.</p>
  <p>With `R = 10` light years `= 10^17 m` and `l_d=10^8 m`, `fmin ~~ 10^18` c./s.</p>
  <p>The source is likely to emit in the region of this broad minimum. </p>
  <p>At what frequency shall we look? A long spectrum search for a weak signal of unknown frequency is difficult. But,
    just in the most favoured radio region there lies a unique, objective standard of frequency, which must be known to
    every observer in the universe: the outstanding radio emission line at 1,420 Me./s. (21 centimeter wavelength) of
    neutral hydrogen. It is reasonable to expect that sensitive receivers for this frequency will be made at an early
    stage of the development of radio-astronomy. That would be the expectation of the operators of the assumed source,
    and the present state of terrestrial instruments indeed justifies the expectation. Therefore we think it most
    promising to search in the neighborhood of 1,420 Mc./s. </p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Power Demands of the Source</h2>
  <p>The galactic background around the 21-cm. line amounts to :</p>
  <p>`dPid^2d/(dS dOmega df) ~~ 10^-21.6` W.m.<sup>-2</sup> ster.<sup>-1</sup> (c./s)<sup>-1</sup>
  </p>
  <p>for about two-thirds of the directions in the sky. In the directions near the plane of the galaxy there is a
    background up to forty times higher. It is thus economical to examine first those nearby stars which are in
    directions far from the galactic plane.</p>
  <p>If at the source a mirror is used `l_s` metres in diameter, then the power required for it to generate in our
    detector a signal as large as the galactic background is :</p>
  <p>`(dW_s)/(df) = (dW_b)/(dS dOmega df)(lambda/l_s)^2(lambda/l_d)R^2 = 10^-14.3 R^2/l_s^2l_d^2` W.(c./s.)<sup>-1</sup>
  </p>
  <p>For source and receiver with mirrors like those at Jodrell Bank (`l=80` m.), and for a distance `R ~~ 10` light
    years, the power at the source required is `10^2-2` W.(c./s.)<sup>-1</sup>, which could tax our present technical
    possibilities. However, if the size of the two mirrors is that of the telescope already planned by the U.S. Naval
    Research Laboratory (`l=200` m.), the power needed is a factor of 40 lower, which would fall within even our limited
    capabilities.</p>
  <p>We have assumed that the source is bearing towards all the sun-like stars in its galactic neighbourhood. The
    support of, say, 100 different beams of the kind we have described does not seem an impossible burden on a society
    more advanced than our own. (Upon detecting one signal, even we would quickly establish many search beams.) We can
    then hope to see a beam toward us from any suitable star within some tens of light years. </p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Signal Location and Band-Width</h2>
  <p>In all directions outside the plane of the galaxy the 21-cm. emission line does not emerge from the general
    background. For stars in directions far from the galactic plane search should then be made around that wavelength.
    However, the unknown Doppler shifts which arise from the motion of unseen planets suggest that the observed emission
    might be shifted up or down from the natural co-moving atomic frequency by plus or minus approximately 300
    kilocycles per second (corresponding to velocities of plus or minus 100 kilometers per second). Closer to the
    galactic plane, where the 21-cm. line is strong, the source frequency would presumably move off to the wing of the
    natural line background as observed from the direction of the Sun.</p>
  <p>So far as the duration of the scanning is concerned, the receiver band-width appears to be unimportant. The usual
    radiometer relation for fluctuations in the background applies here, that is :</p>
  <p>`(DeltaR)/B prop sqrt(1/(Deltafd^2tau))`</p>
  <p>where `Deltafd` is the bandwidth of the detector and `tau` the time constant of the post-detection recording
    equipment. On the other hand, the background accepted by the receiver is :</p>
  <p>`B = (dW_b)/(df)Deltaf_d` and `t prop Deltaf_d/(DeltaB)^2`</p>
  <p>If we set `DeltaR` equal to some fixed value, then the search time `T` required to examine the band `P` within
    which we postulated the signal to lie is given by :</p>
  <p>`T = (Ftau)/(Deltaf_d) prop F/(DeltaB)^2`</p>
  <p>independent of receiver band-width `Deltaf_d`.</p>
  <p>Of course, the smaller the band-width chosen, the weaker the signal which can be detected, provided
    `Deltaf_d>=Deltaf_s`. It looks reasonable for a first effort to choose a band-width `Deltaf_d` normal in 21 cm.
    practice, but an integration time v longer than usual. A few settings should cover the frequency range `F` using an
    integration time of minutes to hours.</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Nature of the Signal and Possible Sources</h2>
  <p>No guesswork here is as good as finding the signal. We expect that the signal will be pulse-modulated with a speed
    not very fast or very slow compared to a second, on grounds of band-width and of rotations. A message is likely to
    continue for a time measured in years, since no answer can return in any event for some ten years. It will then
    repeat, from the beginning. Possibly it will contain different types of signals alternating throughout the years.
    For indisputable identification as an artificial signal, one signal might contain, for example, a sequence of small
    prime numbers of pulses, or simple arithmetical sums. </p>
  <p>The first effort should be devoted to examining the closest likely stars. Among the stars within 15 light years,
    seven have luminosity and lifetime similar to those of our Sun. Four of these lie in the directions of low
    background. They are Tau Ceti, 02 Eridani, Eta Eridani, and Eta Indi. All these happen to have southern
    declinations. Three others, Alpha Centauri, 70 Ophiucus and 61 Cygni, lie near the galactic plane and therefore
    stand against higher backgrounds. There are about a hundred stars of the appropriate luminosity among the stars of
    known spectral type within some fifty light years. All main-sequence dwarfs between perhaps GO and K2 with visual
    magnitudes less than about +6 are candidates.</p>
  <p>The reader may seek to consign these speculations wholly to the domain of science-fiction. We submit, rather, that
    the foregoing line of argument demonstrates that the presence of interstellar signals is entirely consistent with
    all we now know, and that if signals are present the means of detecting them is now at hand. Few will deny the
    profound importance, practical and philosophical, which the detection of interstellar communications would have. We
    therefore feel that a discriminating search for signals deserves a considerable effort. The probability of success
    is difficult to estimate; but if we never search the chance of success is zero. </p></section>
