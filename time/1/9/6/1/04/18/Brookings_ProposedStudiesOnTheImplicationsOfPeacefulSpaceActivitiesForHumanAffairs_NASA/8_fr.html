<p><strong>Ce chapitre concerne</strong> les relations interactives de la planification, des besoins, et des
  réalisations des programmes spatiaux avec les politiques et les arrangements organisationnels des nations et corps
  internationaux. Une attention est particulièrement portée sur les implications internationales de l'activité spatiale
  et de ses contrôle, régulation, inspection et opération qui sont d'un aspect plus large que ceux spécifiquement
  pertinents à des événements potentiels tels que les communications globales et les prédications météo discutées dans
  les chapitres antérieurs.

<p>La participation à l'exploration spatiale dans des buts pacifiques pourrait ne pas apporter à une quelconque nation
  ou groupe de nations de nombreux avantages positifs sur des participants tout aussi sérieux, mais chaque nation ou
  groupe améliorerait probablement sa position par rapport aux nations ne pouvant participer ou ne choississant pas de
  le faire. Cependant, la conséquence pour une puissance majeure de participer complètement, légèrement ou pas du tout
  reste toujours largement un sujet de conjecture. Certains observateurs informés pensent que, si les puissances
  majeures décidaient on all out competition dans leurs programmes spatiaux, les effets sociaux, économiques et
  militaires des activités (à côté des effets que le statut opérationnel des missiles intercontinentaux avec têtes
  nucléaires est déjà jugé avoir eu) n'altéreraient pas significativement les relations existantes entre les puissances,
  bien que, selon un observateur, <q>les effets de prestige pourraient en fait se révéler être la conséquence majeure
    des activités spatiales externes dans le système international</q>.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Mais il est également conjecturé que des développements technologiques <q>prévisibles aiguiseront des tensions
    existantes entre les <a href="/org/us/index.html">Etats-Unis</a> et l'Union Soviétique et fourniront des sources
    fructueuses à de nouvelles... Il est certain que l'exploitation competitive de l'espace ouvre une nouvelle arène
    pour la conduite d'une guerre froide, limitée et même non froide.</q></li>
  <li>Les conclusions de la recherche qui seront suggérées ici pourraient contribuer à une compréhension de la manière
    dont l'impact du programme spatial pacifique d'une nation peut être analysé.
  </li>
  <li>Les études sont principalement liées, cependant, aux opportunités d'avancées positives dans la politique des <q><a
      href="/org/us/index.html">Etats-Unis</a></q> pour arriver à un monde pacifique sur le plan de la sécurité à
    travers de nouvelles formes de coopération international ou une opération unilatérale dans le domaine spatial. Bien
    qu'il soit possible que l'activité spatiale puisse éventuellement être totalement internationalisée, il est supposé
    ici que dans le premier cas les <q><a href="/org/us/index.html">Etats-Unis</a></q> auront un programme spatial
    majeure qui sera substantiellement opéré et financé domestiquement et auquel ne pourrait se comparer en taille et
    variété que le programme soviétique et éventuellement 1 des 2 autres (les implications d'un programme exclusivement
    internationalisé ou supranationalisé demanderaient des études similaires à celles suggérées ici, en ce qu'ils
    devraient être conçues pour augmenter la compréhension de la manière dont les activités spatiales pourraient
    contribuer à une politique mondiale pacifique).

<h2><a id="a"></a>La politique spatiale et sa mise en oeuvre</h2>
<p>The guidelines for space policy as laid down in 1958 by national and international groups implied these outstanding
  stipulations-.
</p>
<ol>
  <li> that outer space be used for nonmilitary purposes only,</li>
  <li> that outer space should especially be used for genuine scientific exploration,</li>
  <li>that the contributions of both domestic and foreign nongovernmental organizations to space activities should be
    encouraged, and
  </li>
  <li> that international organizations and other forms of international cooperation should play a major role in the use
    of outer space. 4/ For a variety of reasons, these four stipulations have not been fully heeded since 1958. The
    military interest in missiles was already well established at that time and has not yet been the subject of serious
    arms control negotiation. 5-/ It has extended to some specific satellite systems and to an unspecifiable number of
    basic experiments employing rockets and satellites. The organization and implementation of the United States
    space<br> program now emphasizes a duality NASA and its rocket and satellite<br> activities are dedicated to a
    policy of "openness" and essentially peaceful<br> endeavor, whereas the experiments and satellite systems of the
    Department<br> of Defense are kept secret -- to the extent that this is possible or militarily<br> desirable and are
    intended to serve military purposes. 6/ The inherent<br> difficulty of maintaining this duality in the international
    context is reflected<br> in the occasional interpretations of scientific and technical feats as<br> demonstrations
    of military prowess and of military testing and operations as<br> innocent scientific inquiries. Scientific space
    exploration has been to some<br> extent mixed with activities of two other types: those that primarily have<br>
    military applications, and those that primarily are propaganda efforts<br> designed to maintain a popular image of
    our national stature as impressive<br> and forward looking.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>7/ The opportunities for private initiative which existed during the IGY and<br> which some competent observers
  regarded as an essential contribution to the<br> distinctive success of the IGY and the organization of its early
  satellite and<br> rocket programs are either no longer present to the same extent or are kept<br> within stricter
  bounds by the interests of both national and international<br> governmental agencies. Prior to the creation of NASA,
  the scientific aspects of<br> our earth satellite programs were the responsibility of the U.S. National<br> Committee
  for the IGY, operating under the nongovernmental National<br> Academy of Sciences. 8/ NASA now has the responsibility
  for satellite and<br> rocket programs , and the Space Science Board of the National Academy<br> makes recommendations
  to NASA and otherwise acts in an important<br> advisory capacity to operating agencies. There has thus been some shift

  toward governmental responsibility is supplemented by a further<br> trend toward national and bilateral activities-as
  compared with the use of<br> international organizations or multilateral mechanisms of international<br> cooperation,
  The ad hoc committee which the United Nations established to<br> consider the peaceful uses of space concluded that
  the United Nations should<br> not play an active role in space operations. An early suggestion that the<br> United
  States might launch complete scientific payloads that would be<br> recommended by the Committee for Space Research
  (COSPAR) of the<br> International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) appears to have been<br> neglected in favor of
  bilateral arrangements, about which COSPAR is kept<br> informed and its advice and comment sought. 9/ The plans of the<br>
  International Astronautical Federation to establish an Academy of<br> Astronautics and an Institute of Space Law have
  had no cooperation from<br> Soviet and certain other participants, who stated that existing
  international<br> arrangements in the space field were adequate. 10/<br> It was the hope of many who were involved in
  the IGY and the early stages of<br> our space program that important nongovernmental and international<br> groups
  would play a significant part in furthering the United States' policy of<br> espousing the peaceful and scientific use
  of space. That the hope has not been<br> fulfilled to any large degree is undoubtedly owing in part to the sizable<br>
  physical and economic requirements of many space activities and the rapid<br> incorporation of space strategy into
  military strategy (compared to the rate of<br> its incorporation into nonmilitary planning) as well as to the
  mutual<br> suspicions of the United States and the Soviet Union. However, it is<br> increasingly clear that the
  original publicly stated guidelines for space policy<br> were incapable of being maintained undiluted -- because
  detailed knowledge<br> of how to maintain them was lacking. 11/ Good intentions alone cannot meet the challenges
  inherent in this complex<br> field. They must be supported by a detailed working knowledge of the bearing<br> of
  international affairs on the design and operation of experiments,<br> equipment, and organization concerned with
  technical matters; on the<br> drafting and negotiation of enforceable agreements about technical subjects;<br> and on
  the accurate and timely assessment of social and material impacts of<br> scientific and technological developments.
  The technological and social<br> complexity of these problems will also require the systematic application of<br> the
  findings of intensive research in the behavioral sciences, such as<br> anthropology, social psychology, and sociology.<br>
  One of the science advisers to the President has stated the need for general<br> research in respect to the whole of
  science in relation to foreign affairs:<br> "Essential to these efforts is the development of an academic field of
  teaching<br> THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION - Final Report<br> "Proposed Studies on the Implications of Peaceful Space

  to<br> provide education in and better understanding of the underlying significance<br> and opportunities of this
  relationship." 12/<br> Research on Potential International Aspects of Space Technology and Science<br> Sharing of
  costs<br> The equipment systems for a space program involve missiles, sounding<br> rockets, earth satellites, deep
  space probes, and ground-based resources such as<br> tracking, communications, launching, and recovery facilities,
  telescopes, and<br> centers for data reduction and analysis. The cost of such systems is so large<br> that few nations
  can support a major program, and at present only the United<br> States and the Soviet Union do so, although there has
  been discussion of a<br> multinational European program. 13/ The vast resources required for the<br> United States'
  effort -- and those even more vast foreseen for the future -have<br> prompted suggestions that world-wide cooperation
  be sought. 14/ How the<br> costs might be shared, however, or what the consequences might be for the<br> control of
  policies and program has not been made clear. The economic costs<br> of any space program must ultimately be
  translated in terms of allocating<br> specialized and therefore fairly limited materials and manpower. Thus,<br>
  supplementary background research is desirable to determine:<br> [-148]<br>
  &bull; What are the size and nature of sharable costs of individual facilities<br> or pieces of hardware and of
  separate units of world wide networks<br> associated with space activities. (Relevant estimates of the technical<br>
  feasibility of having separate nations provide components for each<br> system might be assisted by the experience of
  NASA and the<br> Department of Defense with the system of prime contractors and<br> subcontractors.) This general
  inquiry would provide one basis for<br> assessing the significance of such sharing arrangements as those<br> among
  NATO powers and the possibility that the domestic savings<br> could be used effectively for other purposes. 15/ **<br>
  &bull; Which nations are potential suppliers of personnel talents, special<br> pieces of hardware, and the more
  routine "housekeeping" needs of a<br> large enterprise. This inquiry could provide a basis for estimating the<br>
  extent to which the U.S. program might be shared and also the<br> viability of possible regional programs in Europe
  and Asia. 16/<br>
  &bull; Who would be the potential beneficiaries from the benefits gained by<br> sharing costs. (From an international
  point of view, the potential<br> users of specific direct and indirect products of a space program may<br> well be
  more limited than the universe of potential specific<br> contributors.)<br> THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION - Final

  examples of intranational payment arrangements are furnished by the<br> hourly rental use by NASA of the Jodrell Bank
  radio telescope in England and<br> related-equipment and the purchase by various European nations of the Asp<br> and
  similar U.S. sounding rockets. 17/ The experience of American scientists,<br> government agencies, and businesses in
  hiring foreign personnel to carry on<br> technical investigations or to process data in their own countries could also
  be<br> informative. It would be appropriate to study:<br>
  &bull; Existing arrangements for international payments for space science or<br> related activities and the indicated
  opportunities for further<br> specifying the costs and returns of international space activities on an<br> economic
  basis.<br> The technical operations on which various nations cooperated during the<br> IGY included many of special
  pertinence to space programs, among them the<br> provision of satellite tracking devices and launching of sounding
  rockets. The<br> total experience -- including the economic benefits that may have resulted<br> directly from the
  space technology and activities of the IGY -- in this<br> multinational cost sharing should provide useful insights
  into some of the<br> problems of a shared space program. 18/ It would be appropriate to study:<br> [-149]<br>
  &bull; The costs and benefits of various IGY programs, and, in the light of<br> those, the ability of different
  nations and their scientific groups to<br> support such work on a continuing basis.<br> The imaginations of the
  engineers and scientists involved in space programs<br> have demonstrated their capacity to strain the human resources
  and purse<br> strings of even the mightiest nations. The enormous scale of the human and<br> economic activities thus
  created has produced major administrative problems<br> and a pressing need to establish mechanisms for coordinated and
  cooperative<br> efforts. It is obvious that the international factors inherent in space operations<br> magnify such
  problems; for example, the increase of science activities on an<br> international scale prompted the inclusion of an
  arbitration clause for the<br> first time in the charter of ICSU special committee. 19/ The problems<br> involved in
  sharing equipment and operations with friendly nations, let<br> alone with suspicious political competitors, and in
  estimating the ultimate<br> benefits and cost of such sharing cannot be efficiently defined or solved on an<br> ad hoc
  basis. Very carefully designed studies are necessary to determine:<br>
  &bull; The economic, managerial, legal, and political aspects of specific<br> (albeit hypothetical), economically
  motivated proposals for booster,<br> data center, or tracking station sharing by, for instance, NATO nations<br> ' or
  other groups of nations, or the United States and the Soviet. 20/<br> At the present time the United States is
  providing financial support in one<br> form or another for a very large portion of the free world's space program.<br>
  (The consequences of this for the United States are not entirely clear at<br> THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION - Final Report<br>

  apparently include the development of a unilateral space<br> policy on our part and -- possibly -- a reluctance to
  give financial support to<br> some other scientific or nonscientific projects which might also further our<br>
  international objectives.) There are a variety of ways in which support is<br> given to foreign space enterprises. For
  example, certain U.S. facilities abroad<br> provide for local participation and free use of equipment when it is
  not<br> otherwise needed. We also, as noted earlier, contract for the use by the hour<br> of an existing laboratory
  installation.<br> [-150]<br> To some extent the potentialities for new space discoveries by scientists in<br> foreign
  laboratories thus depend on the breadth of the mandate of funding<br> agencies such as NASA, the National Science
  Foundation, and the<br> Department of Defense. Other consequences of the situation are not known,<br> but should be
  known. Research is necessary to determine:<br>
  &bull; The various ways in which financial support is now given to foreign<br> space enterprises and possible means of
  broadening the range of<br> available methods. The similarities and differences between the<br> various domestic and
  foreign approaches to financing research<br> should be examined. (A domestic equivalent of this same problem is<br>
  the manner in which government agencies support academic and<br> industrial research and development work. 21/)<br>
  &bull; The ways in which foreign currencies resulting from the sale of U.S.<br> surplus foods abroad, special tax
  provisions, other mechanisms for<br> encouraging public or private expenditures and investments abroad<br> might aid
  international cooperation on our space program. 22/<br>
  &bull; The influence U.S. economic support in its various forms can have<br> on the character, quality, and quantity
  of scientific and technical work<br> done abroad.<br> Although the direct cost of supporting leading space scientists
  and engineers<br> and their intellectual exchanges of ideas and information is small compared<br> with the over-all
  cost of a space program, the implications of such support in<br> respect to the international aspects of a space
  program should not be<br> overlooked. Scientists in every country are, for instance, dependent on<br> modest but
  nevertheless tangible financial support merely to keep<br> themselves and others informed of the current state of
  knowledge. It has been<br> suggested by responsible persons that the rules of COSPAR and its parent<br> organization,
  ICSU, governing the expenses for staff and travel might limit<br> the usefulness of COSPAR as a representative body
  which can maintain and<br> encourage interest in space research. 23/<br> Relevant knowledge and understanding of the

  [-151]<br>
  &bull; The International Atomic Energy Agency and the mariner in which<br> economic arrangements have influenced its

  &bull; The administration and financing of the European Center for<br> Nuclear Research (CERN). The Center has been

  &bull; The arrangement whereby the federal government participated in the<br> United States IGY program with especial
  attention to the satellite and<br> rocket program as designed and carried out by the National Academy<br> of Sciences.
  This arrangement deserves special study because of the<br> novelty of this mechanism on the American scene, the
  approval<br> which it appears to have had among a considerable number of<br> scientists, and the direct bearing of the
  program on our subsequent<br> space policies and programs.<br>
  &bull; The proposals for public or private financial support of the activities<br> of the World Meteorological

  need suggests many opportunities for cooperation. NASA<br> operates -- alone or jointly -- a number of overseas

  Although the tasks to be performed in such positions are quite<br> clearly defined, there appear to be considerable
  room for resourcefulness -- for<br> instance, where research stations may have opportunities for independent<br> space
  research. 28/<br> A space program imposes unusual demands for close coordination between<br> scientists and engineers
  and the developments of "teams" of participants. It<br> may also demand the -retraining of individuals and the
  introduction of new<br> and exotic skills. In the international context these demands pose additional<br> problems.
  Possible frictional divisions of labor exist between basic design<br> work, the preparation of necessary hardware

  manpower resources, few individuals and groups here or<br> abroad will be able to make a balanced contribution
  covering all functions, it<br> would be desirable to study the significant political and social factors having<br> to
  do with the allocation of controls and responsibility and with the<br> distribution of benefits and prestige
  associated with the final product.<br> [-152]<br> Professional scientists, engineers, and other specially interested
  persons may<br> participate in the United States' program directly rather than as<br> representatives of the interests
  of other countries or of international<br> organizations. Such participants could be of varying advantage or<br>
  disadvantage for the program. It is possible that they would have differing<br> ideas about the relationship of a
  space program to other competing<br> endeavors. They may have conflicting national loyalties; be looked upon with<br>
  special respect or suspicion by their countrymen; embarrass efforts at secrecy<br> whether or not
  they are privy to secrets, since a well-trained mind can<br> sometimes produce or analyze technical capabilities
  without benefit of<br> confidential knowledge. Differing estimates of suitable proportions of<br> emphasis within or
  between space sciences and space technologies could be a<br> source of disagreement between professionals hailing from
  variously<br> oriented regions. Such disagreements could easily lead to international<br> friction and hence weakening
  of our international posture.<br> If participation of skilled individuals from different regions of the world<br>
  becomes, as would seem likely, a prerequisite for a comprehensive space<br> program or is desirable also for major
  policy reasons, research will be<br> necessary concerning:<br>
  &bull; The problem of standardizing terminology, procedures, and training.<br>
  &bull; Incentives for special training, working conditions, and personal<br> economic security appropriate to
  different societies. In this context<br> special attention should be given to the tendency of some persons or<br>
  groups contributing skills to exploit secrecy or gain priority rights<br> over scientific data; ways to counteract
  this should be sought if the<br> interests of science and the program could better be served by more<br> complete
  sharing of data and skills.<br>
  &bull; Appropriate means for instituting world-wide inventories of<br> technical talents and for measuring interests
  as they might bear on a<br> space program. Such a study might build upon general investigations<br> already under way
  of scientific and technical resources and needs.<br> [-153]<br> The complex and costly supporting apparatus for most
  space science activity<br> makes it particularly important that persons who might provide key ideas be<br> THE

  adequate knowledge of how to develop, use, and coordinate<br> many different talents in many different countries. 31/
  One useful approach<br> to this problem would be to study:<br>
  &bull; Instances of collaborative international and supranational scientific<br> undertakings, including comparative
  studies of: foreign trainee and<br> research programs as developed by universities, the AEC, and the<br> Defense
  Department; the operation of CERN; and various technical<br> aid projects of the IGY program, including such
  situations as the<br> integration of foreign scientists at IGY stations in the Antarctic that<br> illustrate working
  relations between local and foreign-trained<br> personnel.<br> The activities of COSPAR and the IAF contribute on the
  international level<br> to the recruitment and training of persons with skills needed for space<br> programs. These
  organizations and perhaps others which may come to<br> surpass them in importance need to be studied to determine:<br>
  &bull; The opportunities that are offered by organizations with inter<br> national scientific and engineering
  interests for the recruitment and<br> training of scientists, and the political, economic or social factors that<br>
  might facilitate or hinder these opportunities.<br> Since the end of World War II individuals from many parts of the
  world<br> have come to the United States for training in nuclear physics and<br> engineering, in relation to atomic
  energy programs. it has been pointed out by<br> informed persons that these trainees have not always been able to use
  their<br> new and very specialized talents effectively on returning to their native<br> countries, and that this
  sometimes results in personal and official frustrations<br> which can have serious consequences for the training
  programs and the<br> enlargement of the specific technologies involved. In regard to NASA's offer<br> to support
  foreign scientists on fellowships for training in space technology, it<br> would be desirable, then, to examine the
  possible parallel in relation to the<br> danger of over specialization. Much basic information could be gained<br>
  through study of:<br> [-154]<br>

  for<br> developing such skills in countries where persons having them are scarce or<br> nonexistent are worth
  exploring. However, consideration should be given to<br> the following questions. In the light of the specific values
  and ambitions of<br> such countries, will training personnel in the skills pertinent to space<br> THE BROOKINGS

  participation in space-related activities provide means also of other<br> training and participation that would be
  useful to these countries for reaching<br> their own goals (e.g., operating hydroelectric installations)? Research
  is<br> desirable to:<br>
  &bull; Provide means for classifying United States space projects in terms of<br> the contributions they might make to
  the economic or other<br> development of specific nation- 32/<br>
  &bull; Design and use means for measuring long-run and short-run benefits<br> which a nation might derive from the
  exploitation of its various<br> capabilities in the sciences and technology.<br>
  &bull; Determine the cost and benefits to the United States of encouraging<br> the participation of other nations by
  training technologists for them<br> in space activities.<br> The use of technological by-products abroad<br> The
  discussion in Chapter 5 of the possible by-products of the space program<br> included several that might have use
  abroad. One special form of b@ product<br> which may have particularly important international implications is the<br>
  equipment that has been outmoded by the rapid technological advances<br> during the developmental phases of various
  space projects.<br> The innovations needed in some regions of the world may differ radically in<br> kinds and degree
  from those needed in others. A technological device that<br> has been rendered obsolescent for the needs of a
  demanding development<br> program by the program's own rapid pace may very well meet a pressing need<br> in another
  setting. The high degree of automation, miniaturization, and high<br> reliability that is necessary in space
  technology suggests, for instance, that<br> "surplus" devices with these characteristics might have special usefulness
  in<br> regions where, due to present lack of technical knowledge, maintenance<br> services are rudimentary. Thus it
  would be appropriate to examine:<br> [-155]<br>
  &bull; Prospects and problems in the distribution and peaceful use of<br> surplus space equipment in technically
  "backward" parts of the world.<br>
  &bull; Possible ways of identifying in advance specific surpluses of usable<br> and adaptable first, second, and

  could create a viable "foreign<br> market." 33/<br>

  and their effects on space operations as and national<br> prerogatives<br> A country's location may lend it special
  importance with respect to one or<br> another aspect of a space project. For example, to put satellites into
  special<br> orbits -- such as equatorial or polar -- some locations are more advantageous<br> for launchings than
  others. 34/ Tracking and recovery requirements for<br> various operations necessitate cooperation from nations whose
  sites and<br> terrainal features make them important to these tasks. Rocket soundings of<br> the atmosphere may also
  put a premium on the use of certain sites.<br> National efforts to be independent of international cooperation and<br>
  coordination in relation to these considerations may not only add to the<br> expense of a program, but also restrict
  it in various ways. The technological<br> feasibility of some programs could depend on multinational cooperation.
  35/<br> And of course the extent of cooperation will affect both the opportunities for<br> involvement of scientists
  and engineers from different countries and the<br> kinds of scientific work undertaken in a given project. 36/<br>
  Because each geographical location is typically under the control of only one<br> nation if it is not part of the high
  seas, important international aspects are<br> thus built into many space projects. These may possibly be anticipated

<h2>The Status of Space Programs in International Affairs</h2>
<p>Within the foreign affairs context, a space program accelerates the blurring of the well-developed administrative and
  diplomatic distinctions between private and official activities and between military and peaceful activities. In the
  United States the distinction between the private and official activities of any citizen has been an important one,
  but it may now have to be reinterpreted as the space program is developed and executed as an integral part of U.S.
  foreign policy.
</p>
<p>Traditionally the private aspects of a scientist's work have been emphasized, but as scientific research increasingly
  requires more cooperative effort and financial support and produces information of obvious and direct national
  importance it takes on public and even official aspects. There is a question of both the manner and extent to which
  scientists here and abroad have been<q>instructed</q>" in the interests of their countries and the extent to which
  governments have preserved domains set aside for the exercise of private and unofficial initiative on scientific and
  technological matters having international implications. These intangibles need to be identified and studied.
</p>
<p>Many international rules and regulations are based on clear distinctions between military and peaceful activities and
  equipment. 42/ The components of a full space program are not, however, inherently amenable to simple classification
  on this basis, as the following comment of a former leading scientific adviser to the government indicates: <q>I find
    it just as difficult to differentiate between military and nonmilitary science as I do between national and foreign
    policy in this contracting universe. The electronicnuclear, micro-organic-astronautical age in which we live is only
    a military age if we choose to apply these scientific areas to military activities and becomes a peaceful age if we
    create peaceful applications for these scientific developments."</q> 43/
</p>
<p>There are many potential international ramifications of this lack of clear separation of military and nonmilitary
  aspects of space exploitation, some of which pose problems while others offer opportunities. Overtly peaceful
  explorations of space may conceal military preparations or else serve as demonstrations of potential military might,
  whether or not this is intended; 44/ some military space activities may possess considerable inherent technical and
  scientific interest and receive assistance and approval on that basis. However, nations may have an increasing
  interest in demonstrating, with the aid of objective standards, the exclusively peaceful nature of particular space
  projects. 45/ If we plan to make major efforts to convince ourselves and the world of the distinction between our
  peaceful and military activities in space, it is desirable to understand the attitudes toward these two types of space
  activity held by those in other nations. 46/
</p>
<p>Popular and leadership attitudes in other countries toward United States reconnaissance satellites and toward
  statements concerning the orbiting of weapons merit careful. evaluation. Although no definitive data have been
  collected on the matter, there is evidence of a widespread feeling that satellites can fall out of orbit, reach the
  ground, and do great damage. This feeling would not be eased by the realization that orbited weapons would be designed
  to return to earth in fully operative "combat" condition. Persistent research on and testing of military space systems
  may generate an attitude of hostility toward all space activities, no matter how much their scientific nature was
  proclaimed. There has been speculation that some nations will encourage the development of observation satellites,
  since their existence could reduce the incentive for surprise attack and therefore for preemptive nuclear warfare.
  Nevertheless, the same nations might well resent careful surveying of their own sovereign activities,
</p>
<p>Claims of the legitimacy and peaceful value of navigation, communication, and weather satellites may be questioned,
  since the value of these to military operations is also obvious; the claims may be especially jeopardized it civilian
  and military users share satellites and ground facilities. It would seem to be most Important to insure that
  activities undertaken in the process of developing precision. satellites of all sorts and in planning for the
  international cooperation that will be necessary to their maintenance and use are not construed by world publics and
  their leaders as threats-in-disguise against security and sovereignty.
</p>
<p>On these various matters, research is appropriate to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Ascertain now and over time the extent to which pertinent publics and persons in nations (including Eastern Bloc)
    subscribe to and believe in our distinction between military and peaceful. space activities,
  </li>
  <li> Determine what characteristics of our space activities, under what circumstances, are perceived by them as within
    their definition of military or peaceful, and which are held to be ambiguous.
  </li>
  <li> Determine what effects specific military space activities can be expected to have on foreign inclinations to be
    supportive of scientific and peaceful space activities.
  </li>
  <li> Develop means for anticipating difficulties in this area and over coming them. if possible by adequate advanced
    explanations and plans for inspection and control arrangements in which the international community is encouraged to
    participate,
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Although technological advances have injected many complexities into the wide range of foreign policy concerns of the
  United States, it is reasonable to assume that ad hoc solutions are not necessary (and might be harmful) and that
  optimum solutions can be arrived at. It seems certain, however, that the solutions will not be found without careful
  study directly concerned with international affairs and involving technical details of space programs.
</p>
<h3>International cooperation on organization and control</h3>
<p>One pillar of United States foreign policy has been the support and encouragement of international cooperation and
  the control of aggression and armaments through the development of world-wide and regional international agreements
  and rule making, law enforcement, or operating organizations. An increasing number of expensive international
  scientific enterprises, including the IGY, the Antarctic and oceanic programs, and CERN, are being justified in part
  by their contributions to peaceful constructive cooperation. A space program might make unique contributions to this
  policy (1) because of the global nature of many of its activities, (2) because of world-wide interest in the
  exploration and exploitation of outer space even though only two nations now have major space programs, and (3)
  because of the most significant new role being played by private or quasiprivate international and transnational
  scientific organizations.
</p>
<p>Realistic emphasis upon the uses of outer space to further peaceful ends necessitates the recognition that the
  potential military and other aggressive uses of space may have to be actively controlled, by peaceful space means.
  Radio frequency interference, for instance, and the development and use of anti-satellite missiles can be forms of
  aggression in space, although they have little to do with direct military threats. On the other hand, satellite
  systems may contribute to arms control by helping to survey nuclear explosions in outer space or even those near the
  earth's surface. @7/
</p>
<p> Past experience with the development of international negotiations and organizations concerned with technical
  matters indicates that identification of the exact need and opportunity for control mechanisms of this sort requires
  considerable original study and accumulation of new knowledge. It has been suggested, for instance, that "long before
  any agreement becomes possible on regulating or eliminating the use of outer space for military purposes, a design for
  the management of this region, under the auspices of the United Nations, could be set before world opinion, with the
  psychological and ideological benefits inevitably redounding thereto. 48/ It has also been asserted that "lawyers can
  contribute significantly to the solution of legal problems arising from known and predictable contingencies; they
  cannot sensibly recommend in detail rules to deal with contingencies wholly or largely unknown and beyond human
  experience. A viable Law of Space must be based on the facts of space." 49/ On this matter there is much to be learned
  which would provide a needed background for interpreting more specific studies. Such a study would be concerned with:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> The circumstances under which international rules (1) anticipate or (2) wait upon technical developments and the
    accumulation of<br> experience in respect to space matters.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Control over the undesirable uses of outer space would in any case have to be focused on known uses, likely kinds of
  uses, and effective use capability. There may be significant analogies for the space field in the arguments for and
  against international provisions for limiting or increasing membership in the "nuclear club.'' Of particular relevance
  would be studies of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> The expected capabilities of major powers for the exploitation of outer space and the political implications of
    an increased number of "space powers. 11/
  </li>
  <li> The kinds of activities that might be prohibited or subjected to international control or approval, and means for
    estimating the advantages and disadvantages to nations resulting therefrom.
  </li>
  <li> The existing or proposed international legal rules covering space activities, and the existing or proposed
    international machineries for continued promulgation or revision of rules. 50/
  </li>
  <li> The ways in which the more technically oriented international organizations, including some of the specialized
    agencies of the UN, might be concerned with the development or management of various continuing space operations.
    51-/
  </li>
  <li> New types of International and supranational organizations which might be created and the special problems which
    they may face as a<br> result- of the technical, functions to be performed and the sizable budgets involved.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Control of non-space activities with the aid of space projects and the use of space programs for relieving world
  tensions and creating spheres of confidence may well require the kind of careful planning associated with control over
  undesirable uses of space. The difference between the two types of controls may be the greater need for inventiveness
  in the development of the latter, and advances in this area may depend on encouraging the study of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Familiar causes of international tensions which may be attenuated by the use of space technology or the findings
    of space science.
  </li>
  <li> The design requirements for space systems that are intended to demonstrate or otherwise prove their peaceful
    purpose. Such a study might explore the possible forms of inspection or multi-group control over facilities,
    equipment, personnel, operations, and results.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Among areas of revolutionary technical achievement, interest in space activities probably rivaled in some parts of
  the world only by interest in atomic energy matters. Neither of these areas is now immune to disparagement, however,
  and other areas of scientific and technological development may come to rival them in capturing the attention of
  nations. Official national interest in them may well shift from time to time and may or may not parallel the interests
  of scientific communities.
</p>
<p>In the context of human affairs, scientific activity is a means as much as an end in itself. It is not obvious that
  all nations are equally agreed on the importance of space science and it is not impossible that preoccupation with it
  by international science organizations or through other channels of foreign policy may alienate those who do not agree
  with this emphasis. 52/
</p>
<p>To better understand the usefulness of a space program in this context it is appropriate to conduct research on:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The development of means for assessing the importance for nations of exploring and exploiting space as compared
    with the promotion of alternative technical development. 53/
  </li>
  <li> The means by which interests in international cooperation can be reconciled with the concern of the sciences and
    of engineerlng for objective standards and uncompromised achievement. 54/
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Whether or not scientific activities attempt to divorce themselves entirely from international politics, economics,
  law, and public opinion, under present conditions they do have international implications beyond the nature I science
  disciplines. International science organizations provide one means for fostering scientific activity or for
  restricting the spread of space capabilities. The lack of distinctions between private and official activities of
  scientists and between peaceful and military science activities in the context of a space program have suggested in
  the minds of some science statesmen a net increase of opportunities for complementary activities by a variety of
  official and quasi-private international organizations and rule making institutions and hence a greater choice of
  instruments for implementing the policy of national cooperation Further understanding of any such unique contributions
  by a space program, or its planners and implementors, to the promotion of international cooperation could be aided by
  a study of:
</p>
<p>&bull; The distinctive, complementary, or competing space roles played by existing international groups including the
  United Nations,<br> UNESCO, COSPAR, and IAF, and others in existence or proposed.**
</p>
<h3>Relations with allies, adversaries, and neutral nations</h3>
<p>A nonmilitary space program might contribute to the objectives of (1)strengthening bonds with our allies, (2) gaining
  the respect, Confidence, and friendship of the governments and lead in groups of selected neutral nations, and (3)
  achieving direct advantages against hostile powers by nonviolent means, The general foreign policy objective of
  helping certain nations to help themselves might also be furthered.
</p>
<p>To developing nations, programs of aid may be more important than spectacular space events of no direct consequence
  for them. 55-/ Major space exercises conducted by a rich and powerful nation may be resented it is believed that the
  nation is at the same time skimping on the resources it allocates to the developing countries. on the other hand,
  participation in certain space activities of perceived value to such countries could enhance their self-images and/or
  their international prestige.
</p>
<p>We must certainly ask whether or not those space activities which we believe offer many benefits and opportunities
  are perceived as doing so by persons in other countries. For example, the potential advantages of weather and
  communication satellites to the developing areas of the world appear to be substantial, yet there are many large
  problems and potential embarrassments also involved for the national leadership in these areas. As was suggested in
  the chapters on weather and communication satellites, programs of indoctrination and information will be needed well
  before the time of realization of a specific activity. These programs might assist materially in developing attitudes
  and institutions compatible with the benefits to be derived from the activity. 26/ It is recommended, then, that
  specific studies be<br> undertaken to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Determine what activities need to be begun and routines established in various parts of the world to prepare
    regions and nations to take advantage -- with a minimum of undesirable consequences -- of the uses of space
    products.
  </li>
  <li> Develop means for instructing appropriate publics on the significance of contemplated space activities or
    on-going events to help them<br> understand and use the socially important ideas and ideals implicit in particular
    products of space activities.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It has been argued, pro and con, that American prestige in the eyes of the rest of the world depends on the success
  of our space program, and particularly on matching or exceeding the Russian program. 57/ An assessment of the data
  available from public opinion polls overseas does not provide the basis for deciding to what extent our present and
  future prestige is indeed a function of our space effort. 58/ Nor is what is meant by prestige at all clear. Do we
  want people to like us, to emulate us, to send their students to our schools, to buy their heavy equipment and
  instruments from us, to feel we would win a war if a showdown came, or to turn their back on offers and blandishments
  from the Communist bloc? "Prestige" means many things and on the specific interpretation rests part of the basis for
  assessing the possible implications of space activities for enhancing that desired characteristic. 59/
</p>
<p>A foreigner's notions of how a country ought to behave vis-a-vis a country which has "prestige" may not coincide with
  our ideas of how it should behave, and the reasons why specific nationals regard us as a nation with or without
  prestige may not coincide with the reasons we think they should have for so regarding us. French reasons and responses
  may be quite different from British, Congolese, German, etc. Thus the role of space activities in forwarding our
  national image can only be clearly delineated after decisions are made about which aspects of prestige we wish to
  enhance, in what parts of the world, for what purposes. If the direction and effort of our space activities are to be
  partially a function of their prestige-generating consequences -- or at least are not supposed to adversely affect
  behavior and attitudes toward us -- it is necessary to conduct studies to learn:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> In various countries how do particular types of space activity influence specific people and institutions
    involved in the governmental decision making process? 60/ What other factors enter into the decision making process
    which may vitiate or amplify the contribution of particular space activities to our benefit or detriment?**
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Because a space program, unlike many other programs in science and technology, includes a great many rather dramatic
  planned events, an unusual opportunity exists for understanding the consequences of these events for intergovernmental
  relations by comparing international<br> conditions before and after the events. For this reason there is need for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Retrospective and prospective studies of the measurable beneficial and adverse effects, for United States and
    Soviet influence on other<br> nations, of particular space events.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the matter of prestige, it would appear that there are qualitative as well as quantitative aspects to
  competition with Russia in the space area. Such factors as secrecy vs. publicity, feasible space programs, effective
  internal competitors for funds, relations with scientists in other nations, and access to other nations' territory may
  variously provide certain advantages or disadvantages to one side or the other. Without a serious research effort
  which considers the technical details of possible space projects, as well as their inherent merits, it is unlikely
  that the United States can understand, take full advantage of, or guard against the built-in imbalances or differences
  in U.S.- USSR postures. 61/
</p>
<p>Specific studies contributing to this understanding and the development of<br> possible opportunities include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> A systematic and comprehensive identification of significant political, legal, and other social, as well. as
    technical, differences in the<br> postures of the United States and the Soviet Union as they may affect the
    international implementation and effectiveness of possible space projects. Such a study should include historical
    and theoretical analyses of the concept of political parity between the Soviet Union and the United States, which
    appears to have particular significance in international programs for the peaceful uses of space.**
  </li>
  <li> An analysis of the geographic differences in the positions of the United States and the Soviet Union which may
    affect particular space projects. In this connection consideration might be given to the technical, and
    corresponding political or other social significance if any, of physical characteristics such as the equatorial
    belt; the poles of rotation; pairs of magnetic conjugate points; the relation of various land masses to the seas in
    terms of launching, landing, or surface station network requirements; and the general movement of weather from west
    to east or of daylight from east to west.
  </li>
</ul>
