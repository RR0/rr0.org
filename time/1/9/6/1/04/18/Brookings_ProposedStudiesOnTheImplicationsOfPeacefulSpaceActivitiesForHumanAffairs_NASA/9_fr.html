<p><strong>L'acceptation ou le rejet</strong> d'innovations technologiques par une société est rarement uniquement une
  question d'évaluation rationelle. Un mélange de valeurs personnelles et définies culturellement, en tant que concepts
  de ce qui est worth while, souhaitable, bon, et éthiquement bien, joue un rôle majeur et souvent dominant dans la
  génération des attitudes qui déterminent en partie le destin d'une innovation <span class="note">["...dans toute situation humaine, no matter how filled with quantitative data it
may be, sont toujours présentes de puisses considérations humaines qui sont incommensurables. Ces incommensurables -- a tangle of memories,
prejudices, emotional needs, aspirations, common decencies -- exert a
tremendous and probably always a determining influence upon the real,
as opposed to the exposed, nature of a situation. Any wise decision in
such a situation must take into account not only the data from which
logical conclusions about present upgrading efficiencies can be drawn, but
that other data which leads to the non-logical understanding of what
human beings are, need, and want to be." See Elting Morison, "The
Pertinence of the Past" (paper delivered at Executive Development
Convocation, Spring 1959, School of Industrial Management,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology)].</span> Les attitudes individuelles sont de plus conditionnées par la capacité
  d'une personne à comprendre l'utilisation de l'innovation et sa pertinence par rapport aux événements et aux gens dans
  le contexte de la société dans laquelle il vit.</p>
<p>D'un autre côté, l'impact de la <a href="../../../../../../../../analyse/Science.html">science</a> et la technologie
  a toujours le potentiel de changer ou renforcer les attitudes et valeurs fondamentales à la direction et au contenu
  des modes de vie <span class="note">[."it is commonplace to speak of attitudes and values as if there was clear
understanding and agreement on what was the referent of discourse.
Close analysis of points of view seldom reveals a warranty for this
assumption."This is, however, not the place for a lengthy excursion into the latest
points of view in psychology and sociology on these concepts. A word or
two of elaboration may nevertheless clarify the intent of later passages
and sections of this chapter. "Only in the crudest sense are attitudes and values preferred positions on
a scale from strongly 'for' to strongly 'against' some stated position or
state of affairs. Essentially, attitudes and values refer to a variously
organized body of knowledge (facts and fancies) involving recollections,
present experiences and future expectations, this knowledge itself
including evaluative categories and judgments. Thus, attitudes similar in
the degree of endorsement or opposition to a position may be highly
dissimilar in their content and structure. "Part of the content of any attitude or value is one's own self and one's
associations which both validate and interpret one's position and
perspective. Thus, attitudes and values are peculiarly a product of where
one stands in society, where one has been, and where one is going. Thus,
a sharp shift in one's social or physical environment, one's knowledge,
or one's expectations about the future, inevitably has an impact on one's
attitudes and values."The content of knowledge about space is probably very sparse and
unorganized (as is public knowledge about nuclear energy or foreign
policy) and largely seen as irrelevant to one's self and one's associates. To
the extent that developments or a lack of developments in space alter the
body of knowledge, shift notions about relevance, and alter the
viewpoints of one's associates, to that extent one can assume that there
will be a shift in pertinent attitudes and values." (Correspondence with
Stephen B. Withey, Director, Public Affairs Studies, Survey Research
Center, University of Michigan)]</span>. Therefore, if the consequences of space activities for living patterns are to
  be understood, so that they may be anticipated and planned for, it is desirable to know as much as possible about the
  intimate circularity of the relationship between attitudes and values and the processes of social change. Fortunately,
  one of the important implications of space efforts in this regard is the extraordinary opportunity they offer for
  studying these processes of change -- before, during, and after their occurrence <span class="note">["What we think as individuals and as communities, and all the patterns
of our behavior, make sense in a traditional context. They are relevant to
the traditionally established circumstances in which we live. As these
circumstances change, our thinking and behavior have to change too.
The concepts, the attitudes, and the manners of old generations have to
give way to new concepts, new attitudes, and new manners in the
generations that succeed them. But tradition can change only slowly and
painfully. Consequently, even in societies that are evolving at a leisurely
pace there is likely to be some lag between the actual circumstances of the
environment and the traditions that supposedly respond to them. What
threatens when the pace is stepped up, however, is moral and intellectual
chaos." See Louis J. Halle, "The Natural History of Man's Emergence into
Space," International Political Implications of Activities in Outer Space ,

<p>The discussions of problem areas in earlier chapters have of course included to some extent the role of specific
  values in relation to the implications of a specific problem. However, attitudes and values themselves constitute a
  problem area, since one of the major products of the space effort has been a variety of stated opinions about the
  present and future impact of space activities on them. The extent to which these opinions are personal expressions of
  an assumed "fact&rdquo; and the extent to which they are based on empirical data needs to be known, so that their
  validity as a basis for policy can be assessed <span class="note">["Despite many years of discussion and many pages of writing, the actual
tole of public opinion in the making of ... policy decisions, in the United
States or elsewhere, is something of an enigma. To talk to some policy
makers is to come away with the impression that public opinion is a
highly volatile force, omnipresent, unpredictable, a combination of
shifting searchlights within which the policy maker must function, and
which constitutes a basic limitation on what he can do. On the other
hand, there are both poll data and frequent observations which suggest
that the policy maker is largely free to do what he wishes, and will do
what he wishes, regardless of what those outside of government think or
want .... This is one of the more obscure areas of political analysis ....
Behind various statements about the role of public opinion work the
implicit theories and intuitive calculations of public officials. So far as we
know, these have not been described adequately or analyzed by scholars."
Richard C. Snyder and James A. Robinson , National and International
Decision Making (document prepared for the Institute for International
Order, to be published early in 1961), pp. 102-103 of the draft copy.]</span>. Such assessment is always important to
  the workings of a democratic society in which policies are, ideally if not always in fact, the result of an
  interacting relationship between policy planners, decision makers, and the people, who may be either hostile or
  supportive to the plans and decisions. By the same token, assessment would appear to be especially important in regard
  to space activities, which, if present plans and accomplishment hopes materialize, will unavoidably have global
  consequences for human affairs.</p>
<p>Yet exact empirical data are few, both about opinions on attitudes and about the interworkings of attitudes with the
  events of social change. Since the space effort may well be a most radical instrument for social change, it is
  appropriate that agencies charged with its conduct should assist in pursuing research that may enlarge the still
  slender store of knowledge in this problem area.</p>
<h2><a id="a"></a>Implications des activités spatiales pour les objectifs nationaux et le monde de demain</h2>
<p>Many of the knowledgeable persons who were interviewed during the preparation of this report -- or whose statements
  made elsewhere were read -- expressed deep concern and often strong opinions regarding the proper role of space
  activities in a democracy and in the world into which we are moving. The substance of their concern included both the
  special and complex problems that space activities may pose and the changes already under way in traditional values --
  changes in part related to the recent history of high rates of technological change and the pressures for social
  adjustment produced by innovation <span class="note">[See Clyde Kluckhohn, "Have There Been Discernible Shifts in American
Values During the Past Generation?" in Elting Morison, ed., The
American Style , Harper (1958), especially P. 181]</span>. That the present speculations -- and often firm convictions
  -- of these serious students of space and society demonstrated a variety of conclusions about the role of space in
  relation to society suggests that research would be helpful to clarify the assumptions associated with the arguments
  to be discussed here.</p>
<h3>The role of space in the world ahead of us</h3>
<p>Many observers of the present scene believe that eventually the cold war of weapons must either become hot or be
  replaced by economic warfare between East and West. Given the latter alternative, some of the observers argue that the
  vast expenditures consequent on the rivalry in social and economic development would probably seriously reduce
  resources and ambitions for space activities, aside from an occasional scientific probe, because positive humanitarian
  results of earth-based challenges could be realized relatively quickly and without the interim frustrations that are
  at present characteristic of complicated space developments. It is assumed that, in an all-out competition between
  East and West for economic dominance, the East would probably place its major propaganda investments in devices less
  remote than space projects, and thereby reduce the incentive for all-out space activities in the United States to the
  point where the program would be simply a useful technological adjunct to certain areas of scientific research.
  Others, however, assert that, despite the demands made on resources and creativity by all-out economic warfare and the
  associated rivalry to improve the standards of living in underdeveloped areas, the United States and Russia would
  continue to place major emphasis on their space programs as outstanding devices for scoring propaganda victories and
  for demonstrating the relative technological and scientific prowess of the two ideologies.</p>
<p>Some informed students of the matter are unshakeable in their belief that the search for knowledge in space will
  encourage a large program to support and supplement the search and to make use of its findings, although they
  acknowledge that at present there is no good reason to believe that the government and the "public&rdquo; are prepared
  to pursue space-derived knowledge, primarily for its own sake, at the level of resource and financial investment
  presently going into these activities.</p>
<p>Another point of view contends that space activities will continue because they a-re a form of circus not only for
  the man on the street but for his leadership, providing a sense of escape from the profound frustrations and
  complexities of life on earth <span class="note">["But we are also going to have to deal with the dangers of mass insanity
or mass imbecility, dangers that we may not recognize even in their
realization. Anything we can do, therefore ' to keep wisdom alive will be
to the good. Perhaps we should set aside some schools and some
universities for the development of 'generalists,' a few men with broad
philosophical minds and a command of general knowledge who can
survey the whole human scene in which the mindless operatives swarm,
who can speak for direction and ultimate purpose, who can preserve the
heritage of humanity through the period of transition. Perhaps we
should build a few ivory towers against the day when we are able again to
resume, whether on earth or in outer space, that progress which, rather
than identifying us with the bees, distinguishes us from them." See Louis
J. Halle, "The Natural History of Man's Emergence into Space,"
International Political Implications of Activities in Outer Space , P. 208.

Extraordinary Popular Delusons and the Madness of Crowds , Ceorge C.
Harrap (1956)]</span>.</p>
<p>A good-many people are convinced that internationalizing space is the only way to insure its utilization for peaceful
  activities and to meet the eventual magnitude of the cost and effort it involves. Some of those who hold this opinion
  feel that great new opportunities would be open to an internationalized program and new creative resources brought to
  bear; they point to such an international research effort as CERN, the European nuclear accelerator project. Others
  feel that it would eliminate what they consider to be the chief basis for space activities -- East-West competition --
  and without such competition, there would be little or no pressure for expending resources at the level held necessary
  for future large-scale space projects. In other words, if it no longer mattered who "gets there first,&rdquo; the
  incentive for getting there at all would be radically reduced.</p>
<h3>The relation of space strategy to national strategy and needs</h3>
<p>With regard to our needs as a nation, two general problems are posed. First, what is the appropriate priority for
  space activities? In view of the always increasing demands on manpower and money for routine national needs and of the
  many social and technological areas in which manpower and money might be expended to produce other important results
  for mankind, to what extent are we justified in spending vast sums on space activities? <span class="note">[The concerns expressed with regard to the role of space in society today
and tomorrow generally have, as a background, an appreciation in one
form or another of the complications, both political and social, which face
us as a nation and as a world in the years ahead. While there is some
difference of opinion as to the priority and intensity of these
complications, there is apparently general agreement that they are of the
sort described in such books as: Robert L. Heilbroner , The Future as
History , Harper (1960); John Kenneth Galbraith, The Affluent Society ,
Houghton Mifflin (1958); and Walt Whitman Rostow, The United States
in the World Arena , Harper (1960). Generally speaking, these
complications arise from the growing demands in the years immediately
ahead for enlargement of public services at home as well as in the world
abroad. In addition, there is a feeling that the interests of the people at
home as well as of those abroad will not be such as to find space central to
their aspirations, preoccupation, or demands; all-out efforts in the space
area may not be viewed sympathetically and therefore may not have the
kind of support necessary for their realization,
Abroad as well as here, the proper allocation of efforts for space activities
are matters of concern. A New York Times article, March 21, 1959, p. 2
("Two Scientists Question Value of Space and Missile Program"), quoted
Dr. A. R. J. Crosch, then manager of space programs for the International
Business Machine Corporation, as saying: "@e isn't any point in zooming
off into outer space. We could spend the money better solving problems
here at home -- taking care of our overcrowded, underfed millions. If we
did that, we wouldn't need to find new worlds to colonize." Dr. Louis
Ridenour, then Assistant General Manager of Research and
Development in the Missile Systems Division of the Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation, was quoted thus: "We turn in our cars before they are worn
out and our nation would go broke if we didn't. Our missile program fits
into the system very well, we send up missiles that never come back and
so we have to make more missiles."
The London Economist , Vol. 195 (April 30, 1960), pp. 396-397, stated: "In
one week, the 'important' industrial questions offered to the public may
be whether Britain should cast away money with satellites into space,
develop a Channel Tunnel that nobody suggests would pay as a private
commercial enterprise, or go in with France to find the public money to
develop a supersonic airliner. It is usual to answer this by saying that
Britain is a very rich society now; that its citizens have now enough
income to make investment in space circuses as sensible a choice as the
purchase of motor cars which are nice to polish but too dangerous
actually to drive on the roads; and that vast incidental benefits to civil
industry flow irresistibly from these ventures that must always be pushed
just beyond the extremes of dry-as-dust profitability. Is it? Are they? It is
unnecessary to adduce the usual arguments about benefits that could be
gained by applying such resources to medical research, or in assistance to
underdeveloped countries. More selfishly: the houses outside which the
parked cars spawn are a generally inconvenient, often smaller than one's
grandfathers occupied, and aesthetically revolting,"
According to a Reuters' dispatch ( New York Times , June 11, 1960), Pravda
published a letter (entitled "Isn't- it too early to play with the moon?")
from a citizen who wrote in part, "Damn the moon and serve up better
food." See also Fred Hoyle, "The Case Against a British Space
Programme,&rdquo; The New Scientist , Vol. 8 (August 11, 1960), pp. 394-395, and"For and Against a British Space Programme," The New Scientist, Vol. 8
(August 18, 1960), pp. 446-448.]</span>.</p>
<p>Few suggest that they know the answer, and many argue that research on the problem of priority assignment itself
  deserves the highest priority, from the standpoint of the utility of the advancement of science for mankind <span
      class="note">[See, for example, Wallace R. Brode, "Development of a Science Policy,"
Science , Vol. 131 (Jan. 1, 1960), pp. 9-15. Consider also the following
statement by George B. Kistiakowsky, speaking as moderator of the
Harvard Law Schoolls outer Space Symposium, held in early 1960-. "I'd
like to emphasize that I am not in outer space; I am firmly on the ground
-- place down south; but even so I find myself completely unable to
disassociate myself from being involved at least by implication in outer
space. On two separate days I had two Nobel Prize winners come to my
office. The first one of them said, 'George, you are selling basic science
down the river in order to support outer space activities. It is shameful
for a scientist to do so.' Three days later the other sat in the same chair
and said, 'George, you are sabotaging our outer space program. You ought
to be run out of Washington."' See Harvard Alumni Bulletin , Vol. 62
(May 7, 1960), p. 597."True strength and lasting prestige will come from the richness, variety,
and depth of a nation's total program.... We should insist on a space
program that is in balance with our other vital endeavors in science and
technology and that does not rob them because they are currently less
spectacular. In the long run we can weaken our science and technology
and lower our international prestige by frantically indulging in
unnecessary competition and prestige-motivated projects." See James R.
Killian, Jr., "Making Science a Vital Force in Foreign Policy" (a paper
delivered to the Dallas Council on World Affairs, Dallas, Texas, Sept. 23,
1960)]</span>. Even among the scientists in the space community -- who might seem to have the most to gain from space
  activities -- there is some concern as to whether an"all-out space effort&rdquo; is in the best interests of science
  and the nation. While this concern is related in part to the anticipated costs of space activities, there is also a
  feeling that continued excessive attention to space may blind the policy makers to the compelling needs and
  opportunities in other physical and social sciences. 4/</p>
<p>The second problem involves the proper integration and articulation of the space effort's role with other national
  goals. If international competition is a major reason for space activities, it is argued that they should be much more
  closely coordinated with other national policies: if, for example, we insist that our space program is for peaceful
  purposes, every effort must be made to insure that this image is not embarrassed.</p>
<p> Each of the arguments and concerns discussed above has a number of important implications. As a whole they suggest
  that, if the space effort has potentials for benefiting mankind under various broad sets of circumstances, the
  potentials and circumstances need to be explicated in the interest of better planning of space activities in concert
  with other worth while and expensive public service activities. This is especially important in a nation such as the
  United States, where policy is sensitive to the attitudes of the various publics. For some of the questions posed,
  systematic study can perhaps at the most indicate that opinions on a subject are, in fact, only opinions; thus space
  projects based on them should be undertaken with the full understanding that neither history nor psychology guarantees
  the outcome prophesied, no matter how high the source of the opinions. Background research useful for such an
  evaluation would determine:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The general nature of the diffusion of new ideas and artifacts through society and the reasons why an idea will
    be accepted, forwarded, and incorporated by some groups under some circumstances and rejected by others.</li>
</ul>
<p>An especially worthy aspect of this problem entails such questions as, these: What factors historically have entered
  into support or rejection of new ideas or technologies? What was and wasn't appreciated about the potentialities or
  lack of them in the innovation and under what personal and social circumstances did this occur? (For example, what
  were the roles of factors such as physical environment, politics, personalities, limited systems analysis
  capabilities, insufficient communications to decision makers, and national goals?) In what ways are previous
  innovations and the social context in which they developed or were rejected comparable with present space innovations
  and their social contexts?**</p>
<p>In addition, systematic examination of the arguments summarized above should be undertaken to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Set out the conditions under which specific lines of argument would seem reasonably valid and those under which
    they are not likely to pertain.</li>
</ul>
<p> The broad problems posed imply that research is also necessary to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Attempt to develop systematic methods for assigning priorities between competing scientific and social efforts
    (where competition may be long term and involve personnel., money, public sup port, and conflicting attitudes and
    values).**</li>
</ul>
<p>Examine the nature of decision making needed at appropriate levels to develop methods for coordinating space policy
  and national. policy for the benefit of both (See Chapter 8 for more detailed research recommendations on this
  problem).</p>
<h2><a id="b"></a>Publics spéciaux</h2>
<p>In estimating public attitudes, it is necessary to take into account the possibly differing values of various
  specific groups in the society <span class="note">[See Clyde and Florence R. Kluckhohn, "American Culture: Generalized
Orientations and Class Patterns" (paper presented at the seventh meeting
of the Conference on Science,'Philosophy, and Religion in Their Relation
to the Democratic Way of Life, held at the international House of the
University of Chicago on September 9, 10, and 11, 1946); published in
Lyman Bryson, Louis Finkelstein, and Robert Morrison MacIver, eds.,
Conflicts of Power in Modern Culture , Harper (1947)]</span>. The emphases and perspectives of the "military,&rdquo; for
  instance, tend to differ from those of the "scientists&rdquo; and the "politicians,&rdquo; which in turn differ from
  each other. Not all values held by a group are unique to it, and within a group are subgroups and individuals whose
  attitudes differ in some degree from the general position; nevertheless, there is likely to be sufficient cohesiveness
  that identifies the group as a group. Thus it is reasonable to expect that space activities differently affect and are
  differently affected by such "special publics" <span class="note">["There may be occasional limiting conditions under which mass
communications may produce a unanimous effect. There are also times
in which the 'deviant cases' may be so few as not to be of practical
importance. The more important the issue, however, the less likely is the
effect to approach unanimity, because of the public's stronger interest in
and knowledge of the problem. Therefore, the present status of
communication research indicates that any study of the impact of the
mass media must be one of the demography of effect -- the relative
distribution of effects throughout the population. The major job of
charting the appropriate population parameters remains to be done." See
Raymond A. Bauer and Alice H. Bauer, "American Society and the Mass
Media of Communication" (to be published in the Journal of Social Issues
early in 1961), P. II-9 of dittoed copy. Data indicating differential public
responses to space activities can be found in: Donald N. Michael, "Man in
Space: What SR's Readers Think About It," Saturday Review , Vol. 42
(April 4, 1959), pp. 60-63, and Donald N. Michael, "Sputniks and Public
Opinion: The Myth of 'Impact," Air Force Magazine/Space Digest , Vol. 43
(June 1960), pp. 72-75; and in Raymond A. Bauer, "Executives Probe
Space," Harvard Business Review , Vol. 38 (September-October 1960), pp.
6-15]</span>. There is also evidence that both the leadership which makes decisions and that which influences decisions
  tend at times to separate specific groups from the "general public&rdquo; and act as if certain values and attitudes
  were associated with them <span class="note">[Detailed studies of congressional susceptibility to imposing values and
attitudes on population groups are found in Lewis A. Dexter, "Congressmen
and the People They Listen Tot' (dittoed), Communications

<p>To the extent that planning and policies for space activities or their implications actually consider the attitudes
  of special publics, informal estimates of the constitution of such groups and of their opinions should be supplemented
  by research intended:</p>
<ul>
  <li> To discover the role of space activities within the context of the functions and goals which are the
    distinguishing characteristics of specific groups, and to learn the significance of the group attitude toward space
    activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The special publics discussed below are among those presently believed to<br> have special significance for various
  aspects of the space program.</p>
<h3>La communauté spatiale</h3>
<p>As might be expected, many of the scientists and engineers associated with government and private space activities
  are enthusiastic about them. There are others, however, whose disillusionment and cynicism have impressed observers;
  personally and professionally preoccupied with their work, they nevertheless feel alienated from the world they are
  creating -- because they believe it will be used "as politicians and promoters see fit,&rdquo; whether or not the use
  is appropriate to what they believe to be its significance <span class="note">[The following personal reactions to elements in the manipulation of the
space program have been variously noted by the scientists and engineers
involved, as seeming to them to contribute to the resentment and
disillusion : What they felt to be the disproportionate amount of publicity and
spectacular promotion given to space activity efforts, "by self-seeking
politicians or entrepreneurs who want to use space to advance their
own interests." These interests are believed to have little to do with
the professed interest in space exploration.
2. They felt that many of the statements made about the future of
general space activities and specific space projects are based on
ignorance -- sometimes willful -- of the facts, in particular, the
ignorance of the tremendous difficulties involved in bringing even
the simplest space activity to fruition.
3. They despaired -- given government funding methods -- of receiving
the systematic long-range financial support necessary to bring to
fruition within a reasonable time many of the projects which they
feel can be accomplished, given such support.
4. They had sensed ambiguity in the relationship between NASA and
the military services which seems to them to belie the "pious
protests" of a civilian space program separate from the military
program. The compromises and conflicts are seen as frustrating to
both the military and the civilian effort.
5. The scientists in particular sensed pressure on them not to fail,
whereas the traditional role of the scientist includes honorable failure
in the quest for knowledge. Given the pressures of corporate profits,
publicity, and national status, however, failure is not easily
acceptable; moreover, exciting ideas ate sometimes not explored
because
6. The disillusioned individuals usually admit that they are geared to
respect a world which is based on their types of goals and their
methods for reaching them, and that it is practically a professional
tradition to dislike and distrust those whom they perceive as
manipulating situations for the sake of expediency]</span>.</p>
<p>No systematic study has been made of such factors, but the frequency with which the 'subject has occurred in informal
  conversations between observers and members of the space community indicates that negative attitudes are not rare. it
  should be known how widespread such attitudes may be, at what levels of decision making and creativity they occur most
  often, and what other factors may be involved. It should also be learned to what extent these attitudes might be known
  to or shared by students planning careers in space fields; if they were found to be prevalent yet not deterring, this
  might indicate that the new recruits for space activities have a different set of values than those typical of the
  engineers and scientists heretofore involved.</p>
<p>The more intensely reacting members of the present engineering and scientific personnel, perhaps including some of
  the more imaginative, might very well. leave the field for other more satisfying areas; already there is evidence in
  many areas of science of the arrival of the "gentleman scientist" <span class="note">["The individual is having a harder and harder time finding a place for
himself in science; and, though this is rationalized as an inevitable
development that comes with the growth of science and its practice by
groups, many recognize that this emphasis on smooth working
relationships in happy laboratories may be changing the notion of
knowledge at any price to knowledge as it is convenient and comfortable
for the scientist." See Bernice T. Biduson, "The Changing Self-Images of
the Research Scientist" (paper presented at the American Psychological
Association Meetings, September 1959, Cincinnati, Ohio)]</span>. Whether or not the loss of these dissatisfied personnel
  or the influx of changed values with new personnel would change the quality of space activities needs careful study
  <span class="note">["We do not yet understand the creativity of groups well enough to say
that quantity (number of groups, amount Olf support, structured
competition, i.e., all organizationally manipulated) cannot approximate
the results of quality (individual talent plus professional motivation).
Perhaps the space effort does lose something immediate if the 'best'
people choose to pursue different interests, or even the same interests in
a different way. While it is true that the disenchantment and cynicism of
scientists may affect recruitment and creativity on an individual basis,
this may not be true on an organizational level, and may have desirable
consequences for the 'balance of power' relationships among elite groups
in the society." (Correspondence with Dr. Herbert E. Krugrnan, Director of
Market Research, Raymond Loewy Associates)]</span>. </p>
<p>Many studies show that people filling particular roles have different ideas of their roles and the roles of others
  than do people filling other roles <span class="note">[For a related discussion see Chapter 6, section on the role of the science
adviser. Also see Robert K. Merton, "Bureaucratic Structure and
Personality," Social Theory and Social Structure , Free Press (1949), pp. 151-160; Harry C. TriAndis, "Differential Perception of Certain Jobs and People
by Managers, Clerks, and Workers in Industry," Journal of Applied
Psychology , Vol. 43 (August 1959), pp. 221-225]</span>. Thus there is every reason to believe that, among other
  pertinent space community people, as well as outsiders, there is ignorance of or confusion about the attitude
  situation described here; similarly there is every reason to believe that the dissatisfied scientists and engineers
  within the community are not fully aware of the purposes and roles of those they disparage, So long as the situation
  is left formally unexamined and not brought to the attention of all concerned it will be difficult for all individuals
  and groups involved to base their actions and understanding on valid-assessments of the attitudes and values of each
  other. It appears worth while then to conduct studies to determine:</p>

  <li> The nature and extent of positive and negative attitudes and values among members of the space science and
    engineering community over the application of their efforts. To what extent are similar attitudes conveyed to or
    already incipient among potential. space activity candidates and what kinds of influence do they have on
    recruitment? (This type of study should be repeated every few years.)</li>
  <li> What is the relationship between specific aspirations and motivations on the one hand and job satisfaction or
    dissatisfaction on the other? Is there a relationship between satisfaction or dissatisfaction and quality of
    creativity, as well as the rate of personnel turnover?</li>
  <li> In the light of the above, if alterations in perspective are appropriate for those in the space community who are
    dissatisfied and/or for those who act in ways presently contributing to this dissatisfaction, what means can be
    discovered to encourage insights, understanding, and changed perspectives?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Astronautes présents et futurs</h3>
<p>The attitudes of the men now training as astronauts in the Mercury program and their perception of the attitudes held
  toward them and their efforts will have important implications for their training, their ultimate performance
  capabilities, and thereby for the selection and training of future astronauts. (The public's reactions to "man in
  space&rdquo; are discussed later in this chapter.) Further information is much needed on the relation of attitudes and
  values to aspirations and fulfillment of performance requirements in this very special situation. The kind of
  understanding that would be derived from studying the values and attitudes of the first group of astronauts over time
  as they move through and beyond the Mercury program will also be of use to future astronaut programs. Thus it is
  important to study:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The attitudes of the astronauts toward themselves, each other, their families, other space community associates,
    former associates, and the world at large and changes in these attitudes, and the values on which they are based,
    over time and in the face of particular events in connection with space activities both nationally and
    internationally.</li>
  <li> The attitudes of their families and associates toward the astronauts' efforts, and the effects of time and events
    on these.</li>
  <li> The attitudes believed by the astronauts to be held by various publics about them, their families, a@ their
    mission.</li>
  <li> The interrelationship of the above as they affect astronaut performance and motivation through time and in the
    face of specific<br> events.</li>
  <li> Historical parallels (if they exist) of the "hero's&rdquo; perception of his role and the effects of this
    perception on his behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h3>La communauté scientifique non spatiale</h3>
<p>Conversations with natural and social scientists and science administrators indicate a range of reactions to space
  activities: some scientists are delighted with them as tools for and areas of research, some are indifferent, some are
  hostile. Future space activities will be partly dependent on scientists in universities and other institutions for
  ideas as well as for the kind of supporting approval that will encourage competent men to contribute to the space
  effort <span class="note">[Richard L. Meier and others have pointed out that all successful
machine" science projects very quickly use up available
require for their efficient operation national and, eventually,
international participation both for research ideas and data
the past, this phenomenon has been observed in connection
accelerators, computer facilities, radio telescopes, etc. It is
the same situation will arise with space research, especially
capacity increases into the thousands of pounds range]</span>. It will thus be important to discover how to use most
  effectively the existing enthusiasms among non-space scientists, but there appears to be an even more pressing need to
  discover and assess the reasons for the expressed indifference and hostility <span class="note">[Various factors that were suggested by members of the non-space science
community as accounting for unfavorable or indifferent attitudes are
listed below. The relative importance assigned to them varied.
1. Some dislike the flamboyant public relations and propaganda
associated with space activities. (E.g., Dr. Joseph Kaplan, as quoted by
Dick Turpin in "Space Probes Need Publicity," Los Angeles Times,
March 7, 1960, has said: "As a scientist, I am chagrined to have to face
the realization that propaganda is as important as it is today in world
politics." See also James S. Hanrahan,&rdquo; Negative Reactions to the Age
of Space"--especially, pp. 4-7-- American Rocket Society publication
1191-60. And in the words of the present administrator of NASA:"There seems to be a contest going on in this country in which
substantial numbers of people are attempting to outdo each other in
predicting exotic accomplishments in space in the next few years. In
my opinion, there is need for more common sense and good<br>
technical judgment to be injected into this picture.&rdquo; From an address
by Dr. T. Keith Glennan to the 4th USAF-BMD Symposium on
Missiles and Space Technology, Los Angeles, Aug. 24, 1959.)
2. Some dislike affiliation with the military -- and regardless of what
may be said by NASA and the White House, they feel space is chiefly
a military activity.
3. Many are committed to research funded through sources which
would not permit a shift in their programs to relate them to space
activities. Moreover, those with good and continuing support and
those hoping to get such support from their present sponsors have no
motivation to abandon their commitments.
4. Many for whose work space probes might be useful in one way or
another prefer to depend instead on techniques more familiar to
them.
5. Some have not lost the feeling that space activity is science fiction
and therefore not a proper area of attention for a serious scientist
with a serious research program.
6. Planning and launching a research package for a space probe usually
takes a long time, perhaps years, and because of the small supply of
rockets and the demand for them there is no assurance of when, if
ever, it will get off the ground. Some scientists are not prepared to
risk their careers in an activity with coordinating elements so far out
of their control.
7. Some resent the amount of money expended on space activities, a
fraction of which, they feel, would accomplish much more if it were
put into their own earth-based activities.
8. Some feel that space activities should be planned in close
coordination with pertinent earth-bound activities; until this is done
they doubt that the first interest of space is truly science.
9. Some are repelled by the big business-big money approach. While
generally they know that some scientific activities do require large
amounts of money, the promotional efforts that seem to be
considered necessary to insure the money are incompatible with their
image of science and the way research should be conducted.
10. Some resent what they believe to be willful confusion of science with
engineering. They insist that rocket design and rocket launchings are engineering and that calling them science degrades science]</span>.
</p>
<p>At present, it is not clear how extensively these attitudes are held and under what personal and operating
  circumstances they predominate. Nor is it clear what could be done to make space activities more compatible with the
  values and attitudes of those reluctant to participate in them -or whether efforts should be made to reduce this
  reluctance to participate in space until the nature and extent of the reluctance, and thereby its significance, are
  better understood. Thus, it is most desirable that studies be undertaken to determine:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The nature and extent of positive and negative attitudes and values In the non-space science community toward
    space activities. (This<br> kind of study should be repeated every few years.)</li>
  <li> The nature and extent of participation desired now and in the foreseeable future from the type of scientist and
    student who presently 1.9 reluctant to participate.</li>
  <li> How, in the light of the above, to increase, when appropriate, the compatibility of interests of those
    preoccupied with space activities<br> and the rest of the science community.</li>
  <li> How to bring to the attention of nonhostile and potentially enthusiastic social and natural scientists the unique
    opportunities for applied and theoretical research offered by space activities</li>
</ul>
<p>(The last recommendation refers to that important implication of space activities noted earlier in this chapter --
  the opportunity they afford social. scientists for research on the effects of spectacular yet continuing events on the
  attitudes. values, and behavior of members of various societies -- both before the events and after them <span
      class="note">[See Donald N. Michael, "Man-into-Space: A Tool and Program for
Researching the Social Sciences," American Psychologist , Vol. 12 (June
1957), pp. 324-328</span>]. The fact that space events can be anticipated by informed personnel before they become known
  to the general public enhances possibilities for (1) the sort of controlled experiments usually not available to the
  historian or social scientist, (2) base line studies, and (3) judging value and attitude changes in the light of the
  base line studies and the larger context of events. There is an excellent chance that theoretical insights into the
  processes of social change can thus be increased substantially. Since such insights would be invaluable for
  anticipating the implications of space activities for mankind, it would be desirable for the NASA social science
  research facility to bring these special opportunities for fundamental and applied research on social change to the
  attention of the social science community as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Business executives</h3>
<p>The attitudes of business executives as influenced by space activities may well have important implications for the
  direction and intensity of space activities and, to some extent, for business philosophy and practice. Information
  about these attitudes and the values underlying them is found in a survey directed by Raymond A. Bauer of the Harvard
  Graduate School of Business Administration for the Harvard Business Review <span class="note">[Raymond A. Bauer, "Executives Probe Space," Harvard Business Review,
Vol. 38 (September-October 1960), pp. 6-15]</span>. The study is also valuable for showing where further research is
  necessary in this area. (Only a brief summary of the findings is provided here, but a detailed report on the survey,
  its findings, and the recommended research is given in Appendix A (to be found at the end of the Footnote Volume).</p>
<p>According to the survey, the impact of recent technological advances appears to have made executives extremely
  reluctant to conclude that anything is impossible, and they questioned only the most speculative of the possible
  benefits from space exploration. The majority felt that projects such as longrange weather forecasting, improved
  communications, and tangible byproducts of research were very likely to "pay off. However, the responses gave very
  little indication of either the significance or stability of attitudes, and since the approving support evinced could
  have been based on generalized impressions rather than specific knowledge, it might wither if project results were
  slow in coming. Older executives, particularly, seemed less caught up by the romance and adventure of space and more
  reluctant to spend money on space programs.</p>
<p>The respondents were able to distinguish between civilian and military space objectives, but did not do as well in
  specifying which existing programs were civilian and which military. What distinctions were made probably did not
  reflect detailed knowledge of the actual differences between the two objectives, for not many of even the most
  enthusiastic executives were completely informed on this subject.</p>
<p>Five possible reasons for or advantages of supporting the space program were ranked in this order-. (1) pure science
  research and gaining of knowledge; (2) control of outer space for military and political reasons; (3) tangible
  economic payoff and research results for everyday life on earth; (4) meeting the challenge and adventure of new
  horizons; (5) winning the prestige race with the Soviet Union. However, there did not seem to be a clear distinction
  in the minds of the respondents between "pure science&rdquo; and "control of outer space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considerable willingness was indicated to grant the civilian space program more funds than the amount it was assumed
  to be already getting. A preponderant majority of the executives gave space research priority over a cut in taxes,
  though expenditures for health and education took precedence over space expenditures. Many thought that the program
  needed to be stepped up and, in general, that more could be done with the resources already committed. It was evident
  that respondents hoped that private industry would have a role in the space program, but many of the comments about
  this were more wistful than confident.</p>
<p>The generally favorable attitude revealed toward a civilian, rather than a military, space effort needs additional
  scrutiny. Is the attitude based on an evaluation of the relative potency or efficiency of the two programs, or does it
  indicate a preference for nonmilitary space research? The optimism about space activities also needs examination. Is
  it the product of an unbounded faith in science, of past experience with R&amp;D payoffs, or what? Will practical R&amp;D
  benefits be needed to reinforce the optimism and the implied support? These questions are typical of others that need
  to be answered before the implications of business executives' opinions become clear. Research, then, would be
  desirable to determine, for example;</p>
<ul>
  <li> The meaning of executives' estimates as to the speed with which the civilian space agency (as opposed to the
    military) will achieve given objectives.</li>
  <li> The factors behind the optimism expressed about the benefits of space research.</li>
  <li> The tenacity of the opinions about and commitment to space research, especially in the light of possible future
    events.</li>
  <li> To what extent and under what circumstances do executives' attitudes, when the approach is made to them as
    individuals, differ<br> from those when approached as members of a group? <span class="note">["When the last big discussion of postwar aid to Britain was being argued
in Congress, most of the organizational mail was for it, and most of the
individual letters were against it. It is possible to organize every kind of
voluntary group back of something as a group -and still have a large
number of individual dissidents who generate important undercurrents.
We need studies comparing what people say -when approached as
individuals -- and what they say as members of organized groups.'.'

<h3>Enfants</h3>
<p>Les enfants nés l'année de <em>Sputnik I</em> voteront dans la période de 20 ans encompassed by this study; ceux nés
  quelques années avant qui, dans cette période de temps, lanceront leurs carrières. Leurs impressions d'enfance de
  l'espace et de ses implications pourraient avoir de forts effets sur leurs choix de carrière et attitudes adultes
  envers les activités spatiales.</p>
<p>Pour l'adulte, la perception et l'interpretation de nouveau événements, objets et idées est filtré à travers un
  résidu de valeurs, croyances et expériences représentant toute une vie de familiarité avec l'ancien. Pour les enfants,
  le nouveau est plus réel, puisqu'il y a moins interpretive background to help define initial and spontaneous
  perceptions. Ainsi les enfants sont les principaux porteurs du changement ; ce qu'ils "voient" ou ce dont ils se
  souviennent will be remolded over time, mais rien ne peut remove the underpinnings of initially more literal
  perceptions <span class="note">["For an adult to know that other adults are all talking About and reading
about space is not the same as for the child to know this. He sees adults
taking it seriously (regardless of what they say about it). When we
listened to Buck Rogers we believed it was the 25th Century and it had no
expectancy value. Today it's real, but what is real for the adults who say so
may be quite different for the child who perceives it that way truly."
(Correspondence with Dr. Herbert Krugman.)]</span>. Even the four-year-old, however, is already a "socialized animal,&rdquo;
  reflecting many characteristic adult attitudes, and the freedom to see a given subject area through fresh eyes
  operates less and less as the child grows older. Therefore, since the attitudes of children toward space ought to
  provide much insight, especially if they can be rechecked at various periods of the child's growth, it would be wise
  to begin studies on very young children as soon as possible. Since values start young and in primitive enough form to
  be readily observable to research, such studies are practicable <span class="note">[For interview techniques with children, see Eugene L. Hartley and
Dorothy C. Krugman, "Note on Children's Social Role Perception,"

theory applied to development of values, see Herbert E. Krugman and
Eugene L. Hartley, "Studies in the Development of Consumer Tastes"
(scheduled for publication in Public Opinion Quarterly in the spring of
1961)]</span>. A special purpose of the research would be to detect both the inner and outer factors that contribute to
  the eventual adult's attitudes and behavior in support or nonsupport of space activities and to his perception of the
  world as influenced by pace activities <span class="note">["Here in a ten year project, or less, we will see the most cogent indicators
of value (political, social, etc., consequences of space activities -- and we
will see them in process. We need only a handful of schools for collection
of longitudinal data, and the Purdue Young People's Opinion Poll (high
school and college opinions) for our national cross-checks."
(Correspondence with Dr. Herbert Krugman.)]</span>. </p>
<p>Research, then, would be desirable to determine:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Les attitudes prévalant toward and knowledge of space events in youngsters of varied ages and the changes in
    attitudes and knowledge through the years ahead under the combined influence of new events in and adult attitudes
    toward space activities and exposure to the other alternatives and experiences which come with physical and mental
    growth. For each annual group of-four-year-olds, six-year olds, and so on, how important is space In relation to
    other world events and societal commitments and how do they define this importance?</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="c"></a>Implications possibles pour le grand public</h2>
<p>Exactement quand et comment les divergences dans l'opinion et l'attitude that mark off one special public from
  another decrease to the extent that the members of a large number of such groups can then be referred to as the "grand
  public" est indéterminable -- et n'arrive probablement jamais en fait. Néanmoins, il existe de nombreuses situations
  dans lesquelles un assez bon degré d'unanimité plutôt que de divergence semble au moins observable, et alors que le
  concept de grand public puisse n'être qu'un mythe sémantique, il est certainement bien pratique, et particulièrement
  pour les porte-paroles, planners, et décideurs. Cette section, alors, discuste des implications et attitudes ayant été
  adoptées par des porte-paroles à propos des activités spatiales pour pouvoir être applicables à de large groupements
  de publics spéciaux.</p>
<h3>Intérêt du public pour et implication dans les activités spatiales</h3>
<p>De nombreuses déclarations affirmatives ont été faites sur le degré de connaissance du public de, l'intérêt pour, et
  l'implications dans les activités spatiales à des fins pacifiques, mais il y a de bonnes raisons de croire que la
  situation est bien plus compliquée que nombre des déclarations impliquent <span class="note">[Les discussions suivantes illustrent ces points :  Donald N. Michael, "Sputniks and Public Opinion: The Myth of 'Impact," Air Force

  des activités spatiales et les attitudes associées. Ainsi une recherche est recommander afin d'explorer :</p>
<ul>
  <li> L'état de la connaissance du public sur les activités spatiales, both ongoing and contemplated, and the
    assumptions, expectations, and values that underlie the attitudes toward and interpretations of this knowledge. Also
    needing study are the effects over time of new knowledge and events on attitudes toward space activities, and the
    effects of the sources of information on the acceptability of the information. **</li>
</ul>
<p>Related to this general matter is the widespread tendency to assume that the direction and intensity of mass media
  reporting have attributable affects on attitudes. There is also the assumption that the media reflect, in the amount
  of attention they give to a subject, the interests of their audiences. However, the precise effects of the mass media
  on attitudes and values and the extent to which they reflect or generate interest are still not well understood,
  despite the amount of research conducted on these problems <span class="note">["... despite many years of discussion and many pages of writing, the
various roles of the press are not clear. There seem to be at least two
major influences which characterize the activity of the press. First, the
press perhaps more than any other agency, helps to create as well as
reflect the environment in which daily interaction...occurs. Second, while
the situation is obvious with respect to totalitarian countries, in which
the press is government controlled, it seems highly likely that in other
societies the press has also emerged as an actual adjunct to official policy
making structures and processes." Richard C. Snyder and James A.

  important events that foreknowledge about space activities make possible.) Because it is important that decision
  makers, policy planners, and pertinent attentive publics have more precise information about the role of the mass
  media in regard to space activities, further study is recommended on:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Les relations complexes entre les événements, leur traduction par les media, leur présentation par les media,
    l'attention que le public leur porte, les valeurs, attitudes et perceptions du public dans les secteurs associés, et
    les changements de valeurs, attitudes et comportement suite à l'exposition au contenu médiatique <span class="note">"Le nombre de specific findings are so great that the reader is likely to
assume that they are of great help in assessing the impact of the mass
media on American society. Actually their value is, at present, quite
limited for this purpose... Communications research has done much to
help us identify the relevant parameters of the problem, but the crucial
job of giving values to these parameters is yet to be done.'' See Raymond
A. Bauer and Alice H. Bauer, "American Society and the Mass Media of
Communication," (to be published in the Journal of Social Issues in early
1961), P. ii-5 of dittoed copy.]</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus encore, une étude careful is indicated of the proper and effective role for the public in regard to policy on a
  subject as complicated as space; given the many alternative needs on which public funds might be expended, this
  question is of particular interest. Thus, it would be desirable to examine:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Les manières dont le public peut contribuer à la mise en place et le soutien de la politique d'activité spatiale.
    En quoi il est limité (e.g., manque d'éducation, manque d'information exacte, manque de canaux pour communiquer son
    opinion?) dans sa capacité à contribuer de manière constructive et avec le niveau de sophistication requis ?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optimisme et sur-optimisme</h3>
<p>Les portes-parole sur les activités spatiales tentent souvent de générer un optimisme chez leur public en dwelling
  sur l'imminence de vastes efforts spatiaux et les abondants retours qui en sont attendus. Il y a également eu an
  unceasing stream de communiqués de relations publiques et de déclarations promotionnelles (souvent traduites par les
  médias de masse en termes d'actualités) sur les événements fascinants et fantastiques qui arriveront dans l'espace
  dans un futur proche, et sur ce que cela signifie pour le public.</p>
<p> L'optimisme du public est supposé être souhaitable, en ce qu'il devrait générer un soutien pour le programme spatial
  en général. Cependant, si les efforts de promotion devaient mener à un sur-optimisme, les attitudes de soutien
  pourraient facilement ne pas durer si les difficultés inhérentes aux efforts spatiaux n'avaient pas dans le même temps
  été suffisamment appréciées pour rendre compréhensible l'échec de certais projets. Les efforts spatiaux devenant de
  plus en plus grandioses et les conséquences potentielles de retour plus excitantes, un échec aura encore plus de
  possibilité de créer une désillusion générale. Si suffisamment de projets fascinants ne sont pas couronnés de succès
  au moment où ils sont supposés l'être, les premiers efforts to imply their ease and imminence may boomerang: the
  public state of mind may well make it difficult to obtain future funds for the more expensive efforts, which must
  compete in one way or another with other public programs for money, manpower, and ideas <span class="note">[Some anticipated space projects will in effect involve building a large
ship on end at the launching site. The contemplated Nova rocket, for
example, would stand about as tall as the Washington monument and
probably cost upwards of a billion dollars. Our economy has had no
peacetime experience with this kind of "one-shot" activity. Normally in
peacetime we finance either many relatively cheap, and therefore
disposable, items or an expensive item -- such as an ocean liner -- which
can be used over and over again. A really big rocket represents a new type
of investment, since in the nature of rocket technology the first shot may
fail. Thus there is the not unlikely specter of several years of publicized
effort and several billion dollars blowing up when only 100 yards off the
pad. Can a society used to traditional modes of investment revise its
values so that such a spectacular and expensive "test" would not produce
strong pressures to forego further investments of the sort?]</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it may be that a certain degree of over-optimism is necessary to sustain public interest in and
  support of space activities in the face of project frustrations and failures. However, these discussed effects are
  mere conjecture, since exact knowledge simply does not at present exist of whether the public is optimistic,
  pessimistic, or indifferent about the future of the space effort. Thus, to anticipate and ameliorate adverse
  consequences of over-optimism and to make effective use of optimism, the following questions need systematic
  study:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Row important are expectations of imminent and glamorous space activities to public support of the effort and the
    allocation of funds<br> and resources to it?</li>
  <li> Under what circumstances do authoritative statements about the assured success of costly projects, which do not
    eventuate as predicted, result in indifference or resentment and withdrawal of support or in continued support?
    What, in terms of the individual's attitudes and values, defines the success or failure of an event or sequence of
    events?</li>
  <li> To what extent are people sophisticated or naive about the competition for attention between the many
    institutional and organizational rivals in the space field, and in what ways do the level of knowledge about and the
    attitudes toward the competition affect expectations and interest in and support of space activities?</li>
  <li> To what extent are people sophisticated or naive regarding optimism as to the future, to progress, and the limits
    and potentialities of science? How do these general values and attitudes relate to attitudes toward space
    possibilities <span class="note">[Daniel Lerner, Professor of Communications Research at MIT, and his
associates found some interesting differences recently in sophisticated
European publics regarding expectations about the future importance of
space activities. In a general way, those people who foresaw intensive
and, perhaps, disastrous competition between East and West, also foresaw
space as an important activity in the future. Those people who foresaw a
lessening of tensions and the need for greater cooperation, also foresaw a
lessening role for space. See also R. C. Davis and Stephen B. Withey, The
Public Impact of Science in the Mass Media , Survey Research Center,

Dimensions of Attitudes Toward Man-into-Space ," Psychological
Newsletter (New York University), Vol. 10 (January-February 1959), pp.

</ul>
<h3>Horizons élargis</h3>
<p>On dit que l'homme a une volonté insatiable de progresser, de grimper la montagne "parce qu'elle est là", et par
  conséquent d'explorer l'espace à l'extrême parce qu'il est guidé par la nature de son être pour le faire. A mesure de
  cette exploration, ses horizons sociaux et psychologique seront nécessairement élargis par la magnitude et les défis
  de l'univers, en contraste avec ses anciennes préoccupations terrestres herein, it is claimed, lies one of the great
  implications of space activities for attitudes and values.</p>
<p>In assessing these claims it should be recalled that there are many societies in which the traditional way of doing
  things is the proper way of life; even in our own society, with its emphases on change and on progress, it is common
  for potentially useful innovations to be blocked by traditional perspectives <span class="note">[For example, an excellent summary of opposition to changes in
transportation is found in Wilfred Owen, The Community Objects (a
report prepared for the Air Force Association, 1954)]</span>. Not all people here or abroad will be or are committed to
  space exploration because it is "challenging&rdquo; or represents "progress&rdquo;; among those who are interested in
  meeting challenges, a good number will no doubt decide that they prefer to expend money and effort on challenges more
  immediately and intimately related to their own needs and those of the earthbound human community <span class="note">[It is significant, perhaps, that among those people today who would be
spoken of as having broad horizons, there is questioning regarding the
appropriate allocation of resources to meet these many challenges on the
horizon. For example, 11 ... certainly there are scientific problems of
overwhelming importance that can be solved for a small fraction of a
single Atlas or Titan fizzle. Is it possible that, in the long run, we'll be
better off relative to the Russians to channel expenditures into other
fields? ... and what about cancer research, studies in geriatrics, urban
redevelopment -- even aid to India?" (d'après un discours de <a href="/people/l/LowRobertJ">Robert J. Low</a>,

said: "Nor need we look beyond our own shores to view unreached
horizons of science. Our hospitals are overcrowded with men, women,
and children emotionally unfit to move among their fellow men. Killers
and cripplers of men such as cancer, arthritis, heart disease, muscular
dystrophy, all await the day when science will marshal still greater forces
against them. Rich deposits of minerals and food await extraction from
the sea, while the sea awaits desalination in quantities large enough to
open new lands to mankind. The atom awaits fusion, photosynthesis to
be harnessed, new galaxies to be discovered. Science itself awaits the day
when it will be reunited with music, art, and literature into harmonious
culture to move together, toward the achievement of excellence in our
lives."

of Chicago) of Basic Research in the Navy (a report to the Secretary of the
Navy by the Naval Research Advisory Committee ), Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists , Vol. 16 (June 1960), P. 221, which reads in part, "What
we need... is a 100-fold redirection of money and competent research
scientists into other long-neglected areas of basic research and invention.
Areas where 100-fold may mean 100 scientists, to balance a little bit the
hordes already working on space and fusion. Areas related to
transportation, housing, textiles, contraceptives, Operations Analyses of
local government mechanisms, and so on; where high technology sees
no dividend and has not even a toehold. Survival is also, like
technology, a many-factor problem; and for optimum success, it also
needs a distribution of research effort among all the factors, not just the
well-advertised military and industrial factors."]</span>.</p>
<p>Cependant, certaines idées liées aux activités spatiales pourraient même maintenant contribuer in some quarters à
  changer les horizons. Par exemple, sous l'impulsion des nouvelles mais fréquentes déclarations selon laquelles
  l'exploration spatiale est un bon exemple de l'aspiration most worthy de l'homme — l'accumulation de
  connaissance en soi — une attitude favorable du public au scholarship en général pourrait être générée.
  L'acceptation de longues périodes de planification d'activités spatiales et la possibilité de programmes spatiaux
  internationaux pourraient stimuler des attitudes favorables à la coopération multinational comme à une planification
  systématique dans d'autres domaines. Et peut-être la conviction que les activités spatiales doivent inévitablelent
  déboucher sur des horizons et perspectives élargis encouragera-t-elle un schéma de réponses qui produira une

            class="note">[les positions des principales dénominations religieuses américaines, des sectes Chrétiennes, et des religions orientales sur le sujet de la vie extraterrestre nécessitent une élucidation. Considérez ce qui suit : "Les sectes fondamentalistes (et anti-science) are growing apace around
the world and, comme des entreprises missionnaires, may have schools and a good
deal of literature attached to them. Une des choses importantes es que,
là où elles sont actives, elles appeal to the illiterate and semiliterate
(including, as missions, the preachers as well as the congregation) and can
pile up a very influential following in terms of numbers. Pour elles, la découverte d'une autre vie -- plutôt que tout autre produit de l'espace -- serait électrifiant. Les principales de ces sectes ayant une couverture largement internationales et étant, en certains endroits, une source d'informations, les principaux distributeurs d'éléments de médias de masse, an important source of
value interpretation, a central social institution, an educational
institution, and so on, some scattered studies need to be made both in
their home centers and churches and their missions, in relation to
attitudes about space activities and extraterrestrial life. additionally,
because of the international effects of space activities and, in the event of
its happening, of the discovery of extraterrestrial life, even though space
activities are not internationalized, it is very important to take account of
other major religions. So, for example, Buddhist priests are heavily
politically engaged in Ceylon. So, too, in Burma, many politically active
men (including U Nu) are professedly active Buddhists. The Burmese
convoked the Sixth Great Buddhist Council which brought together a
huge international group of Buddhist lay and ecclesiastical leaders and it
seems likely that -- at least in the case of Theravada Buddhism -- with the
wide participation of modern-educated, politically active men, Buddhist
beliefs and principles are being reinterpreted. We need, and we do not
have, good observations or interpretive statements about the possible
repercussions of space activities, etc., for these Buddhists."
(Correspoidence with Dr. Rhoda Metraux. The observations are based on
field work with the Montserrat Anthropological Expedition, 1953-55.,
field work in Haiti, and examination of sectarian literature.)
If plant life or some subhuman intelligence were found on Mars or
Venus, for example, there is on the face of it no good reason to suppose
these discoveries, after the original novelty had been exploited to the
fullest and worn off, would result in substantial changes in perspectives
or philosophy in large parts of the American public, at least any more
than, let us say, did the discovery of the coelacanth or the panda. It might
well be that this sort of discovery would simply not be sufficiently salient
for most people most of the time to cause any noticeable shift in
philosophy or perspective. If super intelligence is discovered, the results
become quite unpredictable. it is possible that if the intelligence of these
creatures were sufficiently superior to ours, they would choose to 'nave
little if any contact with us. On the face of it, there is no reason to believe
that we might learn a great deal from them, especially if their physiology
and psychology were substantially different fro)ii ours,
It has been speculated that, of all groups, scientists and engineers might be
the most devastated by the discovery of relatively superior creatures,
since these professions are most clearly associated with the mastery of
nature, rather than with the understanding and expression of man.
Advanced understanding of nature might vitiate all our theories at the
very least, if not also require a culture and perhaps a brain inaccessible to
earth scientists. Nature belongs to all creatures, but manes aspirations,
motives, history, attitudes, etc., are presumably the proper study of man.
It would also depend, of course, on how their intelligence )ere expressed,
it does not necessarily follow that they would excel technologically.
It is perhaps interesting to note that when asked what the consequences
of the discovery of superior life would be, an audience of Saturday
Review readership chose, for the most part, not to answer the question at
all, in spite of their detailed answers to many other speculative questions.
Perhaps the idea is so foreign that even this readership was bemused by it.
But one can speculate, too, that the idea of intellectually superior
creatures may be anxiety-provoking. Nor is it clear what would be the
reactions to creatures of approximately equal and communicable
intelligence to ours.
What may perhaps present a particularly knotty philosophical problem,
and one which would seem most clearly to have the potentials of
profound repercussions for our values and attitudes and philosophies,could arise if we discovered a creature whose intelligence and behavior,
by our standards, was indeterminate to the point that we were unable to
decide whether or not it should be treated morally and ethically as if it
were "a human being." Certainly, this could provide a continuing subject
of controversy across and within various earth cultures; some people
who had not otherwise speculated on these matters might gain a sense of
the complexity of the universe. , For a convincing presentation of this
idea, see Vercours, You Shall Know Them , Pocket Books (1955).
On this general problem see Daniel C. Raible, "Rational Life in Outer
Space?" America , Vol. 103 (Aug. 13, 1960), pp. 532-535;,Wolfgang D.

              exchange of radio communication would take twice-the number of light years separating our sun from

in April-June 1960, surveyed samples of about 100 legislators and 100

changed by a series of developments, including some in space. (in what
follows the figures are given in the following order: (1) Brazilian
legislators and (2) students; (3) Finnish legislators and (4) students.) The
discovery of civilized alien life was foreseen as increasing the chances for
East-West reconciliation by 15, 11, 5, and 6 per cent of the respondents,
and as increasing the chances of a third political force by 6, 6, 11, and 20
per cent of the respondents. Increased status quo and increased likelihood
of disarmament accounted for most of the remaining scattered responses,
being, respectively, 2, 5, 21, and 21 per cent, and 5, 7, 6, and 5 per cent. The
remaining types of situations facing the world were seen as essentially
unaffected by this event. (See Chapter 8, Note 58, for other details of this

              discovery is a moot question. Anthropological files contain many examples of societies, sure of their
              place in the universe, which have disintegrated when they have had to associate with previously unfamiliar
              societies espousing different ideas and different life ways; others that survived such an experience
              usually did so by paying the price of changes in values and attitudes and behavior.</p>

                <p>The Mercury man-in-space program has already received much comment in the media, which illustrates
                  the kind of conflicts that can be expected. There have been favorable reports, as typified by the
                  articles on the astronauts, their families, and their training <span class="note">[A series of articles on the astronauts began in the Sept. 14, 1959,issue of

which Lee DuBridge was quoted as saying also, "I believe even the
Mercury Program, in spite of all the nauseating journalistic publicity
about the astronauts, has now been converted into a needed research
program." See also the editorial, "Don't Rush the Astronauts,"

                  assets to astronauts, who can thus still be considered "normal&rdquo; Americans; at the same time,
                  their military status permits them to take risks which large portions of the general public might not
                  otherwise consider appropriate for family men. A leading anthropologist who has studied this problem
                  says the astronauts are not models for -other women's husbands -- not one little bit .... Part of the

relatives and neighbors to help, or not so many children. But now, they
need husbands at home, and there is a tremendous objection to men
going anywhere. Part of the feeling about space, which spreads right
through the country, is women's objection to men's going there." See

                  a man's responsibility to family versus his willingness to risk death in space. This and similar
                  questions will. be resolved, probably not without emotional conflict, according to the particular
                  personal and institutions values held by those involved in various aspects of the controversies.</p>
                <p>Here again is an opportunity to conduct before-and-after research on the implications of innovations
                  for attitudes and values. Studies preceding the launching can also provide a basis for better
                  informing the public so that it can realistically appreciate both the accomplishments and difficulties
                  of the program. It is recommended, then, that base line studies be begun as soon as possible to
                  Determine the present knowledge of, beliefs and expectations about, and the values that underlie
                  attitudes toward the Mercury program and the astronaut. These should be continuing studies so that the
                  impact of events can be anticipated, evaluated, and planned for.</p>
                <p>If the Mercury program is successful it will be only a prelude to attempts to put man on the moon and
                  some of the planets. Thus the implications of astronautic efforts, subsequent to Mercury, for
                  attitudes and values should also be studied. Social observers have speculated that manned flight to
                  the moon or Mars might re-stimulate the American frontier spirit, thereby supplying a new form of
                  vicarious living for a large part of the public and perhaps inspiring some to participate in more
                  challenging activities here on earth <span class="note">[Eric Larabee interprets the popularity of the "Western" and the "Private

that he must confront and use his wits and his body to overcome. To the
extent that space may provide a surrogate or vicarious frontier for people,
it may be attractive in this sense too]</span>.</p>
                <p>Although the physical requirements for an astronaut probably will be compatible with the preferred
                  American image of masculinity, the psychological characteristics appropriate for long flights through
                  space, alone or in compact quarters with others, may be quite incompatible. Indeed, the very rigors
                  which the astronaut may have to withstand and the special techniques that may be used to make it
                  possible for him to withstand them (such as hibernation or some form of drug treatment) may produce a
                  great gap in the earthbound man's identification with the astronaut. To the average man who is
                  increasingly embedded in the security and organization of urban life, the physical threat and the
                  physical and psychic isolation implied in manned space activities may seem unpalatable and at a great
                  emotional distance from the daily problems he finds challenging and interesting. Thus, the
                  personalities of astronauts, the esoteric technical problems they solve, and the challenges they
                  accept might become matters of indifference to the public, or, in one way or another, represent
                  aspirations and ways of life that are undesirable <span class="note">[See Donald N. Michael, "Social Studies Must Go On to Find Out How To

Sciences for Space Use," Aviation Week , Vol. 73 (Nov. 7, 1960), p. 67]</span>. This situation could lead to
                  extraordinary efforts to find a way to put man in space -- efforts not necessarily of optimum social
                  use. It could also bring about an intensive development of robot equipment that could do man's
                  exploring for him. Application of the robot technology to other endeavors might be extensive and carry
                  with it all the moral, social, ethical, and economic problems and opportunities which have been
                  explored by the more thoughtful science fiction writers.</p>
                <p>If it should become necessary to accept the impossibility of first-hand experience in space, there
                  may be important consequences for American values and aspirations. As a nation, we have come to
                  believe ourselves conquerors of nature and equal to any task if we apply "/science.&rdquo; In recent
                  years this confidence has appeared to be spectacularly justified. The discovery that man cannot for
                  the foreseeable future go into space by any of the glamorous means so regularly predicted might so
                  disrupt our self-confidence as to set off a chain of revisions in values which could either hinder or
                  improve our capacity to deal maturely with our other problems.</p>
                <p> Whether or not man will be able to study space at first hand in the next two decades depends on
                  information not now available. Since the outcome might go either way, the effects of later
                  man-in-space efforts on values and attitudes in general, as well as with regard to such space
                  activities in particular, require research to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Develop base line data on present attitudes toward and expectations about post-Mercury
                    man,-in-space efforts. These data should include indications of attitudes toward supporting or not
                    supporting such activities and the reasons pertaining thereto.</li>
                  <li> Assess changes in attitudes and expectations in the light of subsequent events and statements
                    intended to inform, to encourage, or to discourage support of the program.</li>
                  <li> Discover what symbols and ideas regarding man in space would be stimulating in cultures whose
                    support is desired, but whose aspirations and ideals may not be similar to ours.</li>
