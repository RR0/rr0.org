<title>Introduction : Goals and Methods â€‘ Brookings Report</title>
<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<ol>
  <li> In November <a href="../../../../../5/9/index.html">1959</a> the <a href="/org/us/nasa">National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> contracted with the Brookings Institution to <q>undertake... the design of
    a comprehensive and long-term program of research and study regarding the social, economic, political, legal, and
    international implications of the use of space for peaceful and scientific purposes.</q></li>
  <li> The long-term program of research set out in the report (and briefly outlined in this Summary) includes:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        Sufficient description and evaluation of speculations on the implications of space activities to provide a basis
        for judging which implications may have sufficient impact on human affairs to merit research.</li>
      <li> Specification of criteria for selection of high priority research.</li>
      <li> Specification, when feasible of high priority research areas for initiating a long-range research
        program; specification of other research areas which will extend the utility of the initial research; and
        specification of research which may become central under later circumstances. </li>
      <li>Suggestions as to methods, persons, and organizations that might assist the conduct of research. (The
        suggestions are made chiefly through footnote citations of pertinent publications and projects and are therefore
        not included in this Summary, which carries no footnotes.) </li>
      <li> Suggestions on the organization and function of a NASA research capability to implement the program
        (Chapter 2). </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> Space activities require great investments of money, men, material, and creative effort and thereby compete with
    the needs of other areas of human endeavor. They contribute to rapid rates of technological change and thereby give
    rise to social and personal readjustment problems. Thus it is most desirable that the problems and opportunities
    they may imply for society be understood. Since the potentialities of space activities are wide ranging, so, too,
    must be a research program on their implications: examined herein are the problems and opportunities that may be
    introduced by hardware (such as a weather satellite forecasting system); events (such as the adventures of
    astronauts in space); and ideas (such as those embodied in discussions of the degree to which national prestige may
    be dependent on success in space accomplishments), certain implications may be directly related to aspects of a
    specific social environment; in such cases, these aspects will be examined.</li>
  <li> Research on the implications of space activities requires a reasonably clear picture of the associated larger
    social context. Given the complex problems facing various components of world society and the technological
    developments, that are believed possible in fields other than space, it appears impractical to speculate beyond the
    next twenty years, and perhaps even beyond the next ten. Even within this time span, however, the consequences of
    space activities can be foreseen only in part, since the effect of any given development in space may be vitiated by
    unexpected but contingent scientific, technological, or a society developments. This report, therefore, does not
    attempt to predict what will happen to society as a result of space activities. Rather, it poses questions about
    what might happen and specifies contingent factors which may affect the likelihood of one implication being realized
    rather than another, </li>
  <li> Certain potential products or consequences of space activities imply such a high degree of change in world
    conditions that it would be unprofitable within the purview of this report to propose research on them. Examples
    include a controlled thermonuclear fusion rocket power source and face-to-face meetings with
    extraterrestrials. </li>
  <li> The impact of innovation is no respecter of differences in academic disciplines. To stress the interdisciplinary
    nature of research on the implications of space activities and to permit a coherent exploration of specific
    products, events, and ideas the report is organized into chapters that (except for Chapter 2) each represent a major
    area of problems and opportunities. Within these major areas., all pertinent aspects of the problems are discussed,
    whether economic, political, or social, or combinations thereof. Certain chapters necessarily overlap, since some of
    them cover general aspects of problems which are specific to the subjects of other chapters. </li>
  <li> Time, resources, and especially the lack of a single formulation of social science theory, broad-ranging enough
    to encompass the variety of problems involved, imposed arbitrary limitations on the amount of research undertaken to
    back the speculation underlying the report. Thus, the report is not exhaustive in its research recommendations, but
    the descriptions of the problem areas (developed through interviews, conferences, and reading) are intended to
    provide the reader with a basis for proposing specific research projects in connection with the study areas
    recommended here. It is important to note that, as a consequence of this approach, the first specific research
    project to be undertaken with regard to many of the problems here discussed should be an assessment of the
    literature to determine what existing knowledge, if any, can be applied directly and what further study needs to be
    done. </li>
  <li> Suggesting a comprehensive research program makes it necessary to examine the range of implications needing
    study, irrespective of who might conduct the research. Not all -the research suggested should or could be sponsored
    directly by NASA; some proposals are more properly within the interests of other groups. </li>
  <li>"Research" is broadly used herein to refer to a variety of approaches, including "think-pieces," sophisticated
    logical and/or mathematical evaluations and analyses, and empirical studies in the field. Studies would range from
    broad programmatic research to detailed inquiries. Most of the projects are phrased in terms of space activities,
    but many of the suggested investigators could as well be stimulated by or applied to a number of other major
    on-going or contemplated scientific developments. Examination of the implications of space activities also provides
    a new standpoint from which to observe human behavior before, during., and after social change resulting from
    innovation. This, the proposed research program offers extraordinary opportunities for fundamental social science
    research as well as applied. </li>
  <li> The recommended high priority research areas (listed at the end of each Summary section) are intended to provide
    NASA with a "mix" of projects to be an initial basis for a long-range research program. The priority criteria
    emphasize:
    <ol>
      <li> That the results of the research would have important applications to the social consequences of
        specific space activities.</li>
      <li> That the study is urgent in order to identify and resolve operating and policy problems associated
        with imminent or on-going developments.</li>
      <li> That the study is non-deferrable in that if the data and methods are to be available when needed it
        is necessary to begin acquiring them now; </li>
      <li> That the study would significantly forward the development of a program of peaceful and scientific
        uses of space. </li>
      <li> That the study would, through the development of methodology, facts, or theory, contribute
        exceptionally to understanding or foreseeing the social implications of space activities. </li>
    </ol>
    Which projects NASA may choose to implement, even among those which might be thought of as urgent, will depend on
    factors not within the purview of this report, including budget, availability of research capabilities, important
    events which have transpired, and the extent to which previous research has paid off.
  </li>
  <li> Research areas are included in the report which are not now considered of high priority, but which are likely to
    become so as social developments and space activities evolve and as high priority research is completed. </li>
  <li> No assumption has been made as to whether that or not specific studies are already underway. If an area
    recommended for study is presently being competently researched, the priorities here assigned to the area would
    alter. </li>
  <li> The magnitude and direction of a long-range research program on the social effects of space activities will
    depend on the organization NASA establishes to select, monitor, and conduct the studies. One of the most pressing
    and continuing research challenges for this capability will be to:
    <ul>
      <li> develop effective methods to detect incipient implications of space activities and to insure that their
        consequences are understood. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Each section of this Summary corresponds to a chapter of the full report and sets forth the main points of the
    chapter and the recommended high priority research for the problem area. In the body of the report, the presentation
    of potential implications involves discussion of and suggested research on all the issues that seem to be pertinent
    to a problem area including some that do not warrant research at the present stage of the problem area's
    development, and some that it would be inefficient to study until other recommended research is completed. This
    supportive discussion constitutes the bulk of the report and in a summary can only be suggested. Its intent,
    however, is to make clear (1) the significance of the research recommended, (2) the variety of the projects implicit
    in the research areas, (3) the order in which related projects could be carried out, and (4) the opportunities for
    approaching various problems in broad or narrow contexts of research and application. Therefore, although for some
    readers this Summary chapter may provide sufficient information &shy;- since these four clarifications may not be of
    central interest to them -- itis assumed that the potential researcher will find it essential to read the body of
    the report. </li>
