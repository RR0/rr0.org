    href="/org/us/nasa">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a>,<br> Washington, D. C.</p>
    <p>DEAR MR. JOHNSON : I am pleased to transmit herewith a report on <em>Proposed Studies on the Implications of
      Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs</em>, which has been prepared for your Committee on Long-Range Studies
      of the <a href="/org/us/nasa">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a>, pursuant to
      Section 102(c) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of <a href="../../../../../5/8/index.html">1958</a>.</p>
    <p>This section specifies that the <q>aeronautical and space activities of the United States shall be so conducted
      as to contribute materially</q> to several objectives, among which is <q>(4) establishment of long-range studies
      of the potential benefits to be gained from the opportunities for, and the problems involved in the utilization of
      aeronautical and space activities for peaceful<br> and scientific purposes.</q></p>
    <p>In seeking assistance in carrying out the objectives of this section, <a href="/org/us/nasa/">NASA</a>, through
      your Committee, and the Brookings Institution agreed that there was a wide range of studies in the social sciences
      that could be made of the potential benefits and problems arising from the peaceful use of space. In fact, the
      full range of possible studies was so great that some guidelines bad to be established to aid in the orderly
      selection and proper support of those studies that would contribute most effectively to the policies and purposes
      of the Congress as stated in the National Aeronautics and Space Act. It was believed, therefore, that if a program
      of such studies were to be developed, <a href="/org/us/nasa/">NASA</a> would be in a better position to discharge
      its statutory responsibilities. The attached report is designed to assist in the development of that kind of
      comprehensive and long-term program of research and study. The report recommends for the consideration of NASA a
      wide range of studies regarding the social, economic, political, legal, and international implications of the use
      of space for peaceful and scientific purposes.</p>
    <p>The agreed upon multiple objectives of the report would be well served if it generates research activities within
      as well as outside of NASA, in accordance with the interests of those in the academic community, private research
      organizations, industry, and other government agencies. Therefore, some material is included which, while familiar
      to <a href="/org/us/nasa/">NASA</a>, is felt to be necessary background for those who have not been close to some
      of the problems discussed.</p>

        </tr></table><p>The Brookings staff members and the consultants responsible for the study collaborated through a
        series of monthly two-day conferences. In addition, over 200 people were interviewed throughout the course of
        the project. These persons by contributing their experience, imagination, and critical insight have been of
        great assistance in the preparation of this report. Throughout the preparation of the report the Institution has
        bad the wholehearted cooperation of your Committee on Long-Range Studies, whose assistance the Institution
        acknowledges with gratitude.</p>
        <p>Midway in the project, the views of the staff were evaluated and enhanced by the participation at a 2-day
          conference of Lincoln P. Bloomfield, Director, United Nations Project, Center for International Studies,
          Massachusetts Institute of Technology; George Clement, Assistant to the President, the <a

            <p>Finally, it should be noted that the time available for the completion of this report has been short in
              view of the broad range of subjects and the new areas of research to be considered. The authors have made
              a pioneering exploration into new fields of investigation in the attempt to foresee types of research
              which space activities make desirable. The treatment, findings, and recommendations are those of the
              authors and, in accordance with usual procedures, do not necessarily reflect the views of other members of
              the Brookings staff, its administrative officers, or members of its Board of Trustees.</p>
