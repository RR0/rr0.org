<p class="abstract">De nouvelles preuves de terres mystérieuses aux Pôles - 200 ans d'exploration ont fourni aux russes
  un nouveau concept du Pôle et rendent obsolètes toutes les géographies précédentes - Voici les faits géophysiques
  incontestables !
</p>
<p>De nombreux lecteurs se souviendrons des articles que nous avons publié livrant nos théories selon lesquelles il a
  quelque chose de mystérieux concernant chaque région polaire de la Terre. Nous avons suggéré qu'il y a bien plus de
  "terrain" aux deux pôles qu'il n'est possible d'en montrer sur un planisphère. Nous avons mis en avant les étranges
  vols de l'amiral Byrd <q>au-delà</q> des pôles. Nous avons mentionné le cas de montagnes manquantes et de différentes
  branches militaires écartant la capacité à cartographier des autres. Nous avons même suggéré que <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/TerreCreuse">la Terre est creuse</a>, et que ces ouvertures géantes de
  <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">2100</span> <span itemprop="unitCode" content="SMI">miles</span>
    </span> existent aux pôles, et que nombreuses sont les preuves de l'existence de ces ouvertures. Nous avons démontré
  beaucoup de secret et de double langage sur les régions Arctique et Antarctique. Nous avons même suggéré que les <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/FlyingSaucers.html">soucoupes volantes</a> pourraient venir de cette région mystérieuse,
  ou de l'intérieur de la Terre.
</p>
<p>Une des choses sur laquelle nous avons le plus insisté est que personne n'est encore allé au Pôle Nord, toutes les
  prétentions de l'avoir fait étant fausses, parce que le Pôle n'est pas un "point", et ne peut être "atteint" au sens
  usuel du terme.
</p>
<p>Nous avons défié avec succès les <a href="/people/pilotes.html">pilotes</a> militaires et civils ayant déclaré
  survoler le Pôle Nord <q>tous les jours</q>. Dans le cas de l'aviateur militaire, nous avons mis en avant que la
  manoeuvre qui est standard, qui rend automatiquement impossible pour lui de voler au-delà du Pôle en le traversant. En
  raison de difficultés de navigation émanant de tous types de compas.
</p>
<p>Un aviateur "perdu" (dont le compas ne fonctionne pas comme il devrait) retrouve son orientation en faisant un virage
  dans n'importe quelle direction, jusqu'à ce que son compas se remette à fonctionner. Dans le cas de lignes aériennes
  commerciales, dont la publicité vante le fait qu'elles survolent le Pole deux fois par jour, elles déforment
  simplement la vérité de <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">2300</span> <span itemprop="unitCode" content="SMI">miles</span>
    </span>.
</p>
<p>Nous disposons, sous la forme documents de plusieurs centaines d'années, dans archives russes, d'une histoire de
  l'exploration arctique prouvant notre point le plus important avant toute autre question : i.e., que le Pôle
  magnétique Nord n'est pas un point, mais (déduisent les russes) une "ligne" d'environ <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">1000</span> <span itemprop="unitCode" content="SMI">miles</span>
    </span> de long. Avant d'aller plus loin, nous devrions suggérer que nous pensons qu'ils se trompent sur cette
  deduction, et qu'au lieu d'être une ligne, il s'agit en fait d'un cercle. Fautre d'espace où le placer sur le globe,
  les russes ont été forcés de compresser leurs observations en une zone bidimensionnelle. Ils ont dû écraser le cercle
  sur deux côtés et en faire une ligne. Nous voudrions maintenant vous livrer un résumé de ce seul point de
  l'exploration russe, qui couvre en fait bien plus que seulement du géomagnetisme.
</p>
<p>Voici ce que disent les russes : les navigateurs des hautes latitudes ont toujours été troublés par le comportement
  étrange de leurs compas magnétiques caused by apparent irregularities and asymmetries in the magnetic field of the
  Earth. Early magnetic maps have been drawn on this assumption, based on hopeful guesses, that the North Magnetic Pole
  is virtually a point. Accordingly, it was expected that the compass needle, which dips more steeply as it approaches
  the Magnetic Pole, would point straight down, or very nearly so, at the Magnetic Pole itself. But data from many
  Russian and other expeditions showed that the compass needle points straight down, or nearly so, at the Magnetic Pole
  itself. But data from many Russian and other expeditions showed that the compass needle points straight down for a
  very long distance across the Arctic Ocean, from a point northwest of the Taimyr Peninsula to another point in the
  Arctic Archipelago. This discovery first inspired the hypothesis that there is a second North Magnetic Pole,
  tentatively located at 86 degrees East longitude. More refined observation has disposed of this idea. The map of the
  magnetic field now shows the magnetic meridians running close together in a thick bunch of lines from the North
  Magnetic Pole in the Arctic Archipelago to Siberia.
</p>
<p>The North Magnetic Pole, once thought to be virtually a point in the Arctic Archipelago, has been shown by recent
  investigations to extend across the polar basin to the Taimyr Penninsula in Siberia.
</p>
<p>The 'Pole', magnetically speaking, is a very extended area that crosses the Polar Basin from one continent to the
  other. It is at least 1,000 miles long, and more likely can be said to exist as a rather diffused line for 1,000 miles
  more. (It is really not a point in the far north, but is the rim of the polar opening, since after Admiral Byrd passed
  it and entered the polar opening leading to the Earth's interior, he left the Arctic ice and snow behind and entered a
  warmer territory - Author. ) Thus when Admiral Peary (and any other Arctic explorer who used a magnetic compass)
  claims to have "reached" the Pole, he is making a very vague claim indeed. He can only say that he reached a point,
  which can be anywhere in a demonstrable 2,000 mile area (the magnetic rim of the polar opening), where his compass
  pointed straight down. A noteworthy achievement, but not a 'discovery of the Pole.'
</p>
<p>Since other types of compass, such as the gyroscopic and the inertial guidance, have equally vague limitations, we
  make bold to say that nobody ever reached the Pole, and more, there is not a 'Pole' to reach.
</p>
<p>Next, having found themselves stumped to account for the strange behavior of the compass in the Polar Basin, the
  theorists have turned to space and the upper atmosphere and even to the sun for an explanation of what is happening to
  their instruments. Now the Pole has become 'the interaction of the magnetic field with charged particles from the
  sun'.
</p>
<p>More significant are the unfavorable references to former cartographers whose maps are now 'thick clouds congealed in
  the imagination of cartographers as land masses'. The Navy, as an example, feels a bit put out when the Army says
  their missing South Pole mountains were never there, because the Army cannot find them by their own confused reckoning
  based on a magnetic pole which 'isn't there at all'. We find now that new land areas are 'discovered' and old maps
  tossed out because the lands they show are not there any more.
</p>
<p>This brings us to the subject of `mystery lands' of great extent in the polar areas, which cannot possibly be placed
  on our globe without overlapping seriously in impossible ways...Could it be here where the flying saucers originate?"
</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>The focal point, or the actual 'pinpoint' of the magnetic pole exists on only one portion of the circumference of
  that circle at a time, and moves progressively around the circle in a definite `orbit' that takes some 235 years. This
  would make the magnetic pole travel approximately 18 miles per year.
</p>
<p>Military and civilian flights 'over the Pole' can be made daily without producing the slightest evidence of the vast
  hole in the Earth, whose perimeter they circumscribe, no matter what they ASSUME in their navigational procedure, due
  to the original error in assumption that what they are passing over is a POINT and not a vast CIRCUMFERENCE which they
  touch at only one place, and then immediately deviate away from its natural curve because they are traveling in a
  straight line.
</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>Exploration and research have shown that an enormous area of the Earth's surface and correspondingly 'large realms of
  the unknown' may be brought within the compass of human understanding in a very few years.
</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>This is truly a stupendous sentence. Contemplate what it actually says. It says that not only exploration, but also
  `research' have shown that enormous regions of the Earth's surface AND correspondingly (this word is significant)
  large realms of the UNKNOWN may be brought within the compass of UNDERSTANDING of human beings in a very few years. In
  plain words, in addition to areas we can understand and investigate by exploration, there are large realms which have
  to be brought to human understanding by means of research.
</p>
<p>Yes, large UNKNOWN and even BEYOND PRESENT UNDERSTANDABILITY areas do exist, and it `MAY BE' that we will discover
  and comprehend them in a very few years. In plain words, in addition to areas we can understand and investigate by
  exploration, there are large realms which have to be brought to human understanding by means of research.
</p>
<p>In the next few sentences (of the Russians) we find that there is much 'prospect for development' in a Polar Basin
  which, by present concepts, is nothing but frozen ocean. What is it that is such a great prospect for development? Ice
  cubes for our tea? No, there must be very much more interesting possibilities, the kind of possibilities that entail
  large land masses of an unknown area yet to be explored and developed.
</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>As recently as 30 years ago more than half the total area of the Polar Basin was unexplored, and 16 per cent was
  still terra incognita only 15 years ago. Today, disappointing as this may be to young geographers, the area of blank
  spots on the map of the Polar Basin has shrunk to almost nothing. At the same time, to the regret of the older
  explorers and the understandable pleasure of the younger ones, there are still blank spots elsewhere in the Arctic.
  The ocean, the air and the ionosphere still hold many mysteries.
</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>We learn that the blank spots on the map of the Polar Basin have shrunk to almost nothing. In the next breath we find
  that there are still blank spots ELSEWHERE in the Arctic. Where else? The ocean, the air and the ionosphere, they say,
  still hold many mysteries. Particularly the ocean, in the UNKNOWN extent of which exist vast land masses so far not
  only beyond our ability to place on our maps, but beyond our ability to understand.
</p>
<p>We might say all this is double talk. We might also say secrets are being kept. But we won't The fact is that neither
  is true. It is STRAIGHT talk, the only kind of talk we can expect from anyone who is trying to tell something, but
  cannot because it is, as yet, beyond his understanding. To say definitely that there are large land masses inside an
  area commonly called a 'point' is to be faced with a challenge to demonstrate and prove. Since this cannot be done,
  the speaker is left rather helpless to do more than hint vaguely at mysteries.
</p>
<p>It is up to the opponents of the 'Mystery Land at the Pole' theory to disprove it, or prove their own - and their own
  has been irrevocably demolished by the scientists and explorers of the two greatest nations on earth. What we have
  presented is not a theory - but the cumulative result of hundreds of years of exploration, culminated by the
  geophysical year [1957] which established the information we have given you as the `new concept of geomagnetism in the
  Polar Basin.'
</p>
<p>The mystery is at last coming to the fore, and the scoffers are at last silenced. Let us all work together to dig out
  the truth about this mystery that is so engrossing, and so important to mankind. What is it that exists at both Poles
  of the earth, which opens to us new frontiers so vast in extent and nature as to be beyond present understanding? It
  may well be that exploration of space is far less important than the exploration of our own mysterious planet, which
  has now suddenly become a 'vast realm' far larger than we ever dreamed it to be.
</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>Only Admiral Byrd's 'mystery land' can account for these inexplicable facts and migrations</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>The musk-ox, contrary to expectations, migrates north in the wintertime. Repeatedly, Arctic explorers have observed
  bears heading north into an area where there cannot be food for them. Foxes also are found north of the 80th parallel,
  heading north, obviously well fed. Without exception, Arctic explorers agree that the further north one goes, the
  warmer it gets. Invariably a north wind brings warmer weather. Coniferous trees drift ashore from out of the north.
  Butterflies and bees are found in the far north, but never hundreds of miles further south; not until Canadian and
  Alaskan climate areas conducive to such insect life are reached.
</p>
<p>Unknown varieties of flowers are found. Birds resembling snipe, but unlike any known species of bird, come out of the
  north, and return there. Hare are plentiful in an area where no vegetation ever grows, but where vegetation appears as
  drifting debris from the northern open water. Eskimo tribes, migrating northward, have left unmistakable traces of
  their migration in their temporary camps, always advancing northward. Southern Eskimos themselves speak of tribes that
  live in the far north. The Ross gull, common at Point Barrow, migrates in October toward the North. Only Admiral
  Byrd's 'mystery land' can account for these inexplicable facts and migrations.
</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>The Scandinavian legend of a wonderful land far to the north called "Ultima Thule" (commonly confused with Greenland)
  is significant when studied in detail, because of its remarkable resemblance to the kind of land seen by Byrd, and its
  remarkable far north location. To assume that Ultima Thule is Greenland is to come face to lace with the contradiction
  of the Greenland Ice Cap, which fills the entire Greenland basin to the depth of 10,000 feet. Is Admiral Byrd's land
  of mystery, the center of the great unknown, the same as the Ultima Thule of the Scandinavian legends?
</p>
<p>
  There are mysteries concerning the Antarctic also. Perhaps the greatest is the highly technical one of biology itself;
  for on the New Zealand and South American land masses are identical fauna and flora which could not have migrated from
  one to the other, but rather are believed to have come from a common motherland. That motherland is believed to be the
  Antarctic Continent. But on a more popular level is the case of the sailing vessel 'Gladys', captained by F. B.
  Hatfield in 1893. The ship was completely surrounded by icebergs at 43 degrees south and 33 degrees west. At this
  latitude an iceberg was observed which bore a large quantity of sand and earth, and which revealed a beaten track, a
  place of refuge formed in a sheltered nook, and the bodies of five dead men who lay on different parts of the iceberg.
  Bad weather prevented any attempts at further investigation.
</p>
<p>
  An unanimous consensus of opinion among scientists is that one thing peculiar to the Antarctic is that there are no
  human tribes living upon it. Also investigation showed that no vessel was lost in the Antarctic at the time, so that
  these men could not be shipwrecked sailors. Could it be that these men who died on the berg came from `that mysterious
  land beyond the South Pole' discovered by the Byrd expedition? Had they ventured out of their warm, habitable land and
  lost their way along the ice shelf, finally to be drifted to their deaths at sea on a portion o! it, broken away to
  become an iceberg while they were on it?
