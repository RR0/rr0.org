<p>there are more reports per year now than there were in the early years of the 'flying saucer era'... [UFO reports]
  have been coming to the Air Force at the rate of better than one a day over the past fifteen years. - . the daily
  press no longer carries such reports, except perhaps as fillers, because monotonously repeated items do not constitute
  news. But it is just this repetition that is of potential scientific interest.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>The intelligence of the observers and reporters of UFO's is certainly at least average, in many cases above average,
  in some cases embarrassingly above average.</p>
<p><q>Le témoin moyen est au-dessus de la moyenne, honnête et sérieux. Aucun examen vraiment scientifique du phénomène
  ovni n'a été entrepris malgré l'énorme volume de données brutes.</q></p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>Based upon unreliable and unscientific surmises as data, the Air Force develops elaborate statistical findings which
  seem impressive to the uninitiated public unschooled in the fallacies of the statistical method. One must conclude
  that the highly publicized Air Force pronouncements based upon unsound statistics serve merely to misrepresent the
  true character of the UFO phenomena.</p>
