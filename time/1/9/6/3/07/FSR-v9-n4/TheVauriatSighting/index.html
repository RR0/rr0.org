<p class="abstract">The weirdest craft of all</p>
<p class="abstract2">In its May-June issue the <i>Flying Saucer Review</i> printed a full account of <span
    class="people">Aimé Michel</span>'s latest discovery in <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/Orthothenie.html">Orthoteny</a>.
  He demonstrated that the UFOs appeared along great world circle lines and, on occasion, returned to points along them.
  He also disclosed how he had discovered the small village of <span class="place">Vauriat</span> by extending the <span
      class="place">Bayonne</span>-<span class="place">Vichy</span> line of <time>1954-09</time> (BaVic) until it
  crossed the railway line in the Puy-de-Dôme. <span class="people">Michel</span> explained that <q>on August 29, 1962,
    in the village of Vauriat... a number of people witnessed... in broad daylight a veritable ballet dance by unknown
    craft.</q> The sighting itself, while not described in detail by <span class="people">Michel</span>, is one of the
  most bizarre that have ever been reported and warrants a full recording. The accounts that follows was taken from the
  Clermond-Ferrand newspaper <i lang="fr">La Montagne</i> of August 30, 1962, and appeared in its translated version in
  the September-October-November issue of the <i>New Zealand Scientific Space Research</i> (NZSSR) bulletin, which the
  <i>Flying Saucer Review</i> gratefully acknowledges.</p>

<p>It was just at 1.45 p.m. on Wednesday, August 29, 1962, when two people on their way back to work from lunch
  witnessed an extraordinary spectacle. The place of observation was route 50, just in front of the railway station of
  Vauriat (Puy-de-Dôme).</p>
<p>Indeed, Jean Rouchon, manager of "Pouzzolanes des Dômes", living at Champradet, Clermont-Ferrand, and Marcel Chimène,
  bricklayer, resident of Menetrol, were chatting while walking alone the road, when in the direction of
  Charbonnières-les-Vieilles they saw mysterious object rising in the air and flying towards them. But let Mr. Rouchon
  give the story in his own words: <q>The first impression I had was that of bale of straw, penetrated by pieces of
    wood. that might have been carried away by tornado —however, the trees around me were not even stirred by breath of
    wind. Suddenly, Mr. Chimène called out and showed me in the same direction three other mysterious machines, smaller
    than the first, but of identical shape. The four objects then proceeded to describe fantastic ballet over Vauriat
    station, first moving at very reduced speeds, and then at prodigious speeds. During this time, empty cement bags
    which were stored in nearby coal yard rose in the air as if sucked in by an extremely powerful breath. M. Laine, man
    working for the railways and living at Saint-ours-les-Roches, then noticed the extraordinary spectacle and called
    out to us. But already the mysterious machines, after last curve at low altitude (approximately 150 ft.), moved
    rapidly in the direction of Puy de Louchadière, behind which they disappeared. The time was then 1.55 p.m.—the
    phenomenon had lasted for 10 minutes.</q></p>
<p>Needless to say, the three witnesses of this Fantastic ballet remained dumbfounded for several minutes, in vain
  searching for logical explanation of what they had seen. The machine they had observed at closest range was the
  largest of the four. Completely irrational in design, the object was of greyish colour, its wings were transparent and
  two tentacles of sort hung from underneath "the front", resembling two legs out of all proportion. It did not resemble
  any known apparatus at present flying, as far as Mr. Rouchon, who is an experienced pilot of the Auvergne Aero-Club.
  has been able to determine.</p>

<p>General <span class="people" title="Lionel Max Chassin">L. M. Chassin</span>, previously General, Air Defence
  Co-ordinator of the Allied Air Forces (NATO) and now retired, still retains Keen interest in the mystery of the flying
  saucers. He personally enquired into the above case by writing to the witness, Rouchon, letter on September 1, 1962:
  Rouchon answered the General's letter on September 9. 1962. The reproduction of Rouchon's letter was authorised by
  General <span class="people">Chassin</span>. From the additional information Rouchon supplies in his letter (point by
  point) the questions asked him by the General are self-evident. We translate from the letter:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul type="a">
    <li>The "machines" did not make any sound. However, after the appearance of the first machine, which hovered at very
      slight altitude (apparently at less than three hundred metres from the witnesses who observed it) for more than 30
      seconds, it was overtaken and—50 it seemed—pursued bv three completely identical machines (in shape, but smaller)
      which appeared in "smooth lumps" on the horizon, coming from the direction of Pulverières (Puy-de-Dôme) travelling
      at very great speed, and trailing in their wake all kinds of debris (old empty paper cement bags. grass, straw.
      ete.) Their acceleration was instantaneous when they arrived in the proximity of the first machine, and it was at
      this moment that my friend Chimène and heard kind of whistling noise, in all respects similar to that which
      violent wind would produce in rigging, or in the tops of forest of pine trees. We attributed this whistling to the
      "machines" displacement of air, ruffled by their passage. Apart from this whistling. which only lasted while, we
      absolutely did not hear any other noise in the course of the machines? movements which carried on for 10
      minutes.</li>
    <li>The machines did not emit any perceptible light in full sunshine, in blue early afternoon sky devoid of any
      cloud. Although they appeared to be of dull colour (dark grey) we did not notice any metallic brightness, as was
      the case with an airliner that crossed the sky from north to south—just prior to the disappearance of the last
      machine—and which glittered with vivid silver brightness. We had it in our field of vision at the same time as the
      last "machine" moved away, and we, therefore, were in position to note the difference between the two moving
      objects simultaneously. However, my friend Chimène believes that he noticed the transparent wings "enveloping" in
      some way the "beams" which penetrated the "machines" on all sides. According to him, these transparent "wings"
      occasionally sparkled in the sun, in the course of the "machines" movements. Personally, I only saw the "beams" of
      dark colour, and the appendages which I described as "legs" and which hung underneath the "machines" body like
      ordinary waterpipes, animated bv slow movements. The shape—the apparent lack of inertia of these "machines"—the
      instantaneous changes in course which characterised them—the absence of all noise in the course of their movements
      and their fixed points ... all that made us think of absurd objects, not answering to any of the known laws of
      gravity, inertia and aero-dynamics. Likewise it was impossible to say whether it concerned real machines,
      incomprehensible objects or fantastic animals. I confess that if I had been the only witness to this startling
      spectacle, I believe I would not have talked. Likewise, in order to be sure that my eves did deceive me, I made
      drawing of what I had seen and also took notes of that which I observed as soon as got back in my office, 200
      metres away. Ah... how do regret not having had camera at my disposal at that very moment. There is no doubt that
      the film I could have taken would have proved to be of extraordinary scientific interest!</li>
    <li>The first "machine" seen, at the very moment we observed it, moved at speed of approx. 200/300 km.p.h., while it
      rose slightly and turned lightly about its own axis, approx. 90 degrees to the left and to the right. It
      stabilised its ascent at height of approx. 150/200 metres, now motionless, now describing more or less regular
      circles at an apparent speed varying between 100/300 km.ph. This was the best moment to observe it and to make all
      kinds of suppositions and comparisons with the "known" in regard to its identification and origin. Suddenly my
      friend Chimène gripped my arm and said: <q>Look, Jean... what's coming up on the left!</q> And saw three things
      identical to the first "machine" but smaller, moving at terrific speed, with no apparent formation between them,
      making straight for the first "machine" as if they tried to attack it from below. The "target", stationary at the
      moment of this sudden "attack", dodged by climbing instantaneously at prodigious speed. Next, the four "objects"
      appeared to play amongst themselves, following course of dodges and instantaneous changes of direction. In order
      to give vou an idea of the spectacle, think of houseflies pursuing each other, such as one can observe in ray of
      sunlight penetrating dark room. Suddenly, the first object rose in the sky at an extraordinary climbing speed (one
      literally saw its mass dissolve in the sky) with the three other objects in pursuit. Before long, this object was
      not much more than black speck, while the three other smaller pursuers disappeared before our eyes. The latter
      were not seen again.<br/> On the other hand the small black speck, which we still observed, grew larger and larger
      at disconcerting speed and, still without noise, stopped all of sudden at height of approx. 300 metres. Next, it
      slowly rocked little for two or three times and then, still at great speed, moved away in the direction of
      Clermont-Ferrand, gaining height steadily, like a plane piloted by good captain.<br/> Suddenly, we heard and saw
      the airliner which, seen from where we were, seemed to have eut the trajectory of the object, The latter continued
      in the direction of the plane and we were just about expecting them to meet, when we were witness to the rapid
      ascent of the object which, at an unheard-of speed, disappeared in the blue sky.</li>
    <li>The different movements of the "objects" appeared to us co-ordinated as whole, although, taken separately, they
      would appear disorderly at certain moments (e.g. when the first object—on its own—without apparent reason,
      described more or less regular circles at speeds varying from moment to moment, while it climbed or descended
      suddenly). It should be noted that the estimates of height and distance of the objects can only be very
      approximate, considering that—for start—one does not know the real dimensions of the objects.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Trusting that the above details will be of help, Lam. General. yours sincerely.</p>
  <p>(Signed) JEAN ROUCHOX.</p></blockquote>
