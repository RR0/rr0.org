<p>We tend to believe that until <time>1453</time>, when the capture of Constantinople by the Turks expelled the Greek
  scholars westwards to usher in the glorious Renaissance, Europe lived in a vacuum, where nothing happened; we are
  astonished to learn that in fact this period was fermented by an intellectual unrest comparable with our own unsettled
  century. A single spiritual dynamism drove Peter the Hermit to set in motion two centuries of Crusades for the Holy
  Sepulchre, a quixotic enterprise. which inspired and taxed men more than our attempt to land on the moon. [n the
  twelfth and thirteenth centuries feudal society was breaking down. monastic orders were founded, masons built
  cathedrals incorporating in the stonework arcane wisdom like those builders of the Pyramids. alchemists in their quest
  for the Philosopher's Stone transmuting metals to gold appear to have stumbled on some of the secrets of our own
  nuclear physics. famous universities were founded, the troubadours were distilling love into life and religion. The
  Church waged desperate conflict for survival against heresy. witchcraft and its own depravities.</p>
<p>Cosmology still followed Ptolemy's system of epicycles and concentric spheres, poetically exemplified in Dante's <i>Divine
  Comedy</i>, wherein the Poet describes the Moon peopled by Spirits of inconstancy. Mercury. ambition. <a

  justice. Saturn, temperance. the stars. souls, and the celestial vault with Angels. beyond which transcending space
  and time exists the Heaven of Light and Love. wherein the Spirit of God Himself abides. This medieval conception of
  the universe amuses our scientific minds until suddenly we are struck by its affinity with the teachings alleged by
  our modern Spacemen, and we wonder. We are surprised to learn that at this time Siger of Brabant taught the
  periodically recurring cycle of events, everything happening over and over again, universe after universe, that
  ancient theory of Eternal Recurrence. propounded lately by Gurdjieff and Ouspensky. Astrology had persisted since the
  Roman Empire. the Arabs brought back to Europe the teachings of the Greeks; for centuries the Christian Church had
  accepted Plato's assertion that the visible world was only an imperfect copy of the transcendent universe. In the 13th
  century this became superseded by the Aristotelian doctrine that the universe around us is real and should be studied.
  Such a vital conception stimulated thinkers like Albertus Magnus. Robert Grossteste and Roger Bacon to defy the Church
  and to lay the foundations for an empirical natural science; fanciful astrology thus developed into practical
  astronomy, which swung to arid materialism and until our own last thrilling decade depopulated the universe to a
  sterile waste confining life to a tiny Earth.</p>

  <h2>Zealous recorders</h2>
  <p>Troubadours from gay Provence sang Chansons de Geste, of courtly Knights and Ladies fair; Chaucer told of the
    Canterbury Pilgrims; later Sir Thomas Malory resurrected King Arthur, Merlin and the Round Table; all revealing a
    magical world, where reality mingled with phantasy in glorious romance. Actual history was left to wandering
    scholars like Gervase of Tilbury, Matthew of Paris, William of Newbury, Giraldus Cambrensis, and Walter Map, who
    chronicled not only the turbulent strife between Emperor and Pope but also recorded phenomena in the heavens with a
    zeal worthy of classical <span class="people">Julius Obsequens</span> and our inimitable Charles Fort; research into
    these mediaeval chronicles startlingly illumines the revelations of our own flying saucer students.</p>

  <h2>A curious incident</h2>
  <p>Gervase of Tilbury, a scholarly adventurer, saw service under our Henry II, wandered through Europe and found
    employment under Emperor Otto IV, for whose delection about A.D. En <time>1211</time> he wrote his Otia Imperialia
    or
    Imperial Trifles, an assembly of marvels, folklore and table-talk of the age. Today this book is extremely rare, no
    copy is believed to exist in England. There are only two or three in Europe. For the following translation, possibly
    the first in English, the present writer had to borrow the volume from the University Library at Hanover. In Book J,
    Chapter XIII, "De Mari," Gervase is writing about "The Sea time and place are not specifically mentioned but the
    subsequent anecdote alleging the teleportation of a knife across the Irish Sea. infers that the incident the
    chronicler now describes occurred at the beginning of the thirteenth century at Bristol, <q>an opulent city filled
      with most wealthy citizens.</q> In his curious mediaeval Latin Gervase narrates as follows: There are some, who
    say that the land is in the centre, in the middle of the circumference, with each part equally distant at the
    extremities, surrounded by sea and encompassed according to the commandments of the Third Day: <q>He gathered
      together the waters under the heavens unto one place and there appeared dry land.</q></p>
  <p><q>There befell in our own times a demonstration from the seas above us, a new revelation appearing from aloft,
    quite wonderful. It was truly on the observance of a feast day in Greater Britain, after the people had heard solemn
    Mass in the church, the crowd were dispersing here and there. at that particular time it was misty because of many
    clouds and somewhat obscure. Then appeared the anchor of a ship, which after circling around seven times became
    fastened below a mound of stones with the rope stretched out hanging in the air. The people broke into clamour, and
    as some of them were talking of this, they saw the rope move as though someone was striving to free the anchor.
    However, despite much effort spent, it did not give way, then a voice was heard in the dense air like the shout of
    sailors to recall the anchor, which had been thrown and stretched out. With no delay, deceived by the promise of the
    task, they sent one of their own sailors, who climbed down in the way our seamen do by clinging to the anchor rope
    and descending changing hand over hand. And when he had already released the anchor, he was seized by the
    by-standers and pushed about from hand to hand as though he were shipwrecked at sea. Suffocated by the mist of our
    moist atmosphere he expired. But then the sailors above took counsel on their ship-wrecked comrade, after the space
    of one hour, they cut off the anchor rope and leaving the anchor sailed away. In memory of this happening, after
    careful consideration, from the anchor was wrought that iron grille for the doors of the basilica, which stand open
    for the public to look at.</q></p>
  <p>Gervase of Tilbury does not express astonishment at these sailors from the skies, he relates the incident in terse
    journalistic style as though reporting an actual occurrence resisting the temptation to embellish his story with
    phantasy or to guess details obscured by the mist. He states that the sailor, rather the Spaceman, was of human
    proportions, spoke an articulate language, behaved with skill but succumbed to our Earth's dense atmosphere ; the
    rope and metal anchor were apparently similar to those in use on Earth. The implied competence of the Spacemen may
    not be very impressive, but this somewhat endears them to us and perhaps supports the stories told by those who
    allege contact with them today that the Spacepeople are basically much like ourselves.</p>

  <h2>More anecdotes</h2>
  <p>This remarkable incident recalls the account of <span class="people">Agobard</span>, Archbishop of Lyons, who wrote
    in De Grandine et Tonitrua how in <time>840</time> A.D. he found the mob in Lyons lynching three men and a woman
    accused of landing from a cloudship from the aerial region of Magonia. The great German philologist, Jacob Grimm,
    about <time>1820</time> described a ship from the clouds, and Montanus, an eighteenth century writer on German
    folklore, told of wizards flying in the clouds, who were shot down. The belief in Beings from the skies who surveyed
    our Earth persisted in human consciousness throughout all the Middle Ages.</p>
  <p>The Benedictine monk, Matthew of Paris, writing in the Monastery of St. Albans until his death in 1259 chronicled
    in his <i lang="lat">Historica Anglorum</i> about sixty intriguing phenomena, emulated by William of Newburgh in
    Yorkshire, who wrote Historia Anglicana dying in <time>1208</time>, and by <i lang="lat">Nugis Curialium</i>, a
    miscellany of Walter Map. compiler of De anecdotes about the reign of Henry II.</p>
  <p>Translations of their works, unobtainable in English, reveal much fascinating data, which would appear fo suggest a
    survey by Extraterrestrials throughout the Middle Ages.</p>
  <p>Le <time>1077-04-09</time> A.D. <q>Now in this year on Palm Sunday about six o'clock in a sky quite serene an
    immense
    star appeared near the sun.</q> <cite>Matthew of Paris</cite>.</p>
  <p>En <time>1110</time> A.D. <q>Now in this year a comet appeared in an unusual manner for rushing from the east it
    ascended to the heavens, it was seen to go not forward but backwards.</q> <cite>Matthew of Paris</cite>.</p>
  <p>En <time>1120</time> A.D. <q>Now in this year on the 13th of May a celestial light came over the Sepulchre of Our
    Lord.</q> <cite>Matthew of Paris</cite>.</p>
  <p>En <time>1189</time> A.D. <q>In the terrible silence a surpassing and greatly astonishing prodigy was seen about
    this
    time in England by many who up to the present time bear witness to those who did not see it. Above the public road
    which continued to London, a village by no means wretched called Dunstaple, by chance, so to speak, an hour after
    noon, those who looked up at the sky saw in the serene vault of heaven the striking shaipe of the Emblem of Our Lord
    with a dazzling milk-like whiteness and the conjoined form of a man crucified, which is painted in Church to the
    memory of the Passion of Our Lord and the devotion of the Faithful.</q> <cite>William of Newburgh</cite>.</p>
  <p>En <time>1200</time> A.D. <q>It was said a warning letter sent to Farth from God in Heaven, which men prophesied,
    hung
    in the lofty air for three days and nights, and everyone fell on the ground praying that this prodigy would forbode
    good to this world. And descending on Jerusalem it hung above the altar of St. Simon in Golgotha, where Jesus Christ
    was crucified.</q> <cite>Matthew of Paris</cite>.</p>
  <p>En <time>1227</time> A.D. <q>About this time when Master Oliver was preaching (for the Crusades) in Germany there
    appeared to all the people a Crucifix manifesting in the air about which sealed letters were sent under seal by
    several prelates to the University of Paris and read aloud to the public</q> <cite>Matthew of Paris.</cite></p>
  <p>(These crucifixes in the air in <time>1189</time> A.D. and <time>1227</time> A.D. recall the famous cross in the
    sky near Rome in <time>312</time> A.D., which inspired Constantine to support the Christians and to establish
    Christianity as the Roman State religion. Had it not been for that phenomenon, possibly a spaceship, Christianity
    might not have triumphed!)</p>
  <p>En <time>1228</time> A.D. <q>At that time the news was dispersed far and wide about Joseph Cartaphilus, whom
    Ananias
    baptised and who saw Christ crucified.</q> <cite>Matthew of Paris.</cite></p>
  <p>En <time>1236</time> A.D. <q>About this time in the month of May along the borders of England and Wales there
    appeared
    portents in the sky of armed soldiers, superbly although hostilely congregated. This is seen to be incredible to all
    who hear this, unless the same thing is read in the beginning of Maccabees. The identical prodigy was seen in the
    heavens assembled in Ireland, of which apparition we are taught by a certain close relative of the Duke of
    Gloucester.</q> <cite>Matthew of Paris.</cite></p>
  <p>We are infinitely obliged to this old Latin history of Matthew of Paris for drawing our attention to the Apocrypha
    to the Old Testament, the Second Book of Maccabees, Chapter V, verses 1 to 3 dealing with <time>-170</time></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>About the same time Antiochus prepared his second voyage into Egypt.</p>
    <p>And then it happened, through all the city for the space of almost forty days, there were seen horsemen running
      in the air, in cloth of gold, and armed with lances running like a band of soldiers.</p>
    <p>And troops of horsemen in array encountering and running one against another, with shaking of shields, and
      multitude of pikes, and drawing of swords, and casting of darts, and glittering of golden ornaments and harness of
      all sorts.</p>
    <p>Whereof every man prayed that apparition might turn to good.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(When we recall, that the Red Indians thought of a railway-engine as an iron horse, we can understand the
    'primitive Jews remembering the manoeuvres of spaceships as a cavalry battle.)</p>
  <p>Similar portents in the skies are reported by Josephus to have preceded the destruction of Jerusalem about
    <time>70</time> A.D. by the Romans, and similar signs may be looked for before the Coming of Christ, according to
    St. Matthew XXIV, v.29, St. Luke XXI, v.25 and Revelations VI, v.12.</p></section>
<p>The student of mediaeval literature is amazed by the parallel between the wonders of the Middle Ages and the flying
  saucer phenomena abounding today. Surely a vast and marvellous insight into extra-terrestrial influence on Earth is
  evoked by those magic chronicles of the Middle Ages?</p>
