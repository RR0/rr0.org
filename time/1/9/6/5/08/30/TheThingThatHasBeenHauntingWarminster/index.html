<p>For two days, after a meeting in the Town Hall to bury the rumours about the mysterious objects and sounds seen in
  the Wiltshire sky, about 90 people, including a party of Park Grammar School, Swindon, boys were keeping an all-night
  vigil.</p>
<p>Christopher Robinson (14), one of the Thing from Outer Space observers from Park Grammar School, said "In a blinding
  flash of light, it seemed to explode and divide into two brighter portions. Either that or the first simply vanished
  and was replaced by two others above."</p>
<p>Another Park Grammar School boy, Graham Challifour, said: "Other people must surely have seen them. It made me
  tremble for quite a while".</p>
<p>"It was a wonderful and stirring spectacle. The last two objects kept changing their speed and altering their
  course".</p>
<p>Norman Leighton (14), also from the school, said: "These two zigzagged to and from, jerked up and down rapidly, then
  sped across the sky at an angle of 45 degrees, before disappearing from view".</p>
<p>His friend, Christopher Crooks-Radford (14), said: "This last one was visible for a good minute or more. There was
  no sound and no sign of coloured landing lights so they were definitely not planes.</p>
<p>"They were not shooting stars as Iõve seen plenty of those in the past".</p>
