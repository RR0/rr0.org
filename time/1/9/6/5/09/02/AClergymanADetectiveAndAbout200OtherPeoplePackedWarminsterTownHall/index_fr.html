<p>It was called in an attempt to clear up the mystery which has been troubling Warminster for les 8 derniers mois. If
  it did not succeed then at least it provided those present with a convincing apology for an extra terrestrial
  intelligence. </p>
<p>Witnesses have reported unidentified flying objects like 'twin red hot pokers or 'cat's eyes' which have crackled and
  buzzed. One person has likened the noise to that made by a refrigerator. And at Friday's meeting a Warminster woman
  told a large attentive audience bathed in television arc lights of the night she was wakened by the noise.</p>
<p><q>"I went to the bedroom window and saw this brilliant object quite low in the sky. It was travelling very slowly. I
  was shaking like a leaf and it went on for half an hour. "I have never heard a sound like it before. It was like a
  brilliant star and I couldnõt take my eyes off it." </q></p>
<h2>ALIEN BEINGS</h2>
<p>Chairman of the meeting was Coun Emlyn Rees, chairman of Warminster Urban Council. With him on the platform was Dr
  Cleary Baker, evaluation officer of the British Unidentified Flying Objects Research Association and editor of its
  journal, and the Rev L Inge, Rector of Orcheston. </p>
<p>Dr Baker told the meeting. "I think that most of us (the members of his Association) would say that merely on the
  basis of the evidence with which we are dealing this is the manifestation of an advanced technology from somewhere.
  The craft were piloted by 'alien beings.' </p>
<p>He suggested that they were not interested in Warminster as such but in things like the War Department rocket ranges
  and the Chemical Warfare Establishment at Porton &ETH; and were using a large hill outside the town as a homing
  beacon. There was no need for the townspeople to be frightened. Their investigations might be of 'immense value.'</p>
<p>"If you help us we may take a substantial step forward in understanding the universe in which we live," said Dr
  Baker. Before the meeting broke up, those of the public interested in establishing a listening post on the downs
  outside Warminster, were asked to give their names to a member of the UFO Research Association.</p>
