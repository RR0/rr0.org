  <p>Mr. Heflin said he carried a camera with him for his work, and that during the time the object was in sight he was
    able to take the three pictures. </p>
  <p>During the time the object was near, Mr. Helfin said, he tried to communicate with his supervisor over a two-way
    radio in his vehicle, but the radio was inoperative. He said the radio has since worked perfectly. </p>
  <p>Despite the object's proximity to the Marine base, radar operators failed to report any mysterious identification
    on Aug. 3. </p>
  <p>Mr. Helfin said he was willing to take a lie-detector test in reply to skeptics who may say the pictures are the
    products of trick photography. </p>
