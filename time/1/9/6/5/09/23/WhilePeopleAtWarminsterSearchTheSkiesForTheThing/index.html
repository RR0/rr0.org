<p> Mrs Eileen Hunt, of 3 Gascelyn Close, Chippenham, told a Gazette and Herald reporter that she had seen The Thing on
  Tuesday night and at first thought it was a very bright star but then realised it could not have been when it suddenly
  moved away.</p>
<p> It was between 7.15pm and 7.45pm that she saw it.</p>
<p>"We were sitting in the dining room when we saw out of the window what appeared to be very large bright star, but
  there was not another star in the sky to be seen. It was low in the sky in the direction of Bath and remained
  stationary for about 10 minutes."</p>
<p> She called her elder son Roger who watched it for some time. "I suggested he took a photograph but he said it was
  too dark.</p>
<p>"Then suddenly it came low and glided off", said Mrs Hunt. It went so low that her younger son Steven had to stand on
  a chair to continue watching it.</p>
<p> Mrs Hunt told her husband who suggested it might have been a military object.</p>
<p> Chippenham police stated they had received no reports of any strange objects having been seen.</p>
