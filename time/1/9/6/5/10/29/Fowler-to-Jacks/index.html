<p>Dear Major Jacks:</p>
<p>This is a formal enquiry concerning the official USAF evaluation of the detailed UFO Report I submitted to
  AFSC-FTD/<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook/index.html">Project Bluebook</a> last month. My
  Investigation and subsequent report took place shortly after the official USAF Investigating Team from Pease AFB made
  their investigation.
</p>
<p><a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Exeter/index.html">The UFO sighting</a> took place between the Clyde
  Russell and Carl Dining properties along Route #150 in Kensington, H. N. on September 3, 1965 in the early hours of
  the morning. The witnesses were Korean Muscarello and Officers Bertrand and Hunt ef the Exeter, N. H. police force.
</p>
<p> In 1964 I customarily received correspondence trcm your office in response to UFO reports submitted to the USAF for
  evaluation. This was appreciated. I have submitted many reports since but have not received any response. This is
  understandable due to the many reports received by the USAF and I do not expect such a service on your part normally,
  but, I did spent a great deal of time and thought on the Kensington, N. H. report and would appreciate your sending
  the official USAF evaluation of the same as-soon-as-possible. I understand the evaluation has been made.
</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation in this matter. I look forward to hearing tram your office soon.</p>
