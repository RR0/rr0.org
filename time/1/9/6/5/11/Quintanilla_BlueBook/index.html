    Hampshire </p>
    <p>Gentlemen, </p>
    <p><a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Exeter/index.html">The sighting of various unidentified objects by
      you and Mr Norman Muscarello</a> was investigated by officials from Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire, and their
      report has been forwarded to our office at <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html">Wright-Patterson Air
        Force Base</a>. This sighting at Exeter, New Hampshire, on the night of 2 September has been given considerable
      publicity through various news releases and in magazine articles similar to that from the "Saturday Review" of 2
      <a href="../../10/index.html">October 1965</a>. A portion of this article is attached for your information. This
      information was released by the <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">National Investigations Committee on
        Aerial Phenomena</a>, a private organization which has no connection with the government. As a result of these
      articles, the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a> has received inquiry as to the cause of this
      report. </p>
    <p>Our Investigation and evaluation of this sighting indicates a possible association with an 8th Air Force
      operation, "Big Blast.'' In addition to aircraft from this operation, there were five B-47 type aircraft flying in
      the area during this period. Before a final evaluation of your sighting can be made, it is essential for us to
      know if either of you witnessed any aircraft in the area during this time period either independently or in
      connection with the objects observed. Since there were many aircraft in the area, at that time, and there were no
      reports of unidentified objects from personnel engaged in this air operation, we might then assume that the
      objects observed between midnight and 2 A. M. might be associated with this military air operation. If, however,
      these aircraft were noted by either of you, then this would tend to eliminate this air operation as a plausible
      explanation for the objects observed. </p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
