<p>Mr Eugene F Bertrand Jr<br/> Mr David R Hunt <br/> Exeter Police Department <br/> Exeter, Hew Hampshire </p>
<p>Gentlemen, </p>
<p><a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Exeter/index.html">The sighting of various unidentified objects by you
  and Mr Norman Muscarello</a> was investigated by officials from Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire, and their report
  has been forwarded to our office at <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</a>.
  This sighting at Exeter, New Hampshire, on the night of 2 September has been given considerable publicity through
  various news releases and in magazine articles similar to that from the "Saturday Review" of <time>1965-10-02</time>.
  A portion of this article is attached for your information. This information was released by the <a
    href="/org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena</a>, a private
  organization which has no connection with the government. As a result of these articles, the <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a> has received inquiry as to the cause of this report. </p>
<p>Our Investigation and evaluation of this sighting indicates a possible association with an 8th Air Force operation,
  "Big Blast.'' In addition to aircraft from this operation, there were five B-47 type aircraft flying in the area
  during this period. Before a final evaluation of your sighting can be made, it is essential for us to know if either
  of you witnessed any aircraft in the area during this time period either independently or in connection with the
  objects observed. Since there were many aircraft in the area, at that time, and there were no reports of unidentified
  objects from personnel engaged in this air operation, we might then assume that the objects observed between midnight
  and 2 A.Â M. might be associated with this military air operation. If, however, these aircraft were noted by either of
  you, then this would tend to eliminate this air operation as a plausible explanation for the objects observed. </p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
