<p>"It was very large, and moving extremely fast," one of the girls, Mrs Pam Gills, said. She and her colleague, Miss
  Eileen Webb, watched the object move across the sky from Faringdon and after only a few seconds, disappear behind
  White Horse Hill.</p>
<p> "It was not a plane, because the light did not flash on and off, and it was much too big", went on Mrs Gills. "I
  have never seen anything like it, we discussed it all day". </p>
<p>A spokesman for the Operations Department of RAF Abingdon, in whose area White Horse Hill and Wantage appear, told a
  Gazette and Herald reporter that they had received no other reports of the object which Mrs Gills and Miss Webb saw
  about 6.30am on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"It was too early in the morning to be anything belonging to us", he added. "I haven't any idea what it was". </p>
<p>A spokesman for the Royal Signals base at Bampton, near Faringdon, said they had not any tracking equipment, and thus
  could not offer any help. So the comet, or meteor, or flying saucer, or whatever it was, remains a mystery.</p>
