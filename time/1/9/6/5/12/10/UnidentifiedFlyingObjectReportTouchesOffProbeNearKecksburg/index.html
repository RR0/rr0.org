<p>An eight-year-old boy, his mother, the Pennsylvania State Police and the military all added up to mystery Thursday
  night and early Friday morning in a wooded area near Kecksburg in Westmoreland County.</p>
<p>It all started when an unidentified flying object (UFO) was reported sighted by the son of Mr. and Mrs. Arnold Kalp
  of Acme RD 1.</p>
<p>"Nevin saw it first," Mrs. Kalp told me as we stood along a dirt road near the woods where State Police and Army
  officials apparently were searching for an "object".</p>

  <h2>Like Flaming Star</h2>
  <p>"He said it looked like a flaming star. It left a trail of flames behind it and fell in the woods," she added,
    pointing to the spot where her son said the UFO had fallen.</p>
  <p>"Then I came out to look and I saw some smoke. Then it turned sort of cloudy, and went away almost like it buried
    itself in the ground."</p>
  <p>Mrs. Kalp's story was told to me and other reporters more than five hours after the first report of the UFO was
    received.</p>
  <p>After she saw the smoke, about 4:45 p.m., she heard a radio report that said an airplane has possibly crashed into
    the woods. So, Mrs. Kalp explained, she phoned the radio station to report that no plane had fallen, just the
    fireball.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Kalp told reporters that she had been told by a Navy officer not to "tell anyone where it happened" until the
    area was sealed and an investigation begun.</p>
  <p>"I never received so many phone calls in my whole life," she said. "Finally I just let it ring, then lifted up the
    receiver and put it back down. The state police had to clear the line to talk to me."</p>
  <p>When I arrived near the scene of the sighting with Photographer Jim Downs, we were denied entrance to the road
    leading to the area where the UFO had reportedly fallen.</p>
  <p>"We've been ordered by the state police and the army not to let anybody in," explained Dale Howard, a Kecksburg
    volunteer fire policeman.</p></section>

  <h2>Lights Seen</h2>
  <p>Then, while at Howard's home using the telephone, Jim Mayes of Mammoth walked in and said he and six other fellows
    had seen three blue flashing lights near the area of the earlier sighting.</p>
  <p>We went into the field (Downs and I) with Mayes and Howard to look for the lights.</p>
  <p>There were none.</p>
  <p>Then the state police returned along with military officials. This time they went into the woods from the field
    where we had searched, apparently looking for the UFO.</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Nothing There</h2>
  <p>A state trooper apparently assigned to handle the huge crowd that had formed then reported that "all search results
    are negative as far as we know, there's nothing there so far."</p>
  <p>He said officers had left earlier "because we were satisfied that nothing was there. We returned because somebody
    reported seeing three huge flashing lights in the area."</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Felt Impact</h2>
  <p>As for Howard, who lives about a mile from the scene, he said he did not see the UFO, but felt the impact. "It
    caused a vibration here at home," he told me. "It hit with a big thump."</p>
  <p>The last search party, which included three military men and State Police Fire Marshal Carl Metz, could be seen
    from the road where we stood, searching the area with flashlights. </p></section>
