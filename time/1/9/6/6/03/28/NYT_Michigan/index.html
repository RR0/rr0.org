<p>BAD AXE, Mich., March 27 (AP) &#8212; More unidentified flying objects were reported in Michigan last night.</p>
<p>Three policemen in this little community reported watching a bright blue light over Lake Huron for about half an hour
  early today. One, Peter Torres, described the object as very large and moving too fast to be a star.</p>
<p>Cpt. Frank Lyon of the State Police, who did not see it, speculated the object might be a weather balloon. He said it
  was not uncommon for balloons released at Sioux Falls, S. D., to drift over the area.</p>
<p>Thousands of residents of Hillsdale County, just north of Ohio, watched a couple of lights high above them for
  several hours last night. Among them was Dave Keister, assistant manager of Hillsdale radio station WCSR.</p>
<p><q>I just don't think it was a star</q>, said Mr. Keister, who looked at one through binoculars for some time. He
  said he could not estimate the size of the objects and added that they appeared to change in color from white to red
  to orange to green.</p>
<p><q>They gave the impression that they might be rotating</q>, he said. </p>
<p>Dr. <span class="people">Josef Allen Hynek</span>, a Northwestern University astrophysicist and scientific consultant
  for the Air Force, said Friday that <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Hillsdale">phenomena reported at
    Hillsdale</a> and at Dexter, Mich., on March 20, were probably swamp gases.</p>
