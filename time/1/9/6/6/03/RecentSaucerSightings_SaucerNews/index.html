    NEW HAMPSHIRE SIGHTINGS</a>: Since publication of our December 1965 issue, we have received a good deal of
    additional material concerning our lead story in the "Recent News" section, which in our opinion is one of the most
    impressive UFO incidents of recent years. Here is Norman Muscarello's story, as quoted in the Rockingham County
    Gazette:</p>
    <p>"It was about 2 a.m. on Friday, September 3rd, I mas walking along Route 150 in Kensington (N.H.) on my way home
      from a visit to a friend in Amesbury. As I approached the Clyde Russell house, I saw a 'thing' with brilliant red

      unable to wake anybody. Then a car came along, and I was given a ride to the Exeter police station. I told them
      what I had seen, and someone suggested that a return to the area.</p>
    <p> "Officer Bertrand took me in one cruiser, and Officer Hunt arrived in another. We walked down into the field,
      but didn't see anything. As we were about ready to return to the cruisers, I noticed the alternating lights down
      in back of some trees. It came out at tremendous speed, and we all had a good opportunity to observe it.</p>
