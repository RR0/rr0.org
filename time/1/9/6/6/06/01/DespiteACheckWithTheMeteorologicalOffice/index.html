<p>An ex-Army man, Mr Spencer was trained in basic aircraft identification. He told me: "My wife and I saw this
  extremely odd object the other night. It took two minutes to travel across the sky due south.</p>
<p>"At first we thought it was a shooting star, but the intensity of light was much brighter than that of any plane. I
  have had a talk with the Met Office and they said it could have been an American weather satellite.</p>
<p>"It travelled across the sky in a curve, and when my wife fetched her binoculars she said it looked like a spherical
  object.</p>
<p>It did not make any noise." Mr Spencer said that he never really thought about flying saucers before seeing this
  object, and even now he is keeping a strictly open mind about them.</p>
<p> But an object that travels across the sky - from horizon to horizon - in less than two minutes, wavers from side to
  side and is brighter than any star or aircraft light, is something that remains to be satisfactorily explained.</p>
