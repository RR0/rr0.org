<p> Photographs of the mysterious object in the sky were taken by 20-year-old Miss Gill Holton of Shelley Street,
  Swindon at about 10.15pm. But a spokesman for RAF Lyneham said that the pictures were probably of a Comet aircraft
  which was on a training flight. </p>
<p> The Comet was in the air between 9.30pm and 10.45pm and could well have been over Swindon at 10.15pm. As it was
  making practice approaches, it may have had its landing lights on. </p>
<p>Gill, a clerk at The College said: "I noticed two bright lights that looked like car headlights coming towards me in
  the sky. There was no sound so I thought it could not be a plane. Anyway, it was going so fast.</p>
<p>"I ran indoors grabbed my camera and took some photographs. By this time it had got over and started to go up. Then
  it got smaller and just vanished.</p>
<p>"The whole thing took just about two minutes. The object was going from east to west and then it went upwards." </p>
<p>The RAF spokesman said the Comet aircraft would be flying at about 1,000 or 1,500ft.</p>
<p>"It is not normal to put its landing lights on over Swindon, but someone may have done so as part of the
  training."</p>
