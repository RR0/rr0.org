<p>WASHINGTON, July 14 (AP) ? The <a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a> intends to make contracts
  with universities to provide scientific teams to investigate promptly and in depth sightings of unidentified flying
  objects.</p>
<p>The <a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a> said today that no schools had been chosen and the number to be
  used in the investigations was still indefinite.</p>
<p>A scientific advisory board recommended last March that this course of action be followed by the Air Force, which has
  pledge to strengthen studies of reports it receives on such objects. </p>
