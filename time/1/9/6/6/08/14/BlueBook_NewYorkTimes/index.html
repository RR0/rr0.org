  </table><p>In obvious response to public disquiet regarding recent "flying saucer" reports, the <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a> is organizing a new approach to the problem.</p>
  <p>It is seeking to contract with a leading university to undertake a program of intensive investigations of a certain
    number of such reports.</p>
  <p>The identity of the university will not be made public until the arrangement is final, but Air Force sources said
    it was an institution of sufficient stature to guarantee n the public mind that its inquiry would be impartial.</p>
  <p>The investigating teams are to include at least one physical scientist, such as an astronomer or someone familiar
    with atmospheric physics. Significantly, there will also be a psychologist, preferably one with clinical
    experience.</p>
  <p>This marks a departure from past Air Force policy. It has not taken very seriously the thousands of reports of <q>unidentified
    flying objects</q>, or UFO's, that have come in during the last two decades.</p>

    this year furnished a conventional explanation for all but 646 of them. The remainder were classed as unidentifiable
    for lack of adequate information.</p>
  <p>The explanations have ranged from weather balloons to swamp gas. The latter was cited to explain strange glowing
    lights reported at two points in Michigan last March.</p>
  <p>In both cases they were (...) </p>
