<p>CHICAGO, Sept 17 (UPI) ? An Illinois astronomer has criticized what he calls the failure to investigate persistent
  reports of unidentified flying objects despite the fact that sightings of many <q>flying saucers</q> remain
  unexplained.</p>
<p>Dr. <a href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen/index.html">J. Allen Hynek</a>, chairman of Northwestern University's
  department of astronomy and a consultant to the Air Force on the subject, cited what he called the <q>persistent and
    disturbing phenomenon</q>. </p>
<p>In a letter to Science magazine, he called for a scientific investigation to dispel <q>20 years of confusion</q>.
</p>
<p>He accused scientists of shying away from study of the objects for fear of <q>injuring their professional
  standing</q>. </p>
<p>Many sightings can be explained as natural phenomena, Dr. <a href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen/index.html">Hynek</a>
  said, but a sizable number defy explanation.</p>
<p>Dr. <a href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen/index.html">Hynek</a> said it was a fallacy to assume that all reports were
  the work of <q>hysteries or crackpots or cranks</q>, or the product of uneducated or unreliable people. </p>
