<p>Flying saucers once again have zoomed back into the public eye-or imagination. In the first six months of this year
  the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, the official registrar of Unidentified Flying Objects, has duly noted 508 UFO
  "sightings." Saturday Review columnist and UFO believer John Fuller's "Incident at Exeter" has been sharing space on
  the best-seller lists with former radio announcer Frank Edwards' book "Flying Saucers-Serious Business." And just last
  week Fuller began a two-part story in Look magazine recounting the terrifying two hours that a New Hampshire couple
  claim they spent being interrogated aboard a flying saucer</p>
<p>The Air Force has been chasing-and usually shooting down-such stories since the late 1940s. The issue has always
  seemed clear-cut: on the one side, the excited believers or someone with a story to sell; on the other side, the sober
  scientific Establishment which explained away alleged sightings as weather balloons, birds, jet aircraft, cloud
  formations or even ball lightning <font size="-1">(NEWSWEEK, Sept. 5, 1966)</font>. But last week one of the leading
  Establishment members seemed to be defecting to the other side. No less a figure than J. Allen Hynek, the Northwestern
  University astrophysicist and the Air Force's own UFO consultant, believes something's up. "There is a phenomenon
  here," Hynek says. "I've studied this for eighteen years and it's not all nonsense." </p>
<p>In a letter to the authoritative journal Science, to be published this month, Hynek calls upon reputable scientists
  to investigate UFO's seriously. "I'm not saying we are being visited by extraterrestrial beings," Hynek told
  Newsweek's Richard Steele, "but I believe it is one of the possibilities and I think we should hold an open mind about
  it. It would be provincial to believe we are the only intelligent beings in the universe." UFO's might even be,
  according to Hynek, "something entirely new to science. Where would you have gotten in 1866," he asks, "if you had
  talked to a scientists about nuclear energy?"</p>
<p>Unlike the true UFO believers, Hynek does not cry conspiracy. First of all, he dismisses the idea that UFO's are some
  secret military device. "I just don't think people can keep a secret for eighteen years," he says. Hynek also
  acknowledges that most UFO reports can be explained as down-to-earth events. At first, Science magazine rejected
  Hynek's letter, reluctant to lend its reputation to a controversy that has been the property of publicity seekers and
  circulation-minded editors. But Hynek's arguments persuaded the magazine to publish an abbreviated version.</p>
<p>In his letter Hynek eloquently seeks to win over "scientists who would like to look into the UFO phenomenon but are
  so vastly afraid of ridicule . . . They don't dare investigate." He presents his argument in charge and rebuttal
  form:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>CHARGE:</b> "UFO's are reported by unreliable, unstable, uneducated people."<br> <b>REBUTTAL:</b> "... some of
    the very best, most coherent reports have come from reliable, scientifically trained people."</li>
  <li><b>CHARGE:</b> "The Air Force has no evidence that UFO's are extraterrestrial or represent advanced technology of
    any kind."<br> <b>REBUTTAL:</b> "As long as there are unidentifieds' the question must obviously remain open."</li>
  <li><b>CHARGE:</b> "UFO's have never been sighted on radar or photographed by meteor or satellite-tracking
    cameras."<br> <b>REBUTTAL:</b> "This is not equivalent to saying that radars, meteor cameras and satellite-tracking
    stations have not picked up 'oddities' on their scopes."</li>
</ul>
<p>Search: To turn UFO's into IFO's <font size="-1">(Identified Flying Objects) </font>Hynek recommends reliable reports
  be searched by computer for common features such as the appearance of the object and where and when it was sighted.
  Then, says Hynek, the investigators could try to be on scene to observe the UFO's.</p>
<p>Hynek claims a pattern 'has already begun to emerge from the "hard-data" cases. They contain, he says, "Frequent
  allusions to hovering, wobbling and rapid take-off. Other often reported features are oval shapes, flashing lights or
  brilliant lights whose glare is uncomfortable." This is an apt description of ball lighting-the glowing mass of
  ionized air molecules that can occur during stormy weather--but Hynek things that relatively few UFO sightings can be
  explained by ball lighting. Many have been seen, he says, when atmospheric conditions are not right for ball
  lighting.</p>
<p>If an inquiry is launched (the Air Force is searching for a university to do the job) Hynek wants only an advisory
  role. "I'm not whipping up a bonfire," he says. "so I can dance around it."</p>
<p>Gullible: How soon, if ever, Hynek's program will be carried out is anyone's guess. Yet the need for a systematic
  investigation of UFO reports to end the uncertainty is undeniable. The national capacity for gullibility is enormous.
  Look magazine's story, for example, recounts the adventures of Barney and Betty Hill, as revealed under hypnosis
  performed by a Boston psychiatrist named Benjamin Simon.</p>
<p>Look insists that he story is a "human document" and not an attempt to convince the public that the Hills actually
  boarded a flying saucer. But the title of Fuller's series--"Aboard a Flying Saucer" --seems to contradict that and so
  does the prose: Barney found himself remembering that "The men had rather odd-shaped heads, with a large cranium,
  diminishing in size as it got toward the chin. And the eyes continued around to the sides of their 'heads'." The Hills
  have earned $24,000 from their story so far and author Fuller and Dr. Simon will share earning from a projected book
  and possibly a movie.</p>
<p>Until the U.S. acts on Hynek's proposals, it seems, the public will continue to be taken for a ride aboard UFO's.</p>
