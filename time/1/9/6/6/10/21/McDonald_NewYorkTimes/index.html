  </table><p>WASHINGTON, Oct 20 (AP) — An Arizona scientist urged today <q>a radical change</q> in the investigation of
  unidentified flying objects to determine if some may come from other worlds. </p>
  <p>Dr. <span class="place">James E. McDonald</span> said in an interview that science had been delinquent in
    dismissing so-called "flying saucers" with too few attempts to find physical or psychological explanations.</p>
  <p>Dr. McDonald is professor of meteorology at the University of Arizona and senior physicist at the Institute of
    Atmospheric Physics there.</p>
  <p>He said that 18 years of <q>administrative foul-up</q> by the Air Force, which is charged with investigating aerial
    phenomena, and deliberate Government "debunking" of U.F.O. sightings had frightened away scientists and left
    needless confusion in the public's mind.</p>
  <p>While any attempt to explain saucers as extraterrestrial visitors seems <q><a
      href="../../../../../../analyse/absurde/">absurd</a></q>, <a
      href="../../../../../../analyse/hypotheses/intelligence/HET/index.html">that explanation</a> also seems to be the
    <q>least unsatisfactory hypothesis</q> for at least somme sightings, Dr. McDonald said.</p>
  <p><q>I believe this is a problem of the first order of scientific importance</q>, Dr McDonald said. <q>It has been
    neglected and misrepresented and it is crying for high-caliber attention</q>.</p>
  <p>The tall, sandy-haired researcher holds degrees in physics, chemistry and meterorology. For about 12 years he has
    interviewed anyone in the Tucson area who reported having seen unusual objects in the sky.</p>
  <p><q>I have never had more than puzzlement until this spring</q>, he said. Then a rash of sightings across the
    country and Congressional attention to the question increased his own interest.</p>
  <p>Since then he has spent most of his time telephoning, traveling and otherwise looking into U.F.O.'s.</p>
  <p>It was announced on Oct. 6 that the University of Colorado at Boulder had been selected by the Air Force to conduct
    independent investigations into reports of unidentified flying objects. Dr. <a
        href="/people/c/CondonEdwardU/index.html">Edward U. Condon</a> will direct the scientific phases of the work.
  </p>
  <p>Because he believes the Air Force has mishandled its role, treating the saucer reports <q>at very low level of
    scientific competence</q>, he sees a need for concurrent investigation by <q>outfits that have no vested
    interest</q> — the <a href="/org/us/asso/NSF.html">National Science Foundation</a> <q>or more sensibly, the <a
      href="/org/us/nasa">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a></q>. </p>
  <p>While his investigations have convinced him there is no attempt to cover up a super-super-secret, he says he found
    evidence in Air Force document that the <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/index.html">Central Intelligence Agency</a> in 1953
    asked the Air Force to "debunk" saucer reports because they were clogging vital military reporting channels and
    demanding too much time of investigators. </p>
  <p>The <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/index.html">C.I.A.</a> reiterated today a statement it made earlier this month after
    Dr. McDonald discussed his views with Arizona newsmen.</p>
  <p>It said the <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/index.html">agency</a> has helped analyze sighting reports of unidentified
    flying objects in the early nineteen-fifties to help determine if some objects <q>might have originated from
      overseas</q>. </p>
  <p>The Air Force at that time concluded that it had no evidence that the sighted objects were hostile, were the
    "artifacts" of a foreign power, or were extraterrestrial in origin.</p>
  <p><q>Presently, the subject of U.F.O. is a responsibility of the Air Force and we have absolutely no interest either
    in building up or debunking any information regarding, or views on, U.F.O.'s</q> the <a
      href="/org/us/ic/cia/index.html">agency</a>'s statement concluded. </p>
