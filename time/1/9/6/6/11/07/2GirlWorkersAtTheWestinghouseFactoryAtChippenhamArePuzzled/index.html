<p>Angela Pinnock (19) of 71 Dickens Avenue, Corsham and Heather Witchell (17) of 3 St John's, Dauntsey, were at work in
  the training department when they saw the objects some time between 4.45pm and 5pm. Their window overlooks St Paul's
  church.</p>
<p>Angela told a Gazette and Herald reporter "Above the spire and some distance away we saw these things in the sky. One
  appeared to be a long streak of light which seemed to be stationary for a while and then, suddenly, went up and behind
  a cloud. Another appeared from the clouds. It was round and very much like a flying saucer.</p>
<p>"It had a glowing light around it.</p>
<p>"Two men in the office were watching them with us. An aircraft flew over while we were watching them. They were
  definitely not aircraft themselves," </p>
