<p>GAITHERSBURG, Md., Nov. 15 —An Air Force plan to have university experts investigate unidentified flying objects is
  getting <q>good acceptance</q> in the academic world, Dr. <span class="people">Edward U. Condon</span> said today.</p>
<p>Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span>, professor of physics at the University of Colorado, is leading the effort
  under a $313,000 Air Force research agreement announced early last month.</p>
<p>Now that the elections are over —Dr. Condon ran for University Regent as a Democrat and lost —he is approaching his
  etheral task in earnest.</p>
<p><q>I was campaining like mad through October et the hell with the flying saucers</q>, he said today. </p>
<p>A merry man of 64 years, Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> arrived here today wearing a white Stetson for the
  dedication of the <a href="/org/us/NBS.html">National Bureau of Standards</a>' new $120-million laboratory complex in
  this town, which is 20 miles northwest of Washington. From <time>1945/1951</time>, he directed the bureau at its old
  site in Washington.</p>
<h2>No Tendency to Ridicule</h2>
<p>In an interview at the bureau's new library, Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> said he had received 300 or 400
  letters since his new assignment was announced, noting that a great many of the writers wanted jobs or wanted to help
  the project in some other way.</p>
<p><q>The important thing is that a lot of people in both the physical and psychological sciences in other universities
  are interested</q>, he said. <q>There is no tendency to ridicule the project at that level</q>. </p>
<p>The letters have also brought some abuse from persons who believe the saucers carry visitors from outer space, but
  think the Air Force would never let Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> say so, event if he became convinced of it.
</p>
<p><q>They say such things as, the man who pays the piper calls the tune</q>, Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span>
  said. <q>I'm sure we won't be able to persuade them otherwise</q>.</p>
<p><q>I confess that I don't expect that we'll find visitors from outer space but I'm not against it</q>, he said. <q>After
  all, that would be the discovery of the century —the discovery of many centuries—of the millenia, I suppose.</q></p>
<p>Then, with his brown eyes twinkling behind gold-rimmed glasses, he recalled that he had once been a newspaperman
  himself and said he saw little danger that he would sit on such a story.</p>
<p><q>I'll write it myself</q>, he stressed. <q>I won't give it away to you guys!</q></p>
<p>The most difficult task to date has been planning how to investigate aerial phenomena, Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span>
  said. The Air Force would like investigating teams to take to the field wherever a saucer is reported as sighted.</p>
<p>But this poses difficult <q>time-logistics</q> problems, Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> said.</p>
<p><q>Most of these things are so damn transient and evanescent that you are not likely to be able to get the guys there
  with the equipment you would like to have</q>, he said. </p>
<p>Emergency teams, such as those the public health services use to help deal with epidemics, have been suggested. But a
  physician pointed out <q>that an epidemic stays there until you get there</q>, Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span>
  said.</p>
<p>The bulk of the study, which will continue until about <time>1967-02</time>, may have to consist of very careful
  interviews. However, Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> said he and his associates would explore all avenues. </p>
