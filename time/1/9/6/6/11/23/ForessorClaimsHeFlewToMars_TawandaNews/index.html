<p>MIAMIBEACH (UPI)—Thanksgiving promises to be just another quiet holiday here since it looks as if the flying saucers
  won't be able to land on the convention hall parking lot.</p>
<p>For a while a number of persons got quite excited, including the police, when Prof. Marisco Genovese, an Italian who
  teaches Greek in Tijuana, Mexico, promised Sunday night at least three saucers would land right behind where Jackie
  Gleason does his television show.</p>
<p>But something has gone wrong. Kent Tomlison, a consultant to the Ufology Research Institute and who holds the patent
  on an egg-peeler, has gone off to Brazil to find out what has gone wrong.</p>
<p>Tomilson's house maid here said Tuesday he already has left.</p>
<p>It must be understood these saucers are not from outer space. They are from Brazil, built by a team of 120 select
  scientists from 23 nations. They work and live in a secret settlement in the jungles between Brazil and Paraguay. The
  Brazilian government is supposed to be aware of all this, but declines comment.</p>
<p>This was all carefully explained Sunday night to an audience who paid $2.50 each to hear.</p>
<p>The explaining was done by Genovese and <span class="people" title="Guy Kirkwood">Mel Noel</span> — a make-believe
  name for a former Air Force officer who says he doesn't want his real name known since his family would get a lot of
  calls from cranks. Noel is director of Ufology Research Institute.</p>
<p>Noel says he made contact with three flying saucers between 1952 and 1957, Genovese said he has ridden a Martian
  flying saucer to Mars and found the people there "delightful," ranging up to seven feet tall with pink and platinum
  hair. He said they were not too unlike earth creatures. They were fond of fish. They are a lot of canals on Mars, he
  explained.</p>
<p>It was Genovese's brother who started the Brazil project, Noel explained. The other Genovese discovered 30 years ago
  that Marconi, who perfected the wireless, has also perfected polarity — electromagnet poser — the secret of all flying
  saucers.</p>
<p>It was during the Brazilian project that the Martian flying saucer visited the secret settlement. It took the
  professor on the three-day trip to Mars.</p>
<p>The Brazilian project is finished, said Genovese, and the scientists are ready to let the world in on the secret.
  They hope the saucers can be used for peaceful purposes—an international outer space police force.</p>
<p>Original plans were for two or three of the saucers to carry six people each and fly from a point in Brazil to Mexico
  and from there to Miami Beach. The trip was to have taken 20 minutes.</p>
<p>From Miami Beach, the saucer squadron was to have flown to Washington and then to Europe.</p>
