<p class="abstract">Base In Brazil</p>
<p>MIAMI BEACH, Nov 23 (UPI)—The "Ufology Research Institute" may not be able to come through on its pledge to put three
  flying saucers on the Convention Hall parking lot tomorrow.</p>
<p>A consultant to the institute, Ken Tomlinson of Miami, is reported to have gone to Brazil to find out why not.</p>
<p>The institute's promise originally came Sunday in a $2.50-a-person lecture by Prof Marisco Genovese, an Italian who
  teaches Greek in Mexico. Mr Genovese said his brother started a project in Brazil in which 123 scientists from 23
  nations are building the saucer. Mr Genovese claims to have made trips with Martians in their saucers.</p>
<p>He said the scientists planned to release their secret to the world and possibly form an outer space police
  force.</p>
<p>Also lecturing was Mel Noel, the pseudonym taken by a man who said he is a former Air Force officer and director of
  the institute. He said he uses the false name so his family won't get crank calls.</p>
<p>They said there have been some problems at the secret Brazil site and Mr. Tomlinso, who holds the patent on a
  egg-peeler, has gone to find out about it.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Genovese and Mr. Noel claim to have made trips in Martian flying saucers, and Mr. Genovese said the people
  were "delightful". There are many canals on Mars, he said and the people are fond of fish.</p>
<p>He described the Martians as being as taille as seven feet, with pink and platinum hair.</p>
