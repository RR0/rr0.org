<p class="abstract">For years the <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> has dismissed them as hoaxes, hallucinations or
  <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise">misidentifications</a>. Now the <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a>'s own scientific consultant on unidentified flying objects declares that many
  of the sightings cannot be so easily explained.</p>
<p>On <time>1966-08-25</time>, an Air Force officer in charge of a missile crew in North Dakota suddenly found that his
  radio transmissions was being interrupted by static. At the time, he was sheltered in a concrete capsule 60 feet below
  the ground. While he was trying to clear up the problem, other <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> personnel on the
  surface reported seeing a UFO--an unidentified flying object high in the sky. It had a bright red light, and it
  appeared to be alternately climbing and descending. Simultaneously, a radar crew on the ground picked up the UFO at
  100,000 feet.</p>
<p>So begins a truly puzzling UFO report--one that is not explainable as it now stands by such familiar causes as a
  balloon, aircraft, satellite or meteor. <q>When the UFO climbed, the static stopped</q>, stated the report made by the
  base's director of operations. <q>The UFO began to swoop and dive. It then appeared to land ten to fifteen miles south
    of the area. Missile-site control sent a strike team (well-armed Air Force guards) to check. When the team was about
    ten miles from the landing site, static disrupted radio contact with them. Five to eight minutes later the glow
    diminished, and the UFO took off. Another UFO was visually sighted and confirmed by radar. The one that was first
    sighted passed beneath the second. Radar also confirmed this. The first made for altitude toward the north, and the
    second seemed to disappear with the glow of red.</q></p>
<p>This incident, which was not picked up by the press, is typical of the puzzling cases that I have studied during the
  18 years that I have served as the Air Force's scientific consultant on the problem of UFO's. What makes the report
  especially arresting is the fact that another incident occurred near the base a few days earlier. A police officer--a
  reliable man---saw in broad daylight what he called <q>an object on its edge floating down the side of a hill,
    wobbling from side to side about ten feet from the ground. When it reached the valley floor, it climbed to about one
    hundred feet, still tipped on its edge, and moved across the valley to a small reservoir.</q></p>
<p>The object which was about 30 feet in diameter, next appeared to flatten out, and a small dome became visible on top.
  It hovered over the water for about a minute, then moved to a small field, where it appeared to be landing. It did not
  touch the ground, however, but hovered at a height of about 10 feet some 250 feet away from the witness, who was
  standing by his parked patrol car. The object then tilted up and disappeared rapidly into the clouds. A fantastic
  story, yet I interviewed the witness in this case and am personally satisfied that he is above reproach.</p>
<p>During the years that I have been its consultant, the <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> has consistently argued
  that UFO's were either hoaxes, hallucinations or misinterpretations of natural phenomena. For the most part I would
  agree with the <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a>. As a professional astronomer--I am chairman of the department
  of astronomy at Northwestern University--I have had no trouble explaining the vast majority of the reported sightings.
</p>
<p>But I cannot explain them all. Of the 15,000 cases that have come to my attention, several hundred are puzzling, and
  some of the puzzling incidents, perhaps one in 25, are bewildering. I have wanted to learn much more about these cases
  than I have been able to get from either the reports or the witnesses.</p>
<p>These special cases have been reported by highly respected, intelligent people who often had technical training --
  astronomers, airport -tower operators, anthropologists, <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> officer, <a
      href="/org/us/ic/fbi">FBI</a> personnel, physicians, meteorologists, pilots, radar operators, test pilots and
  university professors. I have argued for years within the Air Force that these unusual cases needed much more study
  than they were getting. Now, finally, the Air Force has begun a serious scientific investigation of the UFO phenomena.
  (J.C. The Colorado, Condon Committee)</p>
<p>The public, I am certain, wants to know what to believe--what can be believed--about the "flying saucer" stories that
  seem to be growing more sensational all the time. With all loyalty to the <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a>, and
  with a deep appreciation of its problems, I now feel it my duty to discuss the UFO mystery fully and frankly. I speak
  as a scientist with unique experience. To the best of my knowledge, I am the only scientist who has spent nearly 20
  years monitoring the UFO situation in this and other countries and who has also read many thousands of reports and
  personally interviewed many sighters of UFO's.</p>
<p>Getting at the truth of "flying saucers" has been extraordinarily difficult because the subject automatically
  engenders such instantaneous reactions and passionate beliefs. Nearly all of my scientific colleagues, I regret to
  say, have scoffed at the reports of UFO's as so much balderdash, although this was a most unscientific reaction since
  virtually none of them had ever studied the evidence. Until recently my friends in the physical sciences wouldn't even
  discuss UFO's with me. The subject, in fact, rarely came up. My friends were obviously mystified as to how I, a
  scientist, could have gotten mixed up with "flying saucers" in the first place. It was a little as though I had been
  an opera singer who had suddenly taken it into his head to perform in a cabaret. It was all too embarrassing to bring
  up in polite conversation.</p>
<p>While the scientists were chuckling at UFO's, a number of groups of zealous citizens were telling the public that
  "flying saucers" did indeed exist. The believers in UFO's charged the Air Force with concealing the existence of
  "flying saucers" to avoid a public panic. Since I was the Air Force's consultant, these groups accused me of selling
  out as a scientist, because I did not admit that UFO's existed. I was the Air Force's stooge., its tame astronomer, a
  man more concerned with preserving his consultant's fee than with disclosing the truth to the public.</p>
<p>I received many letters attacking me for not attacking the Air Force. One typical writer pointed out that as a
  scientist my first allegiance was to "fact." he went on to state, <q>Any person who has closely followed the UFO story
    knows that many reports have been 'explained away' in a manner that can only be called ludicrous.</q></p>
<p>Another typical letter declared: <q>In spite of the fact that the [Air Force} claims (or is instructed to claim) that
  UFO's do not exist, I think that common sense tells most of us that they do. There have been too many responsible
  people through the years that have had terrifying experiences involving UFO's. I think our Government insults the
  intelligence of our people in keeping information regarding UFO's from them.</q></p>
<p>The question of UFO's has developed into a battle of faiths. One side, which is dedicated to the Air Force position
  and backed up by the "scientific establishment," knows that UFO's do not exist; the other side knows that UFO's
  represent something completely new in human experience. And then we have the rest of the world, the great majority of
  people who if they think about the subject at all, don't know what to think.</p>
<p>The question of whether or not UFO's exist should not be a battle of faiths. It must be a subject for calm, reasoned,
  scientific analysis.</p>
<p>In 1948, when I first heard of the UFO's, I though they were sheer nonsense, as any scientist would have. Most of the
  early reports were quite vague: <q>I went into the bathroom for a drink of water and looked out of the window and saw
    a bright light in the sky. It was moving up and down and sideways. When I looked again, it was gone.</q></p>
<p>At the time, I was director of the observatory at Ohio State University in Columbus. One day I had a visit from
  several men from the technical center at Wright-Patterson Air Force base, which was only 60 miles away in Dayton. With
  some obvious embarrassment, the men eventually brought up the subject of "flying saucers" and asked me if I would care
  to serve as consultant to the Air Force on the matter.</p>
<p>The job didn't seem as though it would take too much time, so I agreed. When I began reviewing cases, I assumed that
  there was a natural explanation for all of the sighting--or at least there would be if we could find out enough data
  about the more puzzling incidents. I generally subscribed to the <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> view that the
  sightings were the results of misidentification, hoaxes or hallucinations.</p>
<p>During the next few years I had no trouble explaining or discarding most of the cases referred to me, but a few were
  baffling enough to make me wonder--cases that the <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> would later carry as
  "unidentified." Let me emphasize the point that the <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> made up its own mind on
  each case; I merely submitted an opinion. I soon found that the Air Force had a tendency to upgrade its preliminary
  explanations while compiling its yearly summaries; a "possible" aircraft often became a "probable" aircraft. I was
  reminded of the Greek legend of Procrustes, who tried to fit all men to his single bed. If they were too long, he
  chopped them off; if they were too short, he stretched them out.</p>
<p>Public statements to the contrary, the <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> has never really devoted enough money
  or attention to the problem of UFO's to get to the bottom of the puzzling cases. The Air Force's UFO evaluation
  program, known as "<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project Blue Book</a>," is housed in one room at
  <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB">Wright-Patterson</a>. For most of its history Project Blue Book has been headed by
  a captain. This fact alone will tell anyone familiar with military procedures the relative position of Project <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> on the Air Force's organization chart. The staff,
  which has usually consisted of two officers and a sergeant, has had to try to decide, on the basis of sketchy
  statements, the causes of all UFO sightings reported to the <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a>. From <time>1947/1965</time>,
  Project <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> reviewed 10,147 cases. Using the Air Force's
  criteria, the project identified 9,501, leaving over 600 that were carried as unidentified.</p>
<p>By <time>1952</time> my feeling that the Air Force was not investigating the reports seriously enough led me to write
  a paper suggesting that the subject deserved much closer study. In <time>1953</time> the <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air
    Force</a> did give UFO's more attention, although not nearly enough, to my mind. A panel of some of the top
  scientists in the country was assembled under the direction of <span class="people" title="Harold P. Robertson">Howard P. Robertson</span>,
  a distinguished physicist from <a href="/org/us/state/ca/Caltech">Cal Tech</a>. The Robertson panel discussed UFO's
  for four days. Most of the cases, incidentally, were not as puzzling as some of the ones we have now. What was more,
  the panel was given only 15 reports for detailed study out of the several hundred that had been made up to that time,
  although it did quickly review many others. This was akin to asking Madame Curie to examine a small fraction of the
  pitchblende she distilled and still expecting her to come out with radium.</p>
<p>I was listed as an associate member of the panel, but my role was really more that of an observer. After completing
  its brief survey, the panel concluded that <q>the evidence presented on unidentified flying objects showed no
    indication that these phenomena constitute a direct physical threat to the national security,</q> and that <q>we
    firmly believe there is no residuum of cases which indicate phenomena which are attributable to foreign artifacts
    capable of hostile acts, and that there is no evidence that the phenomena indicated a need for revision of current
    scientific concepts.</q> It is interesting to note the phrase "we firmly believe," a phrase more appropriate to the
  cloth than to the scientific fraternity.</p>
<p>The Robertson report immediately because the main justification of the Air Force's position--there is nothing to
  worry about--and it so remains to this day. I was not asked to sign the report, but I would not have signed if I had
  been asked. I felt that the question was more complicated than the panel believed and that history might look back
  someday and say that the panel had acted hastily. The men took just four days to make a judgment upon a perplexing
  subject that I had studied for more than five years without being able to solve to my satisfaction.</p>
<p>In <time>1953</time>, the year of the Robertson report, there occurred one of the most puzzling cases that I have
  studied. It was reported first in Black Hawk, S. Dak., and then in Bismarck, N. Dak., during the night of August 5 and
  the early morning of August 6. A number of persons in Black Hawk reported seeing several strange objects in the sky.
  What made these reports particularly significant was the fact that these people were trained observers--they were part
  of the national network of civilians who were keeping watch for enemy bombers.
</p>
<p>At approximately the same time, unidentified blips showed up on the radarscope at Ellsworth Air Force Base, which is
  near Black Hawk. An airborne F-84 fighter was vectored into the area and reported seeing the UFO's. The pilot radioed
  that one of the objects appeared to be over Piedmont S. Dak., and was moving twice as fast as his jet fighter. It was
  <q>brighter than the brightest star</q> he had ever seen. When the pilot gave chase, the light <q>just
    disappeared.</q> Five civilians on the ground, who had watched the jet chase the light, confirmed the pilot's
  report.</p>
<p>Later a second F-84 was sent aloft and directed toward the UFO, which still showed on ground radar. After several
  minutes, the pilot reported seeing an object with a light of varying intensity that alternated from white to green.
  While the pilot was pursuing the UFO, he noted that his gunsight light had flashed on, indicating that his plane's
  radar was picking up a target. The object was directly ahead of his aircraft but at a slightly greater altitude. It
  then climbed very rapidly. When the pilot saw he was hopelessly losing ground, he broke off the chase. Radar operators
  on the ground tracked the fighter coming back from the chase, while the UFO continued on out of range of the
  scope.</p>
<p>As the object sped off to the north, Ellsworth Air Force Base notified the spotter's control center in Bismarck, 220
  miles to the north, where a sergeant then went out on the roof and saw a UFO. The Air Force had no planes in Bismarck
  that could be sent after the UFO, which finally disappeared later that night.</p>
<p>I investigated this reported sighting myself and was unable to find a satisfactory explanation. In my report, I noted
  that <q>the entire incident, in my opinion, has too much of an Alice in Wonderland flavor for comfort.</q></p>
<p>It was about this time that some firm believers in UFO's became disgusted with the <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> and decided to take matters into their own hands, much like the vigilantes of
  the Old West; they organized <q>to do the job the Air Force was mishandling.</q> These groups composed of people with
  assorted backgrounds, were often the recipients of intriguing reports that never came to the official attention of
  Project Blue Book. The first group of this kind in the United States was the <a
      href="/org/us/asso/apro">APRO</a> (Aerial Phenomena Research Organization), founded in 1952 and still going
  strong, as is <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap">NICAP</a> (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) which was
  organized several years later.</p>
<p>As the years went by, I learned more and more about the global nature of UFO sightings. At first I had assumed that
  it was a purely American phenomenon, like swallowing goldfish. But reports of sightings kept coming in from around the
  world until 70 countries were on the list. As a scientist, I naturally was interested in correlating all of the data;
  a zoologist studying red ants in Utah, say, wants to find out about a new species found along the Amazon. But when I
  suggested to the Air Force that the air attaches abroad be used to gather reports on foreign sightings, I was turned
  down. No one in a position of authority seemed to want to take up the time of the officers with such an embarrassing
  subject.</p>
<p>Gradually, I began to accumulate cases that I really couldn't explain, cases reported by reliable, sincere people
  whom I often interviewed in person. I found that the persons making these reports were often not acquainted with UFO's
  before their experience, which baffled and thoroughly frightened them. Fearing ridicule, they were often reluctant to
  report the sighting and did so only out of a sense of duty and a tremendous desire to get a rational explanation for
  their irrational experience. One typical letter to me concluded with the sentence: <q>Hoping you don't think I'm nuts
    but not caring if you do, Sincerely,</q> . . .</p>
<p>We had many reports from people of good repute, yet we had no scientifically incontrovertible evidence--authenticated
  movies, spectrograms of reported lights, "hardware"--on which to make a judgment. There are no properly authenticated
  photographs to match any of the vivid prose descriptions of visual sightings. Some of the purported "photographs" are
  patent hoaxes. Others show little detail; they could be anything. Some show a considerable amount of detail, but
  cannot be substantiated.</p>
<p>The evidence for UFO's, then, was entirely without physical proof. But were all of the responsible citizens who made
  reports mistaken or victims of hallucinations? It was an intriguing scientific question, yet I couldn't find any
  scientists to discuss it with.</p>
<p>The general view of the scientists was that UFO's couldn't exist, therefore they didn't exist, therefore let's laugh
  off the idea. This, of course, is a violation of scientific principles, but the history of science is filled with such
  instances. Some scientists refused to look through Galileo's telescope at sunspots, explaining that <q>since the sun
    was perfect, it couldn't have spots, and therefore it was no use looking for them.</q> Other scientists refused to
  believe in the existence of meteorites; who would be foolish enough to think that a stone could fall from the sky?</p>
<p>From time to time I would urge the Air Force to make a more thorough study of the phenomenon, but nothing ever came
  of it. I began to feel a very real sense of frustration. As the years went by, I continued to find cases that puzzled
  me while I examined reports for Project <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>. People who
  were afraid that the Air Force would scoff at their reports began sending me letters that were often detailed and well
  written about their experiences. The <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> never attempted to influence my view on
  any case, but occasionally the service would disregard my evaluations. What was more, I was not consulted on some key
  cases. (One of the most recent was the well-publicized incident involving two policemen in Ravenna, Ohio, last
  spring.)</p>
<p>Then, from <time>1958/1963</time>, the UFO reports began to diminish in quality as well as quantity, and I felt that
  perhaps the "flying-saucer" era was at last on the wane and would soon vanish. But since <time>1964</time> there has
  been a sharp rally in the number of puzzling sightings. The more impressive cases seem to fit into a pattern. The
  UFO's had a bright red glow. They hovered a few feet off the ground, emitting a high-pitched whine. Animals in the
  vicinity were terrified, often before the UFO's became visible to the people who later reported the incident. When the
  objects at last began to disappear, they vanished in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>A very real paradox was now beginning to develop. As the Air Force's consultant, I was acquiring a reputation in the
  public eye of being a debunker of UFO's. Yet, privately, I was becoming more and more concerned over the fact that
  people with good reputations, who had no possible hope of gain from reporting a UFO, continued to describe
  "out-of-this-world" incidents.</p>
<p>In July, 1965, I wrote a letter to the Air Force calling again for a systematic study of the phenomenon. <q>I feel it
  is my responsibility to point out,</q> I said, <q>that enough puzzling sightings have been reported by intelligent and
  often technically competent people to warrant closer attention than Project Blue Book can possible encompass at the
  present time.</q></p>
<p>Then, in March of this year, came the reports of the now-celebrated "swamp-gas" sightings in Michigan. On two
  separate nights, at spots separated by 63 miles, nearly 100 people reported seeing red, yellow, and green lights
  glowing over swampy areas. When I received the first accounts of the UFO's, I recognized at once that my files held
  far better, more coherent and more articulate reports than these. Even so, the incident was receiving such great
  attention in the press that I went to Michigan with the hope that here was a case that I could use to focus scientific
  attention on the UFO problem. I wanted the scientists to consider the phenomenon.</p>
<p>But when I arrived in Michigan, I soon discovered that the situation was so charged with emotion that it was
  impossible for me to do any really serious investigation. The Air Force left me almost completely on my own, which
  meant that I sometimes had to fight my way through the clusters of reporters who were surrounding the key witnesses
  whom I had to interview.</p>
<p>The entire region was gripped with near-hysteria. One night at midnight I found myself in a police car racing toward
  a reported sighting. We had radio contact with other squad cars in the area. <q>I see it</q> from one car, <q>there it
    is</q> from another, <q>it's east of the river near Dexter</q> from a third. Occasionally even I thought I glimpsed
  <q>it.</q></p>
<p>Finally several squad cars met at an intersection. Men spilled out and pointed excitedly at the sky. <q>See--there it
  is! It's moving!</q></p>
<p>But it wasn't moving. "It" was the star Arcturus, undeniably identified by its position in relation to the handle of
  the Big Dipper. A sobering demonstration for me.</p>
<p>In the midst of this confusion, I got a message from the <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a>: There would be a
  press conference, and I would issue a statement about the cause of the sightings. It did me no good to protest, to say
  that as yet I had no real idea what had caused the reported sightings in the swamps. I was to have a press conference,
  ready or not.</p>
<p>Searching for a justifiable explanation of the sightings, I remembered a phone call from a botanist at the University
  of Michigan, who called to my attention the phenomenon of burning "swamp gas." This gas, caused by decaying
  vegetation, has been known to ignite spontaneously and to cast a flickering light. The glow is well-known in song and
  story as "jack-o'-lantern," "fox fire," and "wil-o'-the-wisp." After learning more about swamp gas from other Michigan
  scientists, I decided that it was a "possible" explanation that I would offer to the reporters.</p>

<p>The press conference, however, turned out to be no place for scholarly discussion: it was a circus. The TV cameramen
  wanted me in one spot, the newspaper men wanted me in another, and for a while both groups were actually tugging at
  me. Everyone was clamoring for a single, spectacular explanation of the sightings. They wanted little green men. When
  I handed out a statement that discussed swamp gas, many of the men simply ignored the fact that I said it was a
  "possible" reason. I watched with horror as one reported scanned the page, found the phrase "swamp gas," underlined
  it, and rushed for a telephone.</p>
<p>Too many of the stories the next day not only said that swamp gas was definitely the cause of the Michigan lights but
  implied that it was the cause of other UFO sightings as well. I got out of town as quickly and as quietly as I
  could.</p>
<p>I supposed that the swamp-gas incident, which has become a subject fro cartoons that I greatly enjoy, was the low
  point of my association with UFO's. The experience was very obvious proof that public excitement had mounted to the
  point that it was ridiculous to expect one professor, working alone in the field, to conduct a scholarly
  investigation. We had quite clearly reached a new state in the UFO problem.</p>
<p>Three weeks after the Michigan incident I appeared before a hearing into UFO's that was conducted by the House
  Committee on Armed Services. I pointed out to the committee that I had a dossier of "twenty particularly well-reported
  UFO cases which, despite the character, technical competence and number of witnesses, I have not been able to explain.
  Ten of these reports were made by scientists or by highly trained individuals, five were made by members of the armed
  services or police, and five were made by other reliable people. The committee urged the <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> to give continued attention to the subject and was assured by Air Secretary
  Dr. <a href="/people/b/BrownHarold">Harold Brown</a> that it would.</p>
<p>A serious inquiry into the nature of UFO's would be justified, in my opinion, just on the basis of the puzzling cases
  that have been reported during the last two years. It seems to me that there are now four possible explanations for
  the phenomena:</p>
<p>First, they are utter nonsense, the result of hoaxes or hallucinations. This, of course, is the view that a number of
  my scientific colleagues have taken. I think that enough evidence has piled up to shift the burden of proof to the
  critics who cry fraud. And if the UFO's are merely hallucinations, they still deserve intensive study; we need to
  learn how the minds of so many men so widely separated can be so deluded over so many years.</p>

<p>Second, the UFO's are some kind of military weapon being tested in secret. This theory is easily dispensed with.
  Secret devices are usually tested in very limited geographical areas. Why should the United States, or any other
  country, test them in scores of nations? The problem of preventing a security leak would be impossible.</p>

<p>Third, the UFO's are really from outer space. I agree with the Air Force. There is no incontrovertible evidence, as
  far as I can see, to say that we have strange visitors. But it would be foolish to rule out the possibility
  absolutely.</p>
<p>Solely for the sake of argument, let me state the case in its most favorable light. We all suffer from cosmic
  provincialism--the notion that we on this earth are somehow unique. Why should our sun be the only star in the
  universe to support intelligent life, when the number of stars is a 1 followed by twenty zeros?</p>
<p>Stars are born, grow old and die, and it now seems that the formation of planetary systems is part of this
  evolutionary process. You would expect to find planets around a star just as you find kittens around a cat or acorns
  around an oak. Suppose that only one star in 10 is circled by a planetary system that has life; that means that the
  number of life-supporting stars in the universe would be a 1 followed by 19 zeros.</p>
<p>We also know that some stars are many millions of year older than our sun, which means that life elsewhere in the
  universe may have evolved many millions of years beyond our present state. That could mean that other planets in other
  solar systems may have solved the problem of aging, which we are beginning to grapple with even now. If a life span
  reached 10,000 years, let us say, a space journey of 200 to 300 years would be relatively short. In that time it would
  be possible to get from some distant planetary systems to ours.</p>

<p>A highly advanced civilization, such as the one I am postulating, would naturally keep an eye on the progress of life
  elsewhere in its galaxy. Any signs of unusual scientific progress might be reason enough to send a reconnaissance
  vehicle to find out what was going on. It so happens that in recent years we have made a very important advance of
  this kind; the development of the use of nuclear energy. </p>
<p>This is still "science fiction," of course, but let me take the story a step further. Some skeptics who scoff at
  reported UFO sightings often ask why the "flying saucers" don't try to communicate with us. One answer might be; Why
  should they? We wouldn't try to communicate with a new species of kangaroo we might find in Australia; we would just
  observe the animals.</p>

<p>Is there any connection between the reported UFO sightings and the scientific probability of life elsewhere in our
  galaxy? I don't know. I find no compelling evidence for it, but I don't rule it out automatically.</p>

<p>The fourth possible explanation of UFO's is that we are dealing with some kind of natural phenomenon that we as yet
  cannot explain or even conceive of. Think how our knowledge of the universe has changed in 100 years. In
  <time>1866</time> we not only knew nothing about nuclear energy, we didn't even know that the atom had a nucleus. Who
  would have dreamed 100 years ago that television would be invented? Who can say what startling facts we will learn
  about our world in the next 100 years?</p>

<p>All of these possibilities deserve serious consideration and now, at long last, they will get it. In October the <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> announced that a thorough investigation of UFO's will be conducted at the
  University of Colorado by a team of distinguished scientists, headed by Dr. <span class="people"
      title="Edward U. Condon">Edward Condon</span>, the former director of the <a href="/org/us/NBS.html">National
    Bureau of Standards</a>.</p>
<p>I cannot help but feel a small sense of personal triumph and vindication. The night the appointment was announced, my
  wife and I went out and had a few drinks to celebrate.</p>

<p>I am particularly pleased that the Condon committee will have time to work into the problem because I cannot consider
  anyone qualified to speak authoritatively on the total UFO phenomenon unless he has read at least a few thousand
  original (not summarized) reports, and is thoroughly acquainted with the global nature of reported UFO sightings. The
  truly puzzling and outstanding UFO reports are few in number compared to the welter of poor reports.</p>

<p>Recently I had dinner with several members of the Condon committee. What a pleasure it was to sit down with men who
  were open-minded about UFO's, who did not look at me as though I were a Martian myself. For the first time other
  scientists, who apparently have been wondering all along, have openly talked about the reports. One leading scientist
  wrote me the other day: <q>For some time now I have been convinced of the reality of this phenomenon based on reports
    in the general news media. It has seemed to me that even with a heavy discount there is a core of reliable
    observations which we cannot shrug off. Twice in recent weeks I have stated my views on the subject in small
    conversational groups of respectable, scholarly friends, and found that they were amazed that I should take these
    matters seriously. So I know that it took some courage for you to speak out.</q></p>

<p>I would like to suggest two more steps to help solve the UFO problem:</p>
<ul>
  <li> First of all the valuable data that we have accumulated--good reports from all over the world--must be
    computerized so that we can rapidly compare new sightings with old and trace patterns of UFO behavior. </li>
  <li>Second, we need good photographs of UFO's. Although the <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> has probably spent
    less on UFO's so far than it has on wastebaskets. I realize that it is impractical to expect the service to set up a
    costly "flying-saucer" surveillance system across the country. When a UFO is spotted, the terrified witness usually
    picks up the phone at once and calls the local police, who have missed dozens of opportunities in the past to record
    the phenomena on film. I recommend that every police chief in the country make sure that at least one of his squad
    cars carries in its glove compartment a camera loaded with color film. The cameras, which could also be used for
    regular police work, might be furnished by civic or service groups. (I carry a camera in my briefcase at all times.)
  </li>
  <li>Finally, I would like to emphasize my views on a controversial subject. During all of my years of association with
    the Air Force, I have never seen any evidence for the charge about UFO's most often leveled against the service:
    that there is deliberate cover-up of knowledge of space visitors to prevent the public from panicking. The entire
    history of the Air Force and the UFO's can be understood only if we realize that the <a
        href="/org/us/dod/Pentagone.html">Pentagon</a> has never believed that UFO's could be anything novel, and it
    still doesn't. The working hypothesis of the <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> has been that the stimulus
    behind every UFO report (apart from out and out hoaxes and a few hallucinations) is a misidentification of a
    conventional object or a natural phenomenon. It is just as simple as that.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now after a delay of 18 years, the Air Force and American science are about to try for the first time, really, to
  discover what, if anything we can believe about "flying saucers."</p>
