<p>It must be admitted that the structure of our social environment is man-made in a certain sense; that its
  institutions and traditions are neither the work of God nor of nature, but the results of human actions and decisions,
  and alterable by human actions and decisions. But this does not mean that they are all consciously designed, and
  explicable in terms of needs, hopes or motives. On the contrary, even those which arise as the result of conscious and
  intentional human actions are, as a rule, <em>the indirect, the unintentional and often the unwanted byproducts of
    such actions</em>. Only a minority of social institutions are consciously designed, while the vast majority have
  just “grown,” as the undesigned result of human actions, as I have said before; and we can add that even most of the
  few institutions which were consciously and successfully designed (say, a newly founded University, or a Trade Union)
  do not turn out according to plan – again because of the unintended social repercussions resulting from their
  intentional creation. For their creation affects not only many other social institutions but also ‘human nature’ –
  hopes, fears, and ambitions, first of those more immediately involved, and later often of all members of the society.
  One of the consequences of this is that the moral values of a society – the demands and proposals recognized by all,
  or by very nearly all, of its members – are closely bound up with its institutions and traditions, and that they
  cannot survive the destruction of the institutions and traditions of a society. [...] </p>
<p>In order to make my point clear, I shall briefly describe a theory which is widely held but which assumes what I
  consider the very opposite of the true aim of the social sciences; I call it the “<em>conspiracy theory of
    society</em>.” It is the view that an explanation of a social phenomenon consists in the discovery of the men or
  groups who are interested in the occurrence of this phenomenon (sometimes it is a hidden interest which has first to
  be revealed), and who have planned and conspired to bring it about.</p>
<p> This view of the aims of the social sciences arises, of course, from the mistaken theory that, whatever happens in
  society – especially happenings such as war, unemployment, poverty, shortages, which people as a rule dislike – is the
  result of direct design by some powerful individuals and groups. This theory is widely held; it is older even than
  historicism (which, as shown by its primitive theistic form, is a derivative of the conspiracy theory). In its modern
  forms it is, like modern historicism, and a certain modern attitude towards ‘natural laws,’ a typical result of the
  secularization of a religious superstition. The belief in the Homeric gods whose conspiracies explain the history of
  the Trojan War is gone. The gods are abandoned. But their place is filled by powerful men or groups – sinister
  pressure groups whose wickedness is responsible for all the evils we suffer from – such as the Learned Elders of Zion,
  or the monopolists, or the capitalists, or the imperialists. </p>
<p>I do not wish to imply that conspiracies never happen. On the contrary, they are typical social phenomena. They
  become important, for example, whenever people who believe in the conspiracy theory get into power. And people who
  sincerely believe that they know how to make heaven on earth are most likely to adopt the conspiracy theory, and to
  get involved in a counter-conspiracy against non-existing conspirators. For the only explanation of their failure to
  produce their heaven is the evil intention of the Devil, who has a vested interest in hell.</p>
<p> Conspiracies occur, it must be admitted. But the striking fact which, in spite of their occurrence, disproves the
  conspiracy theory is that few of these conspiracies are ultimately successful. <em>Conspirators rarely consummate
    their conspiracy</em>. </p>
<p>Why is this so? Why do achievements differ so widely from aspirations? Because this is usually the case in social
  life, conspiracy or no conspiracy. Social life is not only a trial of strength between opposing groups: it is action
  within a more or less resilient or brittle framework of institutions and traditions, and it creates – apart from any
  conscious counter-action – many unforeseen reactions in this framework, some of them perhaps even unforeseeable. </p>
<p>To try to analyse these reactions and to foresee them as far as possible is, I believe, the main task of the social
  sciences. It is the task of analysing the unintended social repercussions of intentional human actions-those
  repercussions whose significance is neglected both by the conspiracy theory and by psychologism, as already indicated.
  An action which proceeds precisely according to intention does not create a problem for social science (except that
  there may be a need to explain why in this particular case no unintended repercussions occurred). One of the most
  primitive economic actions may serve as an example in order to make the idea of unintended consequences of our actions
  quite clear. If a man wishes urgently to buy a house, we can safely assume that he does not wish to raise the market
  price of houses. But the very fact that he appears on the market as a buyer will tend to raise market prices. And
  analogous remarks hold for the seller. Or to take an example from a very different field, if a man decides to insure
  his life, he is unlikely to have intention of encouraging some people to invest their money in insurance shares. But
  he will do so nevertheless. We see here clearly that not all consequences of our actions are intended consequences;
  and accordingly, that the conspiracy theory of society cannot be true because it amounts to the assertion that all
  results, even those which at first sight do not seem to be intended by anybody, are the intended results of the
  actions of people who are interested in these results.</p>
