  <li>The <a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">U.S. Air Force</a> has let a $300,000 contract to the <a
      href="/org/us/university/colorado/index.html">University of Colorado</a> to study reported UFO sightings. Brig.
    Gen. Edward B. Gillers, USAF, is senior Air Force contact and Dr. <a href="/people/r/RatchfordJThomas/index.html">Thomas
      Ratchford</a> is senior Air Force scientist on the project. The senior scientist from the University of Colorado
    is Dr. <a href="/people/c/CondonEdwardU/index.html">E. U. Condon</a>. </li>
  <li>On 20 <a href="../../../index.html">February 1967</a> at <time>0915</time> Dr. <a
      href="/people/c/CondonEdwardU/index.html">Condon</a> and four members of his investigative team visited <a
      href="/org/us/ic/cia/NPIC.html">NPIC</a>. With Dr. <a href="/people/c/CondonEdwardU/index.html">Condon</a> were
    Dr. <a href="/people/l/LowRobertJ/index.html">Robert Low</a>, <a href="/org/us/university/colorado/index.html">University
      of Colorado</a>, Dr. <a href="/people/s/SaundersDavidR/index.html">David Saunders</a>, <a
        href="/org/us/university/colorado/index.html">University of Colorado</a>, Dr. <a
        href="/people/p/PriceWilliamsDouglass/index.html">William Price</a>, Executive Director of AFRST, and Dr. <a
        href="/people/r/RatchfordJThomas/index.html">Ratchford</a>, USAF. The purpose of this visit was to familiarize
    Dr. <a href="/people/c/CondonEdwardU/index.html">Condon</a> and members of his team with selected photogrammetric
    and photographic analysis capabilities of <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/NPIC.html">NPIC</a>.</li>
  <li>The clearance level for the meeting was SECRET.</li>
  <li>Upon arrival at <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/NPIC.html">NPIC</a>, <time>0915</time>, <span
      class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> escorted the group to Mr. <a href="/people/l/LundahlArthurC/index.html">Lundahl</a>'s
    office. In the ensuing 10-15 minute discussion between Mr. <a href="/people/l/LundahlArthurC/index.html">Lundahl</a>
    and Dr. <a href="/people/c/CondonEdwardU/index.html">Condon</a> the following points were clearly established:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Any work performed by <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/NPIC.html">NPIC</a> to assist Dr. <a
          href="/people/c/CondonEdwardU/index.html">Condon</a> in his investigation will not be identified as work
        accomplished by <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/index.html">CIA</a>. Dr. <a
            href="/people/c/CondonEdwardU/index.html">Condon</a> was advised by Mr. <a
            href="/people/l/LundahlArthurC/index.html">Lundahl</a> to make no reference to <a
            href="/org/us/ic/cia/index.html">CIA</a> in regard to this work effort. Dr. <a
            href="/people/c/CondonEdwardU/index.html">Condon</a> stated that if he felt it necessary to obtain an
        official <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/index.html">CIA</a> comment he would make a separate distinct entry into <a
            href="/org/us/ic/cia/index.html">CIA</a> not related to contacts he has with <a
            href="/org/us/ic/cia/NPIC.html">NPIC</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="/org/us/ic/cia/NPIC.html">NPIC</a> will not prepare any written comments, will not analyze
        information with the intent of drawing a conclusion, nor prepare written reports. <a
            href="/org/us/ic/cia/NPIC.html">NPIC</a> personnel will be available to assist Dr. <a
            href="/people/c/CondonEdwardU/index.html">Condon</a> by performing work of a photogrammetric nature, such as
        attempting to measure objects imaged on photographs that may be part of Dr. <a
            href="/people/c/CondonEdwardU/index.html">Condon</a>'s analysis. Work performed by <a
            href="/org/us/ic/cia/NPIC.html">NPIC</a> will be strictly of a technical nature using services and
        equipement generally not available elsewhere.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Following this brief discussion in Mr. <a href="/people/l/LundahlArthurC/index.html">Lundahl</a>'s office the
    group adjourned to the <span class="caviar">XXX</span> conference room where a series of briefings was presented to
    Dr. <a href="/people/c/CondonEdwardU/index.html">Condon</a> and his group. Following a short introduction by <span
        class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXX</span> the following briefings were presented:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>General discussion of photogrammetry, including definition, terminology and, in general, what photogrammetry
        is and what it can do, <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> presented this discussion.
      </li>
      <li><span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> followed with a presentation of the
        analysis he had been conducting on UFO photography furnished by Dr. <a
            href="/people/r/RatchfordJThomas/index.html">Ratchford</a>. <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXX</span>
        discussion was of a general nature and outlined the problems he had encountered because of lack of basic
        information, such as camera focal length, make of camera, unspecified enlargements, etc.</li>
      <li><span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> then gave a general discussion on the microdensitometer
        and its application to image analysis.</li>
      <li><span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> followed this with a presentation on isodensitometer
        experiments he has been conducting.</li>
      <li><span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> then escorted the group into the new clean area where they
        viewed and discussed the isodensitometer and the new Mann Microdensitometer.</li>
      <li>Returning to the conference room, <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> briefed the group on measuring
        instruments used in <span class="caviar">XXX</span> and followed by a general presentation on the success and
        failure <span class="caviar">XXX</span> had experienced in trying to measure objects imaged on the second UFO
        project assigned <span class="caviar">XXXX</span>. Following this discussion <span
            class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXX</span> then conducted the group into the instrument area where the Point Transfer
        Device, Mann 880 Comparator, the Benson-Lehner Plotter and the NRI were viewed by the group.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>At about <time>1215</time> <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXX</span> escorted the group back to Mr. <a
      href="/people/l/LundahlArthurC/index.html">Lundahl</a>'s office where a general discussion on UFOs ensued. At
    about <time>1235</time> the group adjourned to lunch and following lunch they left <a
        href="/org/us/ic/cia/NPIC.html">NPIC</a> for a meeting with Brig. Gen. Gillers at the pentagon.</li>
  <li>Most all the discussion during the morning was of a unclassified nature dealing with primary basic fundamentals of
    photogrammetry, photographic analysis and problems related to the acquiring of enough information to conduct
    meaningful analyses. </li>
