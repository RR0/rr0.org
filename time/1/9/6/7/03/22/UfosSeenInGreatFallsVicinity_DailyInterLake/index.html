<p>Great Falls, Mont. (UPI)—Several persons Tuesday night reported seeing unidentified flying objects over Great Falls,
  Choteau, Vaughn, Fort Benton, and Manchester.</p>
<p>The objects, described as white lights—a big one with a little one apparently on top—moved east to west, but
  occasionally would stop then go north and south.</p>
<p>The sightings in the five communities were made between 7:45 and 8:30 p.m.</p>
