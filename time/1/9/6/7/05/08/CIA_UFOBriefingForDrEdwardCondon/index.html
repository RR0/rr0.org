  <li>At <time>1967-05-05 09:00</time>, <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXX</span> presented a briefing covering his
    analysis of the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Zanesville/index.html">Zanesville, Ohio, UFO
      photography</a>. The briefing was given in the <span class="caviar">XXX</span> conference room, and in attendance
    were Dr. <span class="people">Edward U. Condon</span>, University of Colorado; Dr. <a
        href="/people/l/LowRobertJ/index.html">Robert Low</a>, University of Colorado; Dr. <a
        href="/people/h/HartmannWilliamK/index.html">William Hartmann</a>, University of Arizona, Dr. Charles Reed, <a
        href="/org/us/NRC.html">National Research Council</a>; Dr. <a href="/people/r/RatchfordJThomas/index.html">Thomas
      Ratchford</a>, U.S. Air Force, and <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> briefing was
    very well received by Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> and his colleagues, and they were most enthusiastic.
    They were impressed with the scope of the analysis <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXX</span> had conducted, which
    included ground survey techniques, established and now mathematical analysis, and photogrammetric technique and
    densitometric traces. Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> stated he had for the first time a scientific analysis
    of a UFO that would stand up to investigation. Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> and members of his group
    questionned <span
        class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXX</span> in detail during and after the analysis and were very impressed with the
    quality of his work. </li>
  <li>Preliminary arrangements were made to get <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> in contact with Dr.
    <a href="/people/l/LowRobertJ/index.html">Low</a>, University of Colorado, so that contractual arrangements could be
    made to carry on analysis by <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXX</span> but under financing from U.S. Air
    Force/University of Colorado. To start this procedure, <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXX</span> contacted <span
        class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> and suggested that he call Dr. <a
        href="/people/l/LowRobertJ/index.html">Low</a> to initiate the appropriate discussions. I understand this was
    followed through later in the day. This would transfer most of the future analysis to the University of Colorado
    control, but Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> indicated he wished to keep a channel open into our
    organization. He was most appreciative of the unofficial role <a
        href="/org/us/ic/cia/NPIC.html">NPIC</a> has played in assisting the development of this special photogrammetric
    technique to analyze unscheduled photography.</li>
  <li>There was discussion held concerning methods of interesting the American public in participating in UFO
    photography. No specific conclusions were drawn, but it was suggested that it might be advisable to reivew all the
    photography <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">NICAP</a> holds, and conduct photogrammetic analyses on any that
    have the appropriate and necessary information available. This would put Dr. <a
        href="/people/c/CondonEdwardU/index.html">Condon</a> in a position to say that he had reviewed and analyzed all
    the photography in <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">NICAP</a> files, and was now depending on the American
    public to furnish his new photography. Also discussed was the possibility of making available to police officers, on
    military posts, airline pilots, and such people, polaroid cameras for instance use. No conclusions were arrived at,
    but some interesting thoughts were tabled. It was, however, felt by all that more publicity was needed.
  </li>
  <li><span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> report on his analysis of the Zanesville photography will be
    forwarded to <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXX</span> in the near future for distribution to Dr. <a
        href="/people/r/RatchfordJThomas/index.html">Ratchford</a> and Dr. <a
        href="/people/c/CondonEdwardU/index.html">Condon</a>. </li>
