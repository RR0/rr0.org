  <li>A <time>1967-05-05 09:00</time>, <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXX</span> a présenté un briefing couvrant son
    analyse de la <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Zanesville/index.html">photographie d'ovni de Zanesville
      (Ohio)</a>. Le briefing fut donné dans la salle de conférence de la <span class="caviar">XXX</span>, et y
    assistaient le Dr. <span class="people">Edward U. Condon</span>, de l'Université du Colorado ; le Dr. <a
        href="/people/l/LowRobertJ/index.html">Robert Low</a>, de l'Université du Colorado ; le Dr. <a
        href="/people/h/HartmannWilliamK/index.html">William Hartmann</a>, de l'Université de l'Arizona, le Dr. Charles
    Reed, du <a href="/org/us/NRC.html">Conseil National pour la Recherche</a> ; le Dr. <a
        href="/people/r/RatchfordJThomas/index.html">Thomas Ratchford</a>, de l'U.S. Air Force, et <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span>.
    Le briefing de <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXX</span> fut très bien reçu par le Dr. <span
        class="people">Condon</span> et ses collègues, qui furent particulièrement enthousiastes. Ils furent
    impressionnés par le périmètre de l'analyse que <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXX</span> avait mené, qui incluait des
    techniques d'étude du terrain, established and new mathematical analysis, and photogrammetric technique and
    densitometric traces. Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> stated he had for the first time a scientific analysis
    of a UFO that would stand up to investigation. Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> and members of his group
    questionned <span
        class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXX</span> in detail during and after the analysis and were very impressed with the
    quality of his work. </li>
  <li>Preliminary arrangements were made to get <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> in contact with Dr.
    <a href="/people/l/LowRobertJ/index.html">Low</a>, University of Colorado, so that contractual arrangements could be
    made to carry on analysis by <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXX</span> but under financing from U.S. Air
    Force/University of Colorado. To start this procedure, <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXX</span> contacted <span
        class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> and suggested that he call Dr. <a
        href="/people/l/LowRobertJ/index.html">Low</a> to initiate the appropriate discussions. I understand this was
    followed through later in the day. This would transfer most of the future analysis to the University of Colorado
    control, but Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> indicated he wished to keep a channel open into our
    organization. He was most appreciative of the unofficial role <a
        href="/org/us/ic/cia/NPIC.html">NPIC</a> has played in assisting the development of this special photogrammetric
    technique to analyze unscheduled photography.</li>
  <li>There was discussion held concerning methods of interesting the American public in participating in UFO
    photography. No specific conclusions were drawn, but it was suggested that it might be advisable to reivew all the
    photography <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">NICAP</a> holds, and conduct photogrammetic analyses on any that
    have the appropriate and necessary information available. This would put Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> in a
    position to say that he had reviewed and analyzed all the photography in <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">NICAP</a>
    files, and was now depending on the American public to furnish his new photography. Also discussed was the
    possibility of making available to police officers, on military posts, airline pilots, and such people, polaroid
    cameras for instance use. No conclusions were arrived at, but some interesting thoughts were tabled. It was,
    however, felt by all that more publicity was needed.
  </li>
  <li><span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</span> report on his analysis of the Zanesville photography will be
    forwarded to <span class="caviar">XXXXXXXXXXX</span> in the near future for distribution to Dr. <a
        href="/people/r/RatchfordJThomas/index.html">Ratchford</a> and Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span>. </li>
