  <li>Reference you unclassified message, ZIPPO 2414 Mar 67, subject: Preliminary UFO Report. Your message mentioned
    that numerous reports were received by Malmstrom AFB agencies in the Great Falls, Montana area during the early
    morning hours, on or about 24 March 1967.</li>
  <li>Our office has been informed that during the sightings there were equipement malfunctions and abnormalities in the
    equipment. One individual stated that the USAF instructed both military and civilian personnel not to discuss what
    they had seen as it was a classified government experiment.</li>
  <li>Request information on validity of such statements. If some type of experiment did occur on or about 24 March
    1967, please advice.</li>
</ol>
