<p>On the basis of an intensive study of the UFO problem, I believe that the <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses/intelligence/HET/">extraterrestrial-origin hypothesis</a> must now be
  given extremely serious scientific attention. </p>
<p>Let me hasten to interject that I am quite familiar with all of the standard reasons as to why this hypothesis seems
  very remote. The solar system seems to harbor no good niches for evolution of sentient life. Recent disclosures of the
  lack of magnetic fields near Mars and Venus, demonstrations of the extreme tenuity of the Martian atmosphere and of
  the high temperatures of the Venusian atmosphere, and all else that we know of our neighbor-planets seem s to argue
  cogently that the solar system is a most unlikely place to generate a second life-system in addition to ours --
  certainly unlikely to have a life-system that has gone far past us.</p>
<p>Within the past half-dozen years it has, somewhat amusingly, become scientifically respectable to take as axiomatic
  that in the billions of stellar systems within just our Galaxy alone, life must have evolved again and again, taking
  routes that may have gone far beyond our present civilization, culture, and technology. One can now say that safely in
  a scientific assemblage. But all that sentient life must be said to be way out there -- not here!</p>
<p>The principle scientific objection to thinking that we might (ever) be visited by being from other stellar systems is
  tied up with the energetics of propulsion. Edward Purcell, of Harvard, has presented a delightfully devastating
  analysis of the difficulties of interstellar travel (voir "Interstellar Communications," edité par A. G. W. Carneron,
  W. A. Benjamin, New York, 1963). I certainly am not one to give substantial rebuttal to his arguments except in one
  lame (but conceivably relevant) way. All of his and many others' arguments against feasibility of interstellar travel
  are necessarily couched in terms of present-day scientific knowledge and technology. </p>
<p>Pour être sûr, le type d'argument de Purcell semble accorder tous les bénéfices du doute à l'autre côté en regardant
  loin dans le futur prévisible et démolit toujours l'idée de voyage interstellaire. Mais cet adjectif, "prévisible",
  pourrait simplement être le [rob]. Peut-être y a-t-il des niveaux de technologie si largement supérieurs à tout ce que
  nous pouvons aujourd'hui imaginer que peuvent être faites des choses que nous considérons aujourd'hui comme
  pratiquement hors de question. </p>
<p>Clairement, c'est un argument facile, par lequel chacun pourrait bientôt dire que tout et rien n'est possible. Je ne
  recours certainement pas à de tels arguments dans mon travail de tous les jours, et j'aimerai ajouter que je me soucie
  peu de faire de la <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/culture/litterature/index.html">science-fiction</a> en général. </p>
<p>After a year of scrutiny of highly unconventional phenomena credibly reported from all parts of this country and [I
  believe] from most of the entire world, I have been driven to consider possibilities that I'd ordinarily not give a
  moment's thought to in my own personal brand of orthodoxy. It is the UFO evidence that slowly forces the diligent UFO
  student to seriously consider the extraterrestrial hypothesis - evidence that I can only describe as extraordinary in
  its total nature.</p>
<p>All over the globe persons in all walks of life, representing a wide range of educational and cultural backgrounds,
  are reporting, often in the face of unpleasant ridicule, sightings of objects that appear to be completely real
  objects yet have characteristics that match nothing about which we have present knowledge. </p>
<p> There are still a few persons who suspect these things must be secret Air Force test vehicles. They can forget that:
  No test pilot would ever dream of doing the things that these objects are repeatedly doing - hovering over speeding
  trucks loaded with gasoline, maneuvering low over populated areas, speeding alongside Texas sheriffs' cars, and diving
  down on top of trucks and tractors and motorbikes and trains. No American test vehicles would be checked out in
  Australia and Poland; no Russian test vehicles would be flight-tested in Canada or Brasil. </p>
<p> The UFOs are most definitely not secret test vehicles of superlative nature. No nation came out of WW II with a
  secret aerodynamic technology that could have produced the craft seen by hundreds of persons in the summer of 1947.
  And then there is the whole chapter that I am here omitting concerning the pre-1947 sightings that go back to before
  the Wright brothers. </p>
<p> And I cannot accept the psychological explanation, to which I have felt to obliged to return again and again for
  further checking and further discussion with colleagues in psychology and related fields. My conclusion: Objects that
  rock aircrafts at times, that leave dents in soil and railroad ties, and that splash when they dive into bodies of
  water are not likely to be "projection phenomena." Multiple-witness cases rule out hallucinations, essentially by
  definition. Much more could be said, but armchair speculations about psychological interpretations don't hold much
  weight when one goes over the whole picture very carefully. </p>
<p> Hoax, fraud, and fabrication account for a few but, in terms of percentage, negligible numbers of UFO sightings.
  Misinterpreted meteorological and astronomical observations and the like do account do account for lots of poor UFO
  reports, but experienced investigators learn to recognize these almost at a glance and dismiss them from further
  attention. </p>
<p> It is the detailed, close-range sightings by persons whose reliability cannot be brought into serious question that
  carry great weight. These are on the increase, it appears. Almost no urban sightings can be found in the records in
  the late 1940s. In the past year, there have been dozens of them. What does this all mean? What is happening ? If you
  wish to know, do not ask Project Bluebook. </p>
<p> Pacing of aircraft and buzzing of cars by UFOs go on rather steadily. These cases so strongly suggest something
  vaguely resembling surveillance or reconnaissance that the student of the problem is forced to weigh the possibility
  that the UFOs are probes of some type engaged in something we would loosely call "observation." </p>
<p> There are many other categories of sightings suggesting the same tentative hypothesis. How can this be? There is, in
  my opinion, no sensible alternative to the utterly shocking hypothesis that the UFOs are extraterrestrial probes. </p>
