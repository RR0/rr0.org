<p>A <a href="/org/ca/rcmp/index.html">RCMP</a> Corporal and 6 other witnesses <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/ShagHarbour/index.html">observed what they believed to be an unidentified
  flying object</a> off the southwest coast of Nova Scotia, Canada on the 4th <a href="../../index.html">October
  1967</a>. The object was described as approximately 60 feet in length and was flying in an easterly direction when
  first sighted. During their observation, the UFO descended rapidly to the surface and made a "bright splash" as it
  struck the water. For some time after the impact a single white light remained on the surface. The RCMP Corporal
  endeavoured to reach the location the object sank. A search of the area failed to produce any material evidence which
  could assist in explaning or establishing the identity of the object. An underwater search conducted by divers from
  the Department of National Defence also failed to locate any tangible evidence which could be used to arrive at an
  explainable conclusion.</p>
