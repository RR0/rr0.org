  It can be expected that when people are confronted with some novel experience, they will try to account for it in some
  rational way. The more bizarre the experience, however, the less rational the explanations become. Flying saucers were
  about as bizarre an experience as one could imagine, so it is therefore not surprising to find that by the end of
  June, opinions and "explanations," as well as flying saucer reports, were on the increase.</p>
<p>
  The San Francisco <em>Chronicle</em> for June 27 printed a roundup of opinion regarding Arnold<span
    lang="en-us">'</span>s sighting from assorted "experts." Captain Al Smith, a United Air Lines pilot, believed that
  what Arnold had seen were "<q>reflections of his instrument panel</q>," presumably in the Plexiglas canopy of his
  plane, although this is not stated. Elmer Fisher, Portland, Oregon meteorologist, suggested that Arnold had
  encountered "<q>a slight touch of snow blindness from the mountain peaks</q>."</p>
<p>Dr. J. Hugh Pruett, University of Oregon astronomer and meteorologist, said that "<q>persistent vision</q>," often
  experienced after looking at objects such as the sun, "<q>could have kept such reflections before him as they
    passed</q>." Getting back on safer ground, Dr. Pruett added that the objects "<q>were not of meteoric origin, for
    meteors do not dip and sway</q>."</p>
<p>
  In his syndicated column on the same day, AP Science Writer Howard W. Blakeslee also tackled the Arnold report,
  stating that "<q>in clear air the flash of sunlight from a plane can easily be seen for fifty miles. This flash is
  round, the shape of the sun. Any other reflection at a great distance is also likely to be round, coming from a small
  area on the plane</q>." He also grappled with the problem of the high speeds: if these objects had been jet planes,
  "<q>their speeds probably would be noticeable and could fit into the estimates, where sight gave the impression of
  something traveling at 1,000 miles an hour.</q>" He secured his grasp on this assessment by explaining that the eye
  rarely makes an accurate estimate of speed through the sky. To be fair to Blakeslee, perhaps he did not know that
  Arnold had established the distance between him and the objects based on familiar landmarks; on the other hand,
  perhaps he chose to ignore it.</p>
<p>
  Another "explanation" was offered on the same day by Lt. Colonel Harold R. Turner, at White Sands, New Mexico. In an
  AP account carried in many papers, Turner maintained, like Blakeslee, that Arnold had seen jet planes. "<q>The White
  Sands Proving Ground commandant said that jet planes have circular exhaust pipes and that these, when heated, might
  give an illusion of discs</q>." He, too, may have been ignorant of the facts: for example, that Arnold saw the objects
  first as they were approaching, north of Mount Rainier, in which position their "<q>circular jet exhausts</q>" would
  not have been visible. On the next day, following a series of reports from New Mexico, Colonel Turner rejected jet
  exhausts in favor of "<q>meteorites</q>," explaining that "<q>they appear much larger and apparently are coming closer
  to earth than usual</q>" (see III-9). It is perfectly clear that Colonel Turner did not know what a meteorite was, let
  alone flying saucers.</p>
<p>
  But someone who did know the difference between meteors and meteorites made a statement that was printed in the Denver
  <em>Post</em> of June 28. Dr. H. H. Nininger, an expert in the field of meteoritics, declared that the object observed
  by Byron Savage may have been a meteor; and in commenting on another New Mexico sighting of the previous day, this one
  reported near Shiprock by an associate, Dr. R. L. Hopkins (Case 81), Nininger said he believed that what Dr. Hopkins
  saw <q>"could have been a meteorite falling somewhere in southeast Arizona</q>." Dr. Hopkins, of Maitland, Florida,
  had been visiting Nininger at his laboratory in Winslow and had been near Shiprock, New Mexico, when the sighting was
  made. Regarding the objects Arnold had seen, however, Dr. Nininger said that those could not have been meteors; the
  descriptions of them sounded to him more like "<q>mechanical objects</q>." </p>
<p>Some explanations were as bizarre as the UFO reports themselves. One of the most original and imaginative
  explanations came the same day (June 28th) from the operator of a bottle-capping plant in Everett, Washington, and was
  carried widely by the wire services. Offered with apparent seriousness, this solution proposed that the little
  aluminum discs inside the bottle caps were set free when the bottle caps were melted down, rose up the chimneys on
  columns of hot air, and were then carried aloft by the winds to be reported as flying discs by numerous people
  throughout the country.</p>
<p>On June 30th another Army official spoke out. AP reported that Colonel Alfred F. Kilberer, intelligence officer of
  the Eighth Air Force, in commenting upon recent reports made in Texas, said bluntly that "<q>the reports might be
    true, but I doubt it</q>." 2 days later he, like his colleagues in White Sands, had further thoughts on the subject:
  in the Houston <em>Post</em>, AP quoted him as saying flying saucer reports were nothing more than "<q>an interesting
    study in human psychology</q>."</p>
