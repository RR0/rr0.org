<p>By June 30th sightings for that month had been made in at least thirty states and in two Canadian provinces. The
  largest number of sightings (twenty) had been made in Washington; runners-up were Oregon and New Mexico (thirteen
  each); Utah, Arizona and Texas (eight each); California and Idaho (six each); and the remaining states accounted for
  four or less, making a total of 128 sightings for the month. Daylight sightings predominated, totaling ninety; night
  sightings came to twenty- eight and ten were of undetermined times. Most people had reported seeing “round objects” or
  “discs;” some described the objects as “oval.” Witnesses numbered more than 220 persons, representing a wide
  cross-section of professions, including pilots, scientists, police, public officials, physicians, teachers, students,
  forest rangers, newspaper men, railroad engineers, military men, housewives, a barber, a dentist, and a postmaster.
  Observations were made from planes in the air, from moving automobiles, from the inside of homes, through windows, but
  mostly from open areas outdoors. Instruments that had been used to observe UFOs included binoculars and theodolites,
  and in one report (Case 13) a photograph was said to have been taken (IV-3).</p>

<p>The vantage point of time allows us to view past events with an objectivity that was impossible as those events were
  taking place. Looking back today on the UFO sightings of June, 1947, it appears to be unmistakably evident that by the
  end of the month there was already enough evidence to justify a thorough scientific investigation into these
  unexplained appearances. It is understandable that such an idea occurred to scarcely anyone in mid-1947. What is so
  difficult to understand is why it took another nineteen years of continued observations and reports to get such an
  investigation underway.</p>
