  <h2>Cas 12 : Autour du 17 juin, Madison (Wisconsin)</h2>
  <p>Dr. E. B. McGilvery, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin, had spent the evening playing
    cards at the home of Mrs. Mary North, on Middleton Road. He had hardly left the house, quite late, when he saw a
    bright, round object, about two-thirds the size of the full moon, moving through the sky from southwest to
    northeast.</p>
  <p>Professor McGilvery described the speed of the object as "quite rapid, but not as fast as a meteor." It left no
    trail of light as a meteor usually does, and it did not appear to be fiery, but looked more like an "illuminated
    body." He <span lang="en-us">called
						to Mrs. North to come look at it, but by the time she
					  came out the object had vanished in the northeast.</span></p></section>

  <h2>Case 67: June 26, Logan, Utah</h2>
  <p>Glen Bunting, a local school teacher, reported seeing a silvery object flying eastward at 7:43 p.m. MST. He told
    his wife about the sighting, and although she was reluctant to believe her husband's report, two other witnesses
    called the local paper independently to say they had seen the same object.</p></section>

  <h2>Case 125: June 30, Knoxville, Tennessee</h2>
  <p>C. E. Brehm, acting President of the University of Tennessee, reported that at 9:30 p.m. EST, while sitting with
    his wife in the rear yard of their home at 1721 White Avenue, an object resembling "a long cylinder" was seen
    arching across the sky "at terrific speed, leaving in its wake a shower of sparks." Brehm said that "it happened
    with surprising suddenness and disappeared in a second or two, cut off from our view by our house." He described it
    as "the most peculiar phenomenon I've ever seen. I've seen many a falling star, but never one that behaved like this
    thing. It was high in the sky, though much lower than the stars." He said he was "mystified as to what the thing
    was, but probably it was one of those flying saucers we are reading about in the newspapers. It surely had all the
    earmarks," he added.</p>
  <p>On the same night, Mr. and Mrs. C. E. Bellam, living on Route 7, also reported seeing a shining object in the sky,
    but described it as a "100 Watt bulb with a tail on it." The object made a whistling noise as it passed over at low
    altitude just a short distance away, above a nearby forest (Case 127).</p></section>

  <h2>Case 147: July 1, Charleston, South Carolina:</h2>
  <p>Richard Bischoff, a teacher at the Citadel, in Charleston, was at his mother's home on Sullivan's Island, when he
    and three others saw an object fly overhead at 9:55 p.m. EST. While on the back porch with his mother, Mrs. J. Fred
    Bischoff, his sister, Mrs. Chandler Hewett, of California, and a neighbor, Mrs. J. Albert Von Donlen, a cry from
    Mrs. Hewett brought their attention to the disc-like object, of a reddish color, moving over at a terrific speed.
    One of the women said it appeared to be "between the size of a saucer and a tea plate," and the witnesses said it
    had "grown paler as it disappeared" from view to the south. Mr. Bischoff said he got only a brief view of the
    object.</p>
  <p>
    Less than a half hour before that an object had been seen 150 miles northeast of Charleston, at Wilmington, North
    Carolina; reported by two independent witnesses, it was seen "flashing southward." A third witness, about a dozen
    miles south of Wilmington, at Carolina Beach, verified seeing an object flying south at the same time.</p></section>

  <h2>Case 456: July 6, Norman, Oklahoma:</h2>
  <p>W. H. Carson, Dean of the University of Oklahoma School of Engineering, reported that he had seen three strange
    objects flying west over Norman at about 6:00 p.m. CST. He was alone in his back yard when the first object, of
    undetermined shape, flew over. His wife and three neighbors joined him immediately after and all five saw two more
    objects fly over in the same direction -- one slightly above the other. The witnesses had an unobstructed view of
    the objects from their position in the yard.</p>
  <p><q>"From my observation of aircraft flying at various altitudes, I judged them to be 15,000 to 20,000 feet up</q>,"
    Carson said. <q>"It was impossible at that height to determine their shape. However, they appeared to be moving at
      incredible speed</q>." He said none of the witnesses heard any sound of motors, despite the fact that there was no
    wind at all when the objects flew over. Carson, who had scoffed at reports of flying saucers until he had seen them
    himself, reported that he planned to write to the War Department about the sighting, hoping that the information
    might be useful to the Army, if it had been conducting secret tests. If the Army, or War Department, received the
    information from Carson, it is not now included in the official files of Project Blue Book.</p></section>

  <h2>Cas 424 - 6 juillet, Long Beach (Californie)</h2>
  <p>Howard Shriver, an Army aviator during the First World War, and his sister, Miss Beulah Shriver, a school teacher,
    reported that they were returning to San Diego from Los Angeles by automobile when, between 1:15 and 1:30 p.m. PST,
    a disc-shaped object flashed across the sky just south of Long Beach. The disc, which they estimated to be 7,000
    feet high, appeared to be flying north directly toward them when "<q>it swerved broadside towards the ocean</q>,"
    and then "side-slipped" to the west and vanished from view. Miss Shriver said that in their "<q>broadside</q>" view
    of the object, it had the appearance of "<q>a large serving dinner plate</q>" reflecting the sun. Her brother
    compared its reflective brilliance to "<q>a mirror's reflection of the sunlight</q>." They viewed the object for 3
    ou 4 s before it disappeared from view. Both admitted that they had been "<q>awed by the terrific speed and
      brilliance</q>" of the phenomenon and were now "<q>among the believers,</q>"</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Cas 711 - 8 juillet, St. Louis (Missouri)</h2>
  <p>Thiemo Wolf, school teacher living at 3515 Hartford Street, who had previously "<q>doubted all reports of flying
    saucers</q>," changed his mind when he saw one himself as it flew over St. Louis shortly after noon. Wolf said the
    object appeared to be about the size of an automobile and was pink, with a dark spot in the center. The object sped
    over his home at a height of from 5000 to 10 000 feet, and disappeared "<q>after swooping down out of sight</q>."
