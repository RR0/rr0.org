<p>The mid-April sighting made by meteorologists at the U. S. Weather Bureau in Richmond, Virginia is included in this
  category (I-1).</p>
<section>
  <h2>Cas 151 - 1er juillet, Louisville (Kentucky)</h2>
  <p>U. S. Government Meteorologist E. E. Unger, in charge of the Weather Bureau at Louisville Kentucky, and a weather
    observer with over 30 years of experience, reported that he and his wife had seen a round, luminous object at 10:10
    p.m. CST as they left a movie theatre in the Highlands district of the city. Unger reported that the object was
    flying, "<q>close to the earth</q>" and was "<q>giving off an orange light</q>." He said that his wife had seen it
    first, as they came out of the theatre. "It appeared to be traveling about 100 miles an hour toward the southeast,"
    Unger said. "<q>Of course it could have been an airplane, although the glow was too bright for wing or tail lights
      of a plane, and we didn't hear any noise, although it was quiet enough to have heard a plane motor</q>," he
    explained. <q>"I only know what I saw and I don't know what it was.</q>"</p>
  <p>About an hour and a half earlier, J. L. Laemmle, of 710 South Ormsby, reported that he had seen a glowing disc
    "flash through the sky" (Case 146), and another sighting was made at an unspecified time during the evening by a
    Mrs. E. A. Simpson.</p></section>

  <h2>Cas 347: 5 juillet, Zanesville (Ohio)</h2>
  <p> Weather observer and CAA Communications Operator Miss Barry Peruzzo, at the Zanesville Airport control tower, said
    that she had seen two disc-like objects flying over the field about ten minutes apart. She reported that she had
    seen the first "<q>fairly oval</q>" object at 8:55 p.m. EST, while she was checking the ceiling visibility, one of
    her duties. "<q>I had just stepped outside when the first object came over at about 5,000 feet</q>," she said; it
    was flying under the ceiling of clouds. The second disc followed it five or ten minutes later (Case 353). "<q>They
      went very fast, headed in a northeasterly direction</q>," she added. The witness declined to estimate the speed of
    the objects, as she was uncertain of their size. "<q>I saw them for only about 15 seconds at a time</q>," she said.
    She heard no noise.</p></section>
