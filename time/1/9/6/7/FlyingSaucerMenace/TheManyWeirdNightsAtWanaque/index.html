<p>Varied flying saucer activity has been observed in and near Wanaque, New Jersey, especially over the Wanaque
  Reservoir. Many researchers have long expressed concern over the saucers' interest in earth's water supplies, and it
  has been suggested that the UFOs may in some way be tampering with Wanaque's six-mile-long reservoir, which is New
  Jersey's largest storage basin.</p>
<p>One of the first sightings was made by Patrolman George Dykman on 1966-01-11.</p>
<p><q>"There was a large, bright, white object over the north end of the dam,</q>" Patrolman Dykman said. <q>"It moved
  like one of those low-flying private planes . . . that go over the reservoir once in a while, it looked about that
  high. There was no sound to it . . . It seemed to be above the dam and then it moved west, below the top of the sam in
  my line of sight</q>."</p>
<p>Patrolman Dykman alerted other reservoir policemen, and they watched the UFO move over the dam in a circular motion,
  then hover over the reservoir for several minutes. Later, as they watched, the object dipped down low over the
  reservoir and cast a reflection on the ice. The next morning investigating officers found a circular hole that had
  melted in the ice at the corresponding spot.</p>

    According to <span class="people">August C. Roberts</span>, the glowing object in the upper left-hand section of the
    picture has "no technical reason for being there." It simply appeared, hovered a few minutes, then shot off once
    more into space.

    This photograph of a UFO beaming a ray of light down into a body of water was taken in Pennsylvania, in 1961. It has
    recently been erroneously associated with the UFO flap above the Wanaque Reservoir.

<p>Reservoir custodian Fred Steines said that the object was like a small moon with a reddish glow. "It was above the
  water and then it dropped down and went to the left and to the right."</p>
<p>Bentley Spencer is the Civilian Defense Director of Wanaque. He heard of the sighting over the police monitor and
  rushed out to join the reservoir police.</p>
<p>"It was a big ball of light," Spencer remembered later. "It was reddish on the inside, bluish on the outside. It was
  hovering, dancing, and dipping across the reservoir. It was moving from right to left, swinging like a pendulum. It
  cast a bright reflection on the ice."</p>
<p>In the nights that followed, dozens of sightings were made by reservoir police; by Wanaque's mayor, Harry T. Wolfe;
  by Councilmen Arthur Barton, Warren Hagstrom, John Shutte, and by hundreds of curious tourists.</p>
<p>Basil Wallack, a research engineer, was driving home from work when he sighted a large, bright-blue UFO which seemed
  to be perched slightly above a telephone wire. Wallack was so startled by the confrontation that he nearly drove off
  the road.</p>
<p>Sergeant David Cisco of the Wanaque Police Department described the object he saw as "about the size of nine or ten
  stars clumbed together." Sergeant Cisco's chief concern is that the UFOs may be either draining water from the
  reservoir or tampering with it in some way.</p>
<p>On March 10th, the mother superior of Mt. Saint Francis Convent in nearby Ringwood, New Jersey, had a close sighting
  of a saucer.</p>
<p>The mysterious objects maintained intermittent visitations during the summer months, and then, in October, returned
  for a real "flap."</p>

    them by Wanaque mayor Harry T. Wolfe for use in "saucer spotting" over the reservoir.<br/> Patrolman George Dykman
    of the Wanaque Reservoir Police made one of the initial sightings. He and others saw the UFO in the early evening of
    January 11, 1966, over the Raymond Dam at the reservoir. According to Dykman, the saucer moved over the dam in a
    circular motion, the hovered at a low altitude over the reservoir for several minutes. A circular hole in the ice
    was later found at a corresponding spot.<br/> Sergeant David Cisco of the Wanaque Police Department has sighted
    saucer activity over the reservoir. He has expressed concern that the UFOs might be draining water from the area. He
    describes the object he saw as "about the size of 9 or 10 stars clumped together."

</figure><p>On October 10th, Mrs. Robert J. Gordon, wife of a Pompton Lakes, New Jersey, police sergeant, saw a
  "disk-shaped object about the size of an automobile" pass over her house and disappear in the vicinity of the Wanaque
  Reservoir.</p>
<p>Alerted by the report of the sighting, Sergeant Benjamin Thompson of the Reservoir Police, spotted the object while
  he was cruising in his patrol car.</p>
<p>"I was afraid I would lose control of the car," he said. "The light was so bright I couldn't see the road."</p>
<p>When the saucer moved off over the sam, Sergeant Thompson said that he watched the UFO "maneuver, strirring up brush
  and water in the reservoir."</p>
<p>More than a dozen persons saw a disk-shaped saucer hovering over Wanaque Reservoir on October 12.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mary Ahem called police to notify them that she and seven friends had trained binoculars on the object.</p>
<p>Bernard Zick described the UFO as "aluminium-like, round on top like a balloon and flat on the bottom, hovering in
  the air in the direction of the Wanaque Reservoir. A light seemed to come from beneath the object, and then it
  disappeared. I don't know what it was, but it was definitely solid."</p>
<p>Wanaque Mayor Wolfe estimated that over 400 persons witnessed flying objects over the reservoir on October 16.</p>
<p>Why all the attention to water reservoirs? This is not a question conducive to easy sleep, but consider the theory
  that if an alien force were preparing to launch an invasion, it would be a simple matter to beam down drugs or poisons
  into reserves of drinking water. If, for example, a tranquilizing drug were to be beamed into earth's various water
  basins, there would be no fight, no nuclear bombs to foul the air—there would just be a compliant majority
  waiting to do the bidding of the extraterrestrial masters.</p>
