  <h2><a id="Schellhardt"></a>Cosmopolitique : problèmes et prospects des relations humaines dans l'espace</h2>
  <p>Ronald J. Schellhardt.</p>
  <h3>Une note d'introduction</h3>
  <p>L'exploration de l'espace sera accomplie par les êtres humains. Des sondes spatiales ont été envoyées avant les
    hommes vers d'autres mondes, mais le jour approche où des membres de la race humaine mettront le pied sur les
    voisins de la <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/index.html">Terre</a> dans le système solaire.
  </p>
  <p>Comme il le fait et se prépare à le faire, l'homme doit prendre en considération les difficultés de l'exploration
    spatiale posées par sa propre nature. Sa nature psychologique a fait de l'espace une arène de compétition et,
    peut-être, de guerre ; sa nature biologiquel nécessite qu'il exporte littéralement son environnement naturel vers
    d'autres mondes.
  </p>
  <p>Les développements sociaux et les institutions physiques que les besoins de l'homme pourraient créer à mesure qu'il
    explore le système solaire sont le sujet de cet article, classé par cet étudiant comme la science de la
    "cosmopolitique" — l'extension à l'espace du domaine géopolitique. Etant donné l'espace attribué à cet article et
    les limitations de la connaissance humaine (en particulier dans le cas de l'auteur), aucun plan détaillé de
    l'avancée de la société humaine ne peut être fourni ; cependant, les problèémes et perspectives seront discutées.
  </p>
  <p>Cet étudiant est redevable à Nickolaus Leggett '68, dont la suggestion et même la donation de matériel de lecture
    s'est révélée inestimable. Il doit également remercier M. Harry N. Traugott de Livingston, dans le New Jersey, qui a
    recommandé et fourni l'excellent livre <em>The Case for Going to the Moon</em> de Neil Ruzic.

  <h3>I. Problèmes de la compétition internationale, 1957 - ?</h3>
  <p>Depuis les expérimentations de fusées du Dr. Robert Goddard jusqu'au développement allemand du missile <a
      href="/tech/aero/appareil/missile/v2">V-2</a> et aux <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon">ballons</a> et haute altitude et lancers de fusées de la décade
    suivant la 2de guerre mondiale, l'homme du 20ᵉ siècle a progressivement étendu sa capacité technologique à voyager
    au-delà de l'atmosphère de la <a
        href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/index.html">Terre</a> pour aller dans l'espace. Le
    <time>1957-10-04</time>, cependant, la technologie humaine a scored a decisive breakthrough — and the international
    competition in the area of space exploration, generally known as "The Space Race", was sparked.
  </p>
  <p>For it was on October 4, 1957, that the Soviet Union succeeded in orbiting an artificial satellite, Sputnik I,
    about the earth. The American reaction to the Soviet achievement was expressed by Secretary of State John Foster
    Dulles in a January 16, 1958 speech to the National Press Club in Washington (as cited in <i
        lang="en">Spacepower</i> by Donald Cox and Michael Stoiko, John C. Winston, Philadelphia, 1958, on Page 89).
    Secretary of State Dulles declared in part:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The launching of an earth satellite by the Soviets. . . jolted the American people and produced a reaction which
      was healthy, the kind of reaction that has, in the past, served freedom well. A wave of mortification, anger and
      fresh determination swept the country. Out of that mood is coming a more serious appraisal of the struggle in
      which we are engaged, and an increasing willingness to make the kind of efforts and sacrifices needed to win the
      struggle."
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Thus was the struggle joined. The Soviets placed a dog, Laika, in orbit, and the Americans, following their failure
    to launch Vanguard I in December of 1957, orbited a satellite of their own on January 31, 1958.
  </p>
  <p>The race continued into the 1960's. The Soviets orbited a human being, Major Yuri Gagarin, in April of 1961,
    overshadowing the suborbital flight of Colonel <span class="people">John Glenn</span> by more than ten months. The
    Soviet Union was also the first nation to orbit two manned space vehicles simultaneously and to orbit two cosmonauts
    within the same capsule. Although the Mariner IV probe of Mars and the Surveyor lunar landing were substantial
    American successes, the landing of a Soviet craft upon the surface or Venus in late 1967 rivaled Surveyor V in
    significance and indicated growing Soviet proficiency in "deep space" technology.
  </p>
  <p>Yet American commitment continues (to the extent of five billion dollars per fiscal year since 1965, according to
    <u>U.S. News and World Report</u>, November 6, 1967) despite a Soviet edge in what might be termed "space
    spectaculars". One reason, as voiced by Professor Thornton L. Page of Wesleyan University to one of his classes, is
    that "Russia does it first, and America does it best", a statement reflecting the view that American technology in
    space is more sophisticated and efficient that its Soviet counterpart. Another reason is that neither space power
    has yet perfected the booster power required for a manned lunar journey and return, although the success of
    America's Saturn V rocket in November of 1967 significantly enhances American ability in this field.
  </p>
  <p>Nevertheless, perhaps the major reason for continued American commitment to rapid space exploration is the
    conviction that no acceptable alternative exists. As President Kennedy stated in proposing Project Apollo to
    Congress in May of 1961, America cannot afford to ignore "the impact of this adventure on the minds of men
    everywhere who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take." (quoted in <u>The New York
      Times</u> publication <u>America's Race for the Moon</u>, Random House, New York, 1962, p. 149.)
  </p>
  <p>Since 1961, however, many American leaders have come to believe that mare may be at stake in "The Space Race" than
    national prestige - and that the area known as "near space", beyond the bulk of the earth's atmosphere but within
    several hundred miles of the earth's surface, may be far more crucial than the moon <u>militarily</u>.
  </p>
  <p>Given present military technology ( and that conceivable in the near future), the establishment of a military base
    upon the moon would impose fantastic financial burdens upon the nation involved while achieving no military
    advantage. Missiles fired from Luna would require several days to reach terrestrial targets, might be detected (if
    launched <u>en</u> <u>masse</u>, as to achieve strategic results they would have to be) by bases of other nations
    colonizing the moon or even (perhaps) by Sentinel satellites orbiting the moon as they currently orbit the earth,
    and would be less accurate (although, due to lower lunar gravity, their warheads could be much larger) than
    terrestrial ICBMs. Furthermore, the chief advantage of undetected lunar missiles would be low warning time, an
    advantage possible through the deployment of clandestine nuclear weapons in orbit.
  </p>
  <p>Indeed, Secretary of Defense McNamara revealed on November 3, 1967 that the Soviets appeared to be designing a
    "Fractional Orbital Bombing System: (FOBS). In effect, the Soviet orbital bomb envisioned by Secretary McNamara
    would be an ICBM launched into orbit and sent earthward before completion of its orbit to strike a target elsewhere
    on the planet. Since such an orbital ICBM could orbit over the South Pole, thereby circumventing the northern BMEWS
    detection system of the United States, FOBS warheads could impact with as little as three minutes' warning.
  </p>
  <p>Secretary McNamara hastened to add that an "Over the Horizon" radar network would allow the United States as early
    as 1968 to detect launchings of missiles in their homeland itself, thereby vastly increasing the warning time
    available. The danger remained, however, that nuclear weapons might be secretly stationed in <u>permanent</u> <u>orbit</u>
    among the more than one thousand objects currently extant in near space. The declaration of Hall Syndicate columnist
    Paul Scott on November 25, 1967 that the Soviets appeared to be developing Multiple Independent Re-entry Vehicle
    (MIRV) warhead for orbital vehicles heightened apprehension that a "first strike" from space might one day be
    contemplated by Soviet leaders.
  </p>
  <p>Secretary McNamara's announcement of September 18, 1967 that the United States would construct a "thin"
    Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) defense system brought demands (from influential Democrats such as Senators Pastore and
    Jackson as well as such Republicans as John Tower and Richard Nixon) that a "heavy" ABM system capable of blunting a
    Soviet nuclear assault (at a cost of forty billion dollars) be built. In November came the news that the U.S. was
    perfecting a "spectrum bomb", which when exploded at a high altitude would emit a virtual spectrum of pure radiation
    capable of melting and otherwise neutralizing entire fleets of incoming warheads (<u>New York Times</u>, November
    16, 1967) - and presumably the Soviets, whose lead in high-altitude nuclear technology had been frozen by the test
    ban treaty of 1963, had already developed the "spectrum bomb" and might be deploying it in their <u>own</u> ABM
    system, "already well toward completion due to an earlier start than that of the United States.
  </p>
  <p>The announcement at the close of 1967 -that the United States was developing a "space bus" (or traveling MIRV
    missile able to deliver warheads to targets hundreds of miles apart) to be fired by American submarines (<u>New York
      Times</u>, December 14, 1967) substantiated the growing fear that, in the words of an earlier New York Times
    editorial (November 5, 1967), "the arms race is accelerating into near space.
  </p>
  <p>Balanced against the prospect of warfare in near space are the United Nations space treaties, based upon two
    General Assembly resolutions of 1962 and signed by both major space powers. The treaties in question specifically
    prohibit the stationing of mass destructive weapons in orbit or in deep space as well as the annexation of any
    territory or area in space by a given nation for its own purposes.
  </p>
  <p>The nations of the world - and the Soviet Union and the United States in particular . have in signing the U.N.
    treaties in question given at least lip service to the extension of international law into space. While both space
    powers have been developing weapons (both offensive and defensive) for use in near space, no such weapons have
    (obviously) been actually used. Nevertheless, the treaties involved are deficient in that they contain no inspection
    clause to determine whether mass destructive weapons are indeed being secretly stored in space for future use.
  </p>
  <p><u>U. S. News and World Report</u> has noted that the American Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL) scheduled for
    placement in orbit in 1970 might be employed to identify and destroy clandestine orbital weapons (November 20,
    1967). This student hopes that a United Nations MOL might be launched.to enforce the United Nations space treaties.
  </p>
  <p>Perhaps an international inspection or even policing force, established by and representing all the nations of the
    world, might actually lead to an international space exploration effort.
  </p>
  <p>Such an international space program could serve several functions. It would substantially reduce the costs of space
    exploration by preventing duplication of effort and achievement. It would greatly enhance the efficiency and safety
    factors involved in space flight by allowing each nation to exchange its knowledge with its counterpart (or, a bit
    farther in the future counterparts). For example, the death by fire of three American astronauts in 1967 has been
    traced to the high oxygen content of the capsule atmosphere, a condition which the Soviet's larger booster power
    enabled them to avoid since their rockets could launch heavier gases as well; on the other hand, the death of a
    Soviet cosmonaut occurred during re-entry, a stage of orbital flight in which American superiority was acknowledged.
  </p>
  <p>Finally, but most significantly, such a program would encourage the lessening of tensions on earth - and thus
    hopefully reduce the possibility that the awesome weapons of near space might someday be armed and deployed. The
    program would face obstacles, such as the security of the nations involved and the lack at present of a coordinating
    international organization, but such problems would be political rather than scientific.
  </p>
  <p>The United States has proposed a co-operative space program to the Soviets, but has never received an affirmative
    response. If international pressure can be applied to a great enough extent to force Soviet cooperation, if
    safeguards against espionage can be formulated, and if viable international institutions can be created, then the
    human exploration of space may become a truly human adventure - embracing all of mankind.
  </p>
  <h3>II. Problèmes de la société humaine</h3>
  <p>If man through law surmounts the problems of his own aggressiveness , his exploration of the universe still faces
    the obstacles of a new and alien environment.
  </p>
  <p>His first problem may well be that of reaching his destination in the first place. Food and water must be provided;
    human wastes must be considered. Of coarse, a terrestrial atmosphere must be maintained for the space travelers.
  </p>
  <p>Another problem which arises is that of gravity - or rather lack of it. Life under zero gravity conditions would
    not only be disconcerting psychologically, but would not be without biological effects either. Experiments in
    "bio-satellites", containing plant and insect life subjected to low gravity conditions, indicate that such
    conditions greatly stimulate growth, on the part of both the organisms themselves and their cells (<u>Hartford
      Courant</u>, October 18, 1967). As a result, space travelers might over a period of time find themselves
    increasingly susceptible to cancer, leukemia and other malignant biological malfunctions.
  </p>
  <p>As a result, future voyagers between worlds might be obligated to deliberately slow their cell growth and metabolic
    rates through drugs during the journey. Artificial gravity could be created by spinning, the spacecraft in its
    trajectory, although duplicating the gravitational pull of the earth itself might not be possible in the foreseeable
    future.
  </p>
  <p>As for food and water, Robert Plumb (1962) [1] has cited Air Force experiments in simulated space flight. Food,
    although concentrated and pre-cooked, was stored from the onset of-the "space flight", while drinking water could be
    produced through purification of recycled urine, wash water, and water vapor condensed from the cabin atmosphere.
    The Air Force studies also failed to discover any evidence of friction between members of the "crew", even after
    long periods (although the situation might alter radically during a two year-journey to Mars, for example), nor did
    life in an artificial atmosphere appear harmful.
  </p>
  <p>This student suggests at this point that in long journeys involving fairly large vehicles cultures of algae or
    other edible fungus might be maintained within a spacecraft. Not only could such plant-life serve as a source of
    nutrient, but, also as a source of oxygen for the crew while absorbing excess carbon dioxide.
  </p>
  <p>Once he has reached his destination, man might well wish to colonize if possible. The gravitational pull of
    Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune would be far too great for the human body to withstand, and the atmospheres and
    temperatures upon such planets would hardly be inviting in any event. Pluto, at the very edge of the solar system,
    may well be colonizable if bases can be erected in the frozen slush of its atmosphere, which Felix Godwin (1960) [2]
    suggests might be a source of rocket fuel. Mercury, the closest planet to the sun,alternates as it rotates from
    extreme heat to intense cold.
  </p>
  <p>For the near future, at least, Mars, Venus, and Earth's own Luna appear to be the likeliest prospects. Recent
    probes of Venus indicate high temperatures, an inhospitable atmosphere, and little water; colonists would have to
    live in a wholly artificial environment insulated against heat, with its own resources, and protected against a
    heavier atmospheric pressure. Mariner IV has shown Mars to be very similar to the moon, with an atmosphere nearly as
    thin (if, indeed, a lunar atmosphere exists at all) and low temperatures (although probably not as low as lunar
    cold). Nevertheless, as Professor Page (1967) [3] has noted, both turtles and bacteria have been found able to exist
    in "Mars Jars" simulating the thin atmosphere, low temperatures, and high ultra-violet radiation of that planet - so
    Martian agriculture and even husbandry may conceivably be possible for colonists.
  </p>
  <p>According to J.W.E.H. Sholto Douglas (1956) [4] agriculture may even be possible upon the moon. Douglas envisions
    plants nurtured in domes, provided with artificial sunlight and an artificial atmosphere, and growing in the lunar
    topsoil, fertilized by chemicals. Douglas calls the process <u>hydroponic farming</u> and cites its success in
    earthly laboratories. Since Surveyor V indicates that no thick dust layer shrouds the lunar surface, Douglas'
    proposal appears feasible on the moon as well as elsewhere.
  </p>
  <p>Marcus O'Day (1958) [5] theorizes that solar power might be employed to support a lunar colony and hypothesizes
    that water may exist beneath the lunar surface. Neil Ruzic (1965) [6] prefers to establish lunar nuclear plants,
    employing their power to "launch" rockets earthward without consumption of fuel, an achievement possible
    (theoretically) in the low lunar gravity.
  </p>
  <p>In addition, Professor Page (1967) [7] has reported the finding of Surveyor V that meteoric bombardment or the
    lunar surface is less than had been previously believed. Construction of domes and/or other structures upon the moon
    may therefore be more feasible, although "bumpers" of the type proposed by Dr. Fred L. Whipple of Harvard (1946) [8]
    for interplanetary travel would undoubtedly be provided as a matter of course.
  </p>
  <p>It is more difficult to visualize Martian, Venison, or Plutonian colonization than colonization of earth's
    satellite. Yet the tentative colonization proposals for the moon ere the result or greater knowledge of earth's
    nearer neighbor. Once initial probes (manned and otherwise) have thoroughly (or at least substantially) probed more
    distant worlds, human minds will begin to discover means by which human beings can live upon such worlds.
  </p>
  <p>Considering the farther future, one might extrapolate that distinct human institutions might develop to meet the
    challenges of interplanetary exploration. Presently the prohibitive expenses of early (that is, twentieth century)
    space travel and exploration would force governments to assume the major if not entire responsibility for such
    efforts. However, as the expense of interplanetary flight begins to decrease, the foothold of private enterprise in
    space (as in the case or the COMSAT Corporation) is likely to grow rapidly.
  </p>
  <p>Arthur C. Clarke (1967) [9] notes that the cost of launching a payload into space has been reduced from one million
    to one thousand dollars per pound since the dawn of the Space Age, and has himself suggested (1961) [10] that lunar
    flight costs could be reduced by establishing fuel deposits in lunar orbit rather than on the lunar surface. General
    Electric's astronautical consultant Dandridge M. Cole (cited by Neil P. Ruzic in T<u>he Case for Going to the
      Moon</u>, G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1965, p. 70) has projected that the cost per pound of an earth-to-moon
    flight will drop from five thousand to thirty dollars by 1980.
  </p>
  <p>Neil Ruzic (1967) [11] foresees lunar mining to meet the needs of an earth swiftly exhausting its own natural
    resources and envisions vacuum manufacturing as well - and Ruzic is editor of the magazine <u>Industrial
      Research</u>. Donald Douglas, Jr. (in Arthur Clarke's <u>The Coming of the Space Age</u>, Meredith, New York,
    1967, pp. 130-35), President of Douglas Aircraft, predicts commercial space flight. It is not beyond this student's
    imagination to envisage twenty-first century colonies built for profit by interplanetary developers.
  </p>
  <p>Yet the planetary colonies will remain autonomous, separated not merely by space but by time. Technological
    advancement, it seems likely, will shorten the time required to reach other worlds, but even at the speed of light a
    gap remains. Communication between Luna and Terra (even with the three second time lag between statement and
    response) may be feasible on a fairly wide basis; communication between Mars and Terra (with a time lag measured in
    minutes) may be tolerable; communication between Pluto (or even, for example, a Jovian satellite) and Terra might be
    rendered as a practical matter impossible by a time lag of hours. Communication between interstellar colonies would
    of course be inconceivable - with a time lag measured in years.
  </p>
  <p>Biological factors may be at work also. Generation after generation living upon a given planet might well produce a
    different type of being, as suggested by Arthur C. Clarke in his novel <u>Earthlight</u> (Ballantine, New York,
    1955). A fifth generation Martian colonist might actually be physically as well as psychologically different from
    his earthly counterparts.
  </p>
  <h3>III. L'Univers et la condition humaine</h3>
  <p>How, then, does it appear that space is likely to affect man? Furthermore, how is man likely to affect space?</p>
  <p>Scientifically, the technological "fallout" of advancing space technology is almost certain to continue to spark
    equally significant advances in other branches of science. Economically, it seems probable that space will challenge
    the most imaginative businessmen and government planners to create entire new fields of enterprise, while at the
    same time products of other planets may conceivably stimulate the economy of earthly societies. Sociologically and
    politically, the exploration of space may well unify man or, alternatively, open new avenues and motivations of
    national rivalries. Spiritually, the fulfillment of a dream that has existed since the earliest human times might
    well inspire man to reach new levels of creativity, philosophy, and aesthetics.
  </p>
  <p>Perhaps realization of the vastness of the universe and of the awkwardness of man in an alien environment might
    lead to a deepened sense of humility. He may be more conscious of littering his universe (as he has already to some
    extent clogged near space with over one thousand objects) and of polluting his new home planets (as he has polluted
    his own). He may find ultimately that he has not conquered space, but space him, as scattered cultures born of
    terrestrial seed blossom thoughout space.
  </p>
  <p>As was noted before, the exploration of space will be accomplished by human beings. One can only hope that the new
    adventure upon which man is embarking will render him worthier of declaring: "I am a man."

  <p>(In a critique of this paper, Ramon diRenna wrote:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>...Many questions arise concerning space probing: How will man live in space? What will he do for a learning
      process? How will he be affected psychologically? medically? Will he be able to establish permanent colonies in
      space? How will he react to the change in his environment over a long period of time? and the most important
      question of all: Will man be able to get along with other people and form an effective political ruling force
      under the new and rigorous conditions of space habitation? A few of these questions are touched upon, but none of
      them are answered to my satisfaction (and the last one, which is actually the interrogative form of the paper's
      title, is not touched upon at all.) In his conclusion, the author does not even mention human relations in
      space. </p>
    <p>The paper could be made to be much more effective by using a model space colony as an example to illustrate the
      problems of human relations in space. In this way, Schellhardt could discuss and explain each problem as it arose
      in the colony...)</p>

  <h2 id="Madden">Les implications des soucoupes volantes pour la théologie</h2>
  <p>Par William Madden.</p>
  <p>Dans le livre à succès de <span class="people">Frank Edwards</span> <i lang="en">Flying Saucers - Serious
    Business</i> l'auteur cite <q>certains cas classiques</q> (dans un chapitre du même titre) d'observations d'ovnis.
    En guise d'introduction, je souhaiterais présenter plusieurs de ces cas.
  </p>
  <p>Le 1er cas traite d'un objet solide, d'apparence métallique de près de 30 pieds de diamètre ayant un banc de 20 ou
    30 projecteurs brillants jaunes ou oranges sous une plate-forme circulaire avec 3 pieds, apparemment un train
    d'atterrissage sous forme de tripode. L'objet fut vu en train de chercher un point d'atterrissage et, atténuant sa
    lumière, finit par toucher le sol et rester immobile. Au bout d'une période de 30 mn il commença à s'élever et
    lorsqu'il atteignit une altitude de 300 pieds, accéléra rapidement en direction horizontale et disparût.
  </p>
  <p>Un 2nd signalement concerne la découverte accidentelle d'un objet en forme de disque couleur cuivre, encore une
    fois d'environ 30 pieds de diamètre, avec un dôme bas, rond et luisant. Cet appareil fut trouver reposant sur une
    autoroute près de Pretoria, en <a href="/org/za/index.html">Afrique du Sud</a>. 10 s après que la voiture de police
    qui arriva dessus se soit arrêtée, l'objet s'éleva rapidement sur 2 échappements de flammes depuis des tubes situés
    sur son côté inférieur et disparût. La chaleur de ces souffles détruisit la section de route sur laquelle l'objet
    s'était installé et une enquête ultérieure prouva que l'asphalt avait été brisé par un poids très lourd.
  </p>
  <p>Un 3ᵉ incident eut lieu à un aéroport près de Marseille, en France. L'objet observé était conique aux 2
    extrêmités, d'environ 15 pieds de long et 3 pieds d'épaisseur au centre, et avait une demi-douzaine de fenêtres
    luisant avec une lumière jaune douce. L'appareil fut vu glisser depuis un endroit entre 2 hangars et venir reposer
    sur une piste. Lorsqu'il fut approché, il émit une gerbe d'étincelles et sauta dans l'air, où il fonça au loin à une
    altitude extrêmement basse.
  </p>
  <p>J'ai choisi ces 3 incidents en particulier parce qu'il existe une possibilité distincte de vérité dans chaque cas.
    Les témoins de ces observations incluent 1 <a href="/people/pilotes.html">pilote</a> d'avion vétéran, un ingénieur,
    2 officiers de police et 1 officier des douanes — des hommes que nous créditerions normalement d'une bonne dose
    d'intelligence et de responsibilité. Mon but dans la considération de ces exemples n'étant pas de présenter une
    preuve définie de l'existence des soucoupes volantes, mais plutôt de montrer que l'existence de tels phénomènes
    n'est pas entièrement au-delà de la gamme des possibilités. Si l'on écarte le problème des soucoupes volantes comme
    étant le produit de l'imagination, l'hallucination ou une identité mal comprise alors les questions considérées dans
    la discussion qui suit ne sembleront pas pertinentes. Cependant, si l'on accepte la possibilité de l'existence des
    soucoupes volantes, on doit nécessairement accepter que ces objets sont le produit d'une connaissance technologique
    sophistiquée et par conséquent qu'il existe des êtres extraterrestres possédant un intellect au moins égal à, et en
    toute probabilité plus grand que le nôtre. De nombreux autres points peuvent être trouvés pour soutenir la
    possibilité d'extraterrestres intelligents, comme la découverte de signaux radio venus de l'espace, considérés par
    certains <a
        href="/people/scientifiques.html">scientifiques</a> comme étant des messages de galaxies éloignées, et la loi
    des moyennes, qui semblerait indiquer que le vaste univers est habité par plus de 1 race d'être intelligents.
  </p>
  <p>Une discussion de ces 2 points peut être trouvée dans <em>The New Intelligent Man's Guide to Science</em> de <a
      href="/people/a/AsimovIsaac/index.html">Isaac Asimov</a>. Ils sont inclus dans une section du chapitre 12
    intitulée "Vie dans d'autres mondes". Sur le sujet de la loi des moyennes, l'auteur cite la recherche du
    scientifique de l'espace américain, Stephen H. Dole. Même en se limitant lui-même à une considération de la
    possibilité que la vie <em>humaine</em> existe dans d'autres systèmes solaires, Dole estime qu'il existe 17
    milliards d'étoiles dans notre galaxie capables de soutenir une telle vie (les étoiles de classes spectrales F2 à
    K1). Bien que chacune de ces étoiles adaptées puisse ne pas être nécessairement le centre de planètes habitables, il
    existe toujours probablement quelque 600 millions de planètes habitables dans notre galaxie. Cela signifierait qu'il
    y a 1 planète habitable par 80000 <a href="/science/discipline/hard/nat/univ/astro/AnneeLumiere.html">années-lumières</a>
    cubiques (ou que la planète habitable la plus proche est approximativement à 27 <a
        href="/science/discipline/hard/nat/univ/astro/AnneeLumiere.html">années-lumières</a> de distance et que 50
    existent à moins de 100 <a
        href="/science/discipline/hard/nat/univ/astro/AnneeLumiere.html">années-lumières</a> de la <a
        href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/index.html">Terre</a>). Dole estime de plus que puisque la vie
    intelligente a existé pendant 1/2000ᵉ du temps où notre planète a possédé la vie, 1 planète sur 2000 possédant la
    vie possède une vie intelligente. Cela autoriserait jusqu'à 320000 intelligences dans notre galaxie.</p>
  <p>As for radio signals, the author cites the discovery by a team of Anglo-American astronomers of signals from
    sources called CTA-21 (in the constellation Aries) and CTA-102 (in the constellation Pegasus). These signals had
    wavelengths of ten to fifty centimeters, well beyond the eight to fifty centimeter range estimated necessary for
    interstellar communication and well beyond the intensity of anything we are able to produce.
  </p>
  <p>In the face of evidence of the above type, the case for the existence of flying saucers can be seen as more than
    the superstitious speculation of fertile but irresponsible and illogical imaginations. My discussion will deal with
    the theological implications or the existence of such extraterrestrial spacecraft and consequently of the existence
    of intelligent life beyond that found on our planet. I believe that I can most fruitfully discuss these implications
    in terms of several problems which arise for traditional Christianity since I am, having studied in a Roman Catholic
    background, most familiar with the side of theological thought.
  </p>
  <p>One basic tenet of Christianity is the belief that at some point in the evolution of man this creature was endowed
    with a quality called the soul. This quality is supposed to be the factor which distinguishes man from the rest of
    living matter on the earth. At least three main characteristics of this distinguishing quality can be discussed. The
    first is intellect or the ability to reason and think logically. This first characteristic is closely related to the
    second, which is the possession of a conscience. the ability to perceive the difference between good and evil. The
    third notable characteristic is the fact that human being have certain emotions, the most obvious being that of love
    (as opposed to animal affection and longing). One might also include here qualities such as the emotions of hate and
    revenge and man's ability to have a sense of humor. (This last also falls in certain ways under the first
    characteristic mentioned.) These three characteristics can provide a fairly accurate definition of the soul as it is
    commonly considered. However, such a definition could prove, as will be shown, rather limited in that it applies
    exclusively to human beings; in fact, the terms "soul" and "human being" many times are practically equated (even to
    the point that we often hear an unfortunate human being referred to as "some poor soul").
  </p>
  <p>When a Christian admits that flying saucers may exist he has implied, theologically, a great deal more than he may
    immediately be aware of. For without in any way altering the above definition of soul, we can see that the
    technology involved in manufacturing such spacecraft proves that at least one basic characteristic of this quality
    is present in its builders, that is, the intellect of these extraterrestrial scientists. That the other factors
    which comprise this quality of soul may also be possessed by these aliens is quite plausible. Thus we are confronted
    with the possibility of other worlds whose inhabitants exactly parallel us human beings both physically and
    spiritually.
  </p>
  <p>Considering extraterrestrials as parallel to us is an extremely limited consideration however. For it is most
    likely that the flying saucer manufacturers are not physically similar to us at all. Arthur C. Clarke, in a
    fascinating article entitled "When Earthman and Alien Meet", (in the January 1968 issue of Playboy Magazine)
    considers several of the infinite varieties of forms which extraterrestrial beings (or E.T.'s as he calls them)
    could take. These beings might range from anything as conventional as a humanoid (even these would prove no closer
    to a man physically than a bear or chimpanzee at best) to such rarities as a group of microscopic creatures forming
    a rational entity only when combined as an intelligent cloud. He discusses the possibility of creatures with
    separate organs to perform the many functions which we perform with one mouth and beings shaped like sea monsters or
    insects. Any of these alien forms might be capable of rationality, love, or a sense of beauty. We see therefore that
    not only could the soul be a quality of extraterrestrial humans but also of almost any other intelligent life form.
    Furthermore, there may exist life forms with subtle combinations of the characteristics of the possession of a soul.
    One might discover, for example, a civilization of humans or non-humans similar to that described in Aldous Huxley's
    <u>Brave New World</u>. These creatures may have attained a perfection of technology and yet may lack any sort of
    emotion. Certainly these creatures could not be easily dismissed as lacking souls when some theologians argue that
    the undeveloped fetus, babbling idiots or even living, functionless human mutations have souls.
  </p>
  <p>This extension of the concept of soul to include extraterrestrial life forms raises many other interesting problems
    for traditional Christianity in providing a basis for speculation about the relevance of Christian teaching to alien
    worlds. One particularly interesting question is the matter of the lack of complete virtue which supposedly accounts
    for the conflict in human nature between the attraction towards good and the desire for immediate gratification
    through evil. For Christians, this conflict is basically one between love and giving on the one hand and selfishness
    and hate on the other. The lack of complete virtue is seen as the result of loss of grace in the soul through sin.
    The Bible symbolizes the lack of perfection in human nature as the fall of Adam from his perfect state in the Garden
    of Eden. If the universe contains worlds other than the Earth, inhabited by spiritual as well as physical creatures,
    beings with souls and therefore, according to Christian teaching, able to "fall from grace", several possibilities
    present themselves. If "fallen" extraterrestrials exist, they will be necessarily drawn towards evil as well as
    good. These aliens would therefore be capable of war, selfish ambition for power, deceit, or whatever other forms of
    evil particularly suited their planet. If other such "fallen" life forms exist, it is possible to imagine the
    problems of the Earth on a universal scale. The problems of "fallen" humanity could exist in suitable forms in all
    the galaxies if other worlds are inhabited by "fallen souls". Christian defined evil as well as Christian defined
    good could exist throughout the universe. However, Christian tradition would also seem to allow at least one other
    possibility. For if the Biblical snake has not polluted certain worlds, there must also exist "Gardens of Eden" in
    space. Evil would therefore be confined only to the fallen worlds. C.S. Lewis' <em>Perelandra</em> is based on the
    hypothesis that evil is by no means a universal fact. Perelandra is an unfallen planet where grace and good have no
    opposites.
  </p>
  <p>The possibility of Perelandras presents the second problem stemming from the discussion of non-Earth souls.
    Christianity teaches that the life and crucifixion of Christ were necessary processes for the salvation of fallen
    mankind. His death, therefore, would have no meaning for the inhabitants of a Perelandra. His crucifixion would
    immediately be reduced to an event of limited importance for the universe.
  </p>
  <p>Further problems arise in considering the possibility of other fallen planets. Christ is traditionally the savior
    of <em>mankind</em>. If this is the correct point of view, the salvation process is again seen as a rather limited
    achievement, relevant only for the Earth. Unless the death of Christ took place many times on many different fallen
    worlds, an expanded view of the nature of Christ going far beyond the teachings of traditional Christianity would be
    necessary for Christ to be considered in any way a universally important figure.
  </p>
  <p>Another problem with the nature of Christ becomes evident in the Christian basis for holding that humanity is
    sanctified. Christ is considered both human and divine; he is God become man. The process through which this is
    accomplished is known as The Incarnation. The belief in the sanctity of life stems from this act of divinity taking
    on the nature of its creature. The crux of the problem can be seen in the name of the process itself, for The
    Incarnation is process in which " the word was God...and the word became <u>flesh</u>..."; Christ is not God become
    a being with a soul but specifically God become <u>man</u>. The Incarnation is, as Christianity has named and
    defined it, a limited process. Just as with the salvation process, the concept of God sanctifying human life through
    Christ, must either be expanded to include all life-forms with souls or prove irrelevant for the universe. For
    Christianity to be universally applicable, Christ must be God become intelligent cloud as well as God become man.
  </p>
  <p>Many miracles of Christ would seem quite meaningless or unmiraculous to extraterrestrials. Even if one disregards
    all of the lesser miracles, the greatest miracle, the Resurrection (Christ rising from the dead) might seem
    unimpressive to certain aliens. For, as Clarke points out in his article, there may be extremely advanced beings
    whose technology had achieved immortality. Wonders concerning escape from the inevitable become meaningless when the
    inevitable is destroyed.
  </p>
  <p>The possibility of immortality can be further examined as a problem for traditional Christianity. Christianity, of
    course, has as its ultimate goal the attainment of heaven. Christ is recorded in the Gospels as saying "My kingdom
    is not of this world," and the Christian is in effect assured of eternal happiness if he fully enters the spirit of
    Christianity. For a technically advanced being who can prolong his life indefinitely, a moral philosophy which
    includes a concept of an afterlife could prove unsatisfying if the perfect eternal state is presented as a type of
    "reward for virtue". This concept of Christianity is often stressed, however. The concept of a Christian humanism
    perhaps would be far more relevant for creatures capable of striving for perfection during their physical lives. A
    final problem with traditional Christianity worth considering is related closely to the problem with the concept of
    the Incarnation as discussed above. This is the problem of adapting the symbols of Christianity to alien worlds.
    This problem of course would occur in applying many human institutions in general to novel extraterrestrial
    civilizations, but it is particularly noteworthy in the case of Christianity, which often uses symbols and ceremony
    to express the beliefs upon which it is founded. Moreover, if a symbol is valid, often superficial problems with the
    symbol can stem from a deeper problem with that which is symbolized. An example of this type of problem with symbols
    is the Consecration, the changing of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, which is an essential point
    in the major celebration of several Christian religions. In considering this subject we see that it is founded on
    the premise that human beings are the only beings with a soul. Once again we find the necessity for a change in an
    aspect of Christianity if it is to remain when faced with possible future discoveries about the universe.
  </p>
  <p>Il est intéressant de noter que <a href="/people/a/AsimovIsaac/index.html">Asimov</a> introduit sa discussion sur
    la vie extraterrestre avec la phrase : <q>Si nous devons accepter le point de vue que la vie nait simplement du
      fonctionnement des lois physiques et chimiques, il s'ensuit qu'en toute probabilité la vie n'est pas confinée à la
      <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/index.html">Terre</a>.</q> We find implied here the non-existence of
    God which can probably be considered the essence or the problem which a technologically advancing age presents for
    all religion. It is trite but true to say that the science fiction of yesterday is the science fact of today. As
    more discoveries are made about the scientific truth behind phenomena, there seems to be an increasingly slim basis
    for belief in God, an essential belief for any Christian religion at least. Revision must constantly be made of the
    most firmly rooted ideas; nothing is absolutely sacred and in our times it is extremely easy to be certain that God
    also is not only uninvolved, but really dead. I am fairly certain that science in time, can accomplish anything and
    therefore I am willing to admit the possibility of beings who have developed their own immortality. If hearts can be
    transplanted on Earth in 1968, why should it be impossible to keep intelligent beings living for at least the time
    necessary to travel from another star? Furthermore, if science can accomplish anything eventually, how relevant will
    a concept of God be in centuries to come? These are questions intimately related to any discussion of the
    implications of the existence of flying saucers.
  </p>
  <p>Although my purpose here is not to present an exhaustive discussion of the possible philosophical solutions to such
    questions, I think that at least one line of thought which is rather relevant to the issue should be mentioned, that
    of the Catholic philosopher Teilhard de Chardin. Although his works were for a long time suppressed by conservative
    forces (or better, perhaps, traditionalists) in the Catholic Church, his thinking may prove to be the most
    acceptable workable solution to the problem. Chardin would find in the science vs. theology controversy only an
    apparent dichotomy. He sees science as a tool for discovering increasingly more about the wonder of God. Any
    knowledge about the nature of any phenomenon in the universe does not disprove the existence of God but rather
    provides an expanded view of his creative power.
  </p>
  <p>In summary, therefore , we see that the existence of flying saucers would indicate the existence of intelligent
    extraterrestrial life, either human or non-human. Such an existence would apparently present problems for religion,
    just as any extraordinary scientific discovery does. Traditional Christianity would prove particularly susceptible
    in the face of the problem of flying saucers. Unless many of its concepts were altered radically, this particular
    type of religion would most certainly become an irrelevant, human mythology of sorts. Ultimately, however, all
    religious thought must become truly universally applicable or die with the advance of unlimited technology.

  <h2 id="Swanson">Voyage vers les étoiles</h2>
  <p>Edward T. Swanson</p>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>The major point of this paper is to show that travel between the stars encompasses problems of such number and
    magnitude as to make it impractical if not totally impossible. Today many people ask whether or not "flying saucers"
    come from another world. Since it is very doubtful that such visitors come from our solar system, the existence of
    "flying saucers" depends on the possibility of interstellar travel. By investigating the problems involved in
    traveling to the stars, it is my intent in this paper to show the unlikelihood of such travel. However, the paper is
    <u>not</u> merely a summation of arguments against interstellar travel; the question will be considered in an
    open-minded manner, allowing the facts to suggest their own conclusion. Four general areas will be discussed:
    propulsion, navigation, space hazards, and possible problems facing the travelers. Naturally, in undertaking a topic
    of this scope and complexity, literally hundreds of potential problems and difficulties for such an expedition
    cannot be mentioned here. Yet to treat one aspect in isolation would be to lose the purpose of this paper: an
    examination or the possibility of traveling to other stars. The significance of such an overpowering question is -
    to me at least - sufficient to warrant this approach.
  </p>
  <h3>Propulsion</h3>
  <p>In discussing the various possible means of propulsion for a trip to the stars, three considerations must be kept
    in mind: acceleration, velocity, and specific impulse. Acceleration, although normally mentioned in relation to
    velocity (being the rate of change of velocity with respect to time), is considered here first because of its impact
    on the others, and because no man, even under carefully controlled conditions, can be subjected to more than about 8
    g without permanent injury. Taking into account the far-from-ideal conditions of space travel and the very long
    periods of acceleration and deceleration in voyaging to another solar system (the entire voyage would be spent in
    either acceleration or deceleration in a trip to a nearby star), tolerable rates of acceleration would have to be
    relatively small. Arthur C. Clarke has theorized:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Perhaps one day, when we have learned something about gravitation and the structure of space, we may be able to
      produce one of the "space drives" so beloved of science-fiction writers. These drives, for the benefit of anyone
      unacquainted with contemporary mythology, have the great advantage that, since the force they produce acts
      uniformly on every atom inside the spaceship, accelerations of any magnitude can be produced with no strain on the
      passengers. Even if the ship were accelerating at a thousand gravities, the occupants would still be weightless.
    </p>
    <p>There is nothing inherently absurd about this idea: in fact, a gravitational field produces precisely this
      effect. If one were falling freely towards Jupiter, not far outside the planet's atmosphere, one would be
      accelerating at two and a half gravities yet would be completely weightless. To take an even more extreme case,
      the very dense dwarf star Sirius B has a surface gravity at least 20,000 times as intense as the Earth's. Falling
      in such a field, one would be accelerating more rapidly than a shell while it was being fired from a gun, but
      there would be no feeling of strain whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>If we can ever generate the equivalent of a controlled gravitational field we shall certainly have a very
      effective drive for space ships - one which, combined with an appropriate source of energy, might enable speeds
      near that of light to be reached after relatively brief periods of acceleration.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>However, for the present, at least, acceleration remains one of the key stumbling-blocks to interstellar travel.
    Its implications will be discussed further when the time factor for such a journey is considered.
  </p>
  <p>Velocity (the time rate of change of position) is an essential factor in determining what form of propulsion to use
    in attempting to reach the stars. Unless the spacecraft were able to attain very high velocities, any voyage to the
    stars would take a very considerable amount of time. Aside from the effect upon the occupants, problems such as
    sufficient fuel, oxygen, food and water, and the increased possibility of mechanical and electrical failures, would
    tend to discourage a journey of such length. This problem can perhaps be visualized more clearly with the insertion
    of the following table of minimum launch velocities, with transit times, to reach the planets of our own solar
    system. [3]

  </table>
  <p>Thus, whatever propulsion system used will probably have to produce a very high velocity (unless one envisions a
    many-generation voyage).
  </p>
  <p>The final consideration to be mentioned before coming to the actual discussion of various propulsion systems is
    specific impulse. Specific impulse is simply the pounds of thrust per second for each pound of fuel consumed,
    expressed in seconds. Thus, fuels can be compared as to velocity achievable and the amount of fuel consumed using
    merely their specific impulse. Since both high velocity and minimal fuel consumption are desirable for interstellar
    travel, a high specific impulse is necessary.
  </p>
  <p>Turning now to possible propulsion systems, the first to consider is liquid propellants. Super-high energy
    bi-propellants such as fluorine hydrogen, fluorine-ammonia, ozone-hydrogen, and fluorine-diborane deliver a specific
    impulse of from 300 to 385 seconds. The combination of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen gives a specific impulse of
    around 450 seconds. However, for voyages to other stars much higher specific impulses are desirable, A problem with
    liquid propellants is that they are often bulky — as in the case of liquid hydrogen. This means increased weight for
    the container and shielding. Some liquid fuels with high specific impulses are either inadequate as coolants for the
    walls of the thrust-chamber or highly unstable. The availability of the fuel must be considered also, since a
    tremendous amount would be needed for a journey to another star. It must be remembered too that most liquid
    propellants are corrosive, flammable, or toxic. Thus, primarily due to inadequate specific impulse, but also other
    considerations, liquid propellants would not be suitable for a voyage to another solar system.

  <p>Two possible liquid propellants should — due to their nature — be considered apart from the other liquid
    propellants. These are the use of monatomic hydrogen or hyzone. J. Humphries has this to say about these rather
    unique possibilities:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Another possibility is the use of monatomic hydrogen. When this reassociates into the normal molecular form a
      great deal of energy is released - about ten times the amount available from a conventional propellant
      combination. By using this reassociation energy specific thrusts of up to about 1,700 seconds could be obtained at
      a chamber pressure of 400 lb. per square inch - but at a temperature of almost 10,000 degrees centigrade: By
      diluting the atomic hydrogen with molecular hydrogen this temperature could be reduced to a more moderate figure.
      For example, at 20 percent concentration a temperature of about 2,400 degrees centigrade and specific thrust of
      about 1,000 seconds would be attained. Unfortunately, monatomic hydrogen is exceptionally unstable and when
      produced, as in the atomic hydrogen torch, has a life of a few microseconds only. It is not beyond the bounds of
      possibility that, by the use of very low temperatures for example, a stable solution of monatomic hydrogen may be
      produced. Its application is, however, liable to be very hazardous, and it may be a better proposition to carry
      liquid molecular hydrogen and to produce the atomic form as required by means of an electrical discharge...
    </p>
    <p>"Further theoretical possibilities lie in the use of hyzone (H3) a molecule analogous to ozone, or metastable
      molecules of helium with hydrogen or oxygen. None of these molecules has yet been produced but, if it proves
      possible to produce them, they would on decomposition give very high specific thrusts." [4]
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>As is readily apparent, both systems contain many problems and "if's". Neither can be considered a solution to the
    propulsion problem at present.
  </p>
  <p>Solid propellants are the second half of the "conventional propellants". It should suffice to say that solid
    propellants simply will not do; their major drawback is that they once again produce insufficient specific impulse,
    and the more energetic solids often require carefully controlled storage conditions as well as handling. Recently
    there has been careful consideration of liquid-solid propellant combinations. Although offering greater specific
    impulse, the cost diverting massive research from present sectors to this area and the inadequate increase in
    specific impulse make this possibility also useless for travel to the stars.
  </p>
  <p>Another possible propulsion system presently being developed is nuclear. It would seem very unwise — if not indeed
    impossible — to harness the direct ejection of particles resulting from a nuclear reaction. Although such a feat
    would produce a specific impulse of about 1 000 000 s, it would be extremely difficult to direct a jet of these
    particles. The truly fundamental problem, however, is excess heat produced would evaporate the rocket. It would be
    similar to — indeed, but another name for — trying to regulate a nuclear explosion. Another possibility is using the
    nuclear reactor simply to replace the chemical reaction of conventional propulsion systems in heating a jet of gas
    for propulsion. Certain problems arise in this approach however. The nuclear pile must have a higher temperature
    than the gas being heated, naturally. But uranium oxide melts at 2176 degrees centigrade, so the temperature of the
    jet of gas must be lower than this. If 1500 °C were permissible, then the specific impulse produced would be only
    400 to 600 s. The only way to increase the temperature is to use a gaseous reactor, in which the reactor materials
    are gaseous within the actual chamber. The center could attain higher temperatures than the side, which would be
    cooled. The gaseous pile would be continuously ejected, making it very wasteful and in need of certain minimum size
    chamber for the fuel and working fluid. Therefore, the above two types of nuclear propulsion, although potentially
    able to produce very high specific impulse, each contain certain inherent difficulties.
  </p>
  <p>There is a third possible use for the nuclear reactor, converting the nuclear energy into electricity. This would
    be used as part of an ion propulsion system. In an ion propulsion system the fuel is actually a metal, usually
    mercury or cesium. The molecules of the fuel, known as the propellant, are then given an electric charge — ionized.
    This can be accomplished by passing the propellant over heated metal grids. It is them possible to accelerate the
    ions through a nozzle to speeds approaching that of light. Such an ion engine has a very good performance, with
    estimated specific impulse as high as 20,000 seconds! Unfortunately, the weight of the power-generating equipment
    needed to produce the necessary electric power is a major obstacle. Even with nuclear power to produce the energy,
    electrical generators would still be needed unless direct conversion to electrical energy could become practical.
    [5] In other words, the ion engine cannot produce sufficient acceleration. Perhaps this problem will be solved in
    the future.
  </p>
  <p>Today a nuclear reactor converts only a small fraction of the matter into energy. With nearly a total conversion
    into energy the necessary thrust for an adequate acceleration could be achieved. Though not answering the immediate
    question of a propulsion system for reaching the stars, the ion engine is the most promising system for the future.
  </p>
  <p>An essential part of any discussion of propulsion systems for interstellar flights is the time factor. The
    propulsion system used must be able to produce an adequate acceleration and a high velocity. A very high velocity
    becomes increasingly important as we consider more distant stars. Unless some method is found to enable man to
    withstand acceleration of several g's over long periods of time (years), unless such acceleration could be achieved,
    and unless velocities approaching the speed of light could also be achieved, interstellar voyages in man's lifetime
    will be virtually impossible. A voyage to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri- 4 1/2 light years away - would, even
    if the craft were able to accelerate to as much as 98% of the speed of light in a relatively short amount of time,
    take 5 years one way; the travelers would be gone for at least a decade even under the most ideal conditions (which
    can very probably never be achieved). If one further introduces the fact that any interstellar journeys would be in
    search of other planetary systems, then — aside from the perhaps hundreds of years consumed in sending probes to
    scout nearby suns before undertaking a manned journey — stars further than Proxima Centauri would be chosen as
    targets, thus aggravating an already acute problem of time. Not even relativity's "time contraction" (as a body
    approaches the speed of light time slows down for the occupants) offers any real escape from the time problem. The
    reason for this is that the time-contraction doesn't become significant until speeds greater than half the speed of
    light are reached — over 300 000 000 miles/h. Once again, some means to allow man to withstand the rapid
    acceleration is needed as well as some propulsion system able to give both rapid acceleration and velocities
    approaching that of light would be necessary. Arthur C. Clarke gives the example of a spacecraft which by converting
    90% of its mass into radiation reaches a speed equal to 98% that of light. Leaving the earth at an acceleration of 2
    g's, it would appear to the crew to take one year to reach final speed, while 5 1/2 years would have elapsed on
    earth [6] Using these figures in relation to Proxima Centauri, the crew could get there in about 6 or 7 years; long
    before they reached top speed they would have to begin decelerating and thus not benefit from time-contraction.
    Relativity would benefit longer voyages, where additional light-years distance would require only minutes additional
    time. Until the travelers returned "home", things would seem to be well. But, even under the ideal and rather
    unrealistic condition of high acceleration and velocity near the speed of light, the problem of returning to a
    totally unfamiliar world would exist. Unless some scientist discovers a "space-warp" device, time alone will nullify
    any desire and/or ability to travel to the stars - in one lifetime.
  </p>
  <p>The possibility of a multi-generation voyage to another star comes to mind. Such an approach would cancel the need
    for either great acceleration or velocity more than that sufficient to escape the sun's gravitational system. The
    problem however would be providing a propulsion system powerful enough to lift of the family housing as well as the
    fantastic amount of fuel required. Simply carving out such a gigantic "spacecraft" from an asteroid would be quite a
    challenge for mankind.
  </p>
  <p><u>Navigation</u></p>
  <p>The second area to be discussed is navigation. If the propulsion effort were all expended at the beginning of the
    journey, then the accuracy needed to reach a certain star would be beyond the limit of possibility. The travelers
    could very well find themselves in the midst of a great emptiness. Even with continuous thrust, the problem of
    navigation is a complex one. At high velocities (especially those near the speed of light), any attempt to determine
    the spacecraft's position would have to take into account the time elapsed since the light beam departed, the
    position of the beam's origin, and the difference in relative time of the traveler and earth. Perhaps radar pulses
    could be sent out to certain objects in definite positions before the voyage programmed so that the craft would meet
    the returning beams at certain times and thus be able to fix its position; or light beams from known stars could be
    measured as the craft makes its journey. Perhaps simply aiming at the apparent position of the star would suffice to
    get there. In multi-generation voyages navigation is of relatively little importance, since the huge craft would
    have plenty of time.
  </p>
  <h3>Dangers du voyage spatial</h3>
  <p>There are certain hazards of space which will have to be considered when planning a journey to the stars. Particles
    present a small, but very serious problem to interstellar travelers. The simplest problem that of the planets and
    asteroids. The positions of these can be plotted and it would be simple to plot a course which avoided these
    objects. Meteors and to a lesser extent comets present a more difficult problem. Although the possibility of
    colliding with one of these objects is infinitesimal once outside the solar system, the gravity of such a collision
    is such that the possibility must not be overlooked. Especially at very great velocities, the problem of collision
    becomes a serious threat. Any particle would puncture the ship, requiring repair. Damage to the propulsion system
    could possibly result in total disaster.
  </p>
  <p>Some harmful radiations such as ultraviolet radiation can easily shielded. Solar wind, the flux of plasma from the
    sun, should not pose any problem for interstellar flight. Cosmic rays, a highly penetrating radiation, could present
    the problem of adequate shielding, especially since the voyages would be so lengthy. But these hazards of space are
    no insurmountable problems in attempting to reach the stars.

  <p>A fundamental problem is that of the air needed for such a journey. A normal person breathes seven liters of air
    per minute, Considering the number of <u>years</u> an interstellar voyage would take, the amount of air needed to
    sustain even one person is fantastic, even when taking into consideration the reuse of air. The carbon dioxide
    exhaled also presents a problem. Present research is being undertaken concerning the use of algae to consume carbon
    dioxide while at the same time giving oxygen The amount of algae needed to provide a balanced and self-sustaining
    atmosphere should not be too great. However, if anything should go wrong with the algae, the travelers would be in
    an unfortunate situation. Food and water, as well as other necessary items in a journey of such magnitude, would
    also have to be included. Douglas Aircraft Company determined the various weight required in a 52 000 -lb. three-man
    space vehicle intended to travel extensively throughout the solar system:
  </p>
  <p>The mere number of travelers on an interstellar voyage and their sex creates a problem. If they are to be gone for
    perhaps a decade, should they all have mates? This would seem a sound idea, as well as having a minimum of four
    couples on the voyage. (Two people alone that long would be unadvisable; two couples would likewise become strained;
    in the case of three couples, one couple might feel "left out". An analogous problem existed when Admiral Byrd had
    to determine the number to stay at an isolated outpost in Antarctica.) The effects of acceleration for long periods
    will also have to be considered. Finally, the possible psychological effect of such a trip — cut off from everyone
    and everything, contained in a relatively small space for a long period facing the monotony of space — these and
    others will all have to be considered before such a journey is undertaken. Both physically and psychologically, man
    is not meant to explore the stars yet.
  </p>
  <h3>Summation</h3>
  <p>The possibility of travel to the stars has been considered: propulsion, navigation, space hazards, and problems
    facing the travelers. It is found that no adequate propulsion system has yet been found, the primary block to
    interstellar travel. Both navigation and space hazards could possibly be overcome; however, problems facing the
    travelers reaffirm the improbability of travel to other star systems, at least from the earth. Man is not yet ready
    to explore the heavens.
