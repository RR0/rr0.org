        href="../../../../../../../blue">Projet Blue Book</a>, l'enquête officielle aujourd'hui fameuse sur les ovnis.
    Voici ce qu'il a appris.</q></em><q> </q></p>
    <p>Le <time>12</time> <span class="mois">août</span> <a href="../../../../../../../1953">1953</a>, une femme du <a
        href="/org/us/dod/af/goc/index.html">Corps des Observateurs au Sol</a> dans les Collines Noires du Dakota du sud
      voit une lumière stationnaire dans le ciel à Est de sa position. 2 opérateurs d'une station radar sortirent
      vérifier la chose tandis que la femme était toujours au téléephone. Alors qu'ils scrutaient le ciel, la femme
      signala, <q>La chose commence à se déplacer au-dessus de Rapid City. </q>Au même moment, les 2 hommes du radar
      virent la lumière commencer à bouger. Ils retournèrent à leur radar pour la repérer, et la femme signala que
      l'objet revenait en arrière à sa position d'origine. Le <a
          href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a> got a fix on it at that spot. </p>
    <p>Un F-84, en l'air à ce moment, vu dirigé sur la cible. Le pilote du jet observa la lumière visuellement et partit
      après elle. L'objet se dirigeait vers le Nord avec le jet après lui, et les opérateurs radar observèrent la chasse
      sur leur écran. L'Objet Volant Non Identifié resta devant le jet et sembla to put on speed chaque fois que le
      pilote accélérait avec le jet. Après avoir chassé l'objet sur 120 miles, le pilote fut à court de carburant et
      reçu la permission de revenir. Lorsque le jet fit demi-tour, l'ovni vira également et le suivi sur le retour.</p>
    <p>Après que le jet ait atterri, un 2nd F-84 partit pour investiguer. Il fut orienté vers la position et repéra la
      chose visuellement au-dessus de lui. Il monta jusqu'à 20000 pieds, signala qu'il était au niveau de la lumière, et
      l'objet décolla à nouveau vers le nord avec le jet à sa poursuite. A nouveau la chasse fut observée sur le <a
          href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a> au sol, l'ovni et le jet étant
      pleinement visibles sur l'écran.</p>
    <p>Dans la 2nde poursuite, le pilote fit un certain nombre de tests pour exclure certains phénomènes courants ayant
      été pris à tort pour des "soucoupes volantes". Il éteignit toutes les lumières de ses instruments et [kicked the
      plane around] pour être certain qu'il ne prenait pas en chasse une réflexion de la canopée. Il ne le faisait pas.
      Il observa l'objet avec attention par rapport aux étoiles, et jura qu'il se déplaçait parmi elles, éliminant ainsi
      la possibilité qu'il pourchassait une planète ou une étoile. Finalement, lorsqu'il pensa se rapprocher de l'objet,
      il alluma ses visées de tir radar. Ce type de jet possède une lumière sur le panneau des instruments qui s'allume
      pour indiquer un "verrouillage" avec la cible par les visées <a
          href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a>. La lumière s'alluma.</p>
    <p>Le 2nd jet prit la lumière en chasse à 160 miles au nord avant d'abandonner la poursuite. A ce moment l'ovni
      continuait à voler vers le nord. Le Centre de Filtrage du <a href="/org/us/dod/af/goc/index.html">Corps
        d'Observateurs au Sol</a> devant fut alerté, et les observateurs qui s'y trouvaient signalèrent une lumière
      fonçant vers le nord.</p>
    <p>Ce fut de fait un cas étonnant. Il y avait des observatiosn visuelles simultanées depuis 2 sites au sol reliés
      par téléphone, des observations simultanées au sol et au radar, des observations simultanées sol-radar et
      jet-visuelle, une poursuite dans laquelle l'ovni sema le jet, une inversion de trajectoire, une 2nde observation
      jet-visuelle confirmée par le radar au sol, un "verrouillage" radar en l'air et finalement une observations depuis
      le sol à des centaines de miles de distance.</p>
    <p>Qu'était cet objet ? Pendant 2 ans, de <a href="/time/1951.html">1951</a> à <a
        href="/time/time/1/9/5/3/">1953</a>, j'ai parcouru en vol 200 000 miles, conféré avec des douzaines des
      meilleurs scientifiques américains et une collection exotique d'excentriques hot-eyed, stumbled through Florida
      mangrove swamps, dragged moi-même hors du lit à 3 h du matin pour répondre à des appels téléphoniques
      transatlantiques, inspected scores de photographies étranges et regardé un film court amateur 97 fois dans un
      effort pour répondre à cela et des questions similaires.</p>
    <p>Mes collègues et moi furent fustigés par des collègues américains pour avoir dissimulé la plus grande nouvelle
      dans l'histoire de l'homme moderne, et par Radio Moscou pour setting the stage de la guerre atomique.</p>
    <p>Je fus qualifié de dupe ignorant, un Charlie McCarthy manipulé par des forces puissantes au <a
        href="/org/us/state/wa/pentagone/index.html">Pentagone</a>. Je fus consulté par la Maison Blanche, et j'ai
      briefé la plus
      haute figure de l'Air Force, qui écoutait respectueusement et me laissa faire tout l'exposé.</p>
    <p>Pendant 2 ans, avec l'aide des meilleurs cerveaux du pays, nous avons travaillé sur un jigsaw géant d'un mystère
      qui était soit sans aucune signification, soit ferait basculer le monde.</p>
    <p>Pour chaque morceau que nous remettions en place, nous trouvions que 2 autres avaient été ajoutés à la pile du
      puzzle.</p>
    <p>Je me suis finalement retrouvé à inspecter sobrement un morceau de fumier de vache pour apprendre s'il était venu
      de l'espace.</p>

        charge de l'enquête officielle de l'Air Force sur les Objets Volants Non Identifiés, les choses qui whiz à
        travers l'espace sous le nom populaire de "soucoupes volantes".</p>
        <p>L'Ere de la Soucoupe Volante en était à l'An 5 lorsqu'it plucked me out de mon travail d'analyste en
          renseignement technique pour le <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">Centre de Renseignement Technique
            de l'Air</a> à <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html">Wright Field</a>, Dayton (Ohio).</p>
        <p>L'an 1 s'ouvrit le 24 juin <a href="../../../../4/7/index.html">1947</a>, lorsqu'un homme d'affaires de Boise
          nommé <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Kenneth Arnold</a> signala avoir vu une chaîne de 9 <q>choses
            semblables à des soucoupes</q> glinting dans le soleil alors qu'elles volaient à 1200 miles/h - 2 fois la
          vitesse du son - près du Mont Rainier. Son histoire snared l'imagination de la nation avec un fait baffling.
          Aucun <a href="../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/aeronef/index.html">appareil</a> connu dans le monde
          n'avait brisé le mur du son à cette époque. <q>Je ne le crois pas,</q> dit <a
              href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a>, <q>mais je l'ai vu</q>.</p>
        <p>S'il n'y avait eu que l'histoire d'<a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a>, l'ère de la <a
            href="../../../../../../../FlyingSaucers.html">Soucoupe Volante</a> se serait ouverte et refermée en 1 jour.
          Mais les 30 jours qui suivirent il y eut 53 signalements de <a
              href="../../../../../../../observation/pan/aspect/forme/Soucoupe.html">soucoupes</a> de plus. Près de
          Portland (Oregon), un couple de sherrifs adjoints en signala <q>20 dans une ligne allant like hell vers
            l'ouest</q>. Une mère au foyer de Chicago en vit un <q>avec des jambes</q> et courut dans la maison et
          claqua la porte. Un prospecteur dans les montagnes Cascade repéré 5 ou 6 d'entre eux <q>avec des queues</q> et
          fut effaré de voir son compas magnétique <q>tourner violemment</q>. A Spokane, une femme signala 5 d'entre eux
          <q>de la taille d'une maison de 5 pièces</q>. Les siens avaient la forme de <q>like washtubs</q>. Un homme
          particulièrement serein à Seattle spoke out et rapporté, <q>Pourquoi passent-ils tout le temps à travers notre
            jardin.</q></p>
        <p>A l'époque, j'étais dehors au Parc National de Yellowstone, en vacances du Collège de l'Etat d'Iowa, où
          j'étudiais l'ingéniérie aéronautique. C'était ma 2? tentative pour un diplôme. J'avais laissé tomber la 1ère
          fois, en <a href="../../../../4/2/index.html">1942</a>, pour m'engager dans l'Air Force. J'avais été affecté
          comme bombardier dans le 1er escadron de B-29 organisé, flown the Hump out of India, puis nous partirent over
          to Tinian pour les gros raids contre le Japon. Notre groupe vola la dernière mission de la guerre, un raid
          contre Tokuyama, quelques minutes avant la fin de la guerre.</p>
        <p>Quelques jours après l'observation de <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a>, des jeunes
          jetaient des assiettes en papier en l'air au-dessus de notre loge à Yellowstone et criaient, <q>Soucoupe,
            soucoupe !</q> Certains touristes commençaient à voir des choses et venir et en parler, comme si leurs
          vacances étaient terminées. Je lu l'histoire d'<a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a> et la
          jettais au loin. 2 fois au-dessus du Japon j'avais vu des objets étranges dans le ciel. 1 était une lumière
          jaune-orangée qui suivit notre B-29 pendant un moment et qui suddenly winked out. Le consensus était qu'il
          s'agissait d'un "<a href="../../../../4/2/FooFighters/index.html">foo fighter</a>"-la lumière étrange repérée
          des douzaines de fois par des aviateurs au-dessus de l'Europe et du Japon. La théorie était que c'était un
          phénomène électro-statique. Une autre fois, en volant sur le chemin du retour avec les nerfs jumpy après une
          mission difficile, I cut loose with 6 armes de calibres 0,50 sur un objet brillant juste vers l'aube. Après
          getting the crew in an uproar, je réalisais soudain que je tirais sur la planète <a
              href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus/index.html">Vénus</a>.</p>
        <p>Parmi les observations qui suivaient <a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a>, cependant, il
          y en avait qui avaient plus l'air d'une hystérie. Elles venaient de pilotes accoutûmés aux tours qu'un vol
          peut jouer sur les yeux, de scientifiques, parmi d'autres observateurs a priori sobre et non excités. Un
          météorologue en charge de la station du bureau météo U.S. de Louisville (Kentucky), signala une lumière orange
          "roulant" à travers le ciel nocturne. Au <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/MurocAFB.html">terrain d'aviation de
            Muroc</a>, en Californie, le site d'essais d'un avion expérimental secret du gouvernement, le lieutenant
          Joseph McHenry repéra <q>2 objets argentés de forme sphérique ou semblable à un disque.</q> Il appela 3 autres
          personnes de la base qui virent les mêmes choses. 3 autres témoins rejoignirent le groupe, et 5 des 7 virent
          un 3<sup>ème</sup> objet. Aucun <a href="../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/aeronef/index.html">appareil</a>
          expérimental n'était dans les airs. Les objets se déplaçaient contre le vent et par conséquent n'étaient pas
          des <a href="../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/ballon/index.html">ballons</a>. Quelques heures plus tard,
          un major et un colonel de <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/MurocAFB.html">Muroc</a> firent des observations
          séparées d'un <q>objet fin métallique</q> qui fôlatra au-dessus du terrain pendant 8 mn.</p>
        <p>L'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a>, appris-je plus tard, hésité entre 2 écoles de pensée
          concernant cette première éruption d'observations. Certains responsables d'assez haut rang êtaient préoccupés
          à leur sujet. Les U.S. avaient vu la complacency mener à un Pearl Harbor, et la tension internationale
          commençait à tighten sous le climat de la "guerre froide." Ces responsables pensaient que nous devrions
          trouver ? et rapidement ? ce qui causait l'épidémie des histoires de <a
              href="../../../../../../../observation/pan/aspect/forme/Soucoupe.html">soucoupes</a>.</p>
        <p>Opposés étaient ceux qui affirmaient que l'histoire d'<a
            href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a> avait déclenché une hystérie de masse. Ils pensaient
          que la publicité accordée aux premières observations avait amené des millions de gens à scruter le ciel pour
          "voir une <a href="../../../../../../../observation/pan/aspect/forme/Soucoupe.html">soucoupe</a>," et qu'ils
          s'illusionnaient eux-mêmes avec toutes sortes de choses ? un papier pris dans le vent, des <a
              href="../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/oiseau/Oiseaux.html">oiseaux</a>, des reflets d'<a
              href="../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/aeronef/avion/index.html">avions</a>. Ce groupe raisonnaient
          que les observations allaient diminuer avec le cours normal des événements.</p>
        <p>Les <a href="../../../../../../../analyse/Scepticisme.html">sceptiques</a> étaient confortés par la
          découverte que le récit d'<a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a> avait des manques. Ses
          estimations de la taille des objets et de leur distance de son <a
              href="../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/aeronef/avion/index.html">avion</a> ne concordaient pas. Il les
          rapporta être entre 20 et 25 miles de distance et de 45 à 50 pieds de long. Lorsque son observation fut
          analysée, on découvrit que des objets de cette taille ne pouvaient être discernés à l'?il nu depuis cette
          distance. Si son estimation de taille était correcte, les objets n'étaient éloignés que de 6 ou 7 miles ? et
          volaient à 400 miles/h environ, des valeurs tout à fait dans l'intervalle d'un <a
              href="../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/aeronef/index.html">appareil</a> conventionnel.</p>
        <p>The early skepticism was strengthened when none of the objects indicated any menace, landed, or crashed where
          examination could establish that they were indeed something new under the sun.</p>
        <p>La première dispute sur la prise en charge des histoires d'Objets Volants Non Identifiés fut résolue par les
          ovnis eux-mêmes. Ils persistaient, mois après mois, avec un noyau dur d'incidents qui venaient d'observateurs
          chevronnés et défiaient l'analyse. L'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a> décida de centraliser
          l'investigation et élabora un corps de données qui pouvait être analysé.</p>
        <p>Ils mirent en place le <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/sign/index.html">Projet Sign</a> et went after
          the saucers in earnest. Par la suite le nom de code fut changé pour "<a
              href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge/index.html">Grudge</a>." Nous le changeâmes plus tard en "<a
              href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook/index.html">Blue Book</a>" lorsque quelqu'un au <a
              href="/org/us/state/wa/pentagone/index.html">Pentagone</a> suggéra que "<a
              href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge/index.html">Grudge</a>" donnait l'impression que le projet
          abordait le travail begrudgingly. Le code "<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook/index.html">Blue
            Book</a>" fut prit des livres bleu de college traditionnels qui avaient toutes les réponses aux questions
          des examens. Cela ne se révéla pas un choix particulièrement judicieux.</p>
        <p>Les observations continuaient d'arriver à une moyenne de 1 tous les 3 jours. La controverse à leur sujet
          augmenta et la confusion se multiplia. Des articles commençaient à crop up dans les magazines nationaux, et
          les commentateurs radio periodically broadcast "the inside story of the saucers," with each account
          contradicting the other. They were secret U.S. weapons, new Russian craft, emissaries from an-other planet
          scouting the earth.</p>
        <p>En <a href="/time/1949.html">1949</a>, l'Air Force soumit les 375 observations alors en main à une
          ré-évaluation intensive, et émis un rapport épais sur ses conclusions. Le Dr. <a
              href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen/index.html">J. Allen Hynek</a>, alors directeur du département d'<a
              href="../../../../../../../astronomie/index.html">astronomie</a> à l'Université de l'Etat d'Ohio, screened
          the reports for things of astronomical nature, such as stars, planets, meteors. The Air Force Air Weather
          Service checked the reports for balloons. The <a href="/org/us/RAND.html">Rand Corporation</a> (a high-level
          research group that has nothing to do with the business-machine firm), the Air Force Geophysical Laboratory,
          the U.S. Weather Bureau, and Dr. F. M. Fitts, a psychologist from the Air Force Aero-medical Laboratory, made
          some general appraisals from their specialized viewpoints.</p>
        <p>La <a href="/org/us/RAND.html">Rand Corporation</a> commenta : <q>Nous n'avons rien trouvé qui contredirait
          sérieusement des explications rationnelles simples des phénomènes divers en termes de <a
              href="../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/ballon/index.html">ballons</a>, appareils conventionnels,
          planètes, <a href="../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/rentree/meteore/index.html">météores</a>, morceaux de
          papier, illusions d'optique, practical jokers, psychopathological reporters and the like.</q></p>
        <p>Dr. <a href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen/index.html">Hynek</a>: <q>En considèrant les éléments des observateurs
          et des enquêteurs comme corrects, il est conclut it que 32 % peuvent être expliqués astronomiquement, 35 %
          peuvent être attribués à des oiseaux, fusées, avions, etc. et que 33 % ont manqué d'éléments ou pour
          lesquelles une explication adaptée n'était pas apparente.</q></p>
        <p>Le Service de la Météo Aérienne de l'USAF se cantonna à son domaine, commenta que <q>12 % étaient apparemment
          des <a href="../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/ballon/index.html">ballons</a>.</q></p>
        <p>Sur les 375 rapports, 13 % n'avaient pas des solutions facilement explicables. Le Dr. Fitts avanca une
          théorie : <q>Il y a suffisamment d'explications psychologiques aux signalements d'Objets Volants Non
            Identifiés pour fournir des explications plausibles aux rapports qui ne sont pas explicables autrement. Ces
            erreurs dans l'identification de stimuli réels résultent principalement de l'incapacité à estimé les
            vitesse, distance et taille.</q></p>
        <p>Supporting these analyses were bulky articles of carefully reasoned and qualified consideration of the data.
          La presse, toujours avide d'une réponse qui tiendrais en 2 lignes d'un titre qui compterait 12 lettre par
          ligne, condensa l'ensemble du rapport en un "write-off" par l'Air Force. Les ovnis ignoraient la <a
              href="/org/us/RAND.html">Rand Corp</a>., le Dr. <a href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen/index.html">Hynek</a>,
          la presse, <i>et al, </i>et continuaient à voler. En <a href="/time/1950.html">1950</a> exactement le même
          nombre atterrirent dans les dossiers du projet ? 152 ? qu'il n'y en avait eu en <a
              href="/time/1949.html">1949</a>.</p>
        <p>Alors en <a href="/time/1951.html">1951</a>, ils commencèrent à dwindle.</p>
        <p>Dans le même temps j'avais terminé mon travail au college de Ames and had rolled up my new sheepskin juste à
          temps pour être rappelé en service à l'Air Force à cause de la Corée. Ils me basèrent à Dayton, où durant les
          7 premiers mois je travaillais sur des appareils conventionnels que vous pouvez voir, sentir et mesurer.</p>
        <p>La fonction principale du <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">Centre de Renseignement Technique de
          l'Air</a> n'est pas, comme certaines personnes le pensent, d'analyser le mystère des ovnis. Il est chargé de
          la prévention de la surprise technologique par un pays étranger. Il étudie l'ensemble des données qu'il peut
          obtenir sur un appareil ennemi, des missiles guidés, et les avances technologiques sur tout ce qui vole. Il
          obtint le projet soucoupe parce qu'une chose sur laquelle tous les observateurs s'accordaient était - les
          choses volent.</p>
        <p>Cela amena un jour un enquêteur harassé de <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook/index.html">Blue
          Book</a> à se plaindre : <q>Pourquoi diable ces damnées choses ne nagent pas qu'on puisse les retourner à la
          <a href="/org/us/dod/navy/index.html">Marine</a> ?</q></p>
        <p>A l'été <a href="/time/1951.html">1951</a>, <a
            href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge/index.html">Grudge</a> was down to one man, les observations
          diminuaient, et c'était comme si le projet allait être classé par manque de travail. En juin, pour le 1er mois
          en 4 ans, pas une seule observation n'arriva. En août l'enquêteur solitaire fut transferré, et le proejt fut
          confié à un ami à moi, le lieutenant <a href="/people/c/CummingsJerry">Jerry Cummings</a>. J'avais
          l'habitude de débarquer et de le titillier sur l'état médiocre du boulot des soucoupes.</p>
        <p><q>Tu vas ne plus avoir de travail, garçon,</q> lui dis-je.</p>
        <p><q>Tu as raison,</q> me dit-il, <q>mais la mauvaise raison. I got a discharge coming up.</q></p>
        <p>A 15 h le 13 septembre <a href="/time/1951.html">1951</a>, le projet revint soudain à la vie. Le
          téléscripteur de l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> commença à chattering out un message
          long d'un yard du nord du New Jersey. When it signed off, on aurait dit que c'était comme si le Garden State
          avait été envahi par quelque chose sorti de H. G. Wells.</p>
        <p>Cela avait commencé 2 jours auparavant, le 10 septembre à 11 h 00, lorsqu'un opérateur stagiaire faisait une
          démonstration à un groupe de visiting brass à une école radar du New Jersey. Il avait été choisi parce qu'il
          était le meilleur homme de sa classe. Il fit la démonstration de l'dispositif en opération manuelle pendant un
          moment, repérant le traffic aérien local. Alors il annonça qu'il allait faire la démonstration du repérage
          automatique, dans lequel l'dispositif est place sur une cible et la suit sans aide de l'opérateur. Le
          dispositif pouvait suivre des objets volant à des vitesses de jet.</p>
        <p>L'opérateur repéra un objet à environ 12000 yards au sud-est de la station, volant bas vers le nord. Il
          essaya d'enclencher le mode automatique. Il n'y parvint pas, essaya à nouveau, et échoua à nouveau. Il se
          retourna vers son auditoire de VIP embarrassé.</p>
        <p><q>Il va trop vite pour le dispositif,</q> dit-il. <q>Cela veut dire qu'il va plus vite qu'un jet !</q></p>
        <p>Un lot de sourcils très importants se soulevèrent. Qu'est-ce qui vole plus vite qu'un jet ? </p>
        <p>The object was in range for three minutes and the operator kept trying, without success, to get an automatic
          track. It finally went off the scope, leaving a red-faced operator talking to himself.</p>
        <p>Twenty-five minutes later, the pilot of a jet trainer, carrying an Air Force major as passenger and flying
          20000 pieds au-dessus de Point Pleasant (New Jersey), spotted a dull silver disclike object far below him. He
          described it as 30 à 50 pieds de diamètre and as descending toward Sandy Hook from an altitude of a mile or
          so. He banked over and started down after it. As he shot down, he reported, the object stopped its descent,
          hovered, then sped south, made a 120-degree turn and vanished out to sea</p>
        <p>The Jersey puzzle then switched back to the radar group. A 15 h 15 they got an excited call from headquarters
          to pick up a target high and to the north - which was where the first <q>faster-than-a-jet</q> object had
          vanished - and to pick it up in a hurry. They got a fix on it and reported that it was traveling slowly at
          93000 feet. They also could see it visually as a silver speck.</p>
        <p>What flies 18 miles above the earth?</p>
        <p>The next morning <i>two </i>radar sets picked up another target that couldn't be tracked automatically. It
          would climb, level off, climb again, go into a dive. When it climbed, it went almost straight up.</p>
        <p>The two-day sensation ended that afternoon when an unidentified hovering object was picked up for several
          minutes.</p>
        <p>A copy of the long New Jersey report went to Washington, and shortly later Dayton got instructions to go up,
          investigate and report to the Pentagon. In a matter of hours, Lt. <a
              href="/people/c/CummingsJerry">Cummings</a>
          and an <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">ATIC</a> lieutenant colonel were flying out to see what
          was up.</p>
        <p>Two days later they were back with reams of raw data. Before Cummings could start sorting out the jigsaw, he
          got his discharge.</p>
        <p>Up to this point, I had done the work I was assigned to and paid little attention to flying saucers. But the
          New Jersey outbreak fascinated me. Whatever had happened there was plainly a lot more than the occasional
          "saucer" story I'd read in the papers, where a Dakota farmer saw something zip over his barn, or a housewife
          saw six discs wobbling through the sky while she hung up her wash. My curiosity overcame the ancient rule that
          men in uniform have followed since Hannibal's day. I volunteered.</p>
        <p>I told myself that I'd solve the Jersey puzzle and then go back to my regular work. It turned out that I did
          neither. As if to jeer at my brash confidence, the UFO's suddenly started flying all over the country. In a
          matter of days I found myself down in Texas tangled up in one of the classics of the saucer saga - the Lubbock
          lights.</p>
        <figure class="left side">

            </tr></table><p>I went into the UFO investigation with curiosity and no preconceptions. I soon found that
            the job had enormous difficulties. The basic one was that there were no precedents, rules or manuals for
            chasing flying saucers. The evidence you work with-with few exceptions-is the recollection of observers,
            usually excited, puzzled or frightened humans trying to describe events completely foreign to their
            experience. And what they had seen usually appeared unexpectedly and vanished in a matter of seconds. After
            a few months I got so I could predict the start of their stories.</p>
            <p>"Now listen," they would say, in a mixture of apology and belligerence, "I never believed in these things
              before. I laughed at them like everybody else. You can check me with any of my friends. I'm not cracked
              and I wasn't drunk. I don't know what it was, <i>but I tell you, l SAW it. </i></p>
            <p>What did they see? Trying to evaluate it led you into a dozen complex technical fields - psychology,
              meteorology, physiology, astronomy, aerodynamics, electronics, physics, logic, chemistry, plain and fancy
              detective work.</p>
            <p>Most of the people we talked to tried earnestly to tell us exactly what they had seen. But human beings
              are imperfect observers. This is not something unique to saucer sighters. Police and newspapermen have
              struggled with it for years. Ten eyewitnesses to an auto wreck will tell ten different stories, and each
              will be positive that his is the true account. Autos travel only 60 or 70 miles an hour. The incidents we
              investigated involved things supposedly moving as fast as 25,000 miles an hour. And they were seen from
              great distances, usually under the worst possible conditions for accurate reporting, often at night and
              for only a few seconds.</p>
            <p>The data in the Lubbock case was much better than in 99 percent of the incidents that came into Blue
              Book. It involved multiple sightings by a group of Ph.D.'s, backstopped by a series of independent
              sightings. In addition, there were pictures-four of them.</p>
            <p>Les observations avaient duré pendant des semaines avant que nous en entendions parler. Elles avaient
              commencé le soir du <time>25</time> <span class="mois">août</span>, lorsque 4 professeurs de la Faculté
              Technologique du Texas étaient assis dans le jardin de l'une de leurs maisons à chercher des yeux des
              météores. A <time>21:20</time>, un vol de lumières vertes-bleuâtres bizarres, en formation grossièrement
              de croissant, raced across the sky. The sight caught them by surprise. Being men of science, they deplored
              the fact that their first startled observation had been hasty and incomplete. They vowed to do better if
              the lights reappeared. That night they made a second sighting. In the next few weeks, they made twelve
              more.</p>
            <p>When I got to Lubbock, they had compiled what data they could. They had measured the angular velocity and
              found it to be 30 degrees per second. In an effort to compute the speed, they had set up an ingenious
              two-way radio system and had tried to get sightings from two spots and make a rough triangulation. This
              had failed, but the failure provided a clue.</p>
            <p>The sightings had been reported in the local paper. In the nights following the first appearance of the
              flying lights, they were seen by hundreds of nonprofessorial witnesses. Arguments were raging all over
              Lubbock as to whether the objects were new secret missiles, space ships-or ducks.</p>
            <p>On the night of August 31, an 18-year-old amateur photographer shot some pictures. He had the prints and
              the negatives. The pictures were later reproduced all over the world, and are included in almost every
              book about the saucers.</p>
            <p><q>I was lying in bed when I saw a flight of the lights go over,</q> he said. <q>I grabbed my loaded
              Kodak 35 and went out in the back yard. In a little while a second flight came over and I made two shots.
              Then a third flight passed over and I took three more shots.</q> The camera was set at f 3.5 and the
              shutter at 1/10 of a second.</p>
            <p>His prints were clear, and showed the lights in a sharply defined V. One of the negatives had been
              misplaced, but we had four for analysis. Each showed 18 lights in the V formation, with a larger one off
              to the right. This was promptly labeled <q>the mother ship</q> by the science-fiction boys-an analysis
              that struck me as 99 % fiction and about one per cent science.</p>
            <p>Close examination showed a peculiarity in the pictures that has been ignored in almost every account of
              them that I have read. There is a marked dissimilarity in the lights in the four pictures. In one, they
              are diagonal dashes; in the next, roughly circular; in the third, they are tadpole-shaped, with their
              tails all pointed to the left; in the fourth, they are like arrowheads. In each picture, the "mother ship"
              changes shape to match her brood. </p>
            <p>I have read in dozens of accounts that "the Air Force has declared these pictures to be authentic." The
              Air Force said nothing of the sort. The pictures were submitted to intense scrutiny at the photo
              laboratory at Wright Field. There was little that could be evaluated. There were no points of reference in
              the pictures-only the lights. The photos had not been retouched. The Air Force said only that <q>The
                photos were never proved to be a hoax.</q></p>
            <p>The endless retellings of the Lubbock story recount the multiple sightings, the impeccable reputation of
              the observers, the supporting evidence of the "authentic" pictures-and stop there. The full story contains
              some intriguing facts. It is told here for the first time.</p>
            <p>D'abord, quoi que montrent les clichés, il ne s'agit pas des lumières vues par les professeurs. Ils ont
              regardé les images et l'on dit. Leurs 2 premières observations étaient grossièrement en croissant, et le
              reste n'avait pas de motif géométrique - en forme de V ou autre. Aucune des observations indépendantes
              n'était en forme de V, non plus. Les images, cependant, sont aussi précises en formation qu'une double
              rangée de Radio City Rockettes.</p>
            <p>Second, the pictures were taken on a clear night, with plenty of stars. No stars show in the pictures.
              This means that the lights were much brighter than the stars-and in Texas, the stars at night are big and
              bright. Neither the professors nor the other observers described <i>their </i>lights as big and bright.
              Theirs were dull and glowing.</p>
            <p>Third, with much of the town scanning the sky, no one else in Lubbock reported the lights on August 30,
              when the photographer saw his three bright, spectacularly geometric flights.</p>
            <p>Fourth, we reconstructed the scene later at Dayton, attempted to duplicate the pictures, and failed. The
              photographer had showed me the site in his back yard. Because of trees and other obstructions, it afforded
              a span of 120 degrees of clear sky. I questioned him about the speed at which the lights crossed the sky.
              He estimated it at 30 degrees a second-a figure that agreed with the earlier estimates by the professors.
              To double-check, I had him move his hand across the sky and clocked him. It was close to 30 degrees a
              second. This gave him four seconds in which to shoot each flight-two pictures one time, three the
              next.</p>
            <p>The Kodak 35 has a hand wind to feed fresh film into place. At Dayton we simulated 120 degrees of open
              sky with lights traveling 30 degrees a second, took a Kodak 35, and tried to shoot and wind until we had
              three shots. We couldn't do it. We tried over and over, with different people. The best anyone could
              squeeze in was two badly hurried shots. And with the shutter at 1/10 of a second the two shots were badly
              blurred.</p>
            <p> In poking around Lubbock, I talked to many people who had seen the lights and were sure that they were
              birds. One old gentleman had seen the lights several nights. His description matched that of the
              professors. </p>
            <p><q>Shucks, officer,</q> he drawled. <q>Them things is plovers.</q></p>
            <p>I went off to read up on plovers. They're water birds about the size of quail with light breasts that
              could reflect light. A local game warden told me there were plovers in the vicinity.</p>
            <p>A few blocks from the area where most of the sightings had been made was a boulevard lighted by mercury
              vapor lights that gave off an intense bluish-white glare. Then I recalled an odd bit of information. When
              the professors had tried to set up a second observation post elsewhere, they saw nothing, while the
              sightings continued at the original spot - near the lighted boulevard.</p>
            <p>Four times in the following year, at Fargo, N. D., Greenville, S. C., Randolph Air Force Base, and
              Bakersfield, Calif., we got cases that duplicated the Lubbock affair. Each time they proved to be birds
              reflecting ground lights.</p>
            <p>The project files carry the Lubbock lights as "unknown." The pictures were never <i>proved </i>to be a
              hoax. Maybe, under intense excitement, one man in a thousand can shoot three unblurred shots with a
              hand-held Kodak 35 in four seconds. I'll believe it when I see it done.</p>
            <p>But so far as what the professors saw, I think that a 10-gauge shotgun would have brought down the
              Lubbock saucers in a shower of feathers.</p>
            <p>While I was in Lubbock, a temporary investigator, Lt. Henry Metscher, had made some sense out of the
              Jersey mystery that had lured me into saucer chasing. Among the data that Cummings had brought back on the
              <q>faster-than-a-jet</q> radar objects were some plots on locations and times. It turned out that the
              object that had outsped the automatic tracking and startled the VIPs actually plotted out at an
              unspectacular 400 mph. On questioning, the operator conceded that he had got excited because of the
              visiting brass. The object undoubtedly was a conventional plane.</p>
            <p>The "disc" spotted over Sandy Hook by the jet? Metscher learned that a large balloon painted silver for
              radar tracking had been launched near Sandy Hook just before the pilot and the AF major saw their UFO.
              What about its maneuvering? Hang onto that question for a bit.</p>
            <p>The excited call the next morning from headquarters? Another balloon carrying a radar target. The HQ
              officers had a bet on about its altitude, wanted a fast report, didn't bother to tell the radar crew the
              reason for the urgency. By this time the radar boys had the saucer fever and were ready to see anything.
              The second supersonic object proved to be a weather blip. The last saucer that hung ominously over New
              Jersey was definitely tabbed as another balloon.</p>
            <p>I congratulated Metscher and settled down to the business of knocking off saucers like an ace skeet
              shooter. If the saucers can laugh (we had several that whistled), they probably zipped through the
              stratosphere chuckling to themselves.</p>
            <p>One of the first things I did was to go back over the files of the project from its inception. There were
              some odd facts and some baffling sightings. One thing I learned was that Arnold wasn't the Columbus of the
              flying saucer at all. The project had thirteen listings prior to June 24,1947 - the supposed dawn of the
              Era. They all had come into the project after Arnold told his story, with the usual explanation that the
              observers had been reluctant to tell their tales until had broken the ice.</p>

                  alors que la première analyse du cas a conclut qu'il avait pris en chasse la <a
                      href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus/index.html">planète Vénus</a>.</p>
                <p>La réaction du public à ce récit fut évidemment : <q>Qui croient-ils tromper ?</q> Si 3 aviateurs se
                  sont accordés sur le fait que la chose était <q>métallique</q> et <q>énorme</q>, comment cela
                  aurait-il pu être la <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus/index.html">planète Vénus</a> ?
                  Plus tard dans le cadre du projet, nous eurent de nombreux cas de pilotes confondant <a
                      href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus/index.html">Vénus</a> (et d'autres planètes) avec
                  quelque chose volant dans le ciel. Aucun d'entre eux ne décrit jamais quelque chose d'<q>énorme</q>.
                </p>
                <p>En examinant les rapports d'origine sur la tragédie, j'ai appris les choses suivantes :</p>
                <ol>
                  <li> Les 2 hommes dans la tour de Godman furent rejoints par 5 officiers pendant que la chasse était
                    en cours. Aucun des 7 hommes ne s'est accordé sur la description de la chose dans le ciel. Un l'a
                    qualifé de <q>cornet de glace avec le sommet rouge</q>, une description qui fut reprise par le
                    communiqué de l'Air Force comme une description commune de l'ensemble des observateurs. En fait, les
                    autres descriptions varièrent beaucoup : <q>rond et blanc</q>, <q>énorme et argenté ou
                      métallique</q>, <q>petit objet blanc</q>, <q>1/4 de la taille de la pleine <a

                      taille de la pleine </q><q><a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/lune/index.html">Lune</a></q>.
                  </li>
                  <li> Un aviateur ne vit jamais rien. Il envoya un message radio : <q>Bon sang qu'est-ce que l'on
                    cherche ?</q> Lorsque l'autre atterrit, il le décrivit comme <q>ressemblant à une réflexion de la
                    canopée.</q></li>
                  <li> Il n'y eut pratiquement aucun accord entre les 7 hommes écoutant au haut-parleur dans la tour sur
                    ce que <a href="../../../../../../../MantellThomas.html">Mantell</a> a effectivement dit. Un seul
                    déclara que <a href="../../../../../../../MantellThomas.html">Mantell</a> qualifia l'ovni de <q>métallique
                      et de taille énorme</q>.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Le projet apprit plus tard qu'il y avait un énorme ballon <em><a
                    href="/org/us/dod/navy/projet/skyhook/index.html">Skyhook</a></em> dans les environs. Il fut repéré
                  plus tard au Sud-Ouest de Louisville par deux observateurs avec des télescopes, et fut identifié comme
                  un balloon. Une telle identification aurait dû disqualifier la <a

                  l'Air Force.</p>
                <p>Pourquoi un pilote expérimenté tel que <a href="../../../../../../../MantellThomas.html">Mantell</a>
                  chasserait un ballon ? Les <em>Skyhook</em>s étaient nouveaux à cette époque et il pouvait donc ne pas
                  en avoir entendu parler. Pour lui, un ballon c'était un des petits modèles météo fréquemment lancés
                  depuis les terrains d'aviation.</p>
                <p>Qu'arriva-t-il à son avion ? Pourquoi l'épave fut-elle éparpillée sur une surface si grande si il
                  n'avait pas été explosé par une soucoupe hostile ?</p>
                <p>L'épave montra que l'avion avait trimmed pour monter. <a
                    href="../../../../../../../MantellThomas.html">Mantell</a> n'avait pas d'oxygène à bord, et il se
                  trouvait à près de 20000 pieds - presque 4 miles d'altitude lorsque ses aviateurs abandonnèrent
                  l'ascension. Il est probable qu'il perdit connaissance par manque d'oxygène. A une altitude
                  supérieure, la puissance de l'avion aurait lâché et le F-51 se serait perdu avec un homme inconscient
                  aux commandes. Le couple des propulseur l'amènerait par un lent virage à gauche dans une chute
                  limitée, puis une descente de plus en plus plus abrupte sous l'effet de la puissance moteur. A un
                  moment de cette chute criarde, l'avion atteignit un vitesse trop grande et commenca à se briser en vol&#8230;

                  sait qu'à mesure que la vitesse d'un avion augmente son ascension augmente, et le nez de l'avion
                  aurait monté jusqu'à ce que la vitesse décroisse à nouveau et le nez aurait plongé une nouvelle fois
                  pour reprendre de la vitesse et remonter, créant ainsi une oscillation tout le long - pas une "chute
                  criarde". L'avion pourrait tourner ou spiraler au lieu d'osciller, mais une rotation est une man?uvre
                  statique, et les avions ne partent pas s'ils sont statiques. L'oscillation est ce qui lui serait plus
                  probablement arrivé si l'avion avait tenté de monter... et... comme l'indique Ruppelt "L'épave a

                <p><strong>Classique n° 2</strong> - the <q>dogfight between the plane and the saucer</q>. It is listed
                  as the lone case of "combat" between a plane and a saucer. Actually, there were three other such
                  cases.</p>
                <p>The pilot was George F. Gorman, a 25-year-old second lieutenant in the North Dakota Air National
                  Guard. On October 1, 1948, starting at 9 p.m., he chased an apparently disembodied light for 27
                  minutes in his fast F-51. He described the UFO as "a small hall of clear white light, between six and
                  eight inches in diameter." For awhile it winked on and off, then it appeared to put on power and
                  glowed steadily. Gorman pushed his F-51 to the limit and was unable to catch it. He reported that it
                  made one turn that he couldn't follow and twice came at him in what appeared to be ramming attacks.
                  Both times he dived his plane out of the collision course. The "dogfight" ranged from low level up
                  17,000 feet, and the light finally pulled straight up and disappeared.</p>
                <p><q>I had the distinct impression that its maneuvers were controlled by thought or reason</q>, Gorman
                  said.</p>
                <p>Four other observers at Fargo <i>partially </i>corroborated his story. An oculist, Dr. A. D. Cannon
                  was near the field in his plane with a passenger, Einar Neilson. They saw a light "moving fast," but
                  did not witness all the maneuvers that Gorman reported. Two CAA employees, on the ground, saw a light
                  move over the field once.</p>
                <p>Here are the other "dogfight" cases:</p>
                <p>On June 21, 1952, at 10:58 pm., a Ground Observer Spotter reported that a slow-moving craft was
                  nearing one of our atomic energy installations. An F-47 patrol in the area was vectored in visually,
                  spotted a light and closed on it. They "fought" from 10,000 to 27,000 feet and several times the
                  object made what seemed to be ramming attacks. The light was described as white, 6 to 8 inches in
                  diameter, blinking until it put on power. The pilot could see no silhouette of anything attached to
                  it. The similarity of the Fargo case was striking.</p>
                <p>On the night of Dec. 10, 1952, near another atomic installation, the pilot and radar observer of a
                  patrolling F-94 spotted a light while flying at 26,000 feet. They checked and were told that no planes
                  were known to be in the area. They closed on the object and saw a large, round white "thing" with a
                  dim, reddish light coming from two "windows." They lost visual contact, but got a radar lock-on. They
                  reported that when they attempted to close on it again, it would reverse direction and drop away.
                  Several times the plane altered course itself because collision seemed imminent. There was a solid
                  undercast of clouds, which would eliminate the possibility of refraction of ground lights.</p>
                <p>The other "dogfight" occurred September 24, 1952, between a Navy pilot of a TBM and a light over
                  Cuba. It had a sequel that revealed some fascinating information about the illusions the supposedly
                  objective human eye can contrive.</p>
                <p>The pilot had just finished making some practice passes for night fighters when he spotted an orange
                  light to the east of his plane. He checked on aircraft in the area, learned that the object was
                  unidentified, and started after it. Here is his report, written immediately after he landed:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><q>"As it (the light) approached the city from the east it started a left turn. I started to
                    intercept. During the first part of the chase the closest I got to the light was 8 to 10 miles. At
                    this time it appeared to be as large as an SNB and had a greenish tail that looked to be five to six
                    times as long as the light's diameter. This tail was seen several times in the next 10 minutes in
                    periods of from 5 to 30 seconds each. As I reached 10,000 feet it appeared to be 15,000 feet and in
                    a left turn. It took 40 degrees of bank to keep the nose of my plane on the light. At this time I
                    estimated the light to be in a 10 to 15 mile orbit.</q></p>
                  <p><q>"At 12,000 feet I stopped climbing, but the light was still climbing faster than I was. I then
                    reversed my turn from left to right and the light also reversed. As I was not gaining distance, I
                    held a steady course south trying to estimate a perpendicular between the light and myself. The
                    light was moving north, so I turned north. As I turned, the light appeared to move west, then south
                    over the base. I again tried to intercept but the light appeared to climb rapidly at a 60 degree
                    angle. It climbed to 35,000 feet, then started a rapid descent.</q></p>
                  <p><q>'Prior to this, while the light was still at approximately 15,000 feet, I deliberately placed it
                    between the moon and myself three times to try to identify a solid body. I, and my two crew men, all
                    had a good view of the light as it passed the moon. We could see no solid body. We considered the
                    fact that it might be an aerologist's balloon, but we did not see a silhouette. Also, we would have
                    rapidly caught up with and passed a balloon.</q></p>
                  <p><q>"During its descent, the light appeared to slow down at about 10,000 feet, at which time I made
                    three runs on it. Two were on a 90degree collision course, and the light traveled at tremendous
                    speed across my bow. On the third run I was so close that the light blanked out the airfield below
                    me. Suddenly it started a dive and I followed, losing it at 1,500 feet."</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>When he landed, anyone who would have tried to tell him he was chasing a lighted weather balloon
                  would have had a rough time. Twenty-four hours later, he was <i>convinced </i>that he had chased a
                  balloon.</p>
                <p>The following night, a lighted balloon was sent up and the pilot was ordered up to compare his
                  experiences. He duplicated his "dogfight" - illusions and all. The Navy furnished us with a long
                  analysis of the affair, explaining how the pilot had been fooled. It is recommended or anyone who
                  believes that an experienced pilot cannot be fooled by what he sees.</p>

                    </tr></table><p>In each of our four cases of "dog-fights", including Gorman's, a balloon was known
                    to be in the vicinity.</p>
                    <p>In the case involving the ground observer and the F-47 near the atomic installation, we plotted
                      the winds and calculated that a balloon was right at the spot where the pilot encountered the
                      light.</p>
                    <p>In the other instance, with the "<q>white object with two windows</q>," we found that a skyhook
                      balloon had been plotted at the exact site of the "<q>battle</q>."</p>
                    <p>Why can't experienced pilots recognize a baIloon when they see one? If they are flying at night,
                      odd things can happen to their vision. There is the problem of vertigo, as well as disorientation
                      brought on by flying without points of reference. Night fighters have told dozens of stories of
                      being fooled by lights.</p>
                    <p>On the night of November 24. 1951. there was another incident, with multiple sightings. It
                      started when a CAA tower in southern Michigan told the Air Force Flight Service that an airline
                      crew had seen a huge object with bluish-white flames going southwest at an extremely high speed.
                      At about the same time, other reports flooded in from Air Force personnel at Selfridge AFB, north
                      of Detroit, from a soldier on leave at Battle Creek, from another CAA tower, from some sheriff's
                      deputies. All reported the same sort of object going the same direction. Most of them described it
                      as rocket-shaped. One, an experienced pilot, was certain it was a V-2 type missile. All these
                      observers-at scattered points-reported the thing "about four miles east." It turned out to be a
                      very large meteor passing over the New England states; we verified it with experienced meteor
                      observers and the time checked to the dot. I talked to a number of the witnesses later and they
                      remained firm in their belief that they had seen a Something.</p>
                    <p>It is popular folklore among the more fanatical saucer fans that the Air Force has either bungled
                      or deliberately sabotaged the saucer investigation. Our sterner critics imply that a saucer could
                      land within ten feet of a Project Blue Book man, and he would turn his back on it and walk away.
                      Frank Scully says, <q>"It's high time that the Air Force stop fumbling with the saucer question
                        and turn the investigation over to a competent civilian group."</q></p>
                    <p>It is utter nonsense, of course, to charge that Blue Book doesn't <b><i>want </i></b>to verify
                      the existence of the saucers. If they come from outer space, the first man to lock down proof of
                      it would go down in history with a bigger name than Christopher Columbus. He'd be remembered when
                      such minor figures as U.S. Presidents were long forgotten.</p>
                    <p>Every time a good sighting came into Blue Book, you could feel a suppressed excitement run
                      through the staff, an unspoken <q>Maybe this is <i>it</i>.</q></p>
                    <p>Here is what Blue Book did in its efforts to pin down the facts about the flying saucers.
                      Virtually all the evidence we had to work with was the reports of witnesses. Shortly after I took
                      over the project, we set about preparing a model questionnaire that would get the maximum amount
                      of data from the witnesses. If there was a pattern to the saucer stories, we wanted to find
                      it.</p>
                    <p>The project had tried a variety of questionnaires in the past. We gathered all these together
                      along with a cross section of accounts by witnesses. We took this material to the psychology
                      department of a Midwest university that is noted for the excellence of its statistical
                      questionnaires. We got together a panel of engineers, physicists, mathematicians, astronomers and
                      psychologists to list the questions they would like to have answered. The project also listed the
                      things it wanted to know. Then the psychologists determined whether it was feasible to expect an
                      eyewitness to answer each question and if so, how it should be worded.</p>
                    <p>When we got through with all this, we used the result as a test model, and sent it out to several
                      hundred saucersighters. When the reports were returned, we revised the questionnaires again, from
                      the way it had worked out. The result is the standard questionnaire that Blue Book is using
                      today.</p>
                    <p>The questionnaire ran eight pages and had 68 questions. It was booby-trapped in a couple of
                      places to give us a crosscheck on the reliability of the reporter as a witness. We got quite a few
                      questionnaires answered in such a way that it was obvious that the signer was drawing on his
                      imagination.</p>
                    <p>From this standard questionnaire, the project worked up two more. One dealt with radar sightings
                      of UFO's, the other with sightings made from a plane.</p>

                        </tr></table><p>At the instigation of Blue Book, the Air Force sent out orders to every one of
                        its installations in the world, instructing them on the reporting of "saucers." Immediate
                        reports were to be made by wire to ATIC, listing the basic data such as time, date, location,
                        description of the object, names of observers, etc. These initial reports were to be followed up
                        with expanded written reports. Blue Book was also given authority for direct communication with
                        any installation in the U.S., thus cutting a lot of red tape and speeding up the
                        investigations.</p>
                        <p>This AF regulation, unfortunately, was issued on the same day that <i>Life</i>magazine came
                          out with a flying saucer story that reversed its previous attitude and considered the question
                          soberly A lot of people added two and two and got six. The story went around that <i>Life</i>
                          was "softening up the public for the truth" while the new Air Force regulation was "alerting
                          the military." Actually, it was coincidence.</p>
                        <p>We obtained the cooperation of astronomers all over the country. Scores of them were queried
                          on whether, in their constant watching the skies through giant telescopes, they had ever seen
                          anything that resembled a space ship. The answer was no. There are also a number of stations
                          across the U.S., where automatic cameras photograph the sky at intervals every night the year
                          around to help track meteors. We asked these people if their cameras had ever caught anything
                          that resembled a flying saucer. The answer was no. Both the astronomers and the
                          sky-photographers were asked to notify the project if they ever turned up anything unusual.
                          They never did.</p>
                        <p>We sent out eighty special cameras to places where there had been a high number of sightings
                          in an effort to get pictures of our own. Each camera had two two lenses, one of which had a
                          diffraction grid to split light into its component parts and thus give a clue to the source of
                          the light - whether it was coming from a jet's tail, a balloon, or what? We had a lot of
                          trouble with the cameras, and got only 5 or 6 pictures, all of which were worthless. The
                          light-gathering power of the lenses was too low. The cameras have been re-equipped, and the
                          Air Force recently has redistributed them.</p>
                        <p>
                          We did not rely solely on our own resources in trying to unravel the UFO riddle. En Janvier <a

                          plusieurs scientifiques bien qualifiés pour du conseil, afin de nous aider à rassembler
                          certaines informations techniques, passer en revue les "inconnus" outstanding, to go over our
                          conclusions and to suggest future courses of action. The names of these people have never been
                          made public, and it is unlikely that they will be. The project learned early that publication
                          of anyone's name in connection with the saucer stories brought on a deluge of mail, telephone
                          calls and visits from cranks.</p>

                            that they offered insufficient solid information for evaluation. Several hundred' people, of
                            all different sorts, said they had seen something that they couldn't explain, under a wide
                            variety of circumstances. Where did you go from there? </p>
                            <p>The new questionnaire and the Air Force came at a fortunate time - just before the
                              enormous upsurge of sightings in <a href="//time/1/9/5/2/">1952</a>. By the end of the
                              year we had a much better collection of data-both in quantity and quality-and we decided
                              to summon a week-long conference of scientists to look it over and tell us what they
                              thought.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              They met early in 1953. Like our consultants, they cannot he named, and for the same
                              reasons. But the group consisted of some of the nation's top people in astrophysics,
                              operational research, intelligence, physics and psychology.</p>
                            <p>
                              First we briefed them thoroughly on the operation of the project, on our methods of
                              evaluation, on our conclusions and how we arrived at them. When we were through, they
                              examined closely the "best" of the UFO cases that the project had been unable to explain.
                              They viewed movies, looked at still photographs of "saucers" and heard reports from
                              specialists on radar and photo-interpretation.</p>
                            <p>
                              At the end of the week, they unanimously concluded that we had nothing that proved or even
                              indicated-that any type of vehicle was violating U.S. air space. There was discussion that
                              possibly some new natural phenomenon was causing some sightings, but this was rated
                              doubtful.</p>
                            <p>
                              On the possibility of emissaries from outer space, they made this statement:<br/> "We as a
                              group do not believe it is impossible for some other celestial body to be inhabited by
                              intelligent creatures. Nor is it impossible that these creatures could have reached such a
                              state of development that they could visit the earth. However, there is nothing in all the
                              so-called "flying saucer" reports that would even vaguely indicate that this is taking
                              place."</p>
                            <p>
                              This group viewed-and rejected as proof of the existence of saucers - the controversial
                              Tremonton movies.</p>
                            <p>
                              These pictures were taken at 11: 10 am., July 2, 1952, a few miles out of Tremonton, Utah,
                              by Warrant Officer Delbert Newbouse, a Navy photographer. He was driving in his car with
                              his wife when they saw some white objects circling in the blue sky. Newhouse took out his
                              camera, a 16 mm. Hell and Howell, and shot 40 feet of film. After he had the film
                              developed, he sent it to Blue Hook for analysis.</p>
                            <p>
                              I've sat through ninety-seven showings of the film. When I first saw it, I was impressed
                              by it-and puzzled. It shows several groups of white spots orbiting against the blue Utah
                              sky. There are no points of reference - only the moving spots and the sky. Near the end of
                              the film, one of the spots moved away from the others, and Newhouse panned the camera
                              along to follow it. When he turned back, he reported, the other spots had vanished.</p>
                            <p>
                              I sent the film on to the Pentagon, where it was received by Maj. Dewey Fournet, liaison
                              man for ATIC. Fournet, an excellent engineer, holds strongly to the theory that saucers
                              are real and come from outer space. He has since left the service and is in private
                              industry in Texas. He was tremendously excited with the movies. The movies were inspected
                              by a group of high officers at the Pentagon and were sent back to Dayton for analysis by
                              the Air Force photo laboratory. The lab examined them and reported that there was no
                              evidence of fraud, and that the objects were not spherical balloons. It was the consensus
                              of everyone who viewed the movies, incidentally, that they were not a hoax, that they
                              showed something that Newhouse and his wife had seen. We decided to send them on to the
                              Navy photo lab for further evaluation. They were taken there by Fournet, and I understand
                              that he gave them quite a buildup to the Navy technicians.</p>
                            <p>
                              The Navy subjected them to an intense analysis, involving thousands of man-hours of work,
                              and came up with an astounding report. The gist of their evaluation was that the movie was
                              authentic, and that the objects were not birds, balloons, planes, or anything earthly.
                              They examined the film, frame by frame, and analyzed the density of light on each object.
                              The reported that the objects appeared to be rotating in three groups, with each light
                              increasing in brilliance, then decreasing, disappearing and returning as if spinning about
                              an axis.</p>
                            <p>
                              On the panel of scientists that inspected them later were some men with excellent
                              reputations in the field of astronomical photo analysis. They viewed the movie a number of
                              times, and questioned the Navy analysts closely about their methods of evaluation. They
                              concluded that the Navy's method of measuring light density had been faulty, and that the
                              conclusions drawn from it were therefore unsound. They suggested that the whole study be
                              redone by new methods before the analysis be released.</p>
                            <p>Among the panel were a number of people who were convinced that the objects were sea
                              gulls soaring on a thermal current. This theory also had been advanced by other persons
                              familiar with gulls, who had seen the movie earlier. The ultimate decision of the experts
                              was that the movie did not warrant the great time and expense of a second analysis.</p>
                            <p>
                              At the time, I was doubtful of the gull explanation. But later, while in San Francisco on
                              an investigation, I saw a group of gulls soaring on a bright day over the bay. I was
                              astounded by the similarity between the sight before my eyes and the movie that I had seen
                              almost 100 times.</p>

                                One, in color, was taken at Great Falls. Mont., and showed two bright spots of light
                                speeding across the sky and passing behind a water tower. Two F-94s were in the area,
                                and the lights could have been reflections of the sun on these jets, but we were not
                                able to come to any definite conclusions.

                                  The other two movies were made at the White Sands Proving Grounds with Askania Cine
                                  theodolites - scientific tracking cameras for following guided missiles. The first was
                                  made on April 27, 1950. Shortly after a missile was fired and had soared into the
                                  stratosphere and fallen, someone spotted an object in the sky. The theodolites were
                                  hooked up by an intercom system, and several stations were instructed to try to get
                                  pictures. Unfortunately, only one camera had film. The pictures showed a smudgy, dark
                                  object, not very well defined. It was moving.</p>
                                <p>
                                  On May 29, 1950, after word of the first picture had got around and the stations were
                                  more alert, another object was sighted just before a missile was to be fired. A second
                                  station was called, and they reported that they also could see the object visually.
                                  Both stations swung into action and took photos. On developing the film, it turned out
                                  that each was tracking a different object-bright dots of light-and again we had no
                                  triangulation. Whatever the dots were, they were impossible to evaluate.</p>
                                <p>
                                  As a result of these incidents, the Air Force set up "Project Twinkle," two Askanias
                                  to be manned 24 hours a day. The project was operated for a year and didn't get a
                                  picture. It was first set up in an area where there had been many "saucer" sightings,
                                  but as soon as it was in operation, the sightings stopped and we began to get a flock
                                  of sightings from another area about 100 miles away. After months of inaction, the
                                  Askanias were moved to that spot, whereupon the sightings stopped there and resumed at
                                  the original site.</p>
                                <p>
                                  When I told this story to a dedicated saucer fan later, he had an immediate
                                  explanation, "Of course," he said, "the saucers were watching you guys."</p>
                                <p>
                                  We were always on the lookout for "hardware"- any sort of tangible object that
                                  conceivably might have dropped, been wrenched or stolen from a saucer. We got a
                                  variety of things that people said had fallen from the sky and we had them all
                                  analyzed. Among them were some slag from Virginia, an aluminum mop handle from
                                  Washington, D. C., and a tar-covered marble from Illinois.</p>
                                <p>
                                  Once a Texan reported that something had flashed across the sky and plunged through
                                  the ice into a pond on his farm. Investigators went out with hollow tubes and probed
                                  into the ooze under the jagged hole in the ice. They sent me one sample of the cross
                                  section from their pipes that puzzled them. It turned out to be cow manure.</p>
                                <p>
                                  We naturally tended to give more credence to sightings from a group of witnesses than
                                  from a single observer. One person can have spots before his eyes or hallucinations,
                                  but they won't be seen by a friend. This elementary rule-of-thumb resulted in one
                                  saucer-sighter risking his happy home in an effort to convince us.</p>
                                <p>
                                  We got a report, from a town that is going to remain nameless, that a citizen was
                                  sitting in his car when it was buzzed by a flying saucer. We wrote back to the
                                  intelligence officer to whom the report was made and asked him if there was any
                                  corroboration, pointing out that an unsupported story was - an unsupported story.</p>
                                <p>
                                  "Look, mister," the citizen told the officer. "I'm not the only one who saw it. There
                                  was a woman with me, and she saw it too. The trouble is, she wasn't my wife." This was
                                  the lone case that we received of a saucer flying down Lovers' Lane. </p>
                                <p>
                                  Because of a run of saucer incidents that turned out to be balloons, we attempted to
                                  set up a system that would give us information on every balloon in the country. The
                                  complex project yielded some results, but explained only a small percentage of the
                                  unknowns. </p>
                                <p>
                                  We got flying saucer reports from a weird assortment of origins - an oil drum
                                  exploding in a city dump, paper plates caught in an updraft, bugs silhouetted against
                                  the sun. Birds flying over a well-lighted area, like an athletic field at night,.
                                  caused a lot of reports of "glowing objects."</p>
                                <p>
                                  We were always being collared by volunteer experts. Each non-believer always had some
                                  revolutionary theory that would explain away every saucer in the country. Invariably
                                  it was something that fifty other people had thought about years before. For some
                                  reason or other, there were a lot of military generals who "knew what the saucers
                                  are." They would tell us that each sighting was just a reflection on a plane's canopy,
                                  and then go into long stories about their own experiences with canopy reflections.
                                  Whenever we were badly outranked we would listen carefully and try to nod at the
                                  proper time.</p>
                                <p>
                                  About the fifteenth time that an earnest member of the brass started unveiling the
                                  canopy reflection theory, I rebelled.</p>
                                <p>
                                  "Look, sir," I said, "what about the thousands of sightings on the ground by people
                                  who don't have canopies?"</p>
                                <p>
                                  "Hmmm," mused the two-star theorist, "I never thought of that."</p>

                                  The variety of the UFO's, the many different circumstances under which they were
                                  sighted-in bright sunlight. at dusk, at night, from planes, from the ground, by radar,
                                  by groups of people-should have ruled out any attempts to explain them away by a
                                  single theory. But people kept trying.</p>
                                <p>
                                  Professor Donald H. Menzel, in a book entitled Flying Saucers-History, Myth, Facts,
                                  attempted a single explanation for the stubborn 20 percent of unknowns that the
                                  project could not account for. His theory was that "this mysterious residue consists
                                  of the rags and tags of meteorological optics: mirages, reflections in mist,
                                  refraction and reflections of ice crystals."</p>
                                <p>
                                  His explanation failed to account for the many cases where there was a simultaneous
                                  radar fix on a UFO and a visual sighting. Mirages and reflections can and do fool the
                                  naked eye, but they don't show up simultaneously on a radar scope.</p>
                                <p>
                                  On the one batch of spectacular UFO's that looked as if they ought to have a
                                  meteorological explanation, the explanation collapsed. These were the flock of green
                                  fireballs that appeared in the Southwest.</p>
                                <p>
                                  They caused considerable concern because they showed up in sizable numbers around the
                                  Atomic Energy Commission's vital installations at Los Alamos and Sandia. They all
                                  showed the same characteristics and were seen by hundreds of people, including a lot
                                  of topflight government technicians and scientists.</p>
                                <p>
                                  They were large, often described as big as the full moon, only brighter, and
                                  kelly-green in color. They traveled at terrific speeds at apparently low altitudes.
                                  One airline pilot flying west of Albuquerque swerved his plane, nearly throwing the
                                  passengers out of their seats, in his fear that he was going to collide with one. They
                                  began appearing in December 1948, and had their biggest night on December 5, when
                                  crews of both civilians and military aircraft and ground observers sighted them. They
                                  appeared sporadically afterward, and then vanished. I talked to many people who had
                                  seen the fireballs, and they must have been an impressive sight.</p>
                                <p>
                                  The obvious initial theory was that they were meteors, and that they had shown up in
                                  one section of the country by a fluke of the law of probability.</p>

                                    emerald mysteries were, they were a separate puzzle from the classic flying saucers.
                                    They had no characteristics in common with the silvery disks except that they
                                    flew. </p>
                                    <p>As our experience in investigation broadened, we found that the reliability of
                                      saucer reports varied inversely with the detail that the observer reported. The
                                      hoaxes were almost always marked by a vivid description. When a witness could tell
                                      us exactly how many rivets the saucer had, we started checking his background.

                                      One morning when we arrived at work we found an urgent telegram from a Military
                                      Air Transport Service base in Florida. It told about a scoutmaster who had been
                                      attacked by a saucer and burned. The incident had been witnessed by three scouts,
                                      and the local intelligence officer had made a quick check on the story and could
                                      find no holes in it. He reported that the scoutmaster had a good reputation for
                                      reliability, which of course was what you'd expect.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      I showed the report to my superior at ATIC, Col. Frank Dunn, and he approved an
                                      on-the-scene investigation. In 20 minutes we had a B-25 ready with two pilots. I
                                      threw some things in a bag, got Lt. Robert Olssen, a Blue Book investigator, and
                                      we headed for Florida. Just before we left, we called Florida and asked t em to
                                      have a doctor examine the scoutmaster's burns.</p>

                                      We landed late in the afternoon and reviewed the case with the local intelligence
                                      officer. He was pretty well sold on the man's story. It was an exceptionally
                                      detailed account, and when I'd heard the whole thing, I smelled a hoax.</p>

                                      and then headed for the nearby town where the other three lived. He took a back
                                      road that led through a sparsely settled area. This struck me as odd, but I
                                      checked the map and found that it was the logical route from the first scout's
                                      home to the town where they were going.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      By this time, his story went, it was around 9 p.m. As they drove through a sandy
                                      section with scrub pine, he saw some Iights come down low into the trees and
                                      disappear. The scoutmaster's first thought was that a plane had made a crash
                                      Ianding. The boys didn't see the lights, but he told them about them and said he
                                      thought he ought to investigate. The boys were afraid to be left alone in the car,
                                      and he started to drive on when he peered back into the trees and saw something
                                      glowing. Thjs time the boys thought they saw it too. The scoutmaster decided that
                                      it was his duty to see if a plane was in trouble.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      He had the radio on in his car, and a quarter-hour program was just starting. He
                                      told the boys to wait until the program was over, and if he hadn't returned, they
                                      were to go to a farmhouse a short way down the road and summon help. Taking a
                                      flashlight and a machete, he headed into the woods.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      He stumbled through the night, keeping his light on the ground, until he came to a
                                      clearing a short distance from the road.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      "I suddenly noticed something odd that frightened me," he said. "I felt a damp,
                                      muggy heat on my face. It did not feel natural. At the same time I smelled a
                                      faintly pungent odor.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      "I stepped into the clearing and the heat and odor got worse. It felt like the
                                      radiation from a furnace. I glanced up to check the position of the North Star. It
                                      was a clear night and I had spotted the star when I left the auto, to orient
                                      myself. The whole sky was black.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      "I was paralyzed with fear and turned my flashlight up. The beam shone on the
                                      bottom of something. It looked like battleship-gray linoleum. Whatever it was, it
                                      was so low I could have jumped up and hit it with my machete.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      'I backed up until I could see the stars again. Then I flashed the light up again
                                      and could see the object plainly. It was about 30 feet in diameter, with things on
                                      the side like ventilators. The device was dome-shaped, with a slightly convex
                                      bottom. As I stepped back the heat diminished and I could feel the cool, fresh air
                                      on the back of my neck.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      "Suddenly I had the strange feeling that something was watching me. From the
                                      saucer there came the sound of something moving, of metal against metal, like a
                                      safe door opening.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      "A glowing red ball appeared and started to float down toward me. In a reflex
                                      action, I threw my arms up to protect my face, with my clenched fists over my
                                      eyes. I was engulfed in a red mist and lost consciousness."</p>
                                    <p>
                                      Back on the road, the scouts grew frightened, piled out of the car and ran to the
                                      farmhouse for help. The farmer called the state police, who relayed the alarm to
                                      the sheriff. Two deputies arrived on the scene just as the scoutmaster came
                                      stumbling out of the woods.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      "He had the most scared look I've ever seen," one of the deputies told me. The
                                      scoutmaster poured out his fantastic story to the deputies and then accompanied
                                      them back to the clearing. They found his flashlight on the ground, still burning,
                                      and a crushed place in the grass where someone had been lying.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      The whole party went to the sheriff's office, where the scoutmaster was examined.
                                      They found that the backs of both arms were scorched and that the top of his cap-a
                                      long-visored fishing or skiing model-had been scorched, too. They notified the Air
                                      Force.<br/> We questioned the scoutmaster at length the evening after we arrived.
                                      He told a consistent story. When we got through, he asked if he could talk to
                                      anyone about the event, or should he keep buttoned up? "That's up to you," I told
                                      him. "The Air Force doesn't try to censor these stories."</p>
                                    <p>
                                      We talked to his employer, who said he was a fine fellow. The next morning we went
                                      out to the scene and combed it foot by foot. The only theory we had was that he
                                      had been struck by lightning-possibly ball lightning-but there was no sign of
                                      lightning having struck the area.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      We returned to the base and found it in an uproar. The scoutmaster had a lurid
                                      account in the local paper. He reported that "top Air Force officials from
                                      Washington" had questioned him. "The Air Force and I know what this thing was," he
                                      went on cryptically, "but I'm not allowed to tell because it would create a
                                      panic.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      I looked at Olssen and Olssen looked at me. "Screwball," we said
                                      simultaneously.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      The scoutmaster knew that we were from Dayton, not Washington, that we were a
                                      plain AF captain and a lieutenant, not "top officials," that we had offered no
                                      theory about the "saucer," and had told him he could talk freely. That afternoon
                                      we learned he had hired a press agent. That evening we did some intensive digging
                                      into his background, and the next day we flew back to Dayton.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      We brought his hat back for a check at the lab. They reported the scorch marks
                                      were peculiar, as if they had been burned by a hot iron. There were folded areas
                                      that were not scorched at all. The lab expressed a strong doubt that the hat was
                                      on anyone's head when it was burned.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      We sent out a few queries here and there, and found that he had a peculiar
                                      background for a scoutmaster. He had told a strange story about serving in the
                                      Marines in the Pacific, where he had landed alone on Jap-held islands and mapped
                                      them at night to make the Marine landings easier.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      We queried the Marines and they told us that he had served six months and had
                                      never left the country. He had gone AWOL, got mixed up in a stolen auto case, had
                                      been kicked out of the corps and had served time. We checked the institution where
                                      he had done his term and learned that he was a somewhat unstable character, to put
                                      it charitably, given to spinning wild yarns. He reportedly had once told New York
                                      police he had seen two men hurl a woman out of a skyscraper and that the body had
                                      landed at his feet. Up sped a black limousine, he said, out jumped two other
                                      fellows who picked up the body, threw it in the back seat and roared off. The
                                      police went with him to the scene, and sure enough, there wasn't any body there.
                                      There wasn't any blood on the sidewalk, either.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      We tipped off the Scout council and wrote off the story as a hoax. The fellow kept
                                      telling it, however, and it got better all the time. Within a month, the saucer
                                      had acquired an unspeakable monster, so foul that there were no words to describe
                                      it.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      Later we had an even more fascinating "manned saucer" story from a radar station
                                      up near the Canadian border. Two radar men stepped out of their shack one night
                                      and were astounded to see a great glowing UFO low in the trees a few miles away.
                                      The generator that operated the radar set wasn't operating, and one of the men ran
                                      around to the Quonset hut to get it started.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      While he was in the hut, the saucer flew up to the radar shack and halted,
                                      hovering in the air. A sliding door opened, and a little man, 4 feet high, came
                                      walking down some invisible steps. He was quite remarkable, even for a saucer
                                      crewman-he had two heads, one an old one and the other a young one. With proper
                                      respect for age, the young head let the old one do the talking.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      <q>"May I please have a drink of water?</q>" the elderly head asked the radar
                                      operator.<br/> The man stammered out that they had no water, which subsequent
                                      investigation indeed proved to be the truth. The old head thanked him politely,
                                      and the creature mounted the invisible steps and reentered the saucer, which flew
                                      back to its original position among the trees. A little later the radar pair
                                      pointed it out to several other people, all of whom saw it clearly. The other
                                      witnesses, however, insisted that it was merely the moon.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      A formal report was filed on this and forwarded to Dayton. We were still puzzling
                                      over it when we got a terse supplementary notation from the local intelligence
                                      officer who had interrogated the men. Behind the radar shack he had found two
                                      cases of empty beer bottles. <q>"Please ignore original report,</q>" he wrote.
                                      "<q>Disciplinary action has been taken."</q></p>
                                    <p>
                                      In general, we didn't pay much attention to the reports that involved saucer
                                      crews, whether they were little men, indescribable monsters, or spacemen with
                                      junior and senior heads. Once West Virginia came up with a report of a metallic
                                      monster that blew poison gas at some children. We got an urgent telephone call
                                      from the local newspaper asking us when we would be down to investigate. I took
                                      the call.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      <q>"Has the monster got a saucer?"</q> I asked the reporter.</p>
                                    <p>
                                      <q>"Well, there's talk about some lights seen landing in the vicinity, but no one
                                        has located anything."</q></p>
                                    <p>
                                      I asked him how the monster got around, whether he walked or flew.</p>

                                        <p>The saucers hit the front pages in 96-point type in July, 1952, when they
                                          "buzzed" Washington, D. C. The story caught the Air Force completely off
                                          balance and the handling of it got fouled up beyond all recognition. It
                                          finally took a couple of generals and a press conference to straighten things
                                          out. </p>
                                        <p>
                                          It started shortly after nine o'clock Saturday night, July 19, when the Air
                                          Route Traffic Control Center of the Washington National Airport noticed some
                                          odd targets on their radar scope. They seemed to be the shape and size of
                                          aircraft, but they didn't fly right. They would cruise around aimlessly at
                                          from 100 to 130 mph and then suddenly vanish - "in a burst of speed," the
                                          saucer Boswells added later, in dressing up the story. Shortly before
                                          midnight, the National Airport controllers called BoIling Air Force Base, just
                                          across the Potomac, and asked if they had anything strange on their radar.
                                          BoIling also was picking up strange targets. About this time Andrews AFB
                                          chimed in and reported that they had some unknown objects on their scopes,
                                          too. Boiling, Washington National and Andrews are all tied together in a
                                          common communications net, and they started comparing notes over the squawk
                                          box.</p>
                                        <p>
                                          Once, at a point close to the Andrews range, where the three radar systems
                                          overlapped, they all picked up what seemed to be the same target. Several
                                          people at Andrews were alerted and spotted a big orange-red object hovering
                                          just about where radar had it.</p>
                                        <p>
                                          Washington National called all commercial aircraft in the area and asked them
                                          to look for lights that they couldn't identify as other aircraft. At 3:15
                                          a.m., Capital Airlines Flight 807 reported seven lights between Washington and
                                          Martinsburg, W. Va.-a section where some of the mysterious blips had shown on
                                          the scopes. The captain of the airliner, a man with seventeen years' flying
                                          experience, described the lights as hovering awhile and then moving up and
                                          down. Shortly later a Capitol-National flight approaching Washington from the
                                          south reported that a light had followed them to within four miles of the
                                          airport.</p>
                                        <p>
                                          At 4 a.m. an F-94 all-weather jet fighter was flown into the area and combed
                                          it thoroughly and could find nothing.</p>
                                        <p>
                                          The location of this flareup - practically over the White House - plus the
                                          radar angle and the fact that a fighter had been scrambled combined to make
                                          this story big news. The radar aspects in particular impressed the newspapers
                                          and the wire services, and the case was played up as the first time that
                                          "saucers" had been spotted by radar. All over the country people said, "They
                                          must be real if radar picks them up." The night fighter roaring aloft to chase
                                          saucers away from Capitol Hill was the final touch.</p>
                                        <p>
                                          Actually, radar is as tricky as the imagination of a scared youngster alone in
                                          the house at midnight. There are a number of ways radar can pick up objects
                                          that simply aren't there. An inversion layer in the air will bend the radar
                                          beam and cause it to interfere with another radar station that ordinarily is
                                          out of range. Or inversion will cause the scanning station to pick up ground
                                          targets - such as a big truck. On the night the saucers "buzzed Washington"
                                          there was a temperature inversion and all the sets were getting weather blips.
                                          The fact that three of them showed a blip at the same spot didn't necessarily
                                          mean a thing. They all showed blips wherever they were turned.</p>
                                        <p>
                                          When we talked to the men at Andrews who had seen the orange-red object they
                                          had already figured out that it was a planet. The fact that a fighter had been
                                          sent up was not at all unusual. It is standard procedure whenever the Air
                                          Defense Command gets a target that they can't identify over a "sensitive"
                                          area. That's heir job. We couldn't account for the airline sightings, and
                                          listed them as unknown.</p>
                                        <p>
                                          But by the time we had pieced all this together, the Washington saucer story
                                          was a couple of days old, the papers were back on politics and hardly anyone
                                          was interested in a complex explanation of just why an exciting story hadn't
                                          been true. This time lag was a real drawback in keeping the public informed
                                          about the evaluations of the project. Someone out in Seattle or San Antonio or
                                          What Cheer, Iowa, would report a saucer and the local paper would call us up
                                          and ask, "How about this? What was it, anyway?" We'd tell them, in all
                                          honesty, "We don't know. We haven't been able to make our evaluation yet." The
                                          story would hit the paper's front page the next day under the headline: </p>
                                        <p>PREACHER SEES SAUCER AIR FORCE CAN'T EXPLAIN</p>
                                        <p>
                                          Just one week after the saucers buzzed Washington, they came back and buzzed
                                          it again - and again we stubbed our toe on the story. The reporters got word
                                          of the story and hurried to the airport. This time the all-weather fighters
                                          were called down right away. Commercial traffic was cleared out of the area
                                          and things were set up to work an "intercept." Here the trouble began; some of
                                          the procedures used in the situation are classified, so the reporters were
                                          shooed out of the radar room. Everyone was excited, and the reporters were
                                          bewildered by the sudden bum's rush. They knew that "something" had been
                                          spotted over the capital again, and pretty soon they heard our jets roaring up
                                          and down through the night-while something big went on behind firmly closed
                                          doors. The next day the papers broke out with 120-point bold headline
                                          type:</p>
                                        <p>
                                          SAUCERS ELUDE 600 MPH JETS</p>
                                        <p>
                                          Which was, after all, accurate in its way. The jets had been unable to find
                                          anything over Washington. They would be directed to the spots where the
                                          "saucer" blips showed on the radar and fly right through them. This was merely
                                          confirmation of what we'd learned the week before, that the blips were radar
                                          abberations.</p>
                                        <p>
                                          The big black headlines were on every news rack in Washington when the
                                          Pentagon got a call from the White House asking just exactly what was going
                                          on. White House calls were ordinarily handled by at least a three-star
                                          general, but in this case a captain-Ruppelt - was given the honor of
                                          explaining what was going on over the head of the President. I think there was
                                          something in the tone of the query that downgraded the assignment to my level.
                                          I made a reassuring report to Mr. Truman's air aide. Later I was told that the
                                          President was listening in on the briefing, but he didn't let out a peep.</p>

                                          The scare stories in the Washington press came smack in the middle of a record
                                          wave of saucer sightings. The year 1952 had started modestly with eleven
                                          sightings in January and built up steadily to 149 in June. This was almost as
                                          many as the project normally received in an entire year. While we were digging
                                          our way out from under the unprecedented June reports. July inundated us with
                                          409. The two summer months produced as many sightings as the first four years
                                          of the Age of the Saucer. We went on a 16-hour day.</p>

                                          The press was much more interested in the "saucers over Washington" angle and
                                          fired dozens of questions about that incident, concentrating on the radar
                                          "confirmation." It seemed to be news to many of them that radar is not
                                          infallible, that it is not a crystal-clear mirror that gives back exactly what
                                          is in front of it.</p>

                                          Many of the newsmen were amazed that a big "naval battle" had been fought in
                                          World War II with a nonexistent enemy because of tricks played by radar. The
                                          conference also brought out the fact that a fighter pilot, following a radar
                                          "target" caused by a temperature inversion, once had followed the bend of the
                                          image four times and found himself flying right at the ground. These incidents
                                          took a lot of the edge off the capital saucer sensation.</p>
                                        <p>
                                          I never got adjusted to the tremendous partisanship that the flying saucers
                                          inspired. Hardly anyone was neutral about saucers. People would bend our ears
                                          by the hour proving: (1) Saucers were a lot of damned nonsense and the Air
                                          Force was out of its mind to bother with investigating them, or (2) They were
                                          spaceships whose existence was beyond question and the Air Force was out of
                                          its mind to try to cover up the truth about them.</p>

                                          Both groups would wind up fixing us with a stern glare and demanding-<q>"What
                                          do you think?"</q></p>

                                          I would tell them that we were trying to conduct an open-minded investigation,
                                          and that so far we didn't have sufficient data for a firm conclusion. This
                                          would just pour gasoline on the fire. People wanted a firm yes or no" about
                                          the saucers.</p>

                                            reasonable discussion almost hopeless.</p>
                                            <p>Once I talked to a well-known psychiatrist about this. He was a

                                              about the existence of saucers. He saw some-thing. I can understand why
                                              anyone who has seen something that he can't explain will argue for the
                                              existence of space ships. Such a theory gives him an answer to a personal
                                              riddle. But why do thousands of people who have never seen a saucer swear
                                              that they exist?"</p>

                                              said. "The will-to-believe is a powerful thing, and it edits out reality.

                                              losing faith in the invincible intelligence of man. In eight long years,
                                              the best brains on earth have frustrated each other in removing the

                                              <em>Behind the Flying Saucers</em> went through ten editions and sent a
                                              shining, silvery chain of disc-shaped dollars spinning at supersonic
                                              speeds into Scully's bank account. I was ribbing him about a couple of
                                              Southern California characters who were outdoing each other-and
                                              Scully-with fantastic saucer stories. One wrote a book about a citizen
                                              from <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus/index.html">Venus</a>
                                              who landed his saucer in the California desert and had a long conversation
                                              with the author. Character No. Two topped that one with a yarn about
                                              riding on a saucer to a hitherto unknown planet named Clarion, whose
                                              female residents presumably are known as Clarionettes.</p>

                                              Scully, the staid old scientist who first put the story of the "little men
                                              from the saucers" between book covers, was appalled at such "irresponsible
                                              stories." He complained bitterly about "the lunatic fringe invading the
                                              saucer business," which gives a rough idea of the prevailing standards.
                                              The cultists are nearing the limits imposed by the law of diminishing
                                              returns. About the only sensation left for an author trying to break into
                                              the racket is to have his book delivered by little green men riding bona

                                              The cultists watched the operation of Blue Book like suspicious wives
                                              eyeing wayward husbands. Everything that we did-or failed to do-had
                                              significance. If we investigated a flamboyant "little men" hoax, it was
                                              because we knew there are little men and were trying to keep the secret
                                              bottled up. If we ignored the story, we were playing a shrewd game of
                                              poker and cloaking the truth with a show of contempt. The cultists even
                                              used to analyze our facial expressions at press conferences. I usually
                                              made a "bland show of unconcern."</p>

                                              Once one of the project's technical advisers made the mistake of lapsing
                                              into mild satire in his report. In considering the saucers-from-space
                                              theory, he noted that there had been speculation that some of the UFO's
                                              behaved like animals. 'There are few reliable reports," he commented
                                              dryly, "<q>of extraterrestrial animals.</q>" This quip was pounced on by
                                              the cult as an enormously significant slip-up in our great conspiracy to
                                              hide the truth, and became an "<q>official Air Force admission that some
                                              of the saucers carried beings from outer space.</q>" <a

                                              Such experiences tended to make us cautious in our public announcements,
                                              and we tiptoed on verbal eggs. This, of course, was taken by the cultists
                                              to be further evidence of Operation Cover-up.</p>

                                              The saucer project attracted screw-balls in droves. On gentleman, who was
                                              a plasterer through the week and the shepherd for some off-beat religious
                                              sect on Sunday, telephoned me incessantly until I gave him an appointment.
                                              He was a tall, hollow-eyed fellow who looked like an undertaker down on
                                              his luck. A sister in his flock had solved the riddle of the saucers. She
                                              had it all written out, with citations from the Bible as documentation,
                                              and he clutched the historic document tightly and kept a wary eye on me.
                                              All he wanted for it was $15,000 cash.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              I told him, as gently as possible, that the government didn't hand out
                                              that kind of money for a saucer in the poke.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              <q>"All right, mister</q>," he said, <q>"I'll tell you what the saucers
                                              are. But you'll have to put the cash on the barrelhead to find out how
                                              Sister Betty figured it out."</q></p>
                                            <p>
                                              He took a deep breath. "The saucers are four angels dancing in a
                                              circle."</p>
                                            <p>
                                              He grew surly when I didn't haul out a roll of crisp $100 bills, fresh
                                              from the U.S. Treasury, and start counting them out for him.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              <q>"What's the matter, mister?</q>" he asked. "<q>Doesn't the Air Force
                                              want to solve this problem?"</q></p>

                                              I got off the hook by telling him that our budget had been cut and that he
                                              could make more with Sister's secret peddling it to one of the big
                                              national magazines. He went off with a gleam in his eye.</p>

                                              Then there were the letters. They went into a special file with the
                                              cryptic notation "C. P."-for crackpot. We got them by the hundreds.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              From Campbell, Ohio, a gentleman offered us "<q>spectrograms of saucer
                                              lights</q>"-at a price-and warned us that he was selling "to the highest
                                              bidder, domestic or foreign." "These spectrograms are protected against
                                              forceable seizure," he noted tersely, "and I would not recommend such

                                              From Long Beach, Calif., a woman wrote us a long series of letters about
                                              saucers "touching" her day and night. <q>"They also nip your toes</q>,"
                                              she complained. <q>"They just make you sick."</q></p>
                                            <p>
                                              My favorite was from a gentleman who signed himself "Uncle Sam's Most
                                              Unique Booster." He offered us three working saucers in exchange for train
                                              fare from California to Dayton. "I fly them by changing the potential
                                              energy in centrifugal force to a kinetic energy of 33 pounds to the square
                                              inch in the form of a jet propulsion," he wrote. "Roll that around your
                                              attic." His saucers were powered by vacuum cleaner motors. If we weren't

                                              In 1952, we extracted the best sightings from the files to see what kind
                                              of sense we could make from them. These represented the cream of the
                                              reports and most of them had come through military channels. This meant
                                              that they either had been made by military personnel or had undergone a
                                              preliminary check at the point of origin.</p>

                                              Of the 2,199 sightings, 434-19.7 percent-were listed as unknown. Among
                                              them were sightings reported by scientists and veteran pilots of excellent
                                              reputation, many of whom had been scornful disbelievers until they had
                                              sighted their saucers. These reports included instances of flight
                                              performance and maneuvers be-bond the abilities of any known craft.</p>

                                              <strong>INCIDENT NO. 2</strong>-On July 29, 1952, near Port Huron, Mich.,
                                              two F-94s were in the air making night practice runs on a B-25. A radar
                                              station in the vicinity picked up an unknown object and asked one of the
                                              planes to investigate. The jet went up to 20,000 feet where the pilot
                                              spotted the object visually. He started to chase it, and the fleeing UFO
                                              and the pursuing jet both showed up on the radar scope, which tracked the
                                              chase. The jet pilot switched on his gun radar, got an automatic lock-on.
                                              The object easily kept out in front of the jet, even when the pilot kicked
                                              on his afterburner. Our investigation showed that there were no other
                                              planes in the vicinity, and the double radar verification ruled out
                                              planets, stars, reflections, hallucinations.</p>

                                              <strong>INCIDENT NO. 3</strong>~n July 24, 1952, two Air Force colonels
                                              stationed at the Pentagon were en route in a B-25 from Hamilton AFB to
                                              Colorado Springs. They were flying at 11,000 feet near Carson Sink, Nev.
                                              It was 3:40 p.m. on a calm, clear day with unlimited visibility. Suddenly
                                              they sighted three silver objects shaped like arrowheads approaching them
                                              at terrific speed. The objects first appeared at the 1 o'clock position
                                              and passed the B-25 in a continuous bank. The two colonels both observed
                                              the three strange objects carefully and were positive that they were no
                                              craft that they had ever seen before. They estimated their size at about
                                              that of an F-86, and their distance at the point of passage at between 400
                                              and 800 yards. Both men reported that the objects had a "definite ridge
                                              along the top," and had sharply defined outlines. Neither man was a flying
                                              saucer believer.</p>

                                              <strong>INCIDENT NO. 4</strong>-On January 28, 1953, at 9:35 p.m., a jet
                                              pilot near Albany, Ga., spotted "an extremely bright light" at 10 o'clock
                                              high. At first he thought it was another aircraft or an unusually bright
                                              star, but when he went up to 10,000 feet it appeared to be ahead and a bit
                                              below him. When first spotted, the light was white, but later it began
                                              changing constantly from white to orange and back to white. The object was
                                              in view for 17 minutes. In the last 15 seconds it changed shape from
                                              circular to triangular, and then the triangles split into two
                                              triangles-one immediately above the other-and both disappeared as if
                                              someone snapped off a light.</p>

                                              The pilot called Albany, Ga., but before he could make his amazed report,
                                              ground asked him if he had seen anything unusual. They advised him that
                                              ground radar had picked up both his jet and a strange target. On the radar
                                              scope, when the jet had speeded up, the target had stepped up, too, to
                                              maintain its lead on him.</p>

                                              INCIDENT NO. 5-Shortly before midnight on August 5, 1952, two airmen were
                                              walking toward the tower at Haneda AFB in Japan to begin their shift when
                                              they spotted a large round object bearing a light in the sky. Hurrying to
                                              the tower, they pointed it out to the other tower operators, and they took
                                              turns observing the object through 7x50 binoculars. Under the glasses, a
                                              less brilliant light could be seen around the edge of the object. The
                                              tower people called radar and gave them a bearing on the thing, and radar
                                              picked up a target in the immediate area. By correlating movement of the
                                              radar target and the visual UFO, they established that they were both
                                              observing the same object. The radar tracked the object at speeds varying
                                              from hovering to 300 knots. An F-94 was scrambled and vectored into the
                                              target. It got a radar lock-on and started to close on the object. At
                                              6,000 yards, the jet lost radar contact and at the same time the tower and
                                              ground radar lost it, too. At the end of the sighting, the object as seen
                                              on the ground radar "broke up into three pieces which flew formation at
                                              quarter-mile intervals." During the incident, a weather balloon was
                                              released at the base, and the witnesses reported that its light was much
                                              dimmer than that of the UFO. One of the puzzling aspects of the incident
                                              was that neither the jet pilot nor the radar crew was able to get a visual
                                              sighting on the object, although each was closer to it than the air base
                                              tower.</p>

                                              INCIDENT NO. 6-On the night of January 26, 1953, a group of Air Force
                                              people stationed at a radar site in New Mexico observed a "very bright,
                                              reddish-white" object west of their station and then picked it up on their
                                              radar. The object was in view for 45 minutes both visually and by radar
                                              and once moved behind a hill and then reappeared. Radar showed it 9 miles
                                              from the station, traveling north at a lazy 12 to 15 knots, at 10,000 to
                                              15,000 feet. Although a balloon was in the vicinity, the UFO traveled
                                              steadily almost directly into the wind.</p>

                                              INCIDENT NO. 7~n February 16, 1953, at 11:30p.m., a pilot and an
                                              instructor in a C-47 over Turnagain Arm - bay near Anchorage, Alaska-saw a
                                              red light that they judged to be a jet aircraft, five miles away. But as
                                              they watched it, it got bigger and brighter, as if headed toward them.
                                              Unable to see any green navigation light, they asked the tower at
                                              Elmendorf AFB if any other craft were in the area. The tower said there
                                              was none, and then made a radar check with negative results. The object
                                              was first seen low and definitely below the horizon. The C-47 was flying
                                              at 2,000 feet. The object continued to close on the C-47, increasing in
                                              brilliance and size until it was two or three times the original size.
                                              Then it seemed to stop and hang suspended for five minutes. The pilots,
                                              still thinking it might be another aircraft, headed toward Elmendorf,
                                              where the tower asked them if they still could see the light. It was still
                                              visible, and the tower asked them to try to intercept it. As the C47 took
                                              up the chase, the light appeared to accelerate and shortly vanished.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              The following night, about 8 p.m., five Air Police on patrol spotted the
                                              same-or another-red light near the end of one of the Elmendorf runways. By
                                              comparing it with known lights at the base, they judged it to be similar
                                              to a 36-inch light seen from ~/s mile away. It was in a gradual climb, at
                                              about jet speed, headed for Anchorage. The Air Police called the tower. It
                                              had nothing on radar, but ordered up a jet to intercept. As the jet became
                                              airborne, the object showed a noticeable increase in speed, and when the
                                              jet came around to get on an intercept course, the light climbed
                                              vertically into the overcast at 5,500 feet.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              The Air Police did not know of the original sighting when they made their
                                              report. A careful check showed no balloons in the area. Stars and planets
                                              were eliminated because the first night the.object was below the horizon,
                                              and the second night there was a solid overcast. If it had been a
                                              conventional craft, the radar should have picked it up. If it had been a
                                              stray balloon that wandered in from some distance, on the first night the
                                              C-47 should easily have closed on it and passed it. On the second night,
                                              its sudden vertical rise disposed of the drifting balloon theory.</p>

                                              These cases, and the hundreds more like them, are the core of the flying
                                              saucer mystery. Despite our best efforts over a period of seven
                                              years-assisted by top-grade technical and scientific advisers-we were
                                              unable to crack them. They remain to baffle and intrigue millions. And
                                              despite the improvement in methods of analysis that has resulted from our
                                              experience, scores of unknowns are added fo the project's files each
                                              year.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              Hundreds of people have asked me, "What do you think, yourself?"</p>
                                            <p>
                                              The job of~roject Blue Book was fact-finding, not speculation. Our
                                              investigation of the saucer sightings was aimed at compiling as much firm
                                              data as we could, in the hope that it would provide the basis for analysis
                                              that would answer the seven-year mystery. The project failed in this
                                              attempt. The mystery of the saucers is still as baffling as it was the day
                                              that Kenneth Arnold landed his plane and told the story of what he had
                                              seen near Mt. Rainier.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              My own opinion is that either the saucers are interplanetary or they do
                                              not exist. I do not believe that there is enough evidence at hand to
                                              choose between these alternatives. You can argue either case indefinitely,
                                              and in the end you will have only an opinion.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              In the operation of Blue Book, we briefed a number of assemblies of
                                              scientists-guided missile experts, atomic people, experimental aircraft
                                              technicians, physicists, etc. We found them intensely interested in the
                                              saucer mystery. At Los Alamos, for example, we jammed an amphitheater with
                                              standees and answered questions for three hours after we concluded our
                                              briefing.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              These people were trained in the scientific attitude, as opposed to the
                                              cultists who accept every wild-eyed report as a certified, gold-seal fact.
                                              Among them were people who had seen things that they could not explain.
                                              They were eager for facts that would help them put their experience into
                                              perspective.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              These are the facts upon which I think that any responsible conclusion
                                              about them must be based:</p>
                                            <p>
                                              I. To my knowledge, the Air Force has not concealed any secret sensations
                                              about the saucers. In the earliest days of the investigation, the project
                                              was secret. There was considerable alarm then, and some officials thought
                                              that the objects might be something new from Russia. As the alarm waned,
                                              the information was declassified. Whatever secrecy has been thrown around
                                              subsequent incidents has been only to protect classified
                                              information-precise locations of radar stations, performance data on jet
                                              fighters, etc. We also protected the identity of informants who wished to
                                              remain anonymous. We did this to encourage people of standing to feel free
                                              to report any incredible incident. Reyond these exceptions, the Air Force
                                              knows nothing about the subject that it is not telling.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              2. Project Blue Book was given no orders from above about "handling the
                                              saucer problem." The story that we were a bunch of dupes, reciting
                                              whatever the top echelons told us to say, is a lot of nonsense. We briefed
                                              the echelons above us, not vice versa. I once made a personal report to
                                              Secretary for Air Thomas Fin-letter at the Pentagon. He was accompanied by
                                              a full squad of advisers and technicians. He thanked me when I was
                                              through.! gave him no information that is not in this account.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              3. We had no evidence whatever that the saucers are some supersecret U. S.
                                              development. On the contrary, we had specific disclaimers of this from top
                                              Air Force, Army, Navy and Department of Defense officials. Ordinary horse
                                              sense is against this theory. If the U.S. has flying saucers that can
                                              perform the way saucersighters describe them, why would the government be
                                              pouring billions of dollars into conventional - and inferior -planes?</p>
                                            <p>
                                              4. We also had no evidence that the saucers are of foreign manufacture.
                                              Again, logic opposes such a belief. The chief suspect in the "foreign
                                              saucer" theory is Russia. Why would Russia try out such a revolutionary
                                              device over the U. S. when it has vast stretches of land behind the Iron
                                              Curtain, where the test could be conducted in complete secrecy? Any
                                              man-made device is certain to fail sooner or later. The more complex the
                                              device, the higher the failure probability. Yet in seven years, with
                                              thousands of saucer sightings, not one has been known to have crashed.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              These four points may bring you to the possibility that the saucers are
                                              craft from outer space. As staggering as the implications may be, to my
                                              mind this is the most acceptable theory-if the saucers exist. There is no
                                              other alternative.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              What is the argument that they are nonexistent? It has some stubborn facts
                                              on its side.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              First, the residue of unknowns shows no common characteristics. Their
                                              shapes, performances, times of appearance, colors, locations showed the
                                              same bewildering variety as the 80 percent that we were able to explain.
                                              The 434 unknowns included little lights, big lights, multicolored lights,
                                              discs seen by day, cigar shapes, orbs and dots of lights. To argue that
                                              the hard core of unknowns are all "saucers is inaccurate. They include a
                                              variety of dissimilar objects. This variety gives strength to the theory
                                              that the unknowns are merely the same known objects as the 80 % of
                                              sightings we were able to explain. There is a strong belief in the Air
                                              Force that the unknowns are "unknown" only because we lacked sufficient
                                              data on them. This belief is supported by the fact that our percentage of
                                              explanations rose with the intensity of our investigation.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              Secondly, there were no bursts of unknowns. Over the years, they roughly
                                              followed the total number of sightings, rising and falling with the volume
                                              of reports. In general, there was no geographic clustering of unknowns.
                                              For a time, there were more sightings around certain atomic installations
                                              and defense areas. This concentration was not large enough, in our
                                              opinion, to have significance. Residents of such areas are more security
                                              conscious than people living in a nonsensitive area, and quite possibly we
                                              got more sightings from atomic and defense sections because more people
                                              there were scanning the skies.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              Some theorists have figured that another planet sending emissaries to the
                                              earth would dispatch them at the point where their orbit would bring them
                                              closest to earth. Assuming a set travel time, this would bring their craft
                                              into our ken at a regular time. For several years there was a sharp rise
                                              in saucer reports during the month of July. But in 1953, the sightings in
                                              the month took a sharp drop.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              Thirdly, in the seven years there has been no physical evidence of the
                                              existence of saucers. The Air Force has found no evidence that a saucer
                                              has ever crashed or landed. It has seen no photographic evidence that it
                                              can credit. It has seen no "hardware" that it cannot explain as
                                              man-made.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              Against these arguments stands the testimony of hundreds of people. They
                                              have seen something incredible. They indude hundreds of people who scoffed
                                              at flying saucers until they saw something that bore no relation to
                                              anything they had ever seen. They include hard-bitten airmen familiar with
                                              all the hallucinations of flying, sober scientists who applied every
                                              natural explanation - and stubbornly insisted, <q>"It was something
                                              else."</q></p>
                                            <p>
                                              Among these sightings have been a small number that have been confirmed by
                                              radar. Whatever the object was, it was not hallucination. And frequently,
                                              it outperformed any craft known on earth.</p>
                                            <p>
                                              The fact that the unknowns show a variety of shapes and sizes might be
                                              explained by 2 things. One is the unreliability of witnesses. A saucer
                                              described as '50 feet in diameter" may be 150 feet -if it is farther from
                                              the observer than he believes. The variety in sizes of the unknowns could

                                              data were available, the unknowns might well show a greater consistency in
                                              size.</p>

                                              The sightings of lights at night may have no relevance to the actual size
                                              of be craft that carries them-just as a navigation light on a plane gives
                                              no hint to the size of the ship.</p>

                                              The absence of physical evidence-such as crashed saucers-supports the
                                              theory that they are not of this world. We have reliable data on the
                                              failure actor of man-made devices. If the saucers were made by Americans
                                              or Russians, their imperfections would have brought them down by now. But
                                              if they re interplanetary, they may be contrived by a civilization so far
                                              advanced as to have reduced the probability of failure to near zero. Or
                                              they may utilize a principle of flight unknown to us. A craft capable of
                                              traversing the vast distances of space might fly almost endlessly in the
                                              relatively tiny confines of our air envelope without failure.</p>

                                              The Air Force has never ruled out the possibility that we are being
                                              visited from outer space. It says only that it has no evidence to support
                                              this possibility.</p>
