<p>The requirement for additional experiments in the area of anomalistic phenomena is given, based upon the paucity of
  "hard data"; relevant data collected by astronomers, meteoriticists, and meteorologists, which would be either
  overlooked or not detected; and the possible "filtering" and/or "editing" out of pertinent data by our various space
  surveillance systems prior to its evaluation. An experiment involving two cameras slaved to a detection radar is
  outlined broadly and it is concluded that such a system should be constructed for use in meteoritic, meteorological,
  astronautical, psychological, and "UFO" study programs.</p>
<p>The majority of our astronomical equipment (e.g., conventional photographic telescopes, Baker-Nunn cameras, meteor
  cameras, <em><a href="/people/m/MarkowitzWilliam">Markowitz</a></em> dual-rate Moon Cameras, etc.) are special-purpose
  by their very nature and would probably not detect the anomalous luminous phenomenon reported by the casual observer
  if it were indeed present. Their photographic speed, field of view, etc. put definite limits on their capability to
  collect data on objects other than those for which they have been specially designed. Even if such data WCPP
  collected, the recognition of their uniqueness or anomalous character by an experimenter is improbable. Examples
  abound in celestial mechanics of minor planets being detected on old astronomical plates that had been measured for
  other purposes and then abandoned. <s>Tombaugh's discovery of Pluto from rather old astronomical plates in storage is
    a well-known example.</s> The space surveillance systems are almost programmed to overlook anomalous data. Any
  hard-data arising from an object or manifestation that did not move on a nearly two-body orbit, had a low radar
  cross-section, or followed an erratic path would most probably be filtered out of the system by various data-editing,
  or data-weighting procedures [1], which are inherent in most of our sophisticated space surveillance systems.</p>
<p>
  A representative space surveillance radar may have a beam width of 1/6� for detection and require accurate orbital
  information good to 0.01� for fine tracking. Needless to say, such radars often miss even well-known spacecraft and
  would be completely inadequate for "locking-on" to a hypothetical "UFO." To be sure, advanced radar systems are being
  developed for our missile defense systems, such as the ALTAR (ARPA Long-range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar),
  TRADEX (Target Resolution and Discrimination Experiments) and the phased array RESER (Re-entry System Evaluation
  Radar) system. Although they extend the field of view, they still are developed to filter out anomalous signals. As
  Cheettam [2] points out, "Power and aperture will be programmed after a learning measurement cycle to conserve and
  efficiently distribute available energy when and where (reentry) targets are estimated to exist."</p>
<p>Not only are conventional sensors almost insensitive to anomalous data, but observations published by trained
  scientists, that could be hard-data records of anomalistic phenomena, are often too quickly categorized and then
  forgotten. The observation by Mohr [3] in a letter to <i>Science</i> in 1966 gave an account of a "most unusual fly"
  and described a very remarkable and almost bizarre event that might or might not have been ball lightning. The
  Tunguska event of 1908 may well have been a impacting comet [4] and is usually studied in the context of meteoritics
  [5], Similarly, the Canadian fireball procession of 9 February 1913 could have been an ephemeral natural satellite of
  the Earth [6] or it could have been something more involved. In most such cases, and as in also the situation in
  published UFO studies [7], [8], [10], information-rich hard-data of high quality are rather hard to come by. It
  therefore suggests itself that a special experimental program is in order. The scientific method usually dictates
  experiments in the face of anomalous data and, at the moment, there seems to be sufficient unexplained anomalous
  hard-and-soft data to warrant an experimental program. Several experiments suggest themselves and might include
  geological studies, searches for scraps of material evidence, psychiatric-medical studies of witnesses, or
  radar/optical arrays.</p>
<p>In broad outline, one recommended experiment would involve a large aperture tracing radar that would slave two
  cinetheodolite-type optical trackers if and when an anomalous object appeared. The radar "lock-on" and
  tracking-data-analysis program would be especially designed to avoid satellites and, if possible, common meteors and
  airplanes, but would, for example, detect comet or macrometeorite entry, ball lightning, and any erratic or anomalous
  object within its range (a range that would probably be limited to 500 km or less). Thus, the system might at least
  provide accurate positional information that would provide useful meteoritic data and meteorological data in the
  absence of more bizarre phenomena. The cameras (preferably using Schmidt-type, Maskutov, or Baker catadioptric type
  optics and, perhaps, computer-enhanced digitalized pictorial data [11]) would be on a 5 to 10 km base line (the
  "lock-on" program for the active skin-tracking radar might follow the modified Leuschner differential-correction
  system suggested on pp. 114 and 115 of reference [1] and the system would need to be reliable enough to operate
  unattended for weeks at a time. As shown by studies of meteorite and comet flux, such as Hartmann's [12], Shoemaker
  and Lowery [13], McCrosky [14], and Lamar's [5], a waiting period of a year or so is necessary in order to have
  significant probability of detecting and tracking such natural extraterrestrial objects.

</p>
<p>
  The question of the proper geographical location of the experimental site would almost be as important as the
  specification of the radar/optical and computer/communications complex itself. The meteoriticist would probably prefer
  an area with good atmospheric seeing and of low population density such as the "... Tucson area..." [15]. The
  geologist would prefer a location near dry lakes [16] in order to facilitate the possible recovery of meteoritic or
  other material, or timely study of manifestations of cometary impact or sub-end-point meteoritic debris [17]. The
  psychiatrist would be concerned with the psychiatric-medical credence levels of eye witness (soft data) associated
  with any hard data that might be obtained by the experimental array [18] as well as the general psychological analysis
  of the "... tendency all over the world to believe in saucers and to want them real, ..." [19]. Thus, he would tend to
  prefer a site in a moderate population density area. The physicist interested in ball lightning might wish for a site
  in which atmospheric electrical disturbances were frequent. As Singer noted [20], "The specific properties of ball
  lightning, which present particular difficulty in experimental duplication, are formations of the sphere in air (at
  near-atmospheric pressure and at a distance from the source of energy) and its extensive motion. It is evident that
  additional clarification of both theoretical and experimental aspects of this phenomenon is needed." Often marsh gas
  exhibits bizarre observational data and a location near a marsh might be useful in the examination of such phenomena.
  Clearly, an overall reconcilement of these diverse and interdisciplinary requirements must be accomplished during the
  site (or, perhaps, sites) selection process. </p>
<p>
  In summary, then, four points are to be made:

</p>
<ol><li>
  That we have not now nor have we been able in the past to achieve a complete or even partially complete surveillance
  of space in the vicinity of the Earth, which would betray the presence of any anomalistic phenomena.

</li>
  <li>That so-called hard data on anomalistic observational phenomena do, in fact, exist; but that they are of poor
    quality due to the equipment employed in obtaining them.</li>
  <li>That it follows from the scientific method that an experiment or experiments be devised to define better the
    anomalistic data.
  </li>
  <li>That, in order to justify such an experiment or experiments, it is not necessary to presuppose the existence of
    intelligent extraterrestrial life operating in the environs of the Earth or to make very dubious speculations [9],
    [10] either concerning "their" advanced scientific and engineering capabilities or "their" psychological motivations
    and behavioral patterns.
