<p>Memo to: Files</p>
<p>From: E. u. Condon </p>
<p>Today <span class="people" title="Robert J. Low">Bob Low</span> told me of a remarkable conversation that he had with
  John Ahrens today, after word had been received of the arrest this morning of <span class="place"
      title="James E. Wadsworth">James</span> and Lois Wadsworth for possession of narcotics and peyote. Ahrens told Low
  that some weeks ago, and before the discharge of <span class="people" title="David R. Saunders">Saunders</span> and
  Levine from the UFO project, he (Ahrens) had overhead a conversation of <span class="people">Saunders</span> and <span
      class="people" title="Norman E. Levine">Levine</span> in the UFO project office in which they were saying to each
  other that they could discredit the UFO project by arranging to have <span class="people">Wadsworth</span> arrested
  for narcotics possession. Ahrens was puzzled by this, and did not think much about it at the time. But with the
  subsequent discharge of Saunders and Levine, followed by the arrest of Wadsworth today, he remembered the incident and
  told Low about it.</p>
<p>If true, this would suggest that one of the <span class="people">Saunders</span>-<span class="people">Levine
</span>-<span class="people" title="Mary Louise Armstrong">Armstrong</span> group may have put the police on the
  Wadsworth trail for motives going beyond those of assisting in law enforcement. Also if true, this would show that
  Saunders and Levine, while still on the staff of the project, were actively seeking ways to discredit it, in addition
  to the action they had taken on December 13 (17) <time>1967</time> in giving the stolen August 9, 1966 memorandum to
  <span class="people" title="James E. McDonald">James McDonald</span>.</p>
<p>Low also told me a few days ago that in the summer of 1967, Mary Lou told him "in confidence" that she had been using
  LSD, and also that Jim Wadsworth was using it. She had also told him that she had discontinued use of LSD because of a
  "bad trip." Because Wadsworth's actual work on the job was fairly satisfactory, Low did not undertake to question him
  about LSD at that time or later, nor did he tell me until a few days ago.</p>
<p>Low also told me today that at home the night before (Feb. 29) his daughter Lorrie told him that on one occasion
  during the summer of <time>1967</time>, Mary Lou had tried to induce her (Lorrie) to try LSD but she had declined the
  opportunity.</p>
