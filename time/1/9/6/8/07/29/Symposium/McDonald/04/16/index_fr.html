  1. Commentaires généraux</h4>
<p>
  Le gros des signalements d'ovnis impliquant des objets qui auraient été vus dans les airs, il n'est pas surprenant que
  de nombreuses tentatives pour les expliquer aient invoqué les principes de la physique atmosphérique. Au cours des 20
  dernières années, nombre des explications officielles d'observations d'ovnis importantes ont été basées sur la
  supposition que les observateurs identifiaient ou interprétaient mal des phénomènes atmosphériques naturels. Le Dr. <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/m/MenzelDonaldHoward/index.html">D. H. Menzel</a>, ancien directeur de
  l'Observatoire de Harvard, dans 2 livres sur les ovnis <span class="source">(Ref.
24, 25)</span>, s'est reposé très fortement sur la physique atmosphérique et particulièrement l'optique météorologique
  pour tenter d'expliquer des signalements d'ovnis. Plus récemment, M. <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/KlassPhilipJ/index.html">Philip J. Klass</a>, Rédacteur Senior en
  Avionique de <i>Aviation Week</i>, a écrit un livre <span class="source">(Ref. 36)</span> prétendant montrer que la
  plupart des signalements vraiment intéressants d'ovnis sont le résultat de plasmas atmosphériques inhabituels
  semblables à la <a href="../../../../../../../../../../../enquete/Foudre/Globulaire/index.html">foudre en boule</a>.
  Au fil des années, de nombreux autres ont fait des suggestions semblables selon lesquelles l'explication finale des
  ovnis impliquera un phénomène encore mal compris de physique atmosphérique.</p>
<p>
  En tant que <a href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/scientifiques.html">scientifique</a> principalement
  préoccupé par le domaine de la physique atmosphérique, j'ai accordé une grande attention à ces suggestions. Il est
  vrai qu'une très petite fraction de l'ensemble des signalements bruts implique des phénomènes atmosphériques mal
  identifiés. Il est aussi vrai que de nombreux observateurs lay interprètent vraiment mal des phénomènes astronomiques
  (en particulier météoriques) comme étant des ovnis. Mais, à mon avis, comme cela a été souligné ci-dessus et va être
  développé ci-dessous, nous ne pouvons pas expliquer les ovnis d'un revers de main sur une base météorologique ou
  astronomique. Pour rendre ce point quelque peu plus clair, je ferais des remarques, dans ce qui suit, sur certaines
  tentatives passées de baser des explications d'ovnis sur l'optique météorologique, électricité atmosphérique et
  anomalies de propagation <a href="../../../../../../../../../../../enquete/indice/radar/index.html">radar</a>. </p>
<h4>
  2. Explication optique météorologique </h4>
<p>
  Les mirages, <a href="../../../../../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/Parhelie.html">faux-soleils</a>, sous-soleils
  et divers phénomènes de reflet et de réfraction associés aux cristaux de glace, inversions, couches de brume et <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/nuage/index.html">nuages</a> ont été invoqués de temps à
  autre dans une tentative d'expliquer les observations d'ovnis. From my study of the past history of the UFO problem
  and from an examination of recent ''re-evaluations" of official UFO explanations, I have the strong impression that
  many alterations of explanations for classic UFO cases that have been made in the official files in the last few years
  reflect the response to the writings of Menzel (especially Ref. 25). I have elsewhere (Ref. 2) discussed a number of
  specific examples of what I regard as unreasonable applications of meteorological optics in <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/m/MenzelDonaldHoward/index.html">Menzel</a>'s writings. Some salient
  points will be summarized here. </p>
<p>
  A principal difficulty with <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/m/MenzelDonaldHoward/index.html">Menzel</a>'s mirage explanations is
  that he typically overlooks completely stringent quantitative restrictions on the angle of elevation of the observer's
  line of sight in mirage effects. Mirage phenomena are quite common on the Arizona desert, but both observation and
  optical theory are in good accord in showing that mirage effects are confined to lines of sight that do not depart
  from the horizontal by much more than a few tens of minutes of arc. Under some extremely unusual temperature
  conditions in the atmosphere (high latitude regions, for example), one may get miraging at elevation angles larger
  than a degree, but these situations are extremely rare, it must be emphasized. In Menzel's explanations and in certain
  of the official explanations, however, mirages are invoked to account for UFOs when the observer's line of sight may
  depart from the horizontal by as much as five to ten degrees or even more. I emphasize that this is entirely
  unreasonable. If it were the case that all UFOs were reported essentially at the observer's horizon, then one would
  have to be extremely suspicious that we were dealing with some unusual refraction anomalies. However, as has been
  shown by many cases cited above and has been long known to serious investigators of UFO phenomena, no fixed
  correlation exists. Some of the most interesting UFOs have been seen at close range directly overhead, quite obviously
  ruling out mirage explanations. The 1947 sighting by nold near Mt. Rainier is explained officially and by Menzel as a
  mirage, yet the objects which he saw (nine fluttering discs) changed angular elevation, moved across his view through
  an azimuthal range of about 90 degrees, and were seen by him during the period when he was climbing his own plane
  through an altitude interval that he estimates to be of the order of 500 to 1000 ft. Anyone familiar with mirage
  optics would find it utterly unreasonable to claim that such an observation was satisfactorily explained as a mirage.
  Similarly, as has been noted above, the 1948 sighting by Eastern Airlines pilots Chiles and Whitted, once explained by
  Menzel as a "mirage", involves quantitative and observational factors that are not even approximately similar to known
  mirage effects. There are some extremely rare and still not well-explained refractive anomalies in the atmosphere,
  such as those that have been discussed by Minnaert, but good UFO observations are so much more numerous than those
  types of rare anomalies that it is quite out of the question of explain the former by the latter. </p>
<p>
  Sundogs, or parhelia, are a quite well-understood phenomenon of meteorological optics. Retractions of the sun's rays
  on horizontally falling tabular ice crystals produce fuzzy, brownish-colored luminous spots at about 22 degrees to the
  left and right of the sun when suitable ice-crystal clouds are present. Rarer phenomena, produced by the moon rather
  than the sun, are termed paraselenae. Sundogs are relatively common, but it is probably true that many laymen are not
  really conscious of them as a distinct optical phenomenon. For this reason, it might seem sensible to suggest that
  some observers have been misled by thinking that sundogs were UFOs. However, anyone with the slightest knowledge of
  meteorological optics talking directly to such a witness would, within only a few moments of questioning, establish
  what was involved. Instead of dealing with anything like a sharp-edged "object", one would quickly find that the
  observer was describing a very vague spot of light which he saw to the left or right of the sun, probably very near
  the horizon. To blandly suggest, as Menzel has done, that Waldo Harris in the 10/2/61 sighting near Salt Lake City was
  fooled by a sundog is to ignore either all of the main features of the report or to ignore all of what is known about
  sundogs. </p>
<p>
  Undersuns, sub-suns, can be seen rather frequently when flying in jet aircraft at high altitudes. They are a
  reflection phenomenon produced by horizontally floating ice crystals, which reflect an image of the sun (or at night
  the moon) and can give surprisingly sharp solar images in still air where turbulence does not cause appreciable
  tilting of the ice crystals. Here again, it is probably true that many laymen may be sufficiently unaware of this
  optical phenomenon that they could be confused when they see one. But, as with sundogs, the stringent quantitative
  requirements on the location of this optical effect relative to the sun would permit any experienced investigator to
  quickly ascertain whether or not an undersun was involved in this specific sighting. The effect involves specular
  reflection of the sun's rays, whence the undersun is always seen at a negative angle of elevation in which the
  observer's line of sight to the undersun is just as far below the horizon as the sun momentarily lies above that same
  observer's horizon. Clearly, many of the UFO cases that have been cited in examples given above do not come anywhere
  near satisfying the angular requirements for an undersun. In my own experience, I have already come across two or
  three reports, out of thousands that I have examined, where I was led to suspect that the observer was fooled by an
  undersun. </p>
<p>
  "Reflections off clouds" have been referred to repeatedly in Menzel's writings, never with any quantitative discussion
  of precisely what he means. But the impression is clearly left that many observers have been and are continuing to be
  fooled by some kind of cloud-reflections. Aside from the above-described undersun, I am unaware of any
  "cloud-reflection phenomenon" that could produce anything remotely resembling a distinct object. Clouds of droplets or
  ice crystals do not provide a source of specular reflection (except in the case of horizontally-floating ice crystals
  observed from above with a bright luminary, such as sun or moon, in the distance—undersun). What Menzel could possibly
  have in mind when he talks loosely about such cloud reflections (and he does so in many different places in his
  books), I cannot imagine. </p>
<p>
  Inversions are invoked by Menzel, and in official evaluations, to account for certain UFO sightings. Inversions
  produced by radiational cooling or by atmospheric subsidence are relatively common meteorological phenomena. In some
  cases, quite sharp inversions with marked temperature differences in rather small vertical distances are known to
  occur. It is such inversion layers that are responsible for some of the most striking desert mirages of the looming
  type.</p>
<p>
  To experience a looming mirage, the observer's eye must be located in the atmospheric layer wherein the temperature
  anomalously increases with height (inversion layer), and the miraged target in the object-field must also lie in or
  near the inversion layer. Inversion layers are essentially horizontally, and the actually-encountered values of the
  inversion lapse rates are such that refraction anomalies are confined to very small departures from the horizontal, as
  noted above under remarks on mirages. All of these points are well-understood principles of meteorological optics.
  However, Menzel has attempted to account for such UFOs as Dr. Clyde Tombaugh saw overhead at Las Cruces in August 1949
  in terms of "inversion" refraction or reflection effects. Since I have discussed the quantitative unreasonableness of
  this contention elsewhere, I will not here elaborate the point, except to say that if inversions were capable of
  producing the optical disturbances that Menzel has assumed, astronomers would long since have given up any attempt to
  study the stars by looking at them through our atmosphere. Other atmospheric-optical anomalies have been adduced by
  Menzel in his UFO discussions. He has repeatedly suggested that layers of haze or mist cause remarkable enlargement of
  the apparent images of stars and planets. By enlargement, he makes very clear that he means radial enlargements in all
  directions such that the eye sees not a vertical streak of the sort well-known to astronomers as resulting from
  near-horizon refraction effects, but rather a circular image of very large angular size. Menzel even describes a
  sighting that he himself made, over Arctic regions in an Air Force aircraft, in which the image of Sirius was enlarged
  to an angular size of over ten minutes of arc (one-third of lunar diameter). I have discussed that sighting with a
  number of astronomers, and not one is aware of anything that has ever been seen by any astronomer that approximates
  such an instance. In fact, it would require such a peculiar axially-symmetric distribution of refractive index, which
  miraculously followed the speeding aircraft along as it moved through the atmosphere, that it seems quite hopeless to
  explain what Menzel has reported seeing in terms of refraction effects. </p>
<p>
  Since Dr. Menzel's writings on UFO's have evidently had, in some quarters, a marked effect on attitudes towards UFOs,
  I regard that effect as deleterious. If I felt that we were dealing here with just a slight difference of opinion
  about rather controversial scientific matters on the edge of present knowledge. I would withhold strong comment.
  However, I wish to say for the record, that I reward the majority of Dr. Menzels purported meteorological-optical UFO
  explanations as simply scientifically incorrect. I could, but shall not here, enlarge upon similar critique of
  official explanations that have invoked such arguments. </p>

  4. Anomalies de propagation radar</h4>
<p>
  In the past twenty years, there have been many instances in which unidentified objects have been tracked on radar,
  many of them with concurrent visual observations. Some examples have been cited above. It is always necessary to
  approach a radar unidentified with full knowledge of the numerous ways in which false returns can be produced on radar
  sets. The Physique of "ducting" or "trapping" is generally quite well understood. As with mirages, the allowed angle
  of elevation of the radar beam can only depart from zero by a few tens of minutes of arc for typically occurring
  inversions and humidity gradients. Ducting with beam angles in excess of a degree or so would require unheard of
  atmospheric temperature or humidity gradients. Care must be taken in interpreting that statement, since beam-angles
  have to be distinguished from angles of elevation of the beam axis. For the latter reason, a beam-axis elevation of,
  say, two degrees still involves emission of some radar energy at angles so low that some may be trapped, yielding
  "ground returns" despite the higher elevation of the axis. All such points are well described in an extensive
  literature of radar propagation Physique. </p>
<p>
  In addition to trapping and ground return effects, spurious returns can come from insects, birds, and atmospheric
  refractive-index anomalies that generate radar echoes termed "angels". These are low-intensity returns that no
  experienced operator would be likely to confuse with the strong return from an aircraft or ther large metallic
  object. </p>
<p>
  Also, other peculiar radar effects such as interference with other nearby sets, forward scatter from weak tropospheric
  discontinuities (see work of Atlas and others), and odd secondary reflections from ground targets need to be kept in
  mind. </p>
<p>
  When one analyzes some of the famous radar-tracking cases in the UFO literature, none of these propagation anomalies
  seem typical as accounting for the more interesting cases. (Several examples have already been discussed. (cases 32,
  35, 36, 37, 38, and 39).)
