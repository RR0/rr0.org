<h3><a id="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  I should like first to commend the House Committee on Science and Astronautics for recognizing the need for a closer
  look at scientific aspects of the long-standing puzzle of the Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). From time to time in
  the history of science, situations have arisen in which a problem of ultimately enormous importance went begging for
  adequate attention simply because that problem appeared to involve phenomena so far outside the current bounds of
  scientific knowledge that it was not even regarded as a legitimate subject of serious scientific concern. That is
  precisely the situation in which the UFO problem now lies. One of the principal results of my own recent intensive
  study of the UFO enigma is this: I have become convinced that the scientific community, not only in this country but
  throughout the world, has been casually ignoring as nonsense a matter of extraordinary scientific importance. The
  attention of your Committee can, and I hope will, aid greatly in correcting this situation. As you will note in the
  following, my own present opinion, based on two years of careful study, is that UFOs are probably extraterrestrial
  devices engaged in something that might very tentatively be termed "surveillance." </p>
<p>
  Si l'<a href="../../../../../../../../../../analyse/hypotheses/intelligence/HET/index.html">hypothèse
  extraterrestre</a> se révèle exacte (et je souligne que les éléments actuels ne pointent que dans cette direction mais
  ne peuvent être décrits comme constituant une <a href="../../../../../../../../../../analyse/Preuve.html">preuve</a>
  irréfutable), alors clairement les ovnis deviendront un problème scientifique de la plus haute priorité. Je pense que
  vous seriez d'accord que, même s'il y avait une chance infime de l'exactitude de cette <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../analyse/Hypothese.html">hypothèse</a>, les ovnis demanderaient la plus grande
  des attentions. En fait, cette chance semble à certains de nous loin d'être triviale. Nous partageons le point de vue

  programme scientifique national mais aussi par la poursuite de notre programme spatial entier, et puisque ce programme
  spatial a été attaché pendant des années au but dramatique de la recherche de la vie dans l'univers, je soumets que le
  sujet du Symposium d'aujourd'hui mérite éminemment votre attention. En fait, je dois dire, pour information, que je
  pense qu'aucun autre problème dans votre juridiction n'est d'une importance scientifique et nationale comparable. Ce
  sont des mots forts, et je les pèse. </p>
<p>
  In addition to your Committee responsibilities with respect to science and the aerospace programs, there is another
  still broader basis upon which it is highly appropriate that you now take up the UFO problem: Twenty years of public
  interest, public puzzlement, and even some public disquiet demand that we all push toward early clarification of this
  unparalleled scientific mystery. I hope that our session here today will prove a significant turning point, orienting
  new scientific efforts towards illumination of this scientific problem that has been with us for over 20 years.
</p>
<h3><a id="scope"></a>Portée et contexte de ces commentaires</h3>
<p>It has been suggested that I review for you my experiences in interviewing UFO witnesses here and abroad and that I
  discuss ways in which my professional experience in the field of atmospheric Physique and meteorology illuminates past
  and present attempts at accounting for UFO phenomena. To understand the basis of my comments, it may be helpful to
  note briefly the nature of my own studies on UFOs.
</p>
<p>
  I have had a moderate interest in the UFO problem for twenty years, much as have a scattering of other scientists. In
  southern Arizona, during the period 1956-66, I interviewed, on a generally rather random basis, witness in such local
  sightings as happened to come to my attention via press or personal communications. This experience taught me much
  about lay misinterpretations of observations of aircraft, planets, meteors, balloons, flares, and the like. The
  frequency with which laymen misconstrue phenomena associated with fireballs (meteors brighter than magnitude 5), led
  me to devote special study to meteor Physique; other topics in my own field of atmospheric Physique also drew my
  closer attention as a result of their bearing on various categories of UFO reports. This period of rather casual
  UFO-witness interviewing on a local basis proved mainly educational; yet on a few occasions I encountered witnesses of
  seemingly high credibility whose reports lay well outside any evident meteorological, astronomical, or other
  conventional bounds. Because I was quite unaware, before 1966, that those cases were, in fact, paralleled by
  astonishing numbers of comparable cases elsewhere in the U.S. and the rest of the world, they left me only moderately
  puzzled and mildly bothered, since I came upon relatively few impressive cases within the environs of Tucson in those
  dozen years of discursive study. I was aware of the work of non-official national investigative groups like NICAP
  (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) and APRO (Aerial Phenomena Research Organization) ; but
  lacking basis for detailed personal evaluation of their investigative methods, I simply did not take their
  publications very seriously. I was under other misimpressions, I found later, as to the nature of the official UFO
  program, but I shall not enlarge on this before this Committee. (I cite all of this here because I regard it relevant
  to an appreciation, by the Committee, of the way in which at least one scientist has developed his present strong
  concern for the UFO problem, after a prior period of some years of only mild interest.) Despite having interviewed a
  total of perhaps 150-200 Tucson-area witnesses prior to 1966 (75 of them in a single inconclusive case in 1958), I was
  far from overwhelmed with the importance of the UFO problem.
</p>
<p>
  A particular sighting incident in Tucson in early 1966, followed by the widely-publicized March, 1966, Michigan
  sightings (I, too, felt that the "swamp gas" explanation was quite absurd once I checked a few relevant points), led
  me finally to take certain steps to devote the coming summer vacation months to a much closer look at the UFO problem.
  Within only a few weeks in May and June of 1966, after taking a close look at the files and modes of operation of both
  private and official (i.e., Project Bluebook) UFO investigative programs, after seeing for the first time
  press-clipping files of (to me) astonishing bulk, covering innumerable intriguing cases I had never before heard of,
  and (above all) after the beginning of what became a long period of personal interviewing of key witnesses in
  important UFO cases, I rapidly altered my conception of the scientific importance of the UFO question. By mid-1966, I
  had already begun what became months of effort to arouse new interest and to generate new UFO investigative programs
  in various science agencies of the Federal government and in various scientific organizations. Now, two years later,
  with very much more background upon which to base an opinion, I find myself increasingly more concerned with what has
  happened during the past twenty years' neglect, by almost the entire scientific community, of a problem that appears
  to be one of extremely high order of scientific importance.</p>
<h3><a id="probnature"></a>La nature non conventionnelle de la problèmatique ovni</h3>
<p>
  To both laymen and scientists, the impressive progress that science has made towards understanding our total
  environment prompts doubt that there could be machine-like objects of entirely unconventional nature moving through
  our atmosphere, hovering over automobiles, power installations, cities, and the like, yet all the while going
  unnoticed by our body scientific. Such suggestions are hard to take seriously, and I assure you that, until I had
  taken a close look at the evidence. I did not take them seriously. We have managed to so let our preconceptions block
  serious consideration of the possibility that some form of alien technology is operating within our midst that we have
  succeeded in simply ignoring the facts. And we scientists have ignored the pleas of groups like NICAP and APRO, who
  have for years been stressing the remarkable nature of the UFO evidence. Abroad, science has reacted in precisely this
  same manner, ignoring as nonsensical the report-material gathered by private groups operating outside the main
  channels of science. I understand this neglect all too well; I was just one more of those scientists who almost
  ignored those facts, just one more of those scientists who was rather sure that such a situation really could not
  exist, one more citizen rather sure that official statements must be basically meaningful on the non-existence of any
  substantial evidence for the reality of UFOs. </p>
<p>
  The UFO problem is so unconventional, involves such improbable events, such inexplicable phenomenology, so defies
  ready explanation in terms of present-day scientific knowledge, has such a curiously elusive quality in many respects,
  that it is not surprising (given certain features in the past twenty years' handling of the problem) that scientists
  have not taken it very seriously. We scientists are, as a group, not too well-oriented towards taking up problems that
  lie, not just on the frontiers of our scientific knowledge, but far across some gulf whose very breadth cannot be
  properly estimated. These parenthetical remarks are made here to convey, in introductory manner, viewpoints that will
  probably prove to be correct when many more scientists begin to scrutinize this unprecedented and neglected problem.
  The UFO problem is, if anything, a highly unconventional problem. Hence, before reviewing my own investigations in
  detail, and before examining various proposed explanations lying within atmospheric Physique, it may be well to take
  note of some of the principal hypotheses that have been proposed. at one time or another, to account for UFOs.
</p>
<h3><a id="alterns"></a>Des hypothèses alternatives</h3>
<p>In seeking explanations for UFO reports, I like to weigh witness-accounts in terms of eight principal UFO hypotheses:
</p>
<ol><li>
  Hoaxes, fabrications, and frauds.</li>
  <li>Hallucination, mass hysteria, rumor phenomena.</li>
  <li>Lay misinterpretations of well-know physical phenomena (meteorological, astronomical, optical, aeronautical,
    etc.).</li>
  <li>Semi-secret advanced technology (new test vehicles, satellites, novel weapons, flares, re-entry phenomena,
    etc.).</li>
  <li>Poorly understood physical phenomena (rare atmospheric-electrical or atmospheric-electrical effects, unusual
    meteoric phenomena, natural or artificial plasmoids, etc.).</li>
  <li>Poorly understood psychological phenomena.</li>
  <li>Extraterrestrial devices of some surveillance nature.</li>
  <li>Spaceships bringing messengers of terrestrial salvation and occult truth. </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Because I have discussed elsewhere all of these hypotheses in some detail (Ref. 2), I shall here only very briefly
  comment on certain points. Hoaxes and fabrications do crop up, though in percentually [sic] far smaller numbers than
  many UFO scoffers seem to think. Some of the independent groups like APRO and NICAP have done good work in exposing
  certain of these. Although there has been a good deal of armchair-psychologizing about unstable UFO witnesses, with
  easy charges of hallucination and hysteria, such charges seem to have almost no bearing in the hundreds of cases I
  have now personally investigated. Misinterpreted natural phenomena (Hypothesis 3) do explain many sincerely-submitted
  UFO reports; but, as I shall elaborate below, efforts to explain away almost the entirety of all UFO incidents in such
  terms have been based on quite unacceptable reasoning. Almost no one any longer seriously proposes that the truly
  puzzling UFO reports of close-range sighting of what appear to be machines of some sort are chance sightings of secret
  test devices (ours or theirs) ; the reasons weighing against Hypothesis 4 are both obvious and numerous. That some
  still-not-understood physical phenomena of perhaps astronomical or meteorological nature can account for the UFO
  observations that have prompted some to speak in terms of extraterrestrial devices would hold some weight if it were
  true that we dealt therein only with reports of hazy, glowing masses comparable to, say, ball lightning or if we dealt
  only with fast-moving luminous bodies racing across the sky in meteoric fashion. Not so, as I shall enlarge upon
  below. Jumping to Hypothesis 6, it seems to receive little support from the many psychologists with whom I have
  managed to have discussions on this possibility; I do not omit it from consideration, but, as my own
  witness-interviewing has proceeded, I regard it with decreasing favor. As for Hypothesis 8, it can only be remarked
  that, in all of the extensive literature published in support thereof, practically none of it has enough ring of
  authenticity to warrant serious attention. A bizarre "literature" of pseudo-scientific discussion of communications
  between benign extraterrestrials bent on saving the better elements of humanity from some dire fate implicit in
  nuclear-weapons testing or other forms of environmental contamination is certainly obtrusive on any paperback stand.
  That "literature" has been one of the prime factors in discouraging serious scientists from looking into the UFO
  matter to the extent that might have led them to recognize quickly enough that cultism and wishful thinking have
  essentially nothing to do with the core of the UFO problem. Again, one must here criticize a good deal of armchair
  researching (done chiefly via the daily newspapers that enjoy feature-writing the antics of the more extreme of such
  groups). A disturbing number of prominent scientists have jumped all too easily, to the conclusion that only the nuts
  see UFOs. </p>
<p>
  The seventh hypothesis, that UFOs may be some form of extraterrestrial devices, origin and objective still unknown, is
  a hypothesis that has been seriously proposed by many investigators of the UFO problem. Although there seems to be
  some evidence that this hypothesis was first seriously considered within official investigative channels in 1948 (a
  year after the June 24,1947 sighting over Mt. Rainier that brought the UFO problem before the general public), the
  first open defense of that Hypothesis 7 to be based on any substantial volume of evidence was made by Keyhoe (Ref. 3)
  in about 1950. His subsequent writings, based on far more evidence than was available to him in 1950, have presented
  further arguments favoring an extraterrestrial origin of UFOs. Before I began an intensive examination of the UFO
  problem in 1966, I was disposed to strong doubt that the numerous cases discussed at length in Keyhoe's rather
  dramatically-written and dramatically-titled books (Ref. 4) could be real cases from real witnesses of any appreciable
  credibility. I had the same reaction to a 1956 book (Ref. 5) written by Ruppelt, an engineer in charge of the official
  investigations in the important 1951-3 period. Ruppelt did not go as far as Keyhoe in suggesting the extraterrestrial
  UFO hypothesis, but he left his readers little room for doubt that he leaned toward that hypothesis. I elaborate these
  two writers' viewpoints because, within the past month, I have had an opportunity to examine in detail a large amount
  of formerly classified official file material which substantiates to an almost alarming degree the authenticity and
  hence the scientific import of the case-material upon which Keyhoe and Ruppelt drew for much of their discussions of
  UFO history in the 1947-53 period (Refs. 6 and 7). One of these sources has just been published by NICAP (Ref. 7), and
  constitutes, in my opinion, an exceedingly valuable addition to the growing UFO literature. The defense of the
  extraterrestrial hypothesis by Keyhoe, and later many others (still not within what are conventionally regarded as
  scientific circles), has had little impact on the scientific community, which based its write-off of the UFO problem
  on press accounts and official assurances that careful investigations were turning up nothing that suggested phenomena
  beyond present scientific explanation. Hypothesis No. 7 has thus received short shrift from science to date. As one
  scientist who has gone to some effort to try to examine the facts, I say that this has been an egregious, if basically
  unwitting, scientific error -- an error that must be rectified with minimum further delay. On the basis of the
  evidence I have examined, and on the basis of my own weighing of alternative hypotheses (including some not listed
  above), I now regard Hypothesis 7 as the one most likely to prove correct. My scientific instincts lead me to hedge
  that prediction just to the extent of suggesting that if the UFOs are not of extramundane origin, then I suspect that
  they will prove to be something very much more bizarre, something of perhaps even greater scientific interest than
  extraterrestrial devices. </p>
<h3><a id="exper"></a>Des remarques sur INTERVIEWING EXPERIENCE AND TYPES OF UFO CASES ENCOUNTERED</h3>
<h4>Sources des cas traités </h4>
<p>
  Prior to 1966, I had interviewed about 150-200 persons reporting UFOs; since 1966, I have interviewed about 200-250
  more. The basis of my post-1966 interviewing has been quite different from the earlier period of interviewing of local
  witnesses, whose sightings I heard about essentially by chance. Almost all of my post-1966 interviews have been with
  witnesses in cases already investigated by one or more of the private UFO investigatory groups such as NICAP or APRO,
  or by the official investigative agency (Project Bluebook). Thus, after 1966, I was not dealing with a body of
  witnesses reporting Venus, fireballs, and aircraft strobe lights, because such cases are so easily recognizable that
  the groups whose prior checks I was taking advantage of had already culled out and rejected most of such irrelevant
  material. Many of the cases I checked were older cases, some over 20 years old. It was primarily the background work
  of the many independent investigatory groups here and in other parts of the world (especially the Australian area
  where I had an opportunity to interview about 80 witnesses) that made possible my dealing with that type of
  once-sifted data that yields up scientifically interesting information so quickly. I wish to put on record my
  indebtedness to these "dedicated amateurs", to use the astronomer's genial term; their contribution to the ultimate
  clarification of the UFO problem will become recognized as having been of basic importance, notwithstanding the scorn
  with which scientists have, on more than one occasion, dismissed their efforts. Although I cite only the larger of
  these groups (NICAP about 12,000 members, APRO about 8,000), there are many smaller groups here and abroad that have
  done a most commendable job on almost no resources. (Needless to add, there are other small groups whose concern is
  only with sensational and speculative aspects.) </p>
<h4>
  Some relevant witness-characteristics </h4>
<p>
  By frequently discussing my own interviewing experience with members of those non-official UFO groups whose past work
  has been so indispensable to my own studies, I have learned that most of my own reactions to the UFO witness-interview
  problem are shared by those investigators. The recurrent problem of securing unequivocal descriptions, the almost
  excruciating difficulty in securing meaningful estimates of angular size, angular elevation, and angular displacements
  from laymen, the inevitable variance of witness-descriptions of a shared observation, and other difficulties of
  non-instrumental observing are familiar to all who have investigated UFO reports. But so also are the impressions of
  widespread concern among UFO witnesses to avoid (rather than to seek) publicity over their sightings. The strong
  disinclination to make an open report of an observation of something the witness realizes is far outside the bounds of
  accepted experience crops up again and again. In my interviewing in 1947 sightings, done as a crosscheck on case
  material used in a very valuable recent publication by Bloecher (Ref. 8), I came to realize clearly for the first time
  that this reluctance was not something instilled by post-1947 scoffing at UFOs, but is part of a broadly disseminated
  attitude to discount the anomalous and the inexplicable, to be unwilling even to report what one has seen with his own
  eyes if it is well outside normal experience as currently accepted. I have heard fellow-scientists express dismay at
  the unscientific credulity with which the general public jumps to the conclusion that UFOs are spaceships. Those
  scientists have certainly not interviewed many UFO witnesses; for almost precisely the opposite attitude is
  overwhelmingly the characteristic response. In my Australian interviewing, I found the same uneasy feeling about
  openly reporting an observation of a well-defined UFO sighting, lest acquaintances think one "has gone round the
  bend." Investigators in still other parts of the world where modern scientific values dominate world-views have told
  me of encountering just this same witness-reluctance. The charge that UFO witnesses, as a group, are hyperexcitable
  types is entirely incorrect I would agree with the way Maj. Gen. John A. Samford, then Director of Air Force
  Intelligence, put it in a 1952 Pentagon press conference: "Credible observers have sighted relatively incredible
  objects." </p>
<p>
  Not only is the charge of notoriety-seeking wrong, not only is the charge of hyperexcitability quite inappropriate to
  the witnesses I have interviewed, but so also is the easy charge that they see an unusual aerial phenomenon and
  directly leap to some kind of "spaceship hypothesis." My experience in interviewing witnesses in the selected sample I
  have examined since 1966 is that the witness first attempts to fit the anomalous observation into some entirely
  conventional category. "I thought it must be an airplane." Or, "At first, I thought it was an auto-wrecker with its
  red light blinking." Or, "I thought it was a meteor -- until it stopped dead in midair," etc. Hynek has a very happy
  phrase for this very typical pattern of witness-response: he terms it "escalation of explanation", to denote the often
  rapid succession of increasingly more involved attempts to account for and to assimilate what is passing before the
  witness' eyes, almost invariably starting with an everyday interpretation, <i>not</i> with a spaceship hypothesis.
  Indeed, I probably react in a way characteristic of all UFO investigators; in those comparatively rare cases where the
  witness discloses that he immediately interpreted what he sighted as an extraterrestrial device, I back away from what
  is likely to be a most unprofitable interview. I repeat: such instances are really quite rare; most of the general
  population has soaked up a degree of scientific conventionalism that reflects the net result of decades, if not
  centuries of scientific shaping of our views. I might interject that the segment of the population drawn to Hypothesis
  8 above might be quick to jump to a spaceship interpretation on seeing something unusual in the sky, but, on the
  whole, those persons convinced of Hypothesis 8 are quite uninterested in observations, per se. Their conviction is
  firm without bothering about such things as observational matters. At least that is what I have sensed from such
  exposure as I have had to those who support Hypothesis 8 fervently. </p>
<h4>
  Crédibilité des témoins</h4>
<p>
  Evaluating credibility of witnesses is, of course, an ever-present problem at the present stage of UFO studies. Again,
  from discussions with other investigators, I have concluded that common sense and previous everyday experience with
  prevaricators and unreliable persons lead. each serious UFO investigator to evolve a set of criteria that do not
  differ much from those used in jury instructions in our courts (e.g. Federal Jury Instructions). It seems tedious to
  enlarge here on those obvious matters. One can be fooled, of course; but it would be rash indeed to suggest that the
  thousands of UFO reports now on record are simply a testimony to confabulation, as will be better argued by some of
  the cases to be recounted below. </p>
<h4>
  Fiabilité observationnelle des témoins</h4>
<p>
  Separate from credibility in the sense of trustworthiness and honesty is the question of the human being as a sensing
  system. Clearly, it is indispensable to be aware of psychophysical factors limiting visual discrimination, time
  estimation, distance estimation, angular estimation, etc. In dealing with the total sample of all observations which
  laymen <i>initially</i> label as UFOs, such factors play a large role in sorting out dubious cases. In the type of UFO
  reports that are of primary significance at present, close-range sightings of objects of large size moving at low
  velocities, or at rest, and in sight for many seconds rather than fractions of a second, all of these perceptual
  problems diminish in significance, though they can never be overlooked. </p>
<p>
  A frequent objection to serious consideration of UFO reports, made by skeptics who have done no first-hand case
  investigations, is based on the widely discrepant accounts known to be presented by trial-witnesses who have all been
  present at some incident. To be sure, the same kind of discrepancies emerge in multiple-witness UFO incidents. People
  differ as to directions, relative times, sizes, etc. But I believe it is not unfair to remark, as the basic rebuttal
  to this attack on UFO accounts, that a group of witnesses who see a street-corner automobile collision do not come to
  court and proceed, in turn, to describe the event as a rhinoceros ramming a baby carriage, or as an airplane exploding
  on impact with a nearby building. There are, it needs to be soberly remembered, quite reasonable bounds upon the
  variance of witness testimonies in such cases. Thus, when one finds a half-dozen persons all saying that they were a
  few hundred feet from a domed disk with no resemblance to any known aircraft, that it took off without a sound, and
  was gone from sight in five seconds, the almost inevitable variations in descriptions of distances, shape, secondary
  features, noises, and times cannot be allowed to discount, per se, the basically significant nature of their
  collective account. I have talked with a few scientists, especially some psychologists, whose puristic insistence on
  the miserable observing equipment with which the human species is cursed almost makes me wonder how they dare cross a
  busy traffic intersection. Some balance in evaluating witness perceptual limitations is surely called for in all of
  these situations. With that balance must go a healthy skepticism as to most of the finer details, unless agreed upon
  by several independent witnesses. There is no blinking that anecdotal data are less than ideal; but sometimes you have
  to go with what you've got. To make a beginning at UFO study has required scrutiny of such anecdotal data; the urgent
  need is to get on to something much better. </p>
<h4>
  Problème de la connaissance antérieure du phénomène ovni par les témoins</h4>
<p>
  In interviewing UFO witnesses, it is important to try to ascertain whether the witness was, prior to his reported
  sighting, familiar or unfamiliar with books and writings on UFOs. Although a strong degree of familiarity with the
  literature of UFOs does not negate witness testimony, it dictates caution. Anyone who has done a lot of interviewing
  at the local level, involving previously unsifted cases, will be familiar with occasional instances where the witness
  exhibited such an obvious enthusiasm for the UFO problem that prudence demanded rejection of his account. </p>
<p>
  However, in my own experience, a much more common reaction to questions concerning pre-sighting interest in UFO
  matters is some comment to the effect that the witness not only knew little about UFOs beyond what he'd happened to
  read in newspapers, but he was strongly disinclined to take the whole business seriously. The repetitiveness and yet
  the spontaneity with which witnesses of seeming high credibility make statements similar to, "I didn't believe there
  was anything to all the talk about UFOs until I actually saw this thing," is a notable feature of the
  interview-experience of all of the investigators with whom I have talked. Obviously, an intending prevaricator might
  seek to deceive his interrogator by inventing such an assertion ; but I can only say that suspicion of being so duped
  has not been aroused more than once or twice in all of the hundreds of witnesses I have interviewed. On the other
  hand, I suppose that. In several dozen instances, I have lost interest in a case because of a witness openly stressing
  his own prior and subsequent interest in the extraterrestrial hypothesis. </p>
<p>
  Occasionally one encounters witnesses for whom the chance of prior knowledge is so low as to be almost amusing. An
  Anglican missionary in New Guinea, Rev. N. E. G. Cruttwell (Ref. 9), who has done much interviewing of UFO witnesses
  in his area, has described testimony of natives who come down into the mission area from their highland home territory
  only when they are wallaby-hunting, natives who could not read UFO reports in any language of the world, yet who come
  around, in their descriptions of what they have seen, to the communications-shortcut of picking up a bowl or dish from
  a nearby table to suggest the shape they are seeking to describe in native tongue. Little chance of bias gained from
  reading magazines in a barber-chair in such instances. </p>
<h4>
  Types de récits d'ovnis of present interest </h4>
<p>
  The scope of the present statement precludes anything approaching an exhaustive listing of categories of UFO
  phenomena: much of what might be made clear at great length will have to be compressed into my remark that the
  scientific world at large is in for a shock when it becomes aware of the astonishing nature of the UFO phenomenon and
  its bewildering complexity. I make that terse comment well aware that it invites easy ridicule; but intellectual
  honesty demands that I make clear that my two years' study convinces me that in the UFO problem lie scientific and
  technological questions that will challenge the ability of the world's outstanding scientists to explain as soon as
  they start examining the facts. </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li type="a"><i>Lumières dans le ciel nocturne</i> -- ("DLs" comme les appele l'équipe du <a
      href="../../../../../../../../../../org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">NICAP</a>, sur la base de la profusion des
    signalements de "lumières damnables" meandering or hovering or racing across the night sky in unexplainable manner
    are one of the most common, yet one of the least useful and significant categories of UFO reports.) Ultimately, I
    think their significance could become scientifically very substantial when instrumental observing techniques are in
    wide use to monitor UFO movements. But there are many ways that observers can be misled by lights in the night sky,
    so I shall discuss below only such few cases as are of extremely unconventional nature and where the protocols of
    the observations are unusually strong.</li>
  <li type="a"><i>Close-range sighting's of wingless discs and cigar-shaped objects</i>. -- This category is far more
    interesting. Many are daytime sightings, many have been made by witnesses of quite high credibility. Structural
    details such as "ports" and "legs" (to use the terms the witnesses have adopted to suggest most closely what they
    think they have seen) are described in many instances. Lack of wings and lack of evident means of propulsion clearly
    rule out conventional aircraft and helicopters. Many are soundless, many move at such speeds and with such
    accelerations that they defy understanding in terms of present technology. It is to be understood that I speak here
    only of reports from what I regard as credible observers. </li>
  <li type="a"><i>Close-range nighttime sightings of glowing, hovering objects, often with blinking or pulsating
    discrete lights</i>. -- In these instances, distinct shape is not seen, evidently in many cases because of the
    brilliance of the lights. Less significant than those of the preceding category, these nonetheless cannot be
    accounted for in terms of any known vehicles. Frequently they are reported hovering over vehicles on the ground or
    following them. Sometimes they are reported hovering over structures, factories, power installations, and the like.
    Soundlessness is typical. Estimated sizes vary widely, over a range that I do not believe can be accounted for
    simply in terms of the known unreliability of distance and size estimates when one views an unknown object. </li>
  <li type="a"><i>Radar-tracked objects, sometimes seen visually simultaneously by observers on the ground or in the
    air</i>. -- In many of these cases, the clues to the non-conventional nature of the radar target is high speed
    (estimated at thousands of miles per hour in certain instances); in others, it is alternate motion and hovering; in
    still others, it has been the unconventional vertical motions that make the radar observations significant. Clearly,
    most important are those instances in which there was close agreement between the visual and the radar unknown.
    There are far more such cases than either scientists or public would guess. </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Those four categories do not exhaust the list by any means. But they constitute four commonly encountered categories
  that are of interest here. Examples will be found below. </p>
<h4>
  Question fréquemment rencontrées</h4>
<p>
  Comme l'a dit Mark Twain, <q>La foi est une grande chose, mais on peut douter qu'elle vous donne une éducation.</q>
</p>
<p>
  There are many questions that one encounters again and again from persons who have done no personal case-checking and
  who maintain a healthy skepticism about UFOs. Why don't pilots report these things if they are buzzing around in our
  skies? Why aren't they tracked on radar? Why don't our satellite and astronomical tracking systems get photos of UFOs?
  Why are they always seen in out-of-the way rural areas but never over large cities? Why don't large groups of people
  ever simultaneously see UFOs, instead of lone individuals? Why don't astronomers see them? Shouldn't UFOs occasionally
  crash and leave clear-cut physical evidence of their reality? Or shouldn't they at least leave some residual physical
  evidence in those alleged instances where the objects have landed? Shouldn't they affect radios and produce other
  electromagnetic effects at times? If UFOs are a product of some high civilization, wouldn't one expect something of
  the nature of inquisitive behavior, since innate curiosity must be a common denominator of anything we would call
  "Intelligence"? Why haven't they contacted us if they're from somewhere else in the universe and have been here for at
  least two decades? Is there any evidence of hostility or hazard? Are UFOs seen only in this country? Why didn't we see
  them before 1947, if they come from remote sources? And so on. </p>
<p>
  In the following sections, I shall show how some of these questions do have quite satisfactory answers, and how some
  of them still defy adequate rebuttal. I shall use mostly cases that I have personally investigated, but, in a few
  instances (clearly indicated), I shall draw upon cases which I have not directly checked but for which I regard the
  case-credentials as very strong. </p>
<h4>
  Useful source materials on UFO's </h4>
<p>
  Hoping that Committee staff personnel will be pursuing these matters further, I remark next on some of the more
  significant items in the UFO literature. All of these have been helpful in my own studies. </p>
<p>
  One of the outstanding UFO references (though little-known in scientific circles) is <i>The UFO Evidence</i>, edited
  by R. H. Hall and published by NICAP (Ref. 10). It summarizes about 750 UFO cases in the NICAP flies up to about 1964.
  I have cross-checked a sufficiently large sample of cases from this reference to have confidence in its generally very
  high reliability. A sequel volume, now in editorial preparation at NICAP, will cover the 1964-68 period. Reference 8,
  by Bloecher, is one of the few sources of extensive documentation (here primarily from national newspaper sources) of
  the large cluster of sightings in a period of just a few weeks in the summer of 1947; its study is essential to
  appreciation of the opening phases of the publicly recognized UFO problem. Reference 7 is another now-accessible
  source of extremely significant UFO documentation; it is unfortunate that no generally accessible version of Reference
  6 exists, though the Moss Subcommittee, through pleas of Dr. Leon Davidson, has managed to get it into a status of at
  least limited accessibility. I am indebted to Davidson for a recent opportunity to study it for details I missed when
  I saw it two years ago at Bluebook headquarters. </p>
<p>
  The 1956 book by Ruppelt (Ref. 8) is a source whose authenticity I have learned, through much personal cross-checking,
  is far higher than I surmised when I first read it a dozen years ago. It was for years difficult for me to believe
  that the case-material which he summarized could come from real cases. References 5 and 6, plus other sources, do,
  however, now attest to Ruppelt's generally high reliability. Similarly Keyhoe's books (Refs. 3 and 4) emerge as
  sources of UFO case material whose reliability far exceeds my own first estimates thereof. As a scientist, I would
  have been much more comfortable about Keyhoe's books had they been shorn of extensive direct quotes and suspenseful
  dramatizations; but I must stress that much checking on my part has convinced me that Keyhoe's reportorial accuracy
  was almost uniformly high. Scientists will tend to be put off by some of his scientific commentary, as well as by his
  style; but on UFO case material, his reliability must be recognized as impressive. (Perhaps it is well to insert here
  the general proviso that none of these sources, including myself, can be expected to be characterized by 100 per cent
  accuracy in a problem as intrinsically messy as the UFO problem; here I am trying to draw attention to sources whose
  reliability appears to be in the 90+% range.) </p>
<p>
  A useful collection of 160 UFO cases drawn from a wide variety of sources has been published by Olsen (Ref. 11), 32 of
  which he obtained directly from the official files of Project Bluebook, a feature of particular interest. A book
  devoted to a single short period of numerous UFO observations within a small geographic area, centering around an
  important sighting near Exeter, N.H., is Fuller's <i>Incident at Exeter</i> (Ref. 12). Having checked personally on a
  number of features of the main Sept. 3, 1965, sighting, and having checked indirectly on other aspects, I would
  describe Reference 12 as one of the significant source-items on UFOs. </p>
<p>
  Several books by the Lorenzens, organizers of APRO, the oldest continuing UFO investigating group in this country,
  contain valuable UFO reference material (Ref. 13). Through their writing, and especially through the APRO Bulletin,
  they have transmitted from South American sources numerous unusual sightings from that country. I have had almost no
  opportunity to cross-check those sightings, but am satisfied that some quite reliable sources are being drawn upon. An
  extremely unusual category of cases, those involving reports of humanoid occupants of landed UFOs, has been explored
  to a greater extent by APRO than by NICAP. Like NICAP, I have tended to skirt such cases on tactical grounds; the
  reports are bizarre, and the circumstances of all such sightings are automatically charged in a psychological sense
  not found in other types of close-range sightings of mere machine-like devices. Since I shall not take up below this
  occupant problem, let me add the comment that I do regard the total number of such seemingly reliable reports (well
  over a hundred came just from central France in the outstanding 1954 sighting wave in that country), far too great to
  brush aside. Expert psychological opinion is badly needed in assessing such reports (expert but not close-minded
  opinion). For the record, I should have to state that my interviewing results dispose me toward acceptance of the
  existence of humanoid occupants in some UFOs. I would not argue with those who say that this might be the single most
  important element of the entire UFO puzzle; I would only say that most of my efforts over the past two years, being
  aimed at arousing a new degree of scientific interest among my colleagues in the physical sciences, have led me to
  play down even the little that I do know about occupant sightings. One or two early attempts to touch upon that point
  within the time-limits of a one-hour colloquium taught me that one loses more than he gains in speaking briefly about
  UFO occupants. (Occupant sightings must be carefully distinguished from elaborate "contact-claims" with the Space
  Brothers;</p>
<p>
  I hold no brief at all for the latter in terms of my present knowledge and interviewing experience. But occupants
  there <i>seem</i> to be, and contact of a limited sort may well have occurred, according to certain of the reports. I
  do not regard myself as very well-informed on this point, and will say little more on this below.) </p>
<p>
  It is, of course, somewhat more difficult to assess the reliability of foreign UFO references. Michel (Ref. 13) has
  assembled a day-by-day account of the remarkable French UFO wave of the fall of 1954, translated into English by the
  staff of CSI (Civilian Saucer Intelligence) of New York City, a now-inactive but once very productive independent
  group. I have spoken with persons having first-hand knowledge of the French 1954 episode, and they attest to its
  astonishing nature. <i>Life</i> and <i>The New Yorker</i> published full contemporary accounts at the time of the 1954
  European wave. An earlier book by Michel (Ref. 14), also available in English, deals with a broader temporal and
  geographic range of European UFO sightings. A just-published account of about 70 UFO sightings that occurred within a
  relatively small area around Stoke-on-Trent, England, in the summer and fall of 1967 (Ref. 15) presents an unusual
  cross-section of sightings that appear to be well-documented. A number of foreign UFO journals are helpful sources of
  the steady flow of UFO reports from other parts of the world, but a cataloging will not be attempted here. Information
  on some of these, as well as on smaller American groups, can be found in the two important books by Vallee (Refs. 16
  and 17). </p>
<p>
  Information on pre-1947 UFO-type sightings form the subject of a recent study by Lore and Denault (Ref. 18). I shall
  return to this phase of the UFO problem below; I regard it as being of potentially very great significance, though
  there is need for far more scholarly and scientific research before much of it can be safely interpreted. Another
  source of sightings of which many may ultimately be found to fall within the presently understood category of UFO
  sightings is the writings of Charles Fort (Ref. 19). His curious books are often drawn upon for material on old
  sightings, but not often duly acknowledged for the mine of information they comprise. I am afraid that it has not been
  fashionable to take Fort seriously; it certainly took me some time to recognize that, mixed into his voluminous
  writings, is much that remains untapped for its scientific import. I cannot imagine any escalated program of research
  on the UFO program that would not have a subgroup studying Fortean reports documented from 19th century sources. </p>
<p>
  To close this brief compilation of useful UFO references, two recent commentaries (not primarily source-references) of
  merit may be cited, books by Stanton (Ref. 20) and by Young (Ref. 21). </p>
<p>
  Next, I examine a number of specific UFO cases that shed light on many of the recurrent questions of skeptical slant
  often raised against serious consideration of the UFO problem.

<h3><a id="pilots"></a>Pourquoi les pilotes ne voient-ils pas d'ovnis ?</h3>
<p>
  Cette question may come in just that form from personnes n'ayant essentiellement pas de connaissance de l'histoire des
  ovnis. Pour les autres qui savent bien qu'il y a eut "quelques" observations de pilotes, cela vient dans une forme
  modifiée , telle que, <q>Pourquoi est-ce que les pilotes de ligne et militaires ne voient-ils pas tout le temps des
  ovnis s'ils sont dans notre atmosphère ?</q> Comme réponse partielle, considérez les cas suivants (pour faciliter les
  références internes, je numéroterai l'ensemble des cas séquentiellement traités ici par la suite en détails).</p>
<h4>
  <a id="case01"></a>1. Cas 1. Boise (Idaho), 4 juillet 1947 </h4>
<p>
  Environ 1 semaine après l'observation maintenant fameuse du Mont Rainier par le pilote privé <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Kenneth Arnold</a>, un équipage de DC-3 de
  <em>United Air Lines</em> observa 2 formations séparées de disques sans ailes, peu après avoir décolé de Boise (Réfs.
  8, 10, 22, 28). J'ai localisé et interrogé le pilote, le capitaine <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../people/SmithEmilJ/index.html">Emil J. Smith</a>, aujourd'hui avec le bureau de
  New York de <em>United</em>. Il confirma la fiabilité des récits précédemment publiés. Le vol 105 de <em>United</em>
  avait quitté Boise à 21 h 04. A environ 8 mn dehors, en route pour Seattle, grossièrement au-desuss de Emmet (Idaho),
  le co-pilote Stevens, qui repéré le 1er des 2 groupes d'objets, alluma ses phares d'atterrissage avec l'impression
  initiale que les objets étaient d'autres appareils. Mais, en les étudiant à nouveau devant le ciel du crépuscule,
  Smith et Stevens réalisèrent bientôt que ni des ailes ni des dérives n'étaient visibles sur les 5 objets devant. Après
  avoir appelé une hotesse, afin d'avoir la confirmation d'un 3ème témoin, ils regardèrent la formation un peu plus
  longtemps, appelèrent la <a href="../../../../../../../../../../org/us/faa/CAA.html">CAA</a> de Ontario (Oregon) pour
  tenter d'avoir une confirmation du sol, et virent alors la formation foncer en avant et dispparaître à grande vitesse
  au large à l'Ouest.</p>
<p>
  Smith insista en me disant qu'il n'y avait là aucun phénomène nuageux pouvant les amener à faire une confusion et
  qu'ils observèrent ces objets suffisamment longtemps pour être assez certain qu'il n'étaient pas des appareils
  conventionnels. Ils semblaient <q>plats à la base, arrondis au sommet</q>, me dit-il, et il ajouta qu'il semblait y
  avoir une sorte de <q>rugosité</q> perceptible sur le sommet, bien qu'il ne put affiner cette description. Presque
  immédiatement aprèq qu'ils aient perdu de vue les 5 premiers, une 2nde formation de 4 (3 en ligne et un 4ème au large
  sur le côté) arrivèrent devant leur position, voyageant à nouveau vers l'Ouest mais à une altitude légèrement plus
  élevée que les 8000 pieds du DC-3. Ils passèrent rapidement hors de vue à l'Ouest à des vitesses qu'ils considérèrent
  bien au-delà des vitesses alors connues. Smith insista sur le fait qu'ils ne furent jamais certains des tailles et des
  distances, mais qu'ils avaient eut l'impression générale que ces appareils à l'apparence de disques étaient
  sensiblement plus grands que les appareils ordinaires. Smith insista sur le fait qu'il n'avait pas pris au sérieux les
  histoires des actualités de la semaine précédente qui inventèrent le terme depuis persistant de "soucoupe volante".
  Mais, après avoir vu ce total de 9 appareils non conventionnels, sans ailes et à haute vitesse le soir du 4/7/47, il
  devint bien plus intéressé par le sujet. Néanmoins, en parlant avec moi, il souligna qu'il ne spéculerait pas sur leur
  véritable nature ou origine. J'ai parlé avec le personnel de <em>United Air Lines</em> qui a connu Smith pendant des
  années et se porte garant de sa fiabilité complète. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- L'observation <em>United Air Lines</em> du 4/7/47 est d'un intérêt historique parce qu'elle a à
  l'évidence reçu bien plus de crédit que tout autre des 85 signalements d'ovnis publiés dans les récits de presse le 4
  juillet <a href="../../../../../../../4/7/index.html">1947</a> (voir Réf. 8). Même s'il ne s'agit pas de la plus
  impressionnate observation d'ovni par l'équipage d'un avion de ligne, elle est néanmoins significative. Elle a eut
  lieu par temps clair, s'est étalée sur un temps total estimé entre 10 et 12 mn, a été un cas avec des témoins
  multiples dont 2 observateurs expérimentés familiers des appareillages aériens, et a été faite au-dessus de l'échelle
  d'altitude de 1000 pieds (climb-out) ce qui, combiné au fait que les 9 objets ont été vus au-dessus de l'horizon,
  exclut complètement les phénomènes optiques comme une explication prête. Il est officiellement listé comme Non
  Identifié. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case02"></a>2. Cas 2. Montgomery (Alabama), 24 juillet 1948 </h4>
<p>
  Une autre observation fameuse d'avion de ligne des premières années est le <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../enquete/dossier/ChilesWhitted/index.html">cas de Chiles-Whitted</a> des <em>Eastern
  Airlines</em> (Refs. 3, 5, 6 , 10, 23, 24, 25, 26). An Eastern DC-3, en route from Houston to Atlanta, was flying at
  an altitude of about 5000 ft., near Montgomery at 2:45 a.m. The pilot, Capt. Clarence S. Chiles, and the co-pilot,
  John B. Whitted, both of whom now fly jets for Eastern, were experienced fliers (for example, Chiles then had 8500
  hours in the air, and both had wartime military flying duty behind them). I interviewed both Chiles and Whitted
  earlier this year to cross-check the many points of interests in this case. Space precludes a full account of all
  relevant details. </p>
<p>
  Chiles pointed out to me that they first saw the object coming out of a distant squall-line area which they were just
  reconnoitering. At first, they thought it was a jet, whose exhaust was somehow accounting for the advancing glow that
  had first caught their eyes. Coming almost directly at them at nearly their flight altitude, it passed off their
  starboard wing at a distance on which the two men could not closely agree: one felt it was under 1000 ft, the other
  put it at several times that. But both agreed, then and in my 1968 interview, that the object was some kind of
  vehicle. They saw no wings or empennage, but both were struck by a pair of rows of windows or some apparent openings
  from which there came a bright glow "<q>like burning magnesium</q>." The object had a pointed "nose", and from the
  nose to the rear along its underside there was a bluish glow. Out of the rear end came an orange-red exhaust or wake
  that extended back by about the same distance as the object's length. The two men agreed that its size approximated
  that of a B-29, though perhaps twice as thick. Their uncertainty as to true distance, of course, renders this only a
  rough impression. There is uncertainty in the record, and in their respective recollections, as to whether their DC-3
  was rocked by something like a wake. Perception of such an effect would have been masked by Chiles' spontaneous
  reaction of turning the DC-3 off to the left as the object came in on their right Both saw it pass aft of them and do
  an <i>abrupt pull-up</i>, but only Whitted, on the right side, saw the terminal phase in which the object disappeared
  after a short but fast vertical ascent By "disappeared", Whitted made clear to me that he meant just that; earlier
  interrogations evidently construed this to mean "disappeared aloft" or into the broken cloud deck that lay above them.
  Whitted said that was not so; the object vanished instantaneously after its sharp pull-up. (This is not an isolated
  instance of abrupt disappearance. Obviously I cannot account for such cases.)</p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- This case has been the subject of much comment over the years, and rightly so. Menzel (Ref. 24)
  first .proposed that this was a "mirage", but gave no basis for such an unreasonable interpretation. The large
  azimuth-change of the pilots' line of sight, the lack of any obvious light source to provide a basis for the rather
  detailed structure of what was seen, the sharp pull-up, and the high flight altitude involved all argue quite strongly
  against such a casual disposition of the case. In his second book, Menzel (Ref. 25) shifts to the explanation that
  they had obviously seen a meteor. A horizontally-moving fireball under a cloud-deck, at 5000 ft., exhibiting two rows
  of lights construed by experienced pilots as ports, and finally executing a most non-ballistic 90-degree sharp
  pull-up, is a strange fireball indeed. Menzel's 1963 explanation is even more objectionable, in that he implies, via a
  page of side-discussion, that the Eastern pilots had seen a fireball from the Delta Aquarid meteor stream. As I have
  pointed out elsewhere (Ref. 2), the radiant of that stream was well over 90 away from the origin point of the unknown
  object. Also, bright fireballs are, with only rare exceptions, not typical of meteor streams. The official explanation
  was shifted recently from "Unidentified" to "Meteor", following publication of Menzel's 1963 discussion (see Ref. 20,
  p. 88). </p>
<p>
  Wingless, cigar-shaped or "<q>rocket-shaped</q>" objects, some emitting glowing wakes, have been reported by other
  witnesses. Thus, Air Force Capt. Jack Puckett, flying near 4000 ft. over Tampa in a C-47 on August 1, 1946 (Ref. 10,
  p. 23), described seeing "<q>a long, cylindrical shape approximately twice the size of a B-29 with luminous
  portholes</q>", from the aft end of which there came a stream of fire as it flew near his aircraft. Puckett states
  that he, his copilot, Lt. H. F. Glass, and the flight engineer also saw it as it came into within an estimated 1000
  yards before veering off. Another somewhat similar airborne sighting, made on January 22, 1956 by TWA Flight Engineer
  Robert Mueller at night over New Orleans, is on record (Ref. 27). Still another similar sighting is the AAL case cited
  below (Sperry case). Again, over Truk Is., in the Pacific, a Feb. 6, 1953, mid-day sighting by a weather officer
  involved a bullet-shaped object without wings or tail (Ref. 7, Rept. No. 10). Finally, within an hour's time of the
  Chiles-Whitted sighting. Air Force ground personnel at Robins AFB, Georgia, saw a rocket-like object shoot overhead in
  a westerly direction (Refs. 3, 5, 10, 6). In none of these instances does a meteorological or astronomical explanation
  suffice to explain the sightings. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case03"></a>3. Cas 3. Sioux City, Iowa, 20 Janvier 1951</h4>
<p>
  Another of the many airline-crew sightings of highly unconventional aerial devices that I have personally checked was,
  like Cases 1 and 2, widely reported in the national press (for a day or two, and then forgotten like the rest). A
  check of weather data confirms that the night of 1/20/51 was clear and cold at Sioux City at the time that a
  Mid-Continent Airlines DC-3, piloted by Lawrence W. Vinther, was about to take off for Omaha and Kansas City, at 8:20
  p.m. CST. In the CAA control tower, John M. Williams had been noting an oddly manenvering light high in a westerly
  direction. Suddently the light abruptly accelerated, in a manner clearly precluding either meteoric or aircraft
  origin, so Williams alerted Vinther and his co-pilot, James F. Bachmeier. The incident has been discussed many times
  (Ref. 4,5, 10, and 28), but to check details of these reports, I searched for and finally located all three of the
  above-named men. Vinther and Bachmeier are now Braniff pilots, Williams is with the FAA in Sacramento. From them I
  confirmed the principal features of previous accounts and learned additional information too lengthy to recapitulate
  in full here. </p>
<p>
  The essential point to be emphasized is that, shortly after Vinther got his DC-3 airborne, under Williams'
  instructions to investigate the oddly-behaving light, the object executed a sudden dive and flew over the DC-3 at an
  estimated 200 ft. vertical clearance, passing aft and downward. Then a surprising maneuver unfolded. As Vinther
  described it to me, and as described in contemporary accounts, the object suddenly reversed course almost 180°,
  without slowing down or slewing, and was momentarily flying formation with their DC-3, off its port wing. (Vinther's
  dry comment to me was: <q>"This is something we don't see airplanes do."</q>) Vinther and Bachmeier agreed that the
  object was very big, perhaps somewhat larger than a B-29, they suggested to newspapermen who interviewed them the
  following day. Moonlight gave them a good silhouetted view of the object, which they described as having the form of a
  fuselage and unswept wing, but not a sign of any empennage, nor any sign of engine-pods, propellers, or jets. Prior to
  its dive, it had been seen only as a light; while pacing their DC-3, the men saw no luminosity, though during the dive
  they saw a light on its underside. After about five seconds, the unknown object began to descend below them and flew
  under their plane. They put the DC-3 into a steep bank to try to keep it in view as it began this maneuver; and as it
  crossed under them, they lost it, not to regain sight of it subsequently. </p>
<p>
  There is much more detail, not all mutually consistent as to maneuvers and directions, in the full accounts I obtained
  from Vinther, Bachmeier, and Williams. The dive, pacing, and fly-under maneuvers were made quickly and at such a
  distance from the field that Williams did not see them clearly, though he did see the object leave the vicinity of the
  DC-3. An Air Force colonel and his aide were among the passengers, and the aide caught a glimpse of the unknown
  object, but I have been unable to locate him for further cross-check. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- The erratic maneuvers exhibited by the unknown object while under observation from the control
  tower would, by themselves, make this a better-than-average case. But the fact that those maneuvers prompted a tower
  operator to alert a departing aircrew to investigate, only to have the object dive upon and pace the aircraft after a
  non-inertial course-reversal, makes this an unusually interesting UFO. Its configuration, about which Vinther and
  Bachmeier were quite positive in their remarks to me (they repeatedly emphasized the bright moonlight, which checks
  with the near-full moon on 1/20/51 and the sky-cover data I obtained from the Sioux City Weather Bureau), combines
  with other features of the sighting to make it a most significant case. The reported shape (tailless, engineless,
  unswept aircraft of large size) does not match that of any other UFO that I am aware of; but my exposure to the
  bewildering range of reported configurations now on record makes this point less difficult to assimilate. This case is
  officially carried as Unidentified, and, in a 1958 publication (Ref. 29), was one of 12 Unidentifieds singled out for
  special comment. A contemporary account (Ref. 28), taking note of a then recent pronouncement that virtually all UFOs
  are explainable in terms of misidentified Skyhook balloons, carried a lead-caption. <q>"The <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../org/us/dod/navy/onr/index.html">Office of Naval Research</a> claims that cosmic
  ray
  balloons explain all saucer reports. If so, what did this pilot see?"</q> Certainly it would not be readily explained
  away as a balloon, a meteor, a sundog, or ball lighting. Rather, it seems to be just one more of thousands of
  Unidentified Flying Objects for which we have no present explanations because we have laughed such reports out of
  scientific court. Bachmeier stated to me that, at the time, he felt it had to be some kind of secret device, but, in
  the ensuing 17 years, we have not heard of any aircraft that can execute instantaneous course-reversal. Vinther's
  comment to me on a final question I asked as to what he thinks, in general, about the many airline-pilot sightings of
  unidentified objects over the past 20 years, was : <q>Nous n'avons pas des hallucinations. </q></p>

  <a id="case04"></a>4. Cas 4. Minneapolis (Minnesota), 11 Octobre 1951</h4>
<p>
  Il y a bien plus de pilotes privés que de pilotes de ligne, et il n'est donc pas surprenant qu'il y ait plus
  d'observations d'ovnis de la part des premiers que des derniers. Un ingénieur et ancien pilote de P-38 de la Force
  Aérienne, Joseph J. Kaliszewski, volant pour le <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../org/us/dod/navy/projet/skyhook/index.html">programme de ballon Skyhook</a> de
  General Mills sur des missions de suivi de ballon, observa des objets non-conventionnels en 2 jours successifs en
  octobre <a href="../../../../../../../5/1/index.html">1951</a> (réfs. 5, 7, 10). Les 2 furent signalées via les canaux
  de la compagnie à l'agence enquêtrice officielle (<a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Bluebook</a>), dont le rapport (réf. 7)
  décrit les témoins comme <q>très crédibles</q> et comme des <q>observateurs expérimentés de ballon en haute
  altitude</q>. Le 10 octobre, à environ 10 h 10, Kaliszewski et Jack Donaghue se trouvaient à 6000 ft pieds dans leur

  interrogé Kaliszewski, il m'a confirmé que cet objet <q>avait une leur particulière sur lui, traversant derrière et
  au-dessus de notre ballon d'Est en Ouest très rapidement, venant d'abord dans une légère plongée, leveling off for
  about a minute and slowing down, then into a sharp left turn and climbing at an angle of 50° to 60° into the southeast
  with a terrific acceleration.</q> The two observers had the object in view for an estimated two minutes, during which
  it crossed a span of some 45 of the sky. No vapor trail was seen, and Kaliszewski was emphatic in asserting that it
  was not a balloon, jet, or conventional aircraft. </p>
<p>
  The following morning, near 0630, Kaliszewski was flying on another balloon mission with Richard Reilly and, while
  airborne north of Minneapolis, the two of them noticed an odd object. Quoting from the account submitted to the
  official agency (Ref. 7, Rept. No. 2) : </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>"The object was moving from east to west at a high rate and very high. We tried keeping the ship on a constant
    course and using the reinforcing member of the windshield as a point. The object moved past this member at about 50
    degrees per second. This object was peculiar in that it had what can be described as a halo around it with a dark
    undersurface. It crossed rapidly and then slowed down and started to climb in lazy circles slowly. The pattern it
    made was like a falling oak leaf inverted. It went through these gyrations for a couple minutes and then with a very
    rapid acceleration disappeared to the east. This object Dick and I watched for approximately 5 mn.</q></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Shortly after, still another unknown object shot straight across the sky from west to east, but not before Kaliszewski
  succeeded in radioing theodolite observers at the University of Minnesota Airport. Two observers there (Douglas Smith,
  Richard Dorian) got fleeting glimpses of what appeared to them to be a cigar-shaped object viewed through the
  theodolite, but could not keep it in view due to its fast angular motion. In my conversations with Kaliszewski about
  these sightings, I gained the impression of talking with a careful observer, in full accord with impressions held by
  three other independent sources, including Air Force investigators. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i> -- The October 10 sighting is officially categorized as "Aircraft," the October 11 main sighting as
  "Unidentified." When I mentioned this to Kaliszewski, he was unable to understand how any distinction could be so
  drawn between the two sightings, both of which he felt matched no known aeronautical device. Clearly, objects
  performing such intricate maneuvers are not meteors, nor can they be fitted to any known meteorological explanations
  of which I am aware. Instead, these objects seem best described as devices well beyond the state of 1951 (or 1968)
  technology. </p>

  <a id="case05"></a> 5. Cas 5. Willow Grove (Pennsylvanie), 21 mai 1966 </h4>
<p>
  Skipping over many other pilot observations to a more recent one which I have personally checked, I call attention to
  a close-range airborne sighting of a domed-disc, seen under midday conditions by two observers. One of them, William
  O. Powell, of Radnor, Pa., is a pilot with 18,000 logged flight hours. He and a passenger. Miss Muriel McClave, were
  flying in Powell's Luscombe in the Philadelphia area on the afternoon of 5/21/66 when an object that had been first
  spotted as it apparently followed an outbound flight of Navy jets from Willow Grove NAS made a sharp (non-banking)
  turn and headed for Powell's plane on a near-collision course. As the object passed close by, at a distance that
  Powell put at roughly 100 yards, they both got a good look at the object. It was circular in planform and had no wings
  or visible means of propulsion, both witnesses emphasized to me in interviews. The upper domed portion they described
  as "<q>porcelain-white"</q>, while the lower discoid portion was bright red ("dayglow red" Powell put it). It was
  slightly below their altitude as it passed on their right, and Powell pointed out that it was entirely solid, for it
  obscured the distant horizon areas. His brief comment about its solidity and reality was, <q>"It was just like looking
  at a Cadillac."</q> He estimated its airspeed as perhaps 200 mph, and it moved in a steady, non-fluttering manner. He
  estimated its diameter at perhaps 20 feet. Miss McClave thought it might have been nearer 40 feet across. Each put the
  thickness-to-diameter ratio as about one-half. After it passed their starboard wing, Powell could see it only by
  looking back over his shoulder through a small aft window, but Miss McClave had it in full view when suddenly, she
  stated to me, it disappeared instantaneously, and they saw no more of it. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- Powell flies executive transports for a large Eastern firm, after years of military and airline
  duty. I have discussed the case with one of his superiors, who speaks without qualification for Powell's
  trustworthiness. At a UFO panel discussion held on April 22, 1967 at the annual meeting of the American Society of
  Newspaper Editors, Powell was asked to summarize his sighting. His account is in the proceedings of that session (Ref.
  30). I know of no natural phenomenon that could come close to explaining this sighting. The visibility was about 15
  miles, they were flying in the clear at 4500 ft., and the object passed nearby. A pilot with 18000 hours flight
  experience is not capable of precise midair distance and speed estimates, but his survival has probably hinged on not
  commonly making errors of much over a factor or two. Given the account and accepting its reliability, it seems
  necessary to say that here was one more case of what Gen. <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../people/SamfordJohnA/index.html">Samford</a> described as "<q>credible observers
  seeing relatively incredible objects"</q>. I felt that Powell's summary of his sighting at the ASNE meeting was
  particularly relevant because, in addition to my being on the panel there. Dr. <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../people/m/MenzelDonaldH/index.html">D. H. Menzel</a> et M. <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../people/KlassPhilipJ/index.html">Philip J. Klass</a>, both strong exponents of
  meteorological-type UFO theories, were present to hear his account. I cannot see how one could explain this incident
  in terms of meteorological optics nor in terms of ball lighting plasmoids. Here again, we appear to be dealing with a
  meaningful observation of some vehicle or craft of non-terrestrial origin. Its reported instantaneous disappearance
  defies (as does the same phenomenon reported by J. B. Whitted and numerous other UFO witnesses) ready explanation in
  terms of present-day scientific knowledge. Powell reported his sighting at Willow Grove NAS, but it engendered no
  interest. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case06"></a>Cas 6. Eastern Quebec, 29 juin 1954</h4>
<p>
  A case in which I have not been able to directly interview any witnesses, but about which a great deal is on record,
  through contemporary press accounts, through the pilot's subsequent report, and through recent interviews by BBC staff
  members, occurred near Seven Islands, Quebec, just after sunset on 6/29/54. A BOAC Stratocruiser, bound from New York
  to London with 51 passengers, was followed for 18 minutes (about 80 miles of airpath) by one large object and six
  smaller objects that flew curious "formations" about it. The pilot of the Stratocruiser was Capt. James Howard, a
  highly respected BOAC flight officer still flying with BOAC. At the time, he had had 7500 flight hours. About 20
  witnesses, including both passengers and crew, gave statements as to the unprecedented nature of these objects (Refs.
  4, 10, and Associated Press wire stories datelined June 30, 1954). </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- The flight was at 19000 ft in an area of generally fair weather, with good visibility, attested
  by Howard and by weather maps for that day. No obvious optical or electrical explanation seems capable of accounting
  for this long-duration sighting. The objects were dark, not glowing, and their position relative to the sunset point
  precludes sundogs as an explanation. Mirage phenomena could not account for the eighty-mile persistence, nor for the
  type of systematic shape-changes described by the witnesses, nor for the geometrically regular formations taken up by
  the satellite objects as they shifted positions from time to time. Just before an F-86 arrived from Goose AFB at
  Howard's request, First Officer Boyd and Navigator George Allen, who were watching the objects at that moment, said
  the small objects seemed to merge into the larger object. Then the large object receded rapidly towards the northwest
  and was out of sight in a matter of seconds. Such a maneuver of a number of satellite objects seeming to merge with or
  to enter a larger object has been reported in other UFO incidents around the world. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case07"></a>Cas 7. Goshen (Indiana), 21 avril 1950 </h4>
<p>
  Une autre des premières observations d'avion de ligne qui sembla worth personally cross-checking impliquait l'équipage
  et les passagers d'un <a href="../../../../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/aeronef/DC3.html">DC-3</a> de la TWA le
  soir du 27/4/<a href="../../../../../../../5/0/index.html">50</a> (Refs. 4, 5, 10, 23). J'ai interrogé le pilote, le
  capitaine <a href="../../../../../../../../../../enquete/dossier/Goshen/index.html">Robert Adickes</a> et le copilote,
  le capitaine Robert F. Manning, et confirmé l'ensemble des caractéristiques principales d'abord rapportées en détails
  dans un récit de magazine par <a href="../../../../../../../../../../people/k/KeyhoeDonaldE/index.html">Keyhoe</a> (<a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../Documents/Articles/true/bball.html">Ref. 31</a>). Le DC-3 se trouvait à environ
  2000 pieds, dirigé vers Chicago, lorsque, vers 20 h 25 environ, Manning repéra un objet rouge luisant à l'arrière de
  l'aile droite, bien à leur arrière. Manning m'envoya une copie des notes qu'il avait prises cette nuit-là à son hôtel
  de Chicago. Citation des notes :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <i><q>Son apparence était semblable à celle d'une Lune rouge sang en ascension, et cela semblait se rapprocher de
      nous à un rythme de convergence relativement lent. Je le regardais s'approcher pendant 2 mn environ, tentant de
      déterminer ce que ça pourrait être. J'ai alors attiré l'attention de Adickes sur l'objet en demandant ce qu'il
      pensait que c'était. Il appela notre hôtesse, Gloria Henshaw, et lui montra. A ce moment l'objet avait un
      roulement relatif de 100 ° environ et était légèrement plus lent que nous. C'était comme s'il maintenait sa
      position par rapport à nous, à environ 1/2 mile de distance.</q></i><q> </q></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Le récit de Manning note alors que le capitaine Adickes envoya l'hôtesse prévenir les passagers (voir <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../Documents/Articles/true/bball.html">le récit de Keyhoe</a>, Ref. 31), puis fit
  basculer le <a href="../../../../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/aeronef/DC3.html">DC-3</a> à tribord pour essayer
  de se rapprocher de l'objet inconnu. Manning poursuit dans ses notes du 27/4/<a
    href="../../../../../../../5/0/index.html">50</a> : </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <i><q>Alors que nous tournions, l'objet sembla virer loin de nous dans une direction juste à l'ouest du nord, vers
      la zone aéroportuaire de South Bend. Il sembla descendre alors qu'il augmentait sa vitesse, et en quelque minutes
      nous l'avions perdu de vue...</q></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i> -- Bien que, dans mon interview, j'aie trouvé des différences dans la forme de l'objet, telle que
  les 2 pilotes de la TWA s'en souvenaient, tous 2 était affirmatifs sur le fait qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'un <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/aeronef/index.html">appareil</a>, tous 2 insistèrent sur sa
  luminosité rouge, et tous 2 furent impressionnés par sa vitesse élevée de départ. Manning fit remarquer qu'il n'avait
  jamais rien vu de pareil avant ou depuis ; et il concéda, en réponse à ma demande, que le nombre décroissant de
  rapports d'ovnis par des avions de ligne ces dernières années vient probablement principalement de la réticence des
  pilotes à en faire des rapports. Lui comme Adickes, comme la plupart des autres pilotes que j'ai interrogés,
  indiquèrent ne pas être au courant de quelconques réglements empêchant de faire des signalements, cependant. J'ai
  mentionné à Adickes qu'il y a une indication indirecte dans 1 référence (Ref. 5) selon laquelle l'explication
  officielle de cette observation était <q>des reflets de hauts-fourneaux sur des nuages</q>. Il indiqua que c'était
  absolument hors de question. Il doit être noté que ici, comme dans de nombreuses autres observations de <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../people/pilotes.html">pilotes</a>, une limite supérieure, même si elle grossière,
  est imposée dans la gamme de l'inconnu en vertu d'une ligne de visée inclinée vers le bas. Dans de tels cas, les
  explications de <a href="../../../../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/rentree/meteore.html">météores</a> sont presque

<h4>
  <a id="case08"></a>Cas 8, Newport News (Virginie), 14 Juillet 1952 </h4>
<p>
  Another case in which experienced pilots viewed UFOs below them, and hence had helpful background-cues to distance and
  size, occurred near 8:12 p.m. BST, July 14, 1952. A Pan American DC-4, en route from New York to Miami, was at 8000 ft
  over Chesapeake Bay, northeast of Newport News, when its cockpit crew witnessed glowing, disc-shaped objects
  approaching them at a lower altitude (estimated at perhaps 2000 ft). First Officer Wm. B. Nash, at the controls for
  Capt. Koepke (who was not on the flight deck during the sighting) and Second Officer Wm. H. Fortenberry saw six
  amber-glowing objects come in at high velocity and execute a peculiar flipping maneuver during an acute-angle
  direction-change. Almost immediately after the first six reversed course, two other apparently identical discs shot in
  under the DC-4, joining the other six. I am omitting here certain other maneuver details of significance, since these
  are on record in many accounts (4, 5, 10, 11, 25). Although I have not interviewed Nash (now in Germany with PAA, and
  Fortenberry is deceased), I believe that there has never been any dispute as to the observed facts. Nash has stated to
  T. M. Olsen (author of Ref. 11) that one of the most accurate accounts of the facts has been given by Menzel (Ref.
  25), adding that Menzel's explanation seems entirely out of the question to him. A half-dozen witnesses on the ground
  also saw unknowns at that time, according to official investigators. </p>
<p>
  The objects had definite edges, and glowed "like hot coals", except when they blinked out, as they did in unison just
  after the first six were joined by the latter two. When the lights came back on, Nash and Fortenberry saw them
  climbing westward, eight in line, north of Newport News. The objects climbed above the altitude of the DC-4 and then
  blinked out in random order and were seen no more. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- Menzel explains this famous sighting as resulting from a searchlight playing on thin haze
  layers, an almost entirely ad hoc assumption, and one that will not account for the amber color, nor for the distinct
  edges, nor for the final climb-out of the objects. The rapid motion, abrupt course-reversal, and the change from
  negative to positive angles of elevation of the line of sight to the unknowns seem to preclude any
  meteorological-optical explanation, and there is, of course, no possibility of explaining cases like this in terms of
  bail lightning, meteors, balloons, or many of the other frequently adduced phenomena. Nash has stated that he feels
  these were "intelligently operated craft" This case is officially "Unidentified." </p>
<p>
  9. Many other pilot sightings, both recent and old, could readily be cited. Not only civilian pilots but dozens of
  military pilots have sighted wholly unconventional objects defying ready explanation (see esp. Ref. 10 and Ref. 7 for
  many such instances). Thus, the answer to the question, "Why don't pilots see UFOs?" is: "They do."</p>
<h3><a id="multiwit"></a>Pourquoi les ovnis sont-ils vu uniquement par des personnes seules ? Pourquoi pas des
  observations par plusieurs témoins ?
</h3>
<p>
  Il est vrai qu'il y a plus de signalements d'ovnis par des témoins seuls que de cas à plusieurs témoins. Mais, pour
  indiquer qu'en aucun cas tous les signalements intéressants d'ovnis nécessitent des témoins seuls, considérez les
  exemples suivants : </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case09"></a>Cas 9. Farmington (Nouveau Mexique), 17 mars 1950 </h4>
<p>
  In the course of checking this famous case that made short-lived press headlines in 1950, I interviewed seven
  Farmington witnesses out of a total that was contemporarily estimated at "hundreds" to "over a thousand." (Refs. 5,
  25) It became clear from my interviewing that the streets were full of residents looking up at the strange aerial
  display that day. It was not only a multiple-witness case, but also a multiple-object case. My checking was done
  seventeen years after the fact, so the somewhat confused recollective impressions I gained are not surprising. But
  that unidentified aerial objects moved in numbers over Farmington on 8/17/50 seems clear. One witness with whom I
  spoke, Clayton J. Boddy, estimated that he had observed a total of 20 to 30 disc-shaped objects, including one red one
  substantially larger than the others, moving at high velocity across the Farmington sky on the late morning of
  8/17/50. John Baton, a Farmington realtor, described being called out of a barber shop when the excitement began and
  seeing a high, fast object suddenly joined by many objects that darted after it. Baton sent me a copy of an account he
  had jotted down shortly after the incident A former Navy pilot. Baton put their height at perhaps 15,000 ft. "The
  object that has me puzzled was the one we saw that was definitely red. It was seen by several and stated by all to be
  red and traveling northeast at a terrific speed." Baton also spoke of the way the smaller objects would "turn and
  appear to be flat, then turn and appear to be round," a description matching an oscillating disc-shaped object. No one
  described seeing any wings or tails, and the emphasis upon the darting, "bee-like" motion was in several of the
  accounts I obtained from witnesses. I obtained more details, but the above must suffice here for a brief summary. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- This once-headlined, but now almost forgotten multiple-witness case has been explained as
  resulting from the breakup of a Skyhook balloon (Ref. 25). Skyhooks do shatter at the very low temperatures of the
  upper troposphere, and occasionally break into a number of smaller pieces. But to suggest that such fragments of
  transparent plastic at altitudes of the order of 40-50,000 ft. could be detected by the naked eye, and to intimate
  that these distant objects of low angular velocity could confuse dozens of persons into describing fast-moving
  disc-shaped objects (including a large red object) is simply not reasonable. However, to check further on this, I
  contacted first Holloman AFB and then the Office of Naval Research, who jointly hold records on all Alamogordo Skyhook
  releases. No Skyhooks or other experimental balloons had been released from the Holloman area or any other part of the
  country on or near the date of this incident. A suggestion that the witnesses were seeing only cotton-wisps was not
  only unreasonable, given the witness accounts, but was in fact tracked down by a local journalist to comments casually
  made by a law enforcement officer and overheard by another reporter. From my examination of this case, I see no ready
  explanation for the numerous disc-shaped objects moving in unconventional manner and seen by large numbers of
  Farmington residents on 3/17/50. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case10"></a>Cas 10. Longview (Washington), 3 juillet 1949 </h4>
<p>
  Nombre des cas d'ovnis que je cite sont drawn intentionnellement des premières années, afin d'illustrer que les
  preuves de l'existence d'un phénomène relativement réel et scientifiquement significatif sont avec nous depuis un
  nombre dérangeant d'années. Je discute pour la suite d'un cas au sujet duquel je détiens des copies d'éléments des
  dossiers d'enquête officiels, copies indiquant que cet incident fut <q>observé par 150 autres personnes à une
  exhibition aérienne</q>, en du témoin l'ayant signalé, Moulton B. Taylor. J'ai interrogé M. Taylor et obtenu de
  solides recommandations sur sa fiabilité de la part d'un ancien officier supérieur, l'amiral <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../people/FahrneyDelmerS.html">D. S. Fahrney</a>, sous les ordres duquel Taylor
  servit pour travailler sur les missiles guidés de la <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../org/us/dod/navy/index.html">Marine</a> avant l'incident. Taylor est un ingénieur
  en aéonautique, et fut responsable d'un aéroport à Longview, en charge d'une exhibition aérienne qui devait se tenir
  l'après-midi du 7/3/<a href="../../../../../../../4/9/index.html">49</a>, le jour de l'incident en question. Un
  skywriting Stearman se trouvait à 10000 pieds à 10 h 40, laying down "Air Show Today", and hence holding the attention
  of a number of the personnel already at the airport, when the first of three unidentified objects flew over at high
  altitude. Alerted by one of the persons who first spotted the object coining from the northwest, Taylor got on the
  public address system and announced to all persons at hand that they should look up to see the odd object. Many had
  binoculars, and among the over 150 persons present were police officers, city officials and a number of Longview's
  leading citizens, Taylor emphasized. The object was observed by a number of experienced pilots; and, according to
  official file summaries, all agreed that the object was shaped much like a discus. It seemed to have metallic luster
  and oscillated periodically as it crossed the sky from northwest to southeast until lost in mill-smoke. Taylor
  described the motion as a <q>"sculling or falling-leaf motion rather than a movement through the axis of the
  disc."</q> Its angular size he estimated as about that of a pinhead at arm's length, or about that of a DC-3 at 30,000
  ft., both of which come out to be near 10 mn of arc (one-third of moon's diameter).
</p>
<p>
  The crowd's attention to events in the sky did not lapse when the first object was lost from view, and, about nine
  minutes later, someone spotted a second object, whereupon the event was again announced via the public address system.
  Still a third object was brought to the attention of the crowd in the same manner at 11 h 25. The second object came
  out of the north, the third came from almost due west. In the third case, someone thought of timing the oscillation
  frequency (all three exhibited the same unconventional oscillation, with sun-glint perceptible in certain of the
  instances of tipping, Taylor mentioned). The oscillation frequency was clocked at 48 per minute. In the official
  report are height estimates and some disparate comments on color, etc., from several other witnesses, as well as
  remarks on other sightings in the same area on the same day. Full details cannot be recounted here, for reasons of
  space limitation. Taylor, in his statement submitted to official investigators, said: </p>
<p><q>"My experience in radio control of pilotless aircraft and guided missiles for the Navy at NAMU during the war, and
  over 20 years of aircraft study, does not permit my identification of the objects which were seen. They definitely
  were not balloons, birds, common aircraft, parachutes, stars, meteors, paper, clouds, or other common objects. They
  moved in a regular motion either straight or in curved lines. They were all at approximately the same altitude, but
  moved on different courses as indicated on the sketch. The oscillations were clearly visible and timed on the 3rd
  sighting ***." </q></p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- The official explanation for this case is "Balloons". I obtained information on upper winds over
  that part of Washington on that day (700 and 500 mb charts), and the flow aloft between 10000 and 20000 ft was from
  the southwest. The objects, all reported as about the same angular size, came from three distinctly different
  directions, all within a period of less than an hour. This immediately casts very strong doubt on the balloon
  hypothesis, as does the flipping motion, the sunglint, and, above all, the fact that no pilot balloon stations were
  located close upwind of Longview. Furthermore, a typical pilot balloon of about 1 meter diameter could be no higher
  than about 2500 ft altitude to subtend as large an angle as 10 minutes of arc. Taylor's report (official flies) gave
  transit times of 2-3 minutes for the unknowns to cross the Longview sky, and, during such a time interval, the normal
  ascent rate of a pilot balloon would carry it up by 1200-1800 ft. To then fit the angular-size requirements would
  clearly require that the balloons have been released at some nearby location, which fails to match known pibal-station
  locations at that time. Furthermore, surface winds were from the west, and winds a short distance above the ground
  were southwesterly, as indicated by pulp mill smoke-drift described in Taylor's report. This, plus the previously
  cited upper-flow directions, contradict the balloon hypothesis for all three directions of arrival, particularly those
  coming from north and northwest. To hypothesize that these were, say, Skyhook balloons coming from three different
  (unknown) sites, at three different high altitudes, but all so arranged that the apparent balloon diameter came out at
  about the same 10 minutes of arc each time is scarcely reasonable. In all, I can only regard the balloon explanation
  as untenable. </p>
<p>
  Disc-shaped objects have been sighted in dozens of instances, including Arnold's 6/24/47 Mt Rainier sighting. In many,
  though not all, the odd flipping or fluttering motion has been described by witnesses (Refs. 8, 10). What the
  dynamical significance of this might be is unclear. We know no more about this in 1968 than we knew in 1947, because
  such observations have been ignored as nonsense or misidentified balloons. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case11"></a>Cas 11. Salt Lake City (Utah), 3 Octobre 1961 </h4>
<p>
  A midday sighting of a lens-shaped object involving one airborne witness and seven witnesses on the ground became
  headline news in Salt Lake City (Ref. 32). Accounts of the incident have been summarized elsewhere (Refs. 2, 10, 13,
  25). A private pilot, Mr. Waldo J. Harris, was taking off on Runway 160 at Utah Central Airport at almost exactly noon
  on 10/2/61 when he noted what he at first idly viewed as a distant airplane. He noted it again in the same area just
  after becoming airborne, once more after gaining some altitude, and then became somewhat puzzled that it had not
  exhibited any appreciable change of position. About then it seemed to tilt, glinting in the noonday sun, and
  exhibiting a shape unlike any aircraft. To get a better view, Harris climbed towards the southeast and found himself
  at its altitude when he was somewhat above 6000 ft. By then it appeared as a biconvex metallic gray object, decidedly
  different from conventional aircraft, so he radioed back to the airport, where eventually seven persons were taking
  turns viewing it with binoculars. I have interviewed not only Harris, but also Jay W. Galbraith, operator of the
  airport, who, with his wife, watched the object, and Robert G. Butler, another of those at the airport. As Harris
  attempted to close in, he got to a minimal distance that he thought might have been approximately two or three miles
  from the object, when it abruptly rose vertically by about 1000 ft, a maneuver confirmed by the ground witnesses. They
  indicated to me that it took only a second or perhaps less to ascend. Just before the abrupt rise, Harris had been
  viewing the object on an essentially dead-level line of sight, with distant Mt. Nebo behind it, a significant feature
  of the case, as will be brought out in a moment. </p>
<p>
  Before Harris could close his distance much more, the object began moving off to the southeast at a speed well above
  his light-plane top speed. It was soon an estimated ten miles or so away, but Harris continued his attempt to close.
  However, after seeming to hover a short time in its new location, it began rising and moving westward, at an extremely
  rapid speed, and passed out of sight aloft to the southwest in only a few seconds. Some, but not all of the ground
  witnesses, observed this final fast climb-out, I was told. Military jets were called, but the object had gone before
  they arrived. </p>
<p>
  Both Harris and the ground observers using binoculars attested to lack of wings or tail, and to the biconvex side
  view. Harris said he had the impression its surface resembled "<q>sand-blasted aluminum</q>," but his closest view was
  about 2-3 miles away, and its estimated size was put at about 50-60 ft diameter (and only a tenth as thick), so the
  impression of surface texture must be regarded as uncertain. All witnesses confirmed that the object "wobbled" during
  its hovering. Jay Galbraith said that, when Harris' Mooney Mark 20A was only a speck, they could see the disc rather
  easily by naked eye, suggesting that its size may have been substantially larger than Harris' estimated 50 ft.
  Galbraith's recollection of its final departure was that it climbed at a very steep angle, perhaps within about 20 of
  the vertical, he thought. Butler also recalled the final departure and stressed that it was a surprisingly steep
  climb-out, quite beyond any known jet speed. All remarked on 10/2/61 being a beautifully clear day. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- Once again we deal with observed performance characteristics far beyond anything of which we
  have present knowledge: a wingless device that can hover, shoot straight up, and move fast enough to pass out of sight
  in a matter of a few seconds does not correspond to any known terrestrial craft. The official explanation was
  originally that Harris saw Venus. From astronomical data, one finds that Venus was in the Utah sky at noon in early
  October, but lay in the southwest, whereas everyone's line of sight to the object lay to the southeast. Furthermore,
  Harris' statement that at one stage he viewed the disc against a distant mountain would contradict such an
  explanation. Finally, it is well known to astronomers that Venus, even at peak brilliance, is not very easily spotted
  in daytime, whereas he had no difficulty relocating it repeatedly as he flew. Menzel (Ref. 25) proposed that it was
  merely a sundog that Harris and the others were observing, and this was subsequently adopted as the official
  explanation. But sundogs (parhelia), for well-known reasons, occur at elevation angles equal to or slightly greater
  than the sun, which lay about 40° above the southern horizon at noon in Salt Lake that day. Such a solar position
  would imply that a sundog might have lain to the southeast (22° to the left of the sun), but at an elevation angle
  that completely fails to match Harris' dead-level viewing (against a distant mountain, to further embarrass the sundog
  hypothesis). </p>
<p>
  Finally, to check the witness' statements about cloud-free skies. I checked with the Salt Lake City Weather Bureau
  office, and their logs showed completely clear skies and 40 miles visibility. Sundogs cannot occur without ice crystal
  clouds present. The only weather balloon released that morning was sent up at 10 h 00 ; but in any event, one would
  have to write off almost all of the observed details to propose that this incident was a misinterpretation of a
  weather balloon. As I see it the 10/2/61 Salt Lake City sighting is just one more of the hundreds of very
  well-observed cases of machine-like craft exhibiting "flight performance" far beyond the state and present-day
  technology. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case12"></a>Cas 12. Larson AFB, Moses Lake (Washington), 8 Janvier 1953 </h4>
<p>
  NICAP's recent publication of long-inaccessible official report-summaries (Ref. 7) makes readily available to
  interested scientists a large number of fascinating UFO reports. Many are in the multiple-witness category. For
  example, the dawn (0715 PST) sighting at Larson AFB where <i>"over sixty varied military and civilian sources observed
  one green disc-shaped object. The observations continued for fifteen minutes during which time the object moved in a
  southwesterly direction while bobbing vertically and going sideways. There was no</i> <i>sound. An F-84 aircraft was
  scrambled but a thirty minute search of the area produced negative intercept results."</i></p>
<p>
  The official summary also notes that the "winds were generally from 240° below an overcast at 13000 ft. Thus the
  object would appear to move against the wind since it must have been below the clouds. There was no air traffic
  reported in the area." </p>
<p>
  No radar sites in the area had unusual returns or activity, according to the same report. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- This green disc, moving against the wind below an overcast and seen by over sixty witnesses, is
  an official Unidentified. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case13"></a>Cas 13. Savannah River A.E.C Plant, Eté 1952 </h4>
<p>
  A rather illuminating multiple-witness case was called to my attention by John A. Anderson, now at Sandia Base, New
  Mexico, but in 1952 working as a young engineer in the Savannah River AEC facility near Aiken, S.C. After a
  considerable amount of cross-checking on the part of both Anderson and myself, the date was inferred to be late July,
  1952, probably 7/19/52. The circumstance giving a clue to the date was that, at about 10:00 a.m. on the day in
  question, Anderson, along with what he estimated at perhaps a hundred other engineers, scientists and technicians from
  his group were outside watching a "required attendance" skit presented from a truck-trailer and commemorating the
  150th anniversary of the founding of the DuPont company, July 18, 1802. Anderson indicated that some less than
  absorbed in the skit first spotted the unidentified object in the clear skies overhead, and soon most eyes had left
  the skit to watch more technically intriguing events overhead. A greenish glowing object of no discernible shape, and
  of angular size estimated by Anderson to be not over a fifth of full-moon diameter, was darting back and forth
  erratically at very high speed. Anderson had the impression it was at great altitude, but conceded that perhaps
  nothing but the complete lack of sound yielded that impression. It was in view for about two minutes, moving at all
  times. He stressed its "phenomenal maneuverability"; it repeatedly changed direction abruptly in sharp-angle manner,
  he stressed. The observation was terminated when the object disappeared over the horizon "at apparently tremendous
  velocity." </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- Anderson said that the event was discussed among his group afterwards, and all agreed it could
  not possibly have been a conventional aircraft. He remarked that no one even thought of suggesting the unreasonable
  notion that it was an hallucination or illusion. Despite searching local papers for some days thereafter, not a word
  of this sighting was published, and no further information or comment on it came from within the very
  security-conscious AEC plant. He was unaware of any official report. </p>
<p>
  Months after hearing of this from Anderson, in one of my numerous rereadings of Ruppelt's book (Ref. 5), I came across
  a single sentence in which Ruppelt, referring to the high concentration of reports in the Southeast around September
  of 1952, states that: "Many of the reports came from people in the vicinity of the then new super-hush-hush AEC
  facility at Savannah River, Georgia." Whether one of those reports to the official investigative agency came from
  within Anderson's group or other Savannah River personnel on the 7/52 incident is unknown. If not, then we may have
  here a case where dozens of technically-trained personnel witnessed an entirely unexplainable aerial performance, yet
  reported nothing. Anderson knew of no report, and was unaware of any assembling of witness-information within his
  group, so the evidence points in the direction that this event may have gone unreported. If, as Anderson is inclined
  to think, this event was on July 19, 1952, it occurred only about twelve hours before the famous Washington National
  Airport radar-visual sightings; but this date remains uncertain. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case14"></a>Cas 14. Trinidad (Colorado), 23 Mars 1966</h4>
<p>
  A daytime sighting by at least a dozen persons, in several parts of town, occurred near 5:00 p.m. on 3/23/66 in
  Trinidad, Colo. Following up a report in the APRO Bulletin on this interesting case, I eventually interviewed ten
  witnesses (seven children of average age near 12, and five adults). This case came just a few days after the famous
  "swamp gas" UFO incidents in southern Michigan, which made headline news all over the country. As APRO noted in its
  account, the Trinidad case seems in several respects a distinctly better case, yet went essentially unnoted outside of
  Trinidad. (Press reporting of UFO sightings leaves very much to be desired; I concur in the cited APRO comment.
  However, press shortcomings in the UFO area are only secondary factors in the long failure to get this matter out into
  the open.) </p>
<p>
  The witness-variance that skeptics like to cite is fairly well illustrated in the results of my ten interviews. I wish
  space permitted a full exposition of what each witness told me, for it would not only attest to that well-known
  variance but would also illustrate the point made earlier, namely, that despite those bothersome differences in
  details, there nevertheless comes through a consistent core of information on observations of something that was of
  scientific interest. </p>
<p>
  Mrs. Frank R. Hoch paid no attention when her son first tried to call her out to see something in the sky. Knowing it
  was kite season, dinner preparations took precedence, and she told the 10-year-old boy to go ride his bike. The second
  time he was more insistent, and she went outside to look. Two objects, domed on the top but nearly flat on the bottom,
  shaped like a cup upside down, having no rim or "sombrero brim", she said, were moving slowly westward from Fisher's
  Peak, which lies just south of Trinidad. Her son, Dean, told her he had seen three such objects when he tried to get
  her to come out earlier. (Mr. Louis DiPaolo, a Trinidad postman whom I interviewed, had also seen three objects.) </p>
<p>
  Interestingly, when Mrs. Hoch saw the objects, one was between her and the ridge, the other just above the low
  ridgeline. The ridge is about a half-mile from the Hoch residence. A photo of the ridge, with roughly-scaled objects
  sketched on it, suggests an angular diameter of perhaps a degree (object size of order 100 ft), in disagreement with
  her earlier angular estimates. It was clear that Mrs. Hoch was, as are most, unfamiliar with angular-size estimating.
  The objects, Mrs. Hoch said, moved up and down in a bobbing manner as they progressed slowly westward along the
  ridgeline. Occasionally they tilted, glinting in the late afternoon sun as if metallic. No sound was mentioned by any
  witness except one young boy whose attention was drawn to the object by a "ricocheting sound", as he put it. DiPaolo's
  observations were made with 7x35 binoculars; he also described the objects as metallic in appearance and shaped like a
  saucer upside down. His attention had been called to it by neighborhood boys playing outside. Mrs. Amelia Berry, in
  another part of Trinidad, evidently saw the objects somewhat earlier, when they were farther east, circling near
  Fisher's Peak, but she was uncertain of the precise time. She saw only two, and remarked that they seemed to
  "glitter", and she described them as "saucer shaped", "oblong and narrow". Mrs. J. R. Duran, horseback-riding with a
  12-year-old son on the opposite (north) side of town also saw two objects, "flat on the bottom, and domed on top,
  silvery", when her son called them to her attention. She described them as "floating along slowly, bobbing up and
  down, somewhat to the west of Fisher's Peak." She, like the other witnesses, was positive that these were not
  airplanes. No one described anything like wings or tail. A number of witnesses were so close that, had this been an
  unconventional helicopter, its engine-noise would have been unmistakable. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- Notwithstanding differences in the witness accounts (more of which would emerge from a more
  complete recounting), the common features of the observers' descriptions would seem to rule out known types of
  aircraft, astronomical, meteorological, and other explanations. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case15"></a>Cas 15, Redlands (Californie), 4 février 1968 </h4>
<p>
  Un cas encore plus récent de témoins multiples de grand intérêt fut bien documenté par 3 professeurs ed l'Université
  de Redlands peu après qu'il ait eut lieu le soir du 4 février <a href="../../../../../index.html">1968</a>. L'<a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../org/us/asso/apro/index.html">APRO</a> prévoit d'en faire un rapport de synthèse
  honnêtement détaillé. Le Dr. Philip Seff m'a gentiment envoyé une copie des témoignages que lui et ses collègues se
  sont assurés en interrogeant près de 20 parmi un total estimé à une centaine de témoins de cette observation à basse
  altitude dans une zone résidentielle de Redlands. Parce que je comprends que le Dr. <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../people/HarderJamesA/index.html">Harder</a> va fournir un rapport suffisamment
  détaillé de ce cas à votre Comité, je ne n'en donnerait qu'une version abrégée. A 19 h 20 de nombreuses personnes
  sortirent dehors pour comprendre l'origine de soit (a) l'aboiement inhabituel de chiens du voisinage, soit (b) un son
  dérangeant inhabituel. Rapidement de nombreuses personnes en haut et en bas de plusieurs rues observent un objet rond
  et planiforme, estimé à peut-être 50 ou 60 pieds de diamètre, se déplaçant lentement vers l'est-nord-est à une
  altitude placée par la plupart des témoins à peut-être 300 pieds. Des ouvertues ou panneaux luisants étaient disposés
  autour de son périmètre supérieur et des flammes rouges-orangées <q>semblables à celles de réacteurs</q> ou quelque
  chose ressemblant à des flammes émanait d'un certain nombre de sources sur la surface inférieure. Un certain nombre
  d'effets psysiologiques [sic] étranges furent remarqués par divers témoins, et les réactions animales furent une
  caractéristique notable de ce cas. L'objet à un moment monta brusquement de quelques centaines de pieds avant de
  poursuivre son mouvement quelque peu "saccadé" à l'est puis stationna un court moment et partit au loin avec une
  accéleration au nord-ouest.</p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- Le trio de l'Université de Redlands s'enquit d'une détection <a

  aérienne de March, à Riverside, et que le beam clearing intervening ridges ne pouvait détecter si bas une cible
  au-dessus de Redlands. Un aspect intéressant de la couverture des ovnis par la presse, un aspect très caractéristique,
  est illustré ici. Les articles locaux de la région de Redlands ne portaient que de courts morceaux de l'événement ;
  au-delà de cela aucune couverture de presse n'eut lieu, autant que j'ai été capable de m'en assurer.</p>
<p>
  A l'évidence même les câbles d'état ne rapportèrent par l'histoire (je pense que ce fait mérite d'être souligné avec
  force. One has to see national clipping-service coverage, drawing upon many small-town journaux, to gain even a dim
  glimpse du nombre étonnant de signalements d'ovnis ayant lieu steadily, mais restant non rapporté sur les câbles
  d'état et nationaux de sorte que personne hormis des enquêteurs très diligents sur les ovnis n'ait aucune appréciation
  de la véritable fréquence des observatiosn d'ovnis. Il ne s'agit pas de "calmer la presse", pas de censure ; les wire
  editors "savent" simplement qu'il n'y a rien dans tout de non sens sur les ovnis. Une histoire locale sera lancée
  juste pour son intérêt local, mais cet intérêt retombe rapidement avec la distance radiale au site d'observation).
  Ainsi, nous devons nous confronter à une situation, développée sur plus de 20 ans, dans laquelle plus d'une centaine
  de citoyens d'une ville d'environ 30 000 habitants peut voir une machine aérienne particulièrement non conventionnelle
  juste au-dessus d'eux et, pratiquement au moment où les chiens se sont arrêtés d'aboyer, la presse et les autorités ne
  sont pas intéressées ; le Dr. Seff m'a dit juste la semaine dernière avoir rencontré à l'Université de Redlands coed
  qui a vu l'objet (il ne l'avait pas interrogée auparavant), et elle semblait toujours terrifiée par l'incident. Je
  pense que votre comité doit reconnaître une obligation scientifique non remplie d'aller au fond de ces questions.</p>

<p>
  One cannot study the UFO problem long without being struck by the preponderance of reports that come from somewhat
  remote areas, non-urban areas. Similarly, one cannot escape the conclusion that more UFOs are reported at night than
  in day. For the latter, luminosity and its obvious effect on probability of chance visual detection may go far towards
  explaining the diurnal variation of UFO sightings (though I suspect that moat students of the problem would conclude
  that there is a real excess of nightttme occurrences for quite unknown reasons). Why, some ask with respect to the
  geographical distribution, don't the UFOs, if real and if extraterrestrial, spend most of their time looking over our
  cities? That's what we'd do, if we got to Mars and found huge urban complexes, some skeptics insist. </p>
<p>
  It is surprising to find scientists who do not see through the transparency of that homocentric fallacy. If it were
  true that we were under surveillance from some advanced civilization of extraterrestrial origin, the pattern of the
  observations, the motivation of the surveillance, and the degree of interest in one versus another aspect of our
  planet could be almost incomprehensible to us. Aboriginal natives under anthropological observation must find almost
  incomprehensible the motives behind the strange things that the field-teams do, the odd things in which they are
  interested. But the cultural and the intellectual gulf that would separate us from any intelligent beings commanding a
  technology so advanced that they could cross interplanetary or interstellar distances to inspect us would be a gulf
  vastly greater than that which separates a Harvard field-anthropologist from a New Guinea native. And, for this
  reason, I think one must concede that, within the argumentation carried out under tentative consideration of an
  extraterrestrial terrestrial hypothesis for UFOs, incomprehensibility must be expected as almost inevitable. Hence
  there is more whimsy than good reasoning in queries such as, "Why don't they land on the White House lawn and shake
  hands with the President?" </p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, the evidence affords a fairly definite answer to the skeptics' question, "Why aren't they ever seen over
  or in cities?" They are. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case16"> </a>Cas 16. New York City, 22 Novembre 1966 </h4>
<p>
  A report in a 1967 issue of the NICAP UFO Investigator (Ref. 33) reads as follows; </p>
<p>
  <q>"A UFO over the United Nations in New York City was reportedly seen on November 22, 1966. Witnesses included at
    least eight employees of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, who watched from their offices on the 11th
    floor of 750 Third Avenue at 4:20 p.m. on a bright, sunny day. The UFO was a rectangular, cushion-shaped object
    ...(which) came southward over the East River, then hovered over the UN Building ... It fluttered an bobbed like a
    ship on agitated water." </q></p>
<p>
  Witnesses mentioned were D. B. McVay, assistant general manager of ANPA and Mr. W. H. Leick, manager of the ANPA's
  Publications Department. I telephoned the ANPA offices and spoke at some length with Mr. Leick about the sighting. He
  confirmed that eight or nine persons went out on the 17th floor terrace, watching the object hover over the UN
  Building (as nearly as they could estimate) for a number of minutes as it rocked and reflected the sun's rays with a
  golden glint before rising and moving off eastward at high speed. I asked Leick if they reported it to any official
  channels, and he said that A. A. LaSalle called a New York office of the Air Force and was assured that an officer
  would be in the next day to interview them. But no one ever came. Leick added that they also phoned a New York
  newspaper "which shall go unnamed," but "they weren't interested." It got to NICAP almost by accident, and NICAP sent
  up their standard witness-questionnaires which Leick said they all filled out. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- When an incident such as this is cited to the skeptic who asks, "Why no UFOs near cities?", I
  find that his almost invariable retort is something like: "If that had really happened, why wouldn't hundreds to
  thousands of persons have reported it?" There are, I believe, two factors that explain the latter situation. First,
  consider the tiny fraction of persons on any city street whose vision is directed upwards at any given moment. In
  absence of loud noises aloft, most urbanites don't spend any large amount of time scanning the skies. In addition to
  infrequency of sky-scanning, another urban obstacle to UFO detection is typically restricted vision of the full dome
  of the sky; buildings or trees cut down the field of view in a way not so typical of the view afforded the farmer, the
  forest ranger, or a person driving in open country. Finally. In UFO studies, it is always necessary to draw sharp
  distinction between a "sighting" and a "report". The first becomes the second only if a witness takes the step of
  notifying a newspaper, a law-enforcement office, a university, or some official agency. It is abundantly clear, from
  the experience of UFO investigations in many parts of the world, that psychological factors centering around
  unwillingness to be ridiculed deter most witnesses from filing any official report on a very unusual event. Again and
  again one learns of a UFO sighting quite indirectly, from someone who knows someone who once mentioned that he'd seen
  something rather unusual. On following such leads, one frequently comes upon extremely significant sightings that were
  withheld from official reporting channels because of the "ridicule lid", as I like to term it, that imposes a filter
  screening out a large number of good sightings at their source. </p>
<p>
  Returning to the 11/22/66 New York City report, I must say that. between the information NICAP secured from the
  witnesses and my own direct conversations with Leick. I accept this as a quite real sighting, made by reliable
  observers under viewing circumstances that would seem to rule out obvious conventional explanations. When the object
  left its hovering location, it rose straight upward rapidly, before heading east, Leick said. Although he and his
  colleagues may well have erred in their slant-range estimate which put it over the UN Building, their description of
  its shape and its maneuvers would appear to rule out helicopters, aircraft, balloons, etc. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case17"></a>Cas 17. Hollywood (Californie), 5-6 Février 1960</h4>
<p>
  A still more striking instance in which entirely unconventional objects were observed by many city-dwellers, where
  low-altitude objects hovered and exhibited baffling phenomena, is a central Hollywood case that was rather carefully
  checked by LANS, the Los Angeles NICAP Subcommittee (Ref. 34). The two incidents occurred just after 11:00 p.m. on two
  successive nights, Friday 2/5/60 and Saturday 2/6/60, over or near the intersection of Sunset Blvd. and La Brea Ave.,
  <i>i.e.</i>, in the heart of downtown Hollywood. I have gone over the site area with one of the principal
  investigators of these incidents, Mrs. Idabel Epperson of LANS, have examined press accounts (Ref. 35) that dealt
  (very superficially) with the event, and have studied correspondence between the LANS investigators and official
  agencies concerning this case. The phenomenology is far too complex to report in full detail here; even the 21-page
  single-spaced LANS report was only a digest of results of all the NICAP witness-interviewing carried out to
  substantiate the events. The LANS report summarizes object-descriptions given by eight witnesses Friday night and
  eighteen witnesses Saturday night, several of them police officers. </p>
<p>
  Cars were stopped bumper-to-bumper, according to employees of several businesses on the Sunset-La Brea intersection in
  the midst of the main events, with people gaping at the object overhead. Persons on hotel and apartment rooftops were
  out looking at the bright "cherry-red, circular light" that figured in both incidents. On the two successive nights,
  the red object first appeared at about 11:15 p.m., and on both nights it stopped and hovered motionless for periods of
  about 10 minutes at a time. The angular estimates of the size of the red light varied, but seemed to suggest a value
  of one-fourth to one-third of the lunar diameter, say 5-10 minutes of arc. Almost all agreed that the light was
  sharp-edged rather than hazy or fuzzy. The usual witness-variances are exhibited in the total of about two dozen
  persons interviewed, e.g., some thought the light pulsated, others recalled it as steady, etc., but the common
  features, consistent throughout almost all the testimony, bespeak a quite unusual phenomenon. </p>
<p>
  On Friday night, the red light was first seen directly overhead at Sunset and La Brea. Two service-station attendants
  at that intersection, Jerry Darr and Charles Walker, described to LANS interviewers how, "... hundreds of people saw
  it -- everybody was looking" as the light hovered for at least five minutes over a busy drive-in there. Ken Meyer,
  another service station attendant a third of a mile to the north, estimated it hovered for about 10 minutes. Harold
  Sherman, his wife, and two others watched it in the later phases (also described by the above-cited witnesses) as it
  resumed motion very slowly eastward. After proceeding east for a distance that witnesses roughly estimated at a block
  or two, it veered southeastward and passed out of sight. (It is not clear whether it was occulted by buildings for
  some witnesses, or diminished in intensity, or actually passed off into the distance.) No sound was heard over
  street-noise background. </p>
<p>
  The following night, an object which appeared to be the same, to those several witnesses who saw both events, again
  showed up overhead, this time first seen about one block farther east than on Friday night. Triangulation based on
  estimates of angular elevations as seen from various locations was used to approximate the height above ground. LANS
  concluded that, when first seen, it lay about 500-600 ft. above the intersection of Sunset and Sycamore. A number of
  witnesses observed it hovering motionless in that position for about 10 minutes. Then a loud explosion and brilliant
  bluish-white flash was emitted by the object, the noise described by all witnesses as unlike any sonic boom or
  ordinary explosion they had ever heard. The sound alerted witnesses as far away as Curson and Hollywood Blvd., i.e.,
  Tom Burns and two friends who asked LANS interviewers not to use their names. Condensing very greatly here the
  descriptions given to the interviewers by independent witnesses who viewed the "explosion" from various locations
  scattered over a circle of about a 1-mile radius yields a summary-description as follows: What had, just before the
  explosion, looked much "like a big red Christmas ball hanging there in the sky", was suddenly the source of a flash
  that extended downward and to the west, lighting up the ground all around one interviewed (Soe Rosi) on La Brea Ave. A
  "mushroom-shaped cloud", with coloration that impressed all who saw it, emerged upward and soon dissipated.
  Concurrently, as the red light extinguished, an object described by most, but not all, witnesses as long and tubular
  shot upwards. Angular estimates implied an object a number of tens of feet long, 70 ft. from Harold Sherman's rough
  estimates. </p>
<p>
  Clearly, it is difficult to explain how an object of such size could have materialized from a light at 500 ft.
  elevation and subtending an angle of only 10 minutes of arc, unless it had been there all along, unseen because of the
  brilliance of the red light beneath it. Or perhaps the angular-size estimates are in error. Some witnesses followed
  only the tubular ascending object, others saw only something that "spiraled downwards" beneath the explosion source.
  No witness seemed certain of what it was that came down; some spoke of "glowing embers"; no one gave indication of
  following it to ground. </p>
<p>
  Glossing over other details bearing on this "explosion" at an estimated 5-600 ft above Sunset and Sycamore, witnesses
  next became aware that the just-extinguished red light had evidently reappeared in a new location, about a block to
  the west. Police officers Bay Lopez and Daniel Jaffee, of LAPD, located at the corner of Sunset and LaBrea, heard the
  explosion and looked up, seeing the light in its new location "directly overhead", as did many others at that
  intersection who then watched the red light hovering in its new location for about 3 minutes. (Space precludes my
  giving all pertinent information on time-estimates as set out in the 21-page LANS summary. For example, a good
  time-fix on the explosion came from the fact that E. W. Cass, a contractor living almost a mile west, was just winding
  his alarm clock, looking at it, when flare-like illumination "lit up the whole bedroom", just at the indicated time of
  11:30. He went out, watched the hovering red light in its new location, and added further details I shall omit here.
  Others took their time clues from the fact that 11:30 commercials had just come on TV when they heard the peculiar
  explosion and hastened outside to check, etc.) </p>
<p>
  The red light, now over Sunset and La Brea, was roughly triangulated at about 1000 ft up, a figure in accord with
  several witness comments that, when it re-appeared some 4-5 seconds after the "explosion", it lay not only somewhat
  west of its first location, but noticeably higher. After hovering there for a time inferred to be eight minutes, it
  began slowly drifting eastward, much as on the previous night when much less spectacular events had occurred. Larry
  Moquin, one witness who had taken rather careful alignment fixes using rooflines as an aid, remarked that, at this
  stage. La Brea and Sunset was filled with watchers: "Everybody was standing outside their cars looking up -- cars were
  backed up in the streets -- and everyone was asking each other, "What is it?" After moving slowly but steadily
  (observers mentioned absence of bobbing, weaving, or irregularity in its motion) for about a block east, to its first
  location it turned sharply towards the north-northeast, accelerated, and climbed steeply, not stopping again until at
  a very high altitude well to the north. From crude triangulation, LANS investigators inferred a new hovering altitude
  of over 25,000 ft, but it is clear from the data involved that this estimate is extremely rough. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- Although I have done no personal witness-interviewing to date in the 2/60 Hollywood case, I can
  vouch for the diligence and reliability with which the LANS group pursues its case-studies. The large number of
  interviews secured and the degree of consistency found therein seem to argue that some extremely unusual devices
  maneuvered over Hollywood on the two nights in question. Unless one simply rejects most of the salient features of the
  reports. it is quite clear that no meteorological or astronomical explanation is at all reasonable. Nor does any
  conventional aircraft match the reports. </p>
<p>
  The question that arises almost immediately is that of a practical joke, a hoax. However, the resources required to
  fabricate some device yielding the complex behavior (stop motionless, move against wind, explosively emit secondary
  devices, and finally, in the 2/6 event, climb to rather high altitude) would scarcely be available to college
  pranksters. The phenomena go so far beyond the gas-balloon level of hoaxing that one must have some much more
  elaborate hoax hypothesis to account for the reported events. Balloons must drift with the winds, and the LANS group
  secured the local upper-wind data for both nights, and there is no match between the reported motions and the winds in
  the surface-1000-ft layer. And, in any event, the alternation between hovering and moving, plus the distinct
  direction-shifts without change of apparent altitude, cannot be squared with balloon-drift. This would mean that some
  highly controlled device was involved, capable (in the 2/6 incident) of hovering in an almost precisely stationary
  position relative to the ground (Moquin sighted carefully, using structural objects to secure a fix when the red light
  lay right over La Brea and Sunset, and perceived no motion for many minutes). Yet the Weather Bureau was reporting 5
  mph winds from the southwest at 1000 ft (triangulated altitude when hovering there). Only if one hypothesized that
  this was an expensively elaborate experiment in psychological warfare could one account for financial resources needed
  to build a device capable of simulating some of these phenomena. Such a hypothesis seems quite unreasonable in the
  100-megaton age where ever-present realities of weaponry pose more psychological strains than Disney-like
  pyrotechnics.</p>
<p>
  In fact, UFO sightings with equally peculiar phenomenology are so much a part of the total record that this Hollywood
  incident is not as unparalleled as it might first seem. In Hobard, Tasmania, I interviewed an electrical engineer who,
  along with a fellow engineer also employed by the Tasmanian Hydroelectric Commission, observed phenomena occurring in
  broad daylight over and near the River Derwent at Risdon that have the same "absurd" nature that one meets in the
  Hollywood case. The wife of a Texas rancher described to me an incident she witnessed in Juarez, Mexico, with about
  the same absurdity-quotient. We simply do not understand what we are dealing with in these UFO phenomena; my present
  opinion is that we must simply concede that, in the Hollywood case, we are confronted with decidedly odd UFO
  phenomena, in a decidedly urban locale. </p>
<p>
  There appears to have been no official investigation of these striking events (Ref. 35), and local newspapers gave it
  only the briefest attention. In the New York City case cited above, the particulars were phoned to a large New York
  paper, but the paper was not interested, and no account was reported. Similarly in the 2/4/68 <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../enquete/dossier/Redlands/index.html">Redlands case</a>, the local papers felt it
  warranted only an extremely brief article. This pattern is repeated over and over again; newspapermen have been led to
  believe that UFOs are really no more than occasional feature-story material. On rare occasions, for reasons not too
  clear to students of the UFO problem, some one case like the Michigan incident of 1966 will command national headlines
  for a day or two and then be consigned to journalistic limbo. This, in company with scientific rejection of the
  problem, plus official positions on the matter have combined to keep the public almost entirely unaware of the real
  situation with respect to frequency and nature of UFO incidents. For emphasis, let me repeat that I do not see design
  in that, nothing I construe as any well-planned attempt to keep us all uninformed for some sinister or protective
  reason. The longer I reflect on the history of the past handling of the UFO problem, the more I can see how one thing
  led to another until we have reached the intolerable present situation that so urgently calls for change. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case18"></a>Cas 18. Baytown (Texas), 18 Juillet 1966</h4>
<p>
  Baytown, Texas, on Galveston Bay, has a population near 80,000. Several persons evidently saw an interesting object
  there at about 9:00 a.m. on 7/18/66. My original source on this case was an article that appeared in the 10/8/66 <i>Houston
  Post</i> from NICAP flies. The article, by Post reporter Jimmie Woods, represents one of those rare UFO feature
  stories in which fact is well blended with human interest, as I found when I subsequently interviewed one of the
  principal witnesses, W. T. Jackson, at whose service station he and assistant Kelly Dikeman made the sighting. Both
  were inside the station when Jackson spotted the object hovering motionless about 100 yards away. (The Post said 1000
  yards, but Jackson pointed out that Woods interviewed him while he was waiting on customers at the station and the
  reporter didn't get allot it correct.) </p>
<p>
  Jackson explained to me that the object "<q>lay right over the Dairy Queen.</q>" He described it as a white object
  that "looked like two saucers turned together with a row of square windows in between", and he thought it might have
  been 50 feet in diameter. He called Dikeman over, and they both looked at it for a few seconds and then simultaneously
  started for the door to get a better look. Almost at that moment it started moving westward. Dikeman was at the door
  before Jackson and had the last view of it as it passed over a water tower, beyond buildings and a refinery and was
  gone, "faster than any airplane." Jackson described it as pure white, and definitely not spinning, since he saw
  clearly the features that he termed "windows" Jackson kept the incident to himself for a time; when it got out, two
  nurses who were unwilling to give him their names because "they didn't want to be laughed at" stopped at his station
  and told him they had seen it from another part of Baytown. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- "Swamp gas" explanations were then still featured in press discussions of UFOs, and Jackson
  volunteered the comment that there are no swamps nearby and that it was "too high for any gas formations" he knew of.
  "It damned sure wasn't no fireball," Jackson told the <i>Post</i> reporter, and also commented, "Feller, when you set
  there and count the windows it ain't no damn reflection." I received similar salty commentary on various hypotheses
  when I spoke with Jackson. No sound was heard, yet, as Jackson put it, "if it had been any kind of jet, we'd have been
  deafened." As in many other cases, a distinctly machine-like configuration, definite outlines, secondary "structural"
  features here termed "windows", add up to a description that does not suggest any misinterpreted natural phenomenon.
  That it hovered within a city of moderate size with only a total of two declared and two other undeclared witnesses is
  not entirely difficult to understand when one has interviewed large numbers of witnesses for whom the likelihood of
  ridicule was an almost sufficient deterrent to open reporting. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case19"> </a>Cas 19. Portland (Oregon), 4 juillet 1947 </h4>
<p>
  Au cours du recoupement d'un échantillon des cas de <a href="../../../../../../../4/7/index.html">1947</a> qui
  allèrent dans l'étude de <a href="../../../../../../../../../../people/b/BloecherTed/index.html">Bloecher</a> (Réf.
  8), les nombreuses observations de jour dans le centre de Portland le 4 juillet <a
    href="../../../../../../../4/7/index.html">1947</a> semblèrent intéressantes à vérifier, en particulier parce que
  nombre des rapports vinrent de la police et de patrouilleurs du port. Ici encore, nous avons affaire à un cas pour
  lequel il y a tellement de détails pertinents disponibles que l'espace empêche un résumé adéquat (voir Réf. 8). J'ai
  parlé à l'adjoint du sheriff Fred Krives qui, avec plusieurs autres adjoints, a vu certains des nombreux objets
  au-dessus de Portland depuis le Palais de Justice à travers la Rivière Columbia à Vancouver, Washington. Krives s'est
  souvenu que plus d'une demi-douzaine d'adjoints étaient dehors à regarder ce qu'ils estimèrent être près de 20 objets
  en forme de disque en plusieurs sous-groupes fonçant à travers le ciel à une hauteur estimée de peut-être 1000 pieds,
  dirigés vers le sud-ouest. </p>
<p>
  A partir de récits de presse contemporaine et de mes propres vérifications, il est devenu évident que plus de 1
  formation de disques a volé au-dessus de Portland ce jour-là. Le capitaine de la patrouille portuaire K. A. Prehn, que
  j'ai retrouvé par téléphone, me dit qu'il avait été appelé dehors par un autre officier qui avait repété les objets se
  déplaçant au-dessus d'eux en direction du sud. Leur vitesse semblait comparable à celle d'un appareil, leurs
  silhouettes étaient plutôt précises, et ils avaient l'air métallique lorsqu'ils se reflétaient au Soleil. Ils
  vacillaient de temps en temps, et leur trajectoire semblait être légèrement irrégulière. D'autres officiers avec qui
  j'ai parlé ont vu des disques depuis d'autres parties de la zone de Portland ; un d'entre eux, l'officier Walter
  Lissy, souligna se souvenir d'eux en train de zig-zagguer tout du long à une <q>vitesse terrible</q>. Un autre
  officier, Earl Patterson, me dit avoir vu 1 seul objet qui <q>fit des <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../observation/comportement/Virages.html">virages soudains à 90 °</a> sans
  difficulté</q>. J'obtins également des lettres de récits d'autres dans la région de Portland qui virent des objets
  semblables à des disques ce jour-là. Là se trouvait un premier cas d'objets non identifiés manoeuvrant en plein jour
  au-dessus d'une grande ville.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Discussion</strong> — Les observations du 4 juillet <a href="../../../../../../../4/7/index.html">1947</a>
  (pour lesquelles <a href="../../../../../../../../../../people/b/BloecherTed/index.html">Bloecher</a> a rassemblé des
  récits de presse pour plus de 80 de diverses parties des U.S.) devinrent le sujet d'une bonne dose de ridicule dans la
  presse, comme l'étude de <a href="../../../../../../../../../../people/b/BloecherTed/index.html">Bloecher</a> le
  montre clairement. Cependant, après avoir interrogé un certain nombre des témoins de l'observation de Portland à
  propos de leurs souvenirs de ce qu'ils avaient vu ce jour-là, je ne fois absolument aucun fondement à rejeter ces
  observations. L'explication officielle aux observations de Portland est de la "paillette <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../enquete/indice/radar/index.html">radar</a>," basé concrêtement (Réf. 6) sur un
  rapport selon lequel des appareils avaient fait un lâcher de paillettes dans cette zone à un moment ce jour-là. Les
  "paillettes" sont faites de feuille métallique découpée en bandes courtes, typiquement de quelques pouces de long,
  éjectés depuis des appareils militaires pour perturber le <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../enquete/indice/radar/index.html">radar</a>. Les bandes flottent vers le bas à
  travers les airs, interceptant et retournant les pulsations <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../enquete/indice/radar/index.html">radar</a>. Suggérer que de nombreux officiers
  de police confondraient des bandes de feuille métallique, petites au point d'être invisibles au-delà de quelques
  centaines de yards, avec des objets semblables à des disques manoeuvrant semble déraisonnable. Je doute que quiconque
  ayant parlé directement à ces officiers pourrait avoir sérieusement proposé une telle explication. Ici réside une
  difficulté : dans une majorité écrasante de cas, les explications officielles ont été conçues sans aucune
  interrogation directe des témoins par ceux responsables de concevoir les explications.</p>
<p>
  5. Peut-être, for present purposes, les cas foregoing suffiront à indiquer qu'il y a eu des incidents d'ovnis
  significatifs dans les villes. De nombreux autres exemples pourraient facilement être cités. Ailleurs (Réf. 2) j'ai
  discuté de mes propres interviews avec des témoins dans un cas à Beverly, Massachusetts, le soir du 22 avril <a
    href="../../../../../../6/index.html">1966</a>, où 3 femmes adultes et par la suite un total de plus d'une
  demi-douzaine d'adultes (dont 2 officiers de police) observèrent 3 objets ronds éclairés en survol près d'un bâtiment
  scolaire au milieu de Beverly. At one early stage of the sightings, one of the discs moved rapidly over the three
  women, hovering above one of them at an altitude of only a few tens of feet and terrifying the hapless women until she
  bolted. This case was quite thoroughly checked by M. <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../people/FowlerRaymondE.html">Raymond E. Fowler</a>, one of NICAP's most able
  investigators, who has studied numerous other UFO incidents in the New England area. </p>
<p>
  I interviewed witnesses in a most interesting sighting in Omaha in January 1966, where a stubby cigar-shaped object
  had been seen by a number of persons on the northwest side of the city. Urban UFO cases in other parts of the world
  are also a matter of at least journalistic if not yet scientific record. To sum up, though non-urban reports are
  definitely more numerous, urban reports do indeed exist. </p>
<h3><a id="astronomers"/>Pourquoi les astronomes ne voient-ils pas d'ovnis ?</h3>
<p>Cette question m'a été posée de de nombreuses personnes, dont un certain nombre d'<a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../astro.html">astronomes</a>. Une fois je parlais à un groupe d'un laboratoire
  important d'<a href="../../../../../../../../../../astronomie/index.html">astronomie</a>, lorsque le directeur demanda
  pourquoi les astronomes ne le voyaient jamais. Dans la salle, parmi le personnel, se trouvaient 2 astronomes qui
  avaient vu des objets non conventionnels alors qu'ils faisaient des observations mais qui demandèrent que les
  informations qu'ils m'avaient donnée au sujet de leurs observations restent confidentielles. Je comprends de telles
  restrictions, mais certaines d'entre elles rendent les choses un peu difficiles. Ce phénomène de personnes
  professionnelles voyant des objets non identifiés et étant alors très peu disposés à l'admettre est bien plus courant
  qu'on pourrait le supposer. Après avoir écouté une observation à l'évidence très significative par un physicien
  proéminent qui faisait de la randonnée dans les montagnes de l'ouest et repéra un disque semblant métallique,
  l'examina aux jumelles, et le vit foncer dans les airs vers les cieux (d'après mon rapport de 2nde main d'un collègue
  professionnel), j'essayais pendant des mois de m'en assurer un rapport direct de sa part ; il ne souhaitait pas en
  discuter ouvertement avec moi. Le <a href="../../../../../../../../../../org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">NICAP</a> a eut
  des rapports de responsables proéminents de grandes corporations techniques qui insistèrent pour que, simplement en
  raison de leurs positions, leurs noms ne soient pas utilisés publiquement. Des exemples semblables pourraient être
  cités presque <em>ad infinitum</em>. Les types-mêmes de témoins dont le témoignage donnerait un plus grand crédit se
  révèlent souvent être les plus réticents à admettre leurs observations ; ils semblent penser qu'ils ont beaucoup à
  perdre. En une journée de cette rédaction j'ai parlé à un pilote de ligne vétéran d'une observation dans laquelle il
  fut impliqué il y a une dizaine d'année de cela. Après que l'"explication" officielle ait reçu de la publicité, il
  décida qu'il n'en signalera plus jamais aucune autre. Je prédit que les sociologues auront un domaine un jour, dans
  quelques années, étudiant l'"ignorance pluraliste" qui amena tant de personnes à dissimuler tant d'observations
  pendant si longtemps.</p>
<p>
  Pour revenir, cependant, à la question de pourquoi les astronomes ne voient jamais d'ovnis, une considération
  quantitative pertinente doit au moins être citée. Selon un comptage récent, le nombre de membres de l'<a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../org/us/asso/AmericanAstronomicalSociety.html">American Astronomical Society</a>
  est d'environ 1800 ; par contraste, notre pays possède près de 350 000 officiers de maintien de l'ordre. Avec presque
  200 fois plus de police, d'adjoints de sheriffs, de patrouilleurs d'état, etc., qu'il y a d'astronomes professionnels,
  il n'est pas surprenant que beaucoup plus de signalements d'ovnis viennent d'officiers de maintien de l'ordre que
  d'astronomes. De plus, la notion que les astronomes passent la plupart de leur temps à scruter les cieux est
  relativement incorrecte ; le patrouilleur moyen regarde presque certainement plus au hasard que l'astronome
  professionnel de base.</p>
<p>
  En dépit de ces considérations, de nombreuses observations d'astronomes ont été répertoriées, en particulier
  d'amateurs, qui dépassent largement en nombre les professionnels. Quelques exemples seront être considérés.</p>
<h4>
  1. Cas 20. Las Cruces, Nouveau Mexique, 20 Août 1949</h4>
<p>
  Un bon récit de l'observation du Dr. <a href="../../../../../../../../../../people/TombaughClydeWilliam/index.html">Clyde
  Tombaugh</a>, découvreur de la planète Pluton, est donné par <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../people/m/MenzelDonaldH/index.html">Menzel</a> (réf. 25). De mes propres
  discussions avec le Dr. <a href="../../../../../../../../../../people/TombaughClydeWilliam/index.html">Tombaugh</a>, I
  confirmed the main outlines of this incident. At about 10:00 p.m. on 8/20/49, he, his wife, and his mother-in-law were
  in the yard of his Las Cruces home, admiring what Tombaugh described as a sky of rare transparency, when Tombaugh,
  looking almost directly towards zenith, spotted an array of pale yellow lights moving rapidly across the sky towards
  the southeast. He called them to the attention of the two others, who saw them just before they disappeared halfway to
  the horizon. The entire array subtended an angle which Tombaugh put at about one degree, and it took only a few
  seconds to cross 50 or 60 degrees of sky. The array comprised six "windowlike" rectangles of light, formed into a
  symmetric pattern; they moved too fast for aircraft, too slowly for a meteor, and made no sound. Menzel quotes
  Tombaugh as. saying, "I have never seen .anything like it before or since, and I have spent a lot of time where the
  night sky could be seen well." </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- Le Dr. <a href="../../../../../../../../../../people/m/MenzelDonaldH/index.html">Menzel</a>
  explique ce phénomène comme résultant du reflet de lumières au sol, éventuellement <q>les fenêtres allumées d'une
  maison</q> réfléchies pas une couche d'inversion ou de brume en haut. The movement he explains as resulting from a
  ripple on the haze layer. Such an "explanation" is not merely difficult to understand; it is incredible. For an
  "inversion layer" to produce such a near-normal reflection of window lights would demand a discontinuity of refractive
  index so enormously large compared with anything known to occur in our atmosphere as to make it utterly out of the
  question. However, it has been just such casual <i>ad hoc</i> explanations as this by which Menzel has, in his
  writings, used meteorological optics to rationalize case after ease with no attention to crucial <i>quantitative</i>
  details. It is a simple matter to show that even inversions of intensity many orders of magnitude larger than have
  ever been observed yield reflectivities (at the kind of near-normal incidence involved in Tombaugh's sighting) that
  are only a tiny fraction of one per cent (Ref. 36). In fact, I see no way of accounting for the Tombaugh observation
  in terms of known meteorological or astronomical phenomena. </p>

  "nuages plus sombres"). C'est une notion fallacieuse. Si quelques distortions optiques avaient ici amené à voir un

  <a id="case22"></a>3. Cas 22. Harborside, Me., 8 Juillet 1947</h4>
<p>
  Une observation par un astronome amateur, John F. Cole, signalée aux bureaux d'enquête officiels near the beginning of
  the period of general public awareness of the UFO problem, involves an erratically maneuvering cluster of about 10
  objects, seen near 2:30 p.m. EDT on 7/3/47 on the eastern shore of Penobscot Bay. Hearing a roar overhead, Cole looked
  up to see the objects milling about like a moving swarm of bees as they traveled northwestward at a seemingly high
  speed, as nearly as he could judge size and distance. The objects were light-colored, and no wings could be discerned
  on most, although two appeared to have some sort of darker projections somewhat resembling wings. In 10-15 seconds
  they passed out of sight </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. This is one of several dozen cases admitted to the Unidentified category in one of the earliest
  official reports on UFOs (Ref. 6). I have tried, unsuccessfully, to locate J. F. Cole. An account of the case is given
  by Bloecher (Ref. 8). It might be remarked that "swarming bee" UFO observations have cropped up repeatedly over the

<h4>
  <a id="case23"></a>4. Case 23. Ogra, Latvia, July 26, 1965 </h4>
<p>
  Un astronome que je connais recently toured a number of observatories in the USSR, and brought back the word that a
  majority of Russian astronomers have paid little attention to Russian UFO reports (details of which are quite similar
  to American UFO reports, my colleagues established), a frequently-cited reason being that the American astronomer,
  Menzel, had given adequate optical explanations of all such sightings. I must agree with Dr. Felix Zigel who, writing
  on the UFO problem in Soviet Life (Ref. 38), remarked that Menzel's explanation in terms of atmospheric optics "does
  not hold water." It would, for example, be straining meteorological optics to try to account in such terms for a
  sighting by three Latvian astronomers whose report Zigel cites in his article. At 9:35 p.m. on 7/26/65 while studying
  noctilucent clouds, R. Vitolniek and two colleagues visually observed a starlike object drifting slowly westward.
  Under 8-power binocular magnification, the light exhibited finite angular diameter, so a telescope was used to examine
  it. In the telescope, it appeared as a composite of four smaller objects. There was a central sphere around which, <q>"at
  a distance of two diameters, were three spheres resembling the one in the center."</q> The outer spheres slowly
  rotated around the central sphere as the array gradually moved across the sky, diminishing in size as if leaving the
  Earth. After about 20 minutes' observation, the astronomers noted the outer spheres moving away from the central
  object, and by about 10:00 p.m., the entire group had moved so far away that they were no longer visible. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- I have no first-hand information on this report, of course. The group of objects was seen at an
  angular elevation of about 60 degrees, far too high to invoke any mirage-effects or other familiar refractive
  anomalies. Furthermore, the composite nature of the array scarcely suggests an optical distortion of the telescope, a
  possibility also rendered improbable from the observed angular velocity and apparent recessional motion. </p>

  diminua de taille et ainsi <q>disparut instantanément. </q></p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- If we may accept as reliable the principal features of the sighting, how might we account for
  it? The "faintly luminous ribbons" trailing from the horns suggest a high-flying jet, of course; but the asymmetry and
  the reddish-yellow coloration fail to fit that notion. Also, it was an object of rather large angular size, about 20
  minutes of arc, so that an aircraft of wingspan, say, 150 feet would have been only about five miles away whence
  engine-noise would have been audible under the quiet conditions of a mountain observatory. More significant, if it had
  been an aircraft at a slant range of five miles, and at 20 degree elevation, its altitude would have been only about
  9000 ft above the observatory. For the latitude and date. the sun was about ten degrees below the western horizon, so
  direct sun-illumination on the aircraft at 9000 ft above observatory level would be out of the question. Hence the
  luminosity goes unexplain . Clearly, satellites and meteors can-be ruled out. The astronomers' observation cannot be
  readily explained in any conventional terms. <a href="../../../../../../../../../../people/z/ZiegelFelixY/index.html">Zigel</a>

    href="../../../../../../../../../../people/HessSeymour/index.html">Seymour Hess</a> observed an object from the
  grounds of the Lowell Observatory. Although Hess' principal field of interest has been meteorology, we may here
  consider him an astronomer-by-association, since he was at Lowell doing work on planetary atmospheres, on leave from
  Florida State University. Spotting an unusual small object moving from SE to NW, he had time to send his son after
  binoculars, which he used in the later portions of his observation. He said it looked somewhat disc-shaped, or perhaps
  somewhat like a tipped parachute. It had no wings or visible means of propulsion, Dr. Hess indicated to me that he
  probably had it in sight a total of about three minutes, during which it passed directly between him and a cloud,
  before disappearing (into a cloud Hess feels, though this point was not certain). From meteorological data bearing on
  the cloud-base height, Hess deduced that the cloud bases lay 12,000 ft above terrain (vs. Weather Bureau visual
  estimate of 6000 ft above terrain). The zenith angle was about 48 degrees, so the slant range would have been 17,000
  ft or 8,000 ft, depending on which cloud height is accepted. For its 3 minutes estimated angular diameter (dime at 50
  ft Hess estimated), the diameter would then come out of the order of 10 to 15 feet His subjective impression was that
  it was possibly smaller than that. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- The possibility that this might have been a balloon or some other freely drifting device comes
  to mind. However, Hess noted carefully that the clouds were drifting from SW to NE, i.e., at right angles to the
  object's motion.</p>
<p>
  He estimated its speed to be in the neighborhood of 100 to 200 mph, yet no engine noises of any kind were audible. It
  appeared dark against the bright cloud background, but bright when it was seen against blue sky. No obvious
  explanation in conventional terms seems to fit this sighting. </p>
<p>
  7. Many other sightings by both professional and amateur astronomers could be listed. Vallee (Ref. 17) discusses in
  detail a November 8, 1957 observation by J. L. Chapuis of Toulouse Observatory in France of what appeared through a
  small telescope to be a yellowish, elliptical body, with distinct outlines, leaving a short trail behind it. It was
  seen by other observers in three separate locations, executed maneuvers entirely excluding meteoric origin, and was
  regarded as an unexplainable phenomenon by all of the witnesses. Hall (Ref. 10) lists nine examples of astronomer
  sightings of unidentified objects, several of which are quite striking. Ruppelt (Ref. 5) remarks that an astronomer
  working under contract to the official UFO investigatory program interviewed 45 American astronomers uring the summer
  of 1952, of whom five (11 per cent) had seen what they regarded to be UFOs. Although the sample is small, that
  percentage is well above the population percentage who say they have seen UFOs, which suggests that perhaps
  astronomers may sight more UFOs than they report as such. Indeed, with the recent publication of Ref. 7, further
  interesting information on that 1952 poll is now at hand. The contract astronomer wrote at that time (Ref. 7, Rept 8),
  <q>"... certainly another contributing factor to their desire not to talk about these things is their overwhelming
    fear of publicity. One headline in the nation's papers to the effect that 'Astronomer Sees Flying Saucer' would be
    enough to brand the astronomer as questionable among his colleagues."</q> Unfortunately, we scientists are by no
  means as open-minded and fearlessly independent as we are sometimes pictured. It is often quite difficult to persuade
  a scientist to let his confidential report of a UFO sighting become a fully open UFO report; and my own experience
  suggests that perhaps astronomers, as a group, are just a bit more sensitive on this score than other scientists. At
  any event, perhaps the above-cited cases will suggest that some astronomers have seen unidentified flying objects.

<h4>
  1. Cas 26. Richmond (Virginie), Avril 1947 </h4>
<p>
  To begin an answer to that rhetorical question, we might consider an observation made by a weather observer at the
  Richmond, Va., U.S. Weather Bureau station, about two months before the first national publicity concerning UFOs.
  Walter A. Minczewski, whom I located at the same Weather Bureau office where he made the sighting in 1947, was making
  a pilot balloon observation, when he spotted a silvery object that entered the field of his theodolite (which was
  trained on the balloon he had released). In the account that Minczewski sent me, he stated that "the bottom was flat
  and the top was slightly dome-shaped": and when he tried to see it with naked eye, he could not spot it. (Typical
  pilot balloon theodolites have magnifications of about 20 to 25. and angular fields that are usually about a degree
  across.) It was a "clear bright morning" when he spotted the object, and it lay to his NNE at an elevation of about 45
  degrees. Whether Minczewski really saw the upper surface or formed his mental impressions without realizing that the
  theodolite may have inverted the image is now unclear, and my questioning did not settle that point. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- A report of this sighting is in the official files, a circumstance which greatly surprised
  Minczewski, since he had discussed it only with his fellow workers. In the ensuing two decades, he has never again
  seen anything like it. Clearly, the probability of an object crossing the small angular field of a meteorological
  theodolite is quite low, if only chance were involved here. He tried to track it but lost it, due to its high angular
  velocity, after about five or six seconds, he recalled. No obvious conventional explanation suggests itself for this
  early sighting. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case27"></a>2. Cas 27. Yuma (Arizona), 4 février 1953 </h4>
<p>
  Weather Bureau observer S. H. Brown was tracking a pilot balloon at 6000 ft over Yuma at 1:50 p.m. MST on 2/4/53 when
  first one and then a second unidentified object moved across his theodolite field, somewhat as in the preceding case.
  I obtained an account of this sighting from V. B. Gotten, Meteorologis in-Charge at the Yuma station. The full account
  is too long for recapitulation here. Both objects appeared to be of the order of a minute of arc in diameter and
  appeared "almost round, a solid dull pure white color, with a thin white mist completely edging each object." The
  first object moved into the optical field and curved upwards to the west, with the theodolite oriented to about 53
  degrees elevation, 107 degrees azimuth. About 20 seconds later, a second object entered the field and moved in and out
  of the field erratically two times, to rejoin the first object. Brown was able to track the pair thereafter, as they
  jointly changed both azimuth and elevation. Because he had a stopwatch at hand for the balloon observation (which he
  did not complete because of following the unknown objects), he was able to determine that he followed the pair of
  objects for five minutes (1350 to 1355), until he lost sight of them against a cirrus cloud deck to the SSW. At the
  termination of the observation, his instrument was pointed to 29 degrees elevation, 204 degrees azimuth. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- This case is carried as Unidentified in the official files (see Ref. 7 for official summary). At
  times these objects lay near the sun's position in the sky, which might suggest forward-angle scattering of sunlight
  by airborne particles. However, initially, the objects were detected at angular distance of about 40 degrees from the
  solar position, which would not yield appreciable low-angle scattering. Furthermore, if these were airborne
  scatterers, they would almost certainly be separated by random turbulence within as long a period as five minutes, yet
  the observer's report indicates that they maneuvered together within angular separations of the order of the roughly
  one-degree field of such theodolites. The fact that the second object did go out of the field only to return to the
  vicinity of the first object strains the airborne-particle hypothesis. Thus the official categorization of
  Unidentified seems reasonable here. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case28"></a>3. Cas 28. Upington (province du Cap), 7 décembre 1954 </h4>
<p>
  R. H. Kleyweg, Officer-in-Charge of the Upington Meteorological Station, had just released a balloon for upper-wind
  measurement and was shielding his eyes from the sun trying to spot the balloon to get his theodolite on it. Seeing an
  object east of the sun, moving slowly to the west, he thought it was his balloon and got the theodolite on it, only to
  find that it was white, whereas he had released a red balloon. An account in the Natal Mercury, January 28, 1950,
  quoted Kleyweg as saying that it seemed "like a half-circle with the sun reflecting off the sloping top." He had no
  difficulty following it for about three minutes, but then it began to accelerate and, after another minute, he was
  unable to track fast enough to keep it in optical view (Ref. 10). Discussion. -- Kleyweg was quoted in the cited press
  source as saying, "I have followed thousands of meteorological balloons. This object was no balloon. " A South African
  student doing graduate work in my Department, Petrus DuToit, has confirmed this sighting, having had an account of it
  directly from Kleyweg. An accelerating airborne half-circular object with sloping top seems best categorized as an
  unidentified flying object. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case29"></a>4. Cas 29. Arrey (Nouveau Mexique), 24 avril 1949 </h4>
<p>
  <a href="../../../../../../../../../../people/MooreCharlesB/index.html">Charles B. Moore</a>, Jr., was with four
  enlisted Navy personnel making a pilot balloon observation preparatory to release of a Skyhook balloon at the White
  Sands Proving Ground in the middle of the morning of 4/24/49. The balloon was airborne and was under observation by
  one of the men when Moore became aware that a white object which he took to be the balloon was in a part of the sky
  well away from where the theodolite operator had this instrument trained. As Moore has explained directly to me in
  discussing this famous case, he thought the operator had lost the balloon. Moore took over, swung the 25-power scope
  onto the "balloon" he had spotted, and found that it was in fact an ellipsoidal white object moving at a rapid angular
  velocity towards the NE. With stopwatch and recording forms at hand, it was possible for the team of five men to
  secure some semi-quantitative data on this sighting; Moore disengaged the vernier drives to track manually, and
  followed the object as it sped from the southwest into the northeast skies. At its closest approach, it was moving at
  about 5 degrees/sec. Just before Moore lost it in the distance to the northeast, its angular elevation began to
  increase, as if it were climbing, a quite significant point. The object had a horizontal length about two to three
  times greater than its vertical thickness. Moore never got a sufficiently clear view to identify any finer details if
  any were present. Another balloon was immediately released to check the slim possibility that a high-speed jet from SW
  to NE might have carried some airborne object across the sky; but the winds were blowing more or less at right angles
  to the object's path to the 93,000 ft level, and were rather weak (Ref. 10). The angular diameter of the object was
  estimated at about a minute of arc (which in the 25-power theodolite would appear to Moore as about three-fourths the
  apparent size of the moon ). </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- Moore's sighting is carried as Unidentified in official files. Menzel (Ref. 24) says of it: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <q>This incident, kept in the classified files for more than two years, presents no serious difficulty to the person
      who understands the optics of the earth's atmosphere. The air can, under special conditions, produce formations
      similar to lenses. And, just as a burning glass can project the sun into a point of light, so can these lenses of
      air -- imperfect though they are -- form an image. What Moore saw was an out of focus and badly astigmatic image
      of the balloon above.</q></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  It would be interesting to hear Menzel present a quantitative defense of that astonishing disposition of this
  interesting sighting. Here five witnesses, with aid of a tracking device giving better than rough angular-coordinate
  information on the movements of an unknown object, observe the object move through an arc of over 90 degrees that took
  it into a part of the sky about that same large angular distance from the real balloon's location, and Menzel adduces
  a "lens of air" to explain it away. Astronomers find atmospheric scintillation a very serious observational problem
  because stellar images are often erratically shifted by tens of <i>seconds</i> of arc from their mean position as a
  result of atmospheric turbulence effects. In the 5/24/49 Moore sighting, Menzel is proposing that the atmosphere
  carried a refracted image of the balloon northeastward at a steady rate of excursion that finally totaled several
  thousand times the magnitude of refractive angular image-displacements known to occur with bad seeing. I feel obliged
  to repeat an observation I have made before: If the transmission properties of the Earth's atmosphere were as
  anomalous as Menzel assumes in his handling of UFO observations, he and his colleagues would be out of business. The
  official categorization of Unidentified for the Moore sighting seems inescapable. It might be added that, over the
  years, there have been very many UFO observations of significant nature from the vicinity of White Sands Proving
  Ground, many involving instrumental tracking, many made by experienced observers. A long and impressive list of them
  could easily be compiled, yet all have been slowly lost from official cognizance by a process that is
  characteristically at the heart of response to the UFO problem.</p>
<h4>
  <a id="case30"></a>5. Cas 30. Admiralty Bay (Antarctique), 16 mars 1961</h4>
<p>
  This listing of UFO sightings by meteorologists could be extended very considerably by drawing on my file of such
  cases. To cite just one more that also indicates the global .scale of the UFO phenomena, a very unusual luminous
  unidentified aerial object seen by a meteorologist and others aboard the U.S.S. Glacier at about 6:15 p.m. on 3/16/61
  in the Antarctic will be mentioned. I have quite recently received, through French UFO investigator Rene Fouere, a
  rather detailed summary of this sighting by Brazilian meteorologist Rubens J. Villela, whose earlier account I had
  seen but paid little attention to (Ref. 10). The point I had missed, prior to reading Villela'a detailed description
  of the circumstances of the sighting, was the very important feature of a low cloud overcast present at about 1500 ft
  above the sea. With three shipmates on the flying bridge, Villela suddenly saw </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>a multicolored luminous object crossing the sky,</q></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  an object which for a moment they took to be an unusual meteor.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <q>It was egg-shaped, colored mainly reddish at first, and traveled slowly from NE to SW at about 50 degrees above
      the horizon, on a straight horizontal trajectory. From its frontal part, several multicolored, perfectly straight
      'rays' extended backwards, diverging outwards at an angle; the colors of these rays changed continually,
      predominantly green, red, and blue. Most striking of all, it left a long trail of orange color in the form of a
      perfectly straight tube which gave the distinct impression of being hollow, faintly comparable to a neon
      light,</q></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Villela stated in his summary. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <q>Then, suddenly the object divided in two. It was not an explosion, it was a controlled division in two equal
      parts, one behind the other, each egg-shaped as before and each radiating outwards its V-shaped lateral rays. Then
      the object shone with a slightly stronger light, changing color to blue and white, and disappeared completely.
      That's it -- just disappeared, abruptly.</q></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  His account emphasizes that the boundaries of the object (s) were definite and sharp, not diffuse. Villela's account
  indicates that a total of six persons were above-decks and saw this striking phenomenon. It is to be emphasized that,
  in the estimated 10 seconds that this lasted, the object was moving below a cloud deck that lay only about 1500 feet
  above the sea, so that, for the reported elevation angle of about 50 degrees, the slant range from observers to object
  was perhaps of the order of 2000 ft. Villela had the subjective impression that the egg-shaped initial form was about
  as big as a small airplane.</p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- In a recent book aimed at showing that a majority of the most interesting UFOs are an
  atmospheric-electrical plasma related to ball lightning, <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../people/KlassPhilipJ/index.html">Philip J. Klass</a> (Ref. 39)) cites the
  preceding case as a good example of the port of observation which he feels he can encompass in his "plasma-UFO"
  hypothesis. To the extent that he treats only the breakup into two parts, he has some observational basis for trying
  to interpret this as something akin to ball lightning. But almost at that point the similarity ends as far as
  meteorologically recognized characteristics of ball lightning go. The highly structured nature of the object and its
  rays, its size, its horizontal trajectory, its presence in a foggy area with low stratiform clouds free of
  thunderstorm activity scarcely suggest anything like ball lightning. Nor does this account suggest any meteoric
  phenomenon at sub-cloud altitudes. I would regard this as just one more of a baffling array of inexplicable aerial
  phenomena which span so wide a range of characteristics that it is taxing to try to invent any single hypothesis to
  rationalize them all. The full spectrum of UFO phenomena will, I predict, come as a shock to every scientist who takes
  the necessary time to look into the wealth of reports accumulated in various archives over the past two decades and
  more. Official assertions to the effect that UFO reports in no way defy explanation in terms of present scientific and
  technological knowledge are, in my opinion, entirely unjustified. The Villela sighting seems a case in point. And
  meteorologists do see UFOs, as the foregoing cases should suggest.
</p>
<h3><a id="balloons"> </a>Les ballons méteo et de recherche n'expliquent-ils pas de nombreux ovnis ?</h3>
<p>
  Probablement la déclaration la plus catégorique jamais faite attribuant les observations d'ovnis aux <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/ballon/">ballons</a> apparut dans un article du magazine <em>Look</em>
  par Richard Wilson en février <a href="../../../../../../../5/1/index.html">1951</a>, intitulé, "A Nuclear Physicist
  Exposes Flying Saucers." Dr. Urner Liddel. then affiliated with the Navy cosmic ray research program using the large
  Skyhook balloons, was quoted as saying, "There is not a single reliable report of an observation (of a UFO) which is
  not attributable to the cosmic balloons." When one considers the large number of UFO reports already on record by 1951
  in which reliable airlines pilots, military personnel, and other credible witnesses have observed unidentified objects
  wholly unlike a high-altitude, slowly drifting pear-shaped Skyhook balloon, that assertion appears very curious.
  Nevertheless, that many persons have misidentified Skyhook balloons and even the smaller weather balloons used in
  routine meteorological practice is unquestioned. A Skyhook seen against the twilight sky with back-illumination yields
  a strangely luminous, hovering object which many observers, especially if equipped with binoculars, were unprepared to
  identify correctly in the 1946-51 period when Skyhook operations were tied up with still-classified programs. To this
  extent, Liddel's point is reasonable; but his sweeping assertion fails to fit the facts, then or now. </p>
<p>
  Actually, in official case-evaluations, one finds Skyhook balloons invoked relatively infrequently compared with
  "weather balloons," But in many of the latter cases, the balloon hypothesis is strained beyond the breaking point. The
  official criterion used <span class="source">(Ref. 7, p.
185)</span> is extremely loose: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <i><q>If an object is reported near a balloon launch site within an hour after the scheduled launch times, it is
      classed as a balloon.</q></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  with no specification of heights, shapes, distances, etc. Using such a criterion, it is easy to see why so many
  "balloon" explanations figure in the official summaries. There are even "balloon" UFOs whose speed, when inferred from
  the report, comes out supersonic! The tiny candles or flashlight bulbs hung on pilot balloons for night tracking have
  been repeatedly made the basis for explanations of what witnesses described as huge luminous objects at close range.
  Within only days of this writing, I have checked out such a case near Tucson where four adult witnesses saw, on July
  2, 1968, a half-moon-shaped orange-red object hovering for several minutes at what they estimated to be a few hundred
  feet above terrain and perhaps a few miles away over open desert. They watched it tip once, right itself, then
  accelerate and rise over a mountain range and pass off into the distance in some ten seconds. Because a weather
  balloon had been released earlier (actually about an hour and forty-five minutes earlier) from the Tucson airport
  Weather Bureau station, the official explanation, published in the local press, was that the witnesses had seen a
  "weather balloon". A pilot balloon of the small type (30-gram) used in this instance rises at about 600 ft/min, the
  tiny light on it becomes invisible to the naked eye beyond about 10 000 ft slant-range, and the upper-level winds
  weren't even blowing toward the site in question. Also the angular size estimated for the observed reddish half-moon
  was about twice the lunar diameter, and some said about four times larger. A pilot balloon light would have to be
  within about 20-30 feet to appear this large. Yet such a case will enter the files (if even transmitted to higher
  echelons) as a "balloon", swelling the population of curious balloon-evaluations in official files. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case31"> </a>1. Cas 31. Ft. Monmouth (New Jersey), 10 septembre 1951</h4>
<p>
  It is clear from Ruppelt's discussions (Ref. 5) that a series of radar and visual sightings near Ft. Monmouth on
  9/10/51 and the next day were of critical importance in affecting official handling of the UFO problem in the ensuing
  two-year period. Many details from the official file on these sightings are now available for scientific scrutiny
  (Ref. 7). Here, a sighting by two military airmen flying in a T-33 near Ft. Monmouth will be selected from that series
  of events because the sighting was eventually tagged as a weather balloon. As with any really significant UFO case, it
  would require far more space than can be used here to spell out adequately all relevant details, so a very truncated
  account must be employed. While flying at 20,000 ft from a Delaware to a Long Island airbase, the two men in the T-33
  spotted an object "round and silver in color" which at one stage of the attempted intercept appeared flat. The T-33
  was put into a descending turn to try to close on the object but the latter turned tightly (the airmen stated) and
  passed rapidly eastward towards the coast of New Jersey and out to sea. A pair of weather balloons (probably
  radiosonde balloons but no information thereon given in the files) had been released from the Evans Signal Laboratory
  near Ft. Monmouth, and the official evaluation indicates that this is what the airmen saw. </p>
<p>
  However, it is stated that the balloons were released at 1112 EDST, and the sighting began at about 1130 EDST with the
  T-33 over Point Pleasant, N.J. In that elapsed time, a radiosonde balloon, inflated to rise at the 800-900 ft/min rate
  used for such devices, would have attained an altitude of about 17-18 000 ft, the analysis notes. From this point on,
  the official analysis seems to be built on erroneous inferences. The airmen said that, as they tried to turn on the
  object, it appeared to execute a 120-degree turn over Freehold, N.J., before speeding out over the Atlantic. But from
  the upper winds for that day, it is clear that the Ft. Monmouth balloon trajectory would have taken it to the
  northeast, and by 1130, it would have been about over the coast in the vicinity of Sea Bright. Hence, at no time in
  the interval involved could the line of sight from T-33 to balloon have intersected Freehold, which lies about 15
  miles WSW of the balloon release-point. Instead, had the airmen somehow seen the radiosonde balloon from Pt. Pleasant,
  it would have lain to about their N or NNE and would have stayed in about that sector until they passed it.
  Furthermore, the size of the balloon poses a serious difficulty for the official analysis. Assuming that it had
  expanded to a diameter of about 15 feet as it ascended to about the 18,000-ft level, it would have subtended an arc of
  only 0.6 min, as seen from the T-33 when the latter passed over Pt. Pleasant. This angular size is, for an unaided
  eye, much too small to fit the airmen's descriptions of what they tried to intercept. In a press interview (Ref. 40),
  the pilot, Wilbert S. Rogers of Columbia, Pa., said the object was ''perfectly round and flat" and that the center of
  the disc was raised "about six feet" and that it appeared to be moving at an airspeed of the order of 900 mph. The
  entire reasoning on which the balloon evaluation is elaborated fails to fit readily established points in the official
  case-summary. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- The possibility that a pilot can be misled by depth-perception errors and coordinate-reference
  errors to misconstrue a weather balloon as a fast-maneuvering object must always be kept in mind. But in the Ft.
  Monmouth instance, as in many others that could be discussed in detail, there is a very large gap between the balloon
  hypothesis and the facts. The basic sighting-report here is quite similar to many other daytime sightings by airborne
  observers who have seen unconventional disc-like objects pass near their aircraft.</p>
<h3>
  <a id="case32"></a>2. Cas 32. Odessa (Washington), 10 décembre 1952
</h3>
<p>
  According to an official case-summary (Ref. 7, Rept 10), two airmen in an F94 "made visual and radar contact with a
  large, round white object larger than any known type of aircraft" near 1915 PST on 12/10/52 near Odessa. The radar
  operator in the F-94 had airborne radar contact with the object for 15 minutes, and during that same interval, ground
  radar was also tracking it. The summary states that <q>l'objet appeared to be level with the intercepting F-94 at 26
  000 to 27 000 ft,</q> and it is pointed out that <q>a dim reddish-white light came from the object as it hovered,
  reversed direction almost instantaneously and then disappeared.</q> It is stated that the skies were clear above 3000
  ft The official evaluation of this incident is "Possible Balloon", although the report notes that no upper-air
  research balloon was known to be in the area on this date. The principal basis for calling it a balloon was the
  observers' description of <q>large, round and white and extremely large</q>, and it was remarked that the instrument
  package on some balloon flights is capable of yielding a radar return. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- To conclude that this was a "Possible Balloon" just on the basis of the description, <q>large,
  round and white and extremely large</q>, and thereby to ignore the instantaneous course reversal and the inability of
  a 600-mph jet to close with it over a period of 15 minutes seems unreasonable. We may ignore questions of wind speeds
  at the altitude of the object and the F-94 because both would enjoy the same "tail-wind effect". In 15 mn, the F-94
  would be capable of moving 150 miles relative to any balloon at its altitude. On the other hand, airborne radar sets
  of that period would scarcely detect a target of cross-section represented by the kinds of instrument packages hung on
  balloons of the Skyhook type, unless the aircraft were within something like 10 or 15 miles of it Yet it is stated
  that the F-94 was pursuing it under radar contact for a time interval corresponding to an airpath ten times that
  distance. Clearly, categorizing this unknown as a "balloon" was incompatible with the reported details of the case.
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, there seems no reason to take seriously Menzel's evaluation of this Odessa F-94 sighting (Ref. 25,
  p. 62). Menzel evidently had the full file on this case, for he adds a few details beyond those in Ref. 7, details
  similar to those in Ruppelt's account of the case (Ref. 5) : </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <i><q>Dim reddish-white lights seemed to be coming from windows and no trail or exhaust was visible. The pilot
      attempted to intercept but the object performed amazing feats—did a chandelle in front of the plane, rushed away,
      stopped, and then made straight for the aircraft on a collision course at incredible speed.</q></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  He indicates that after the pilot banked to avoid collision he could not again locate it visually, although another
  brief radar contact was obtained. Having recounted those and other sighting details, Menzel then offers his
  interpretations: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <i><q>In the east, Sirius was just rising over the horizon at the exact bearing of the unknown object. Atmospheric
      refraction would have produced exactly the phenomenon described. The same atmospheric conditions that caused the
      mirage of the star would have caused anomalous radar returns.</q></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Now stars just above the viewer's horizon do scintillate and do undergo turbulent image-displacement, but one must
  consider quantitative matters. A refractive excursion of a stellar image through even a few minutes of arc would be an
  extremely large excursion. To suggest that a pilot would report that Sirius did a chandelle is both to forget
  realities of astronomy and to do injustice to the pilot. In fact, however, Menzel seems to have done his computations
  incorrectly, for it is easily ascertained that Sirius was not even in the Washington skies at 19 h 15 (PST) on
  12/10/52. It lay at about 10 degrees below the eastern horizon. A further quite unreasonable element of Menzel's
  explanation of the Odessa case is his easy assertion that the radar returns were anomalous results of the "atmospheric
  conditions". Aircraft flying at altitudes of 26 000 pieds do not get ground returns on level flight as a result of
  propagation anomalies. These extreme forcings of explanations recur throughout Menzel's writings; one of their common
  denominators is lack of attention to relevant quantitative factors. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case33"></a>3. Cas 33. Rosalia (Washington). 6 février 1953</h4>
<p>
  Another official case-summary of interest here is cited by Menzel (Ref. 25, p. 46). Keyhoe (Ref. 4), who studied the
  case-file on it much earlier, gives similar information, though in less detail. A B-36, bound for Spokane was over
  Rosalia, Wash., at 1:13 a.m. when, as Menzel describes it, <q>the pilot *** sighted a round white light below him,
  circling and rising at a speed estimated at 150 to 200 knots as it proceeded on a southeast course.</q></p>
<p>
  <a href="../../../../../../../../../../people/m/MenzelDonaldH/index.html">Menzel</a> states that the B-36 <q>made a
  sharp descending turn toward the light, which was in view for a period of three to five minutes.</q></p>
<p>
  The light was blinking, and Keyhoe mentions that the blink-interval was estimated at about 2 seconds. </p>
<p>
  <a href="../../../../../../../../../../people/m/MenzelDonaldH/index.html">Menzel</a> concurs in the official
  evaluation of this as a "weather balloon", noting that a pilot balloon had been released at Fairchild AFB at 1:00
  a.m., and remarking that the <q>winds aloft at altitudes of 7000 to 10 000 ft. were from the northwest with a speed of
  about fifty knots.</q></p>
<p>
  He says that <q>computations showed that the existing winds would have carried the balloon to the southeast, and it
  would have been over Rosalia, which is 12,5 nautical miles southeast of Fairchild, in about fifteen minutes.</q></p>
<p>
  In fact, Rosalia lies 33 statute miles SSE of Fairchild, or about twice as far as Menzel indicates. The net drift of
  the balloon cannot be deduced simply from the winds in the 7-10 000 pieds layer; and, in fact, an examination of the
  upper-wind data for that area on February 6 indicates that the winds at lower levels were blowing out of the
  southwest. The trajectory of the balloon would have taken it initially east-northeast, then east, and finally curving
  back to the southeast as it got up to near the 10000-ft. levels. By that time, it would have been already east of
  Spokane, nowhere near Rosalia. </p>
<p>
  The small light (candle or flashlight bulb) used on night pibal runs is almost invisible to the naked eye beyond a few
  miles' distance. (A 1-candle source at 3000 pieds is equivalent to a star of about the first magnitude. At 6 miles,
  then, one finds that the same source equals the luminosity of a sixth-magnitude star, the limit of human vision under
  the most favorable conditions. For a pilot, looking out of a cockpit with slight inside glare to spot a 1-candle
  source against a dark background would require that the source be only a few miles away.) At some 30 miles, the B-36
  pilot could not have seen the small light on a balloon east of Spokane. </p>
<p>
  Menzel states that <q><i>the balloon carried white running lights which accounted for the blinking described, and the
  circling climb of the UFO is typical of a balloon's course.</i></q></p>
<p>
  Neither inference is supportable. The light used on pilot balloons is a steady source; only if one were right above
  it, with its random swing causing intermittent occultation, would one ever perceive blinking. But then, flying at B-36
  speeds, the pilot would have swept over the sector of perceptible occultation in only a matter of seconds. Yet here
  the pilot watched it for a reported 3-5 minutes. Furthermore, "circling climb" cannot be called "<q>typical of a
  balloon's course</q>." The balloon trajectory is controlled by the ambient wind shears and only with unusually strong
  directional shears would a pilot flying a straight course perceive a pilot balloon to be "circling." </p>
<p>
  In all, there appear to be so many serious difficulties with the balloon explanation for the Rosalia sighting that it
  is not possible to accept <a href="../../../../../../../../../../people/m/MenzelDonaldH/index.html">Menzel</a>'s
  statement: </p>
<p><q>Thus all the evidence supports ATIC's conclusion that the UFO was a weather balloon.</q></p>

<p>
  A 09 h 30 (EDST), un <em>Constellation</em> de la TWA en vol de Paris à New York passe près de Boston lorsque
  l'équipage du cockpit repère <q>au-dessus un grand objet de couleur blanche à l'apparence de disque</q> <span
    class="source">(Ref. 41)</span>. Le capitaine Charles J. Kratovil, le copilote W. R. Davis et l'ingénieur de vol
  Harold Raney le regardent tous pendant une durée totale de 10 mn alors qu'ils volent sur leur propre trajectoire
  sud-ouest vers New York. Ils le perdront par moments derrière les nuages surplombants. Sachant qu'ils volaient par
  vents contraires, ils concluèrent qu'il ne pouvait s'agir d'un type de <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/ballon/">ballon</a>, et appelèrent donc par radio la tour de
  contrôle de l'aéroport de Boston, qui l'informa que des jets furent envoyés et virent l'objet, mais ne purent s'en
  rapprocher. </p>
<p>
  Après avoir atterri à New York, le capitaine Kratovil fut informé que les portes-parole officiels avaient attribué
  l'observation à un <q><a href="../../../../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/ballon/">ballon</a> météo</q> lâché
  depuis la base aérienne de Grenier, dans le New Hampshire.</p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- Je suis toujours en train d'essayer de localiser Kratovil pour confirmer les détails de
  l'observation ; mais le fait que 4 récits de journaux ce jour-là donnent les mêmes informations sur les points majeurs
  justifie probablement l'acceptation de ces points. D'après les données upper-wind for that area and time, I have
  confirmed the presence of fairly strong flow from the WSW aloft, whence Kratovil's press comment, "<q>If this was a
  weather balloon, it's the first time I ever saw one traveling against the wind</q>," seems reasonable. The cruising
  speed of a Constellation is around 300 mph, so during the reported 10 mn duration of the crew's sighting, they moved
  about 50 miles relative to the air, so it would have been impossible for them to have kept a weather balloon in sight
  for this long. Furthermore, it was about 1,5 h after scheduled balloon-release time, so that even a small balloon
  would have either burst or passed to altitudes too high to be visible. Finally, with flow out of the southwest sector
  from surface to above 20 000 pieds, any balloon from Grenier AFB would have been carried along a trajectory nowhere
  near where the TWA crew spotted the "<q>large, white-colored, disc-like object</q>" overhead. </p>
<p>
  5. Dans mes fichiers se trouvent de nombreux autres cas de "ballons" from the past twenty years, cases that ought
  never have been so labeled, had the evaluators kept relevant quantitative points in mind. To ignore most of the
  salient features of a sighting in order to advance an easy "balloon" explanation is only one more of many different
  ways in which some very puzzling UFO observations have been shoved out of sight.</p>
<h3><a id="radar"></a>Pourquoi les ovnis ne sont-ils pas repérés par radar ?</h3>

<h4>
  <a id="case35"></a>1. Cas 35. Fukuoka (Japon), 15 Octobre 1948</h4>
<p>
  A very early radar-UFO case, still held as an official Unidentified, involved an attempted interception of the unknown
  object by an F-61 flying near Fukuoka, Japan, at about 23 h 00 local time on 10/15/48. The official file on this
  incident is lengthy <span class="source">(Ref. 42)</span> ; only the highlights can be recounted here. The F-61 (with
  pilot and radar operator) made six attempts to close with the unknown, from which a radar return was repeatedly
  obtained with the airborne radar. Each time the radarman would get a contact and the F-61 pilot tried to close, the
  unknown would accelerate and pass out of range. Although the radar return seemed comparable to that of a conventional
  aircraft, <q>the radar observer estimated that on three of the sightings, the object traveled seven miles in
  approximately twenty seconds, giving a speed of approximately 1200 mph.</q></p>
<p>
  In another passage, the official case-file remarks that <q>when the F61 approached within 12,000 feet, the target
  executed a 180° turn and dived under the F-61 </q>adding that <i><q>the F-61 attempted to dive with the target but was
  unable to keep pace.</q></i></p>
<p>
  The report mentions that the unknown <i><q>could go almost straight up or down out of radar elevation limits</q></i>
  and asserts further that <i><q>this aircraft seemed to be cognizant of the whereabouts of the F-61 at all times...</q></i>
</p>
<p>
  The F-61 airmen, 1st Lt. Oliver Hemphill (pilot) and 2d Lt. Barton Halter (radarman) are described in the report as
  being <i><q>of excellent character and intelligence and are trained observers.</q></i></p>
<p>
  Hemphill, drawing on his combat experience in the European theater, said that <i><q>the only aircraft I can compare
  our targets to is the German ME-163.</q></i></p>
<p>
  The airmen felt obliged to consider the possibility that their six attempted intercepts involved more than one
  unknown. Hemphill mentions that, in the first attempted intercept, <i><q>the target put on a tremendous "burst of
  speed and dived so fast that we were unable to stay with it.</q></i></p>
<p>
  After this head-on intercept, Hemphill did a chandelle back to his original 6000-ft altitude and tried a stern
  interception, <i><q>but the aircraft immediately outdistanced us. The third target was spotted visually by myself,</q></i>
</p>
<p>
  Hemphill's signed statement in the case-file continues. </p>
<p>
  <i><q>"I had an excellent silhouette of the target thrown against a very reflective undercast by a full moon. I
    realized at this time that it did not look like any type aircraft! was familiar with, so I immediately contacted my
    Ground Control Station ..."</q></i></p>
<p>
  which informed him there were no other known aircraft in the area. Hemphill's statement adds further that <q>the
  fourth target passed directly over my ship from stern to "bow at a speed of roughly twice that of my aircraft, 200
  mph. I caught just a fleeting glance of the aircraft; just enough to know he had passed on. The fifth and sixth
  targets were attempted radar interceptions, but their high rate of speed put them immediately out of our range.</q>
</p>
<p>
  (Note the non-committal terminology that treats each intercept target as if it might have been a separate object.) A
  sketch of what the object looked like when seen in silhouette against the moonlit cloud deck is contained in the file.
  It was estimated to be about the size of a fighter aircraft, but had neither discernible wings nor tail structures. It
  was somewhat bullet-shaped, tapered towards the rear, but with a square-cut aft end. It seemed to have <q>a dark or
  dull finish.</q></p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- Ground radar stations never detected the unknown that was seen visually and contacted by
  airborne radar. The report indicates that this may have been due to effects of "ground, clutter", though the F-61 was
  seen intermittently on the ground units. The airmen stated that no exhaust flames or trail were seen from this object
  with its "stubby, clean lines". The total duration of the six attempted intercepts is given as 10 mn. We deal here
  with one of many cases wherein radar detection of an unconventional object was supported by visual observation. That
  this is carried as Unidentified cannot surprise one; what is surprising is that so many other comparable instances are
  on record, yet have been ignored as indicators of some scientifically intriguing problem demanding intensive study.
</p>
<h4>
  <a id="case36"></a>2. Cas 36. Nowra (Australie), septembre 1954</h4>
<p>
  The first UFO case to command general press attention in the Australian area seems to have been a combined
  radar-visual sighting wherein the pilot of a Hawker Seafury from Nowra Naval Air Station visually observed two unknown
  objects near him as he flew from Canberra to Nowra <span class="source">(Ref. 43)</span>. Press descriptions revealed
  only that the pilot said "the two strange aircraft resembling flying saucers" were capable of speeds much beyond his
  Seafury fighter. He saw them flying nearby and contacted Nowra radar to ask if they had him on their scope; they
  informed him that they had three separate returns, at which juncture he described the unidentified objects. Under
  instructions from the Nowra radar operator, he executed certain maneuvers to identify himself on the scope. This
  confirmed the scope-identity of his aircraft vs. the unknowns. As he executed the test maneuvers, the two unknowns
  moved away and disappeared. No explanation of this incident was offered by Naval authorities after it was widely
  reported in Australian and New Zealand papers about three months after it occurred. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- It is mildly amusing that the press accounts indicated that <i><q>the pilot, fearing that he
  might be ragged in the wardroom on his return if he abruptly reported flying saucers, called Nowra by radio and asked
  whether the radar screen showed his aircraft.</q></i></p>
<p>
  Only after getting word of three, not one, radar blips in his locality did he radio the information on the unknowns,
  whose configuration was not publicly released. This is in good accord with my own direct experience in interviewing
  Australian UFO witnesses in 1967; they are no more willing than Americans to be ridiculed for seeing something that is
  not supposed to exist. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case37"></a>3. Cas 37. Capetown (Afrique du Sud), 23 mai 1953</h4>
<p>
  En Novembre <a href="../../../../../../../5/8/index.html">1958</a>, the South African Air Force released a brief
  announcement concerning radar-tracking of six successive passes of one or more unknown high-speed objects over the
  Cape. On January 1, 1967, in a transoceanic shortwave broadcast from South Africa, the authenticity of this report was
  confirmed, though no additional data beyond what had been cited earlier were presented. In the six passes, the
  target's altitude varied between 5000 and 15 000 ft, and its closest approach varied between 7 and 10 miles. Speeds
  were estimated at over 1200 mph, well beyond those of any aircraft operating in that area at that time. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- This report, on which the available information is slim, is cited to indicate that not only
  visual sightings but also radar sightings of seemingly unconventional objects appear to comprise a global phenomenon.
  By and large, foreign radar sightings are not readily accessible, and not easily cross-checked. Zigel <span
    class="source">(Ref.
88)</span> briefly mentions a Russian incident in which both airborne and ground-based radar tracked an unidentified in
  the vicinity of Odessa, le 4 avril <a href="../../../../../../6/index.html">1966</a>, the ground-based height-finding
  radar indicating altitudes of well over 100 000 pieds. Such reports, without accessory information, are not readily
  evaluated, of course. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case38"></a>4. Cas 38. Washington, (D.C.), 19 juillet 1952</h4>
<p>
  By far the most famous single radar-visual sighting on record is the one which occurred late in the evening of July
  19, and early on 20 juillet <a href="../../../../../../2/index.html">1962</a>, in the vicinity of Washington, D.C.
  <span class="source">(Refs. 2, 4, 5, 10, 24,
25)</span>. A curiously similar incident occurred just one week later. The official explanation centered around
  atmospheric effects on radar and light-propagation. Just before midnight on July 19/20, <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../org/us/faa/CAA.html">CAA</a> radar showed a number of unidentified targets which
  varied in speed (up to about 800 mph) in a manner inconsistent with conventional aircraft A number of experienced CAA
  radarmen observed these returns, and, at one juncture, compatible returns were being received not only at the ARTC
  radar but also on the ARS radar in a separate location at Washington National Airport, and on still a third radar at
  Andrews AFB. Concurrently, both ground and airborne observers saw unidentifiable lights in locations matching those of
  the blips on the ground radar. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- I have interviewed five of the CAA personnel involved in this case and four of the commercial
  airline pilots involved, I have checked the radiosonde data against well-known radar propagation relations, and I have
  studied the CAA report subsequently published on this event Only an extremely lengthy discussion would suffice to
  present the serious objections to the official explanation that this complex sighting was a result of anomalous radar
  propagation and refractive anomalies of the mirage type. The refractive index gradient, even after making allowance
  for instrument lag, was far too low for "ducting" or "trapping" to occur; and, still more significant, the angular
  elevations of the visually observed unknowns lay far too high for radar-dueling under even the most extreme conditions
  that have ever been observed in the atmosphere. Some of the pilots, directed by ground radar to look for any airborne
  objects, saw them at altitudes well above their own flight altitudes, and these objects were maneuvering in wholly
  unconventional manner. One crew saw one of the unknown luminous objects shoot straight up, and simultaneously the
  object's return disappeared from the ARTC scope being watched by the CAA radar operators. The official suggestion that
  the same weak (1.7° C) low-level "inversion" that was blamed for the radar ducting could produce miraging effects was
  quantitatively absurd, even if one overlooks the airline-pilot sightings and deals only with the reported
  ground-visual sightings. From the CAA radar operators I interviewed, as well as from the pilots I talked to about this
  case, I got the impression that the propagation-anomaly hypothesis struck them as quite out of the question, then and
  now. In fact, CAA senior controller Harry G. Barnes, who told me that the scope returns from the unknowns. </p>
<p>
  <i><q>were not diffuse, shapeless blobs such as one gets from ground returns under anomalous propagation </q></i>but
  were strong, bright pips, said that <i><q>anomalous propagation never entered our heads as an explanation.</q></i></p>
<p>
  Howard S. Conklin, who, like Barnes, is still with FAA, was in the control tower that night, operating an entirely
  independent radar (short-range ARS radar). He told me that what impressed him about the sighting that night was that
  they were in radio communication with airlines crewmen who saw unidentified lights in the air in the same area as
  unknowns were showing up on his tower radar, while simultaneously he and Joseph Zacko were viewing the lights
  themselves from the tower at the D.C. Airport James M. Ritchey, who was at the ARTC radar with Barnes and others,
  confirmed the important point that simultaneous radar fixes and pilot-sightings occurred several times that night He
  shared Barnes' views that the experienced radar controllers on duty that night were not being fooled by ground returns
  in that July 19 incident. Among the airlines crewmen with whom I spoke about this event was S. C. Pierman, then flying
  for Capitol Airlines. He was one of the pilots directed by ground radar to search in a specific area for airborne
  objects. He observed high speed lights moving above his aircraft in directions and locations matching what the CAA
  radar personnel were describing to him by radio, as seen on their radars. Other airline personnel have given me
  similar corroborating statements. I am afraid it is difficult to accept the official explanations for the famous
  Washington National Airport sightings. </p>
<h4><a id="case39"></a>5. Cas 39. Port Huron (Michigan), 29 juillet <a
    href="../../../../../../../5/2/index.html">1952</a></h4>
<p>
  Many of the radar cases for which sighting details are accessible date back to 1953 and preceding years. After 1953,
  official policies were changed, and it is not easy to secure good information on subsequent cases in most instances. A
  radar case in which both ground-radar and airborne-radar contact were involved occurred at about 9:40 p.m. CST on
  7/29/52 <span class="source">(Refs. 4, 5, 7, 10, 25)</span>. From the official case summary <span class="source">(Ref. 7)</span>
  one finds that the unknown was first detected by GGI radar at an Aircraft Control and Warning station in Michigan, and
  one of three F-94s doing intercept exercises nearby was vectored over towards it. It was initially coming in out of
  the north <span class="source">(Ref. 5, 25)</span>, at a speed put at over 600 mph. As the F-94 was observed on the
  GCI scope to approach the unknown, the latter suddenly executed a 180° turn, and headed back north. The F-94 was by
  then up to 21 000 pieds, and the pilot spotted a brilliant multicolored light just as his radarman got a contact. The
  F-94 followed on a pursuit course for 20 minutes <span class="source">(Ref. 7)</span> but could never close with the
  unknown as its continued on its northbound course. At the time of first radar lockon, the F-94 was 20 miles west of
  Pt. Huron, Mich. The GCI scope revealed the unknown to be changing speed erratically, and at one stage it was moving
  at a speed of over 14 000 miles/h, according to Menzel <span class="source">(Ref. 25)</span>, who evidently drew his
  information from the official files. <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../people/RuppeltEdwardJ/index.html">Ruppelt</a> <span
    class="source">(Ref. 5)</span> states that when the jet began to run low on fuel and turned back to its .base, GGI
  observed the unknown blip slow down, and shortly after it was lost from the GGI scope. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- This case is still carried as an official unknown. The case summary (Ref. 7) speculates briefly
  on whether it could have been <i><q>a series of coincident weather phenomena affecting the radar equipment and
  sightings of Capella, tut this is stretching probabilities too far.</q></i></p>
<p>
  <a href="../../../../../../../../../../people/m/MenzelDonaldH/index.html">Menzel</a>, however, asserts that the pilot
  did see Capella, and that the airborne and ground radar returns <i><q>were merely phantom returns caused by weather
  conditions.</q></i></p>
<p>
  No suggestion is offered as to how any given meteorological condition could jointly throw off radar at the ground and
  radar at 21 000 pieds, no suggestion is offered to account for 180° course-reversal exhibited by the blip on the GCI
  scope just as the F-94 came near the unknown, no suggestion of how propagation anomalies could yield the impression of
  a blip moving systematically northward for 20 minutes (a distance of almost 100 miles, judging from reported F-94
  speeds), with the F-94 return following along behind it. With such ad hoc explanations, one could explain away almost
  any kind of sighting, regardless of its content. I have examined the radiosonde sounding for stations near the site
  and time of this incident, and see nothing in them that would support Menzels interpretations. I have queried
  experienced military pilots and radar personnel, and none have heard of anything like "ground returns" from
  atmospheric conditions with aircraft radar operated in the middle troposphere. If Menzel is not considering
  ground-returns, in the several cases of this type which he explains away with a few remarks about "phantom radar
  returns", then it is not clear what else he might be thinking of. One does have to have some solid target to get a
  radar return resembling that of an aircraft. Refractive anomalies of the "angel" type have very low radar
  cross-section and would not mislead experienced operators into confusing them with aircraft echoes. </p>
<p>
  <a id="radarOther"></a>6. De nombreux autres cas peuvent être cités où des ovnis sont apparus sur radar dans des
  conditions où aucune explication conventionnelle n'existe. La Réf. 7 en possède un certain nombre. <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../people/HallRichardH.html">Hall</a> <span class="source">(Ref. 10)</span> lias
  près de 60 cas dans lesquels observations radar et visuelles étaient toutes deux impliquées. Un cas du 19 décembre <a
    href="../../../../../../4/index.html">1964</a> à la rivière Patuxent NAS est un de ceux que j'ai sélectionné. Il
  implique 3 passages successifs d'un objet inconnu se déplaçant à des vitesses estimées à près de 7000 miles/h. C'est
  un cas intéressant, qui vit le jour pour des raisons plutôt curieuses. Un plafond nuageux bas empêchait toutes
  observations visuelles par le personnel de la tour de contrôle, et il ne s'agit donc pas d'un cas <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../observation/classification/hynek/rv/">radar-visuel</a>. Je n'ai trouvé aucune
  explication conventionnelle pour l'expliquer.</p>
<p>
  Il doit être stressed qu'il existe de nombreuses possibilités où de faux retours peuvent être vus sur des écrans
  radar, résultant non seulement de canalisation des retours du sol mais aussi de l'interférence d'autres radars
  proches, de signaux électroniques internes dans l'ensemble radar, d'anges et d'insectes (retours faibles), etc. Ainsi
  chaque cas doit être examiné indépendamment. Après avoir étudié un certain nombre d'évaluation officielles de cas
  radar d'ovnis, j'ai l'impression qu'il y aurait probablement plus d'Inconnus radar s'il y avait moins tendance à les
  expliquer rapidement par des arguments qualitatifs qui overlook quantitative matters pertinents. Even at that, il y a
  trop d'inconnus concédés dans les dossiers officiels pour qu'ils soient ignorés.</p>
<p>
  Un cas fameux dans les annales ufologiques impliqua un B-29 au-dessus du Golfe du Mexique, où plusieurs inconnus
  furent suivis sur les écrans aériens embarqués et furent vu simultanément par des aviateurs, se déplaçant sous
  l'appareils alors qu'ils passaient <span class="source">(réfs. 4, 10, 25)</span>. Celui-ci est toujours marqué comme
  Non-Identifié dans les dossiers officiels. Au autre cas fameux de combiné radar-visuel, que <a

  plus troublants que j'aie étudié,</q> <a href="../../../../../../../../../../enquete/dossier/RapidCity/index.html">eut
  lieu entre Rapid City et Bismarck le 5 Août 1953</a>. Il impliquait à la fois des radars au sol et aériens embarqués
  et et des observations visuelles au sol et aériennes, mais est trop long et trop complexe à recapituler ici. </p>
<p>
  Peut-être ce qui vient d'être décrit suffit à indiquer que les ovnis sont parfois vus sur radar et l'ont été pendant
  de nombreuses années. La question de savoir pourquoi nous n'entendons pas grand chose de ces observations, en
  particulier avec de nouveaux radars de surveillance plus élaborés, est une question raisonnable. Des réponses à cela
  sont posées par la déclaration du Dr. <a href="../../../../../../../../../../people/BakerRobertML/index.html">Robert
  M. L. Baker</a>, Jr., dans ces proceedings. D'autres parties de la réponse doivent être omises ici.</p>
<h3><a id="case40"></a><a id="photo"></a>Pourquoi n'y a-t-il pas de nombreuses photos d'ovnis s'ils existent vraiment ?
</h3>
<p>
  Voici une question à laquelle je considère que les réponses disponibles restent insatisfaisantes. Je concède qu'il
  semble raisonnable de s'attendre à ce qu'il doive, au-delà des 20 dernières années, y avoir substantiellement plus de
  bonnes photos qu'on en connait exister. Bien que je ne considère pas ce mystère comme expliqué de manière
  satisfaisante, neither do I think that it can be safely concluded that the paucity of good photos disproves the
  reality of the UFOs. Many imponderables enter into consideration of this question. </p>
<h4>
  1. Quelques considérations générales</h4>
<p>
  If one had reliable statistics on the fraction of the population that carried loaded cameras with them at any randomly
  selected moment (I would guess it would be only of the order of one per cent) and had figures bearing on the
  probability that a UFO witness would think of taking a photo before his observation terminated, then these might be
  combined with available information on numbers of sightings to attempt crude estimates of the expected number of UFO
  photos that should have accumulated in 20 years. Then one would need to weight the data for likelihood that any given
  photo would find its way to someone who would make it known in scientific circles, and then this figure might be
  compared with the very small number of photos that appear to stand the test of the exceedingly close scrutiny photos
  demand. </p>
<p>
  A general rule among serious UFO investigators with whom I have been in touch is that the UFO photo is no better than
  the photographer (Hall). De nombreuses canulars photographiques ont été brought forth. A UFO photo can be sold; this
  attracts hoax and fraud to an extent not matched in anecdotal accounts. Many photos have been clearly established as
  fraudulent in nature; far larger numbers seem so suspicious on circumstantial grounds that no serious investigator
  gives them more than casual attention. </p>
<p>
  An interesting, even if very crude check on the likelihood of securing photos of UFOs from the general populace is
  afforded by fireball events. Le 25 avril <a href="../../../../../../6/index.html">1966</a>, a fireball, rated at about
  magnitude -10, arced northward across the northeastern U.S. From the total geographic area over which this fireball
  was visually detected, the population count is about 40 million persons. According to one account (Ref. 43), 200
  visual accounts were turned in, and I infer that only 6 photos were submitted. The fireball was visible for a
  relatively long time as meteors go, about 80 seconds, and was, of course, at a great altitude (25 to 110 km). That 6
  photos were submitted (at time of publication of the cited article) from a potential population of sighters of 40
  million might seem to argue that perhaps we really cannot expect to get many photos of UFOs. However, one of the
  principal reasons for citing the foregoing is to bring out the difficulties in drawing any firm conclusions. A
  phenomenon lasting 30 seconds scarcely permits the observer time to collect his wits and to swing into photographic
  action if he does have a loaded camera. UFO sightings have often extended over much longer than 30 seconds, by
  contrast, affording far better opportunity to think of snapping a photo. But, on the other hand, sighting a UFO in
  daytime at close range, judging from my own witness-interviewing experience, is a far more disconcerting and
  astonishing matter than viewing a brilliant meteor. Thus one can go back and forth, with so little assurance of
  meaningfulness of any of the relevant weight factors that the end result is not satisfactory. I simply do not know
  what to think about the paucity of good UFO photos, though I do feel uncomfortable about it. </p>
<h4>
  <a id="case40"></a>2. Cas 40. Corning (Californie), 4 juillet 1967</h4>
<p>
  Un cas qui pourrait shed at least a bit of light on the paucity of photos involves a multiple-witness sighting near
  dawn at Corning, Calif., on 7/4/67. I have interviewed four witnesses who sighted the object from two separate
  locations involving lines of sight at roughly right angles, serving to confirm the location of the object as almost
  directly over Highway 5 just west of Corning. Jay Munger, proprietor of an all-night bowling alley, was having coffee
  with two police officers, Frank Rakes and James Overton, when he spotted the object through the front window of his
  place. All three rushed out to the parking lot to observe what they described as a large flattened sphere or possibly
  un objet en forme de ballon de rugby [football américain], with a brilliant light shining upward from the top and a
  dimmer light shining down from the underside. The dawn light was such that the object was visible by reflected light
  even though the object's beams were discernible. It appeared at first to be hovering almost motionless at a few
  hundred feet above ground, and all three felt it lay about over Hwy. 5 (which estimate proved correct from sightings
  made on the highway by the independent witnesses). Their estimates of size varied from a diameter of maybe 50 feet to
  about 100 ft. It was silent, and the three men all emphasized to me that the quiet morning would have permitted
  hearing any kind of conventional aircraft engines. All three said they had never before seen anything like it. Munger
  decided to phone his wife to have her see the thing, and by the time he came back out from phoning, the object had
  moved southward along the highway by about a quarter of a mile or so. At about that juncture, it began to accelerate,
  and moved off almost horizontally, passing out of sight to the south in an additional time estimated at about 10-20
  seconds. </p>
<p>
  This case is relevant to the photo question since Officer Overton was on duty and had in his patrol car both
  binoculars and a loaded camera. When I asked him why he didn't try to get a picture of the object, he admitted that he
  was so astonished by the object that he never even thought of dashing for the camera. I asked Munger to go through the
  motions that would yield a time estimate of the period he was inside phoning, to get a rough notion of how long
  Overton, along with Rakes, looked at it without thinking of the camera. The time was thus estimated by Munger as about
  a minute and a half, possibly two minutes. </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. — It may be hazardous to try to draw any conclusions from such a case. but I do think it suggests
  the uncertainty we face in trying to assess the likelihood of any given witness getting a photo of a UFO he happens to
  see. A colleague of mine at the University of Arizona was out photographing desert flowers on a day when a most
  unusual meteorological event occurred nearby — a tornado funnel came down from a cloud. Despite having the loaded
  camera at hand, despite having just been taking other pictures, and despite the great rarity of Arizona tornadoes,
  that colleague conceded that it wasn't till much later that the thought of getting a photo rose to consciousness, by
  which time the funnel was long since dissipated. </p>
<p>
  In the Trinidad, Colo. case of March 23, 1966 (Cas 14 above), Mrs. Frank R. Hoch pointed out to me that she had loaded
  still and movie cameras inside the house, yet never thought about getting a photo. Again, the reason cited was the
  fascination with the objects being viewed. I think this "factor of astonishment" would have to be allowed for in any
  attempt to estimate expected numbers of hotos, but I would be quite unsure of just how to evaluate the factor
  quantitatively.</p>
<h4>
  <a id="case41"></a>3. Cas 41. Edwards AFB, 3 mai 1957</h4>
<p>
  Occasionnellement, one could argue, UFOs ought to come into areas where there were persons engaged in photographic
  work, who were trained to react a bit faster, and who would secure some photos. One such instance evidently occurred
  at Edwards AFB on the morning of 5/3/57. I have managed to locate and interview three persons who saw the resultant
  photos. The two who observed the UFO and obtained a number of photos of it were James D. Bittick and John R. Gettys,
  Jr, both of whom I have interviewed. They were at the time Askania cameramen on the test range, and spotted the
  domed-disc UFO just as they reached Askania #4 site at Edwards, a bit before 8:00 a.m. that day. They immediately got
  into communication with the range director, Frank E. Baker, whom I have also interviewed, and they asked if anyone
  else was manning an Askania that could be used to get triangulation shots. Since no other camera operators were on
  duty at other sites, Baker told them to fire manually, and they got a number of shots before the object moved off into
  the distance. Bittick estimated that the object lay about a mile away when they got the first shot, though when first
  seen he put it at no more than 500 yards off. He and Gettys both said it had a golden color, looked somewhat like an
  inverted plate with a dome on top, and had square holes or panels around the dome. Gettys thought that the holes were
  circular not square. It was moving away from them, seemed to glow with its own luminosity, and had a hazy, indistinct
  halo around its rim, both mentioned. The number of shots taken is uncertain; Gettys thought perhaps 30. The object was
  lost from sight by the time it moved out to about five miles or so, and they did not .see it again. They drove into
  the base and processed the film immediately. All three of the men I interviewed emphasized that the shots taken at the
  closer range were very sharp, except for the hazy rim. They said the dome and the markings or openings showed in the
  photos. The photos were shortly taken by Base military authorities and were never seen again by the men. In a session
  later that day, Bittick and Carson were informed that they had seen a weather balloon distorted by the desert
  atmospheric effects, an interpretation that neither of them accepted since, as they stated to me, they saw weather
  ballons being released frequently there and knew what balloons looked like. Accounts got into local newspapers, as
  well as on wire services (Ref. 44). An Edwards spokesman was quoted in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> as saying, "This
  desert air does crazy things," An INS wire-story said, "intelligence officers at Edwards ... would say almost nothing
  of the incident." </p>
<p>
  <i>Discussion</i>. -- I have not seen the photos alleged to have been taken in this incident, I have only interviewed
  the two who say they took them and a third person who states that he inspected the prints in company with the two
  Askania operators and darkroom personnel. I sent all of the relevant information on this case to the University of
  Colorado UFO project, but no checks were made as a result of that, unless done very recently. It would be rather
  interesting to see the prints. </p>
<p>
  4. Photographic sky-survey cameras might be expected to get photos of UFOs from time to time. However, one finds that,
  in many sky-photography programs in astronomy, tracks that do not obviously conform to what is being sought, say
  meteor-tracks, are typically ignored as probable aircraft. Indeed, a very general pattern in all kinds of monitoring
  programs operates to bias the system against seeing anything but what it was built to see. Nunn-Baker satellite
  cameras are only operated when specific satellites are computed to be due overhead, and then the long axis of the
  field is aligned with the computed trajectory. Anything that crosses the field and leaves a record on the film with an
  orientation markedly different from the predicted trajectory is typically disregarded. Photographic, radar, and visual
  observing programs have a large degree of selectivity intentionally built into them in order not to be deluged with
  unwanted "signals". Hence one must be rather carefnl in suggesting that our many tracking systems surely ought to
  detect UFOs. There's much evidence to suggest that, if they did, the signal would be ignored as part of a systematic
  rejection of unwanted data. Even in the practices of the <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../org/us/dod/af/goc/index.html">GOC</a>, some units received instructions to
  report nothing but unidentified aircraft. (But, for examples of some UFOs that did get into the GOC net, see Hall,
  Ref. 10.) </p>
<p>
  Although I am aware of a few photos allegedly showing UFOs, for which I have no reason at present to doubt the
  authenticity (for example a series of snapshots taken by a brother and sister near Melbourne, Australia, showing a
  somewhat indistinct disc in various positions), I must emphasize that the total sample is tiny. Compared with that, I
  have seen dozens of alleged UFO photos which I regard as of dubious origin. Other UFO photos of which I am aware are
  still in process of being checked in one way or another. To summarize, I do have the impression that we ought to have
  more valid UFO photos than the small number of which I am aware. </p>
<h3><a id="physical"></a>Si les ovnis sont réels, ne devraient-ils pas produire de véritables effets physiques ?</h3>
<p>
  Again, the answer is that they do. There are rather well-authenticated cases spanning a wide variety of "physical
  effects." Car-stopping cases are one important class. UFOs have repeatedly been associated with ignition failures and
  light-failures of cars and trucks which came near UFOs or near which the UFOs moved. I would estimate that one could
  assemble a list of four or five dozen such instances from various parts of the world. Interference with radios and TV
  receptions have been reported many times in connection with UFO sightings. There are instances where UFOs have been
  reported as landing, and after departure, holes in the ground, or depressions in sod, or disturbed vegetation patterns
  have been described. In many such instance's, the evident reliability of the witnesses is high, the likelihood of hoax
  or artifice small. A limited number of instances of residues left behind are on record, but these are not backed up by
  meaningful laboratory analyses, unfortunately. </p>
<p>
  A physical effect that does <i>not</i> typically occur under conditions where the description of events might seem to
  call for it, relates to sonic booms. Although there are on record a few cases where fast-moving UFOs were accompanied
  by explosive sounds that might be associated with sonic booms, there are far more instances in which the reported
  velocity corresponded to supersonic speeds, yet no booms were reported. A small fraction of these can be rationalized
  by noting that the reporting witnesses were located back within the "Mach cone" of the departing UFO; but this will
  not suffice to explain away the difficulty. One feels that if UFOs are solid objects, capable of leaving depressions
  in soil or railroad ties when they land, and if they can dash out of sight in a few seconds (as has been repeatedly
  asserted by credible witnesses), they should produce sonic booms. This remains inexplicable; one can only lamely
  speculate that perhaps there are ways of eliminating sonic booms that we have not yet discovered; perhaps the answer
  involves some entirely different consideration. </p>
<p>
  If we include among "physical effects" those that border on the physiological, then there appear to be many odd types.
  Repeatedly, tingling and numbness have been described by witnesses who were close to UFOs; in many instances outright
  paralysis of a UFO witness has occurred. These effects might, of course, be purely psychological, engendered by fear;
  but in some instances the witnesses seem to have noted these effects as the first indication that anything unusual was
  occurring. A number of instances of skin-reddening, skin-warming, and a few instances of burns of very unusual nature
  are on record. These physiological effects are sufficiently diverse that caution is required in attempting
  generalization. Curiously, a peculiar tingling and paralysis seem to be reported more widely than any other
  physiological effects. A person who is almost unaware of the ramifications of the UFO evidence may think it absurd to
  assert that people have been paralyzed in proximity to UFOs; the skeptic might find it inconceivable that such cases
  would go unnoticed in press and medical literature. Far from it, I regret to have to say, on the basis of my own
  investigations. I have encountered cases where severe bodily damage was done, or where evident hazard of damage was
  involved, yet the witness and his family found ridicule mounting so much faster than sympathy that it was regarded
  wiser to quietly forget the whole thing. At an early stage of my investigations I would have regarded that as quite
  unbelievable; UFO investigators with longer experience than mine will smile at that statement, but probably they will
  smile with a degree of understanding. I could cite specific illustrations to make all this much clearer, but will omit
  them for space-limitations, except for a few remarks in the next section.
</p>
<h3><a id="hostility"></a>Y a-t-il quelque indice de danger ou d'hostilité dans les phénomènes ovnis ?</h3>
<p>
  Official statements have emphasized, for the past two decades, that there is no evidence of hostility in the UFO
  phenomena. To a large degree, this same conclusion seems indicated in the body of evidence gathered by independent
  investigators. The related question as to potential hazard is perhaps less clear. There are on record a number of
  cases (I would say something like a few dozen cases) wherein persons whose reliability does not seem to come into
  serious question have reported mild, or in a very few instances, substantial injury as the result of some action of an
  unidentified object. However, I know of only two cases for which I have done adequate personal investigation, in which
  I would feel obliged to describe the actions as "hostile". That number is so tiny compared with the total number of
  good UFO reports of which I have knowledge that I would not cite "hostility" as a general characteristic of UFO
  phenomena. </p>
<p>
  One may accidentally kick an anthill, killing many ants and destroying the ants' entrance, without any prior
  "hostility" towards the ants. To walk accidentally into a whirling airplane propeller is fatal, yet the aircraft held
  no "hostility" to the unfortunate victim. In the UFO phenomena, we seem to confront a very large range of unexplained,
  unconventional phenomena and if among them we discern occasional instances of hazard, it would be premature to adjudge
  hostility. Yet, as long as we remain so abysmally ignorant of over-all nature of the UFO problem, it seems prudent to
  make all such judgments tentative. If UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin, we shall need to know far more than we now
  know before sound conclusions can be reached as to hazard-and-hostility matters. For-this reason alone, I believe it
  to be urgently important to accelerate serious studies of UFOs. </p>
<p>
  In the remainder of this section, I shall briefly cite a number of types of cases that bear on questions of
  hazard: </p>
<h4>
  1. Cas d'arrêt de voitures</h4>
<p>
  Dans une période de 2 h près de minuit, du 2 au 3 novembre <a href="../../../../../../../5/7/index.html">1957</a>, 9
  véhicules differents all exhibited ignition failures, and many suffered headlight failures as objects described as
  about 100-200 ft long, glowing with a general reddish or bluish glow, were encountered on roads in the vicinity of the
  small community of Levelland, Tex. <span class="source">(Ref.
10, 13, 14)</span>. This series of incidents became national headline news until officially explained in terms of ball
  lightning and wet ignitions. However, on checking weather data, I found that there were no thunderstorms anywhere
  close to Levelland that night, and there was no rain capable of wetting ignitions. Although I have not located any of
  the drivers involved, I have interviewed Sheriff Weir Clem of Levelland and a Levelland newspaperman, both of whom
  investigated the incidents that night. They confirmed the complete absence of rain or lightning activity. The
  incidents cannot be regarded as explained. </p>
<p>
  Cette classe d'effet d'ovnis n'est en aucun cas rare. En France dans la vague d'observations d'ovnis de <a
    href="../../../../../../../5/4/index.html">1954</a>, <a
    href="../../../../../../../../../../people/MichelAime/index.html">Michel</a> <span class="source">(14)</span> a
  décrit many such cases involving ignition-failure in motorbikes, cars, etc. Similar instances were encountered in my
  checks on Australian UFO cases. There are probably of the order of a hundred cases on record <span class="note">(see
Ref. 10 for a list of some dozens)</span>. In only a very few cases has there been any permanent damage to the vehicle's
  electrical system. In the Levelland case, for example, as soon as the luminous object receded from a given disturbed
  vehicle, its lights came back on automatically (in instances where the switches had been left on), and the engines
  were immediately restartable. The latter point in itself makes the "wet ignition" explanation unreasonable, of course.
</p>
<p>
  It is unclear how such effects might be produced. One suggestion that has been made as to ignition-failure is that
  very strong magnetic fields might so saturate the iron core of the coil that it would drive the operating point up
  onto the knee of the magnetization curve, so that the input magnetic oscillations would produce only very small output
  effects. Only a few oersteds would have to be produced right at the coil to accomplish this kind of effect, but when
  one back-calculates, allowing for shielding effects and typical distances, and assumes an inverse-third-power dipole
  field, the requisite H-values within a few feet of the "UFO dipole" end, to speak here somewhat loosely, come out in
  the megagauss range. Curiously, a number of other back-calculations of magnetic fields end up in this same range; but
  obviously terrestrial technologies would not easily yield such intensities. Clear evidence for residual magnetization
  that might be expected in the foregoing hypothesis does not exist, so far as I know. The actual mechanism may be quite
  unlike that mentioned. </p>
<p>
  How lights are extinguished is even less clear, although, in some vehicles, relays in the lighting circuits might be
  magnetically closed. The lights pose more mystery than the ignition. Such cases do not constitute very disturbing
  questions of hazard or hostility. One might argue that highway accidents could be caused by lighting and ignition
  failures; however, more serious highway-accident dangers are implicit in other UFO cases where no electrical
  disturbance was caused. Many motorists have reported nearly losing control of vehicles when UFOs have swooped down
  over them; this hazard is distinctly more evident than hazard from the car-stopping phenomenon. Indeed, the number of
  instances of what we might term "car-buzzing" instances that have involved road-accident hazards is large enough to be
  mildly disturbing, yet I know of no official recognition of this facet of the UFO problem either. An incident I
  learned of in Australia involved such fright on the part of the passengers of the "buzzed''' vehicle that they jumped
  out of the car before it had come to a stop, and it went into a ditch. A similar instance occurred not long ago in the
  U.S. For reasons of space-limitations, I shall not cite other such cases, though it would not be difficult to assemble
  a list that would run to perhaps a few dozen. </p>
<h4>
  2. Mild radiation exposure </h4>
<p>
  By "radiation" here, I do not mean exposure to radioactivity or to other nuclear radiations, but skin irritations
  comparable to sunburn, etc. I have interviewed a number of persons who have experienced skin-reddening from exposure
  to (visible) radiations near UFOs. Rene Gilham, of Merom. Indiana, watched a UFO hovering over his home-area on the
  evening of Nov. 6. 1957, and received mild skin-burns, for example. I found in speaking with him that the symptoms
  were gone in a matter of days, with no after-effects. The witnesses in a car-stopping incident at Loch Raven Dam, Md.,
  on the night of Oct. 26, 1958, who were close to a brightly luminous, blimp-sized object after getting out of their
  stopped car, experienced skin-reddening for which they obtained medical attention. Without citing other such
  instances, I would say that these cases are not suggestive of any serious hazard, but they warrant scientific
  attention. </p>
<h4>
  3. More serious physical injuries </h4>
<p>James Flynn, of Ft. Myers. Fla., in a case that has been rather well checked by both APRO and NICAP investigators,
  reportedly suffered unusual injuries and physical effects when he sought to check what he had taken to be a
  malfunctioning test vehicle from Cape Canaveral that had come down in the Everglades, Mar 15, 1965. I have spoken with
  Flynn and others who know him and believe that his case deserved much more than the superficial official attention it
  received when he reported it to proper authorities. He was hospitalized for about a week, treated for a deep
  hemorrhage of one eye (without medical evidence of any blow), and suffered loss of all of the principal deep-tendon
  reflexes for a number of days, according to his physician's statement, published by APRO (Ref. 45). </p>
<p>
  An instance of more than mere skin-reddening, associated with direct contact with a landed unidentified object,
  reportedly occurred in Hamilton, Ontario, March 29, 1966. Charles Cozens, then age 13, stated to police and to
  reporters (and recounted to me in a telephone interview with him and his father) that he had seen two rather small
  whitish, luminous objects come down in an open field in Hamilton that evening. He moved towards them out of curiosity,
  and states that he finally moved right up beside them, and touched the surface of one of them to see what it felt
  like. It was not hot, and seemed unusually smooth. One of the two small (8 ft by 4 ft plan form, 3-4 feet high)
  bun-shaped objects had a projection on one end that the boy thought might have been some kind of antenna, so he
  touched it. only to have his hand flung back as a spark shot out from the end of the projection into the air. He ran,
  thinking first to go to a nearby police substation. But on looking over his shoulder after getting to the edge of the
  field and seeing no objects there, he decided the police might not believe him and ran to his home. His parents, after
  discussing the incident at some length with the frightened boy, notified police, which is how the incident became
  public knowledge. Two others in Hamilton saw that night seemingly similar objects, but airborne rather than on the
  ground. Cozens was treated for a burn or sear on the hand that had been in contact with the projection at the moment
  the spark was emitted. On questioning both the boy and his father, I was left with the impression that, despite the
  unusual nature of the report, it was described with both straightforwardness and concern and that it must be given
  serious consideration. Clearly one would prefer a number of adult witnesses to an individual boy; yet I believe the
  case will stand close scrutiny. </p>
<p>
  There are a few other such reports of moderate injury reportedly sustained in direct physical contact with landed
  aerial objects for which I do not set feel satisfied with the available degree of authentication. It would be very
  desirable to conduct far more thorough investigations of some foreign cases of this type, to check the weight of the
  evidence involved. That only a very small number of such cases is on record should be emphasized.</p>
<h4>
  4. Rares cas suggérant une hostilité ouverte </h4>
<p>
  De ma propre expérience d'enquêtes, je ne connais que 2 cas de blessures suffered under what might be describable as
  overt hostility, and for which present evidence argues authenticity. There are other reports on record that might be
  construed as overt hostility, but I cannot vouch for them in terms of my own personal investigations. </p>
<p>
  In Beallsville, Ohio, on the evening of March 19, 1968, a boy suffered moderate skin burns in an incident of puzzling
  nature. Gregory Wells had just stepped out of his grandmother's house to walk a few tens of yards to his parents'
  trailer when his grandmother and mother heard his screams, ran out and found him rolling on the ground, his jacket
  burning. After being treated at a nearby hospital, he described to parents, sheriff's deputies, and others what he had
  seen. Hovering over some trees across the highway from his location, he had seen an oval-shaped object with some
  lights on it. From a central area of the bottom, a tube-like a endage emerged, rotated around, and emitted a flash
  that coincided with ignition of his jacket. He had just turned away from it and so the burn was on the back of his
  upper arm. In the course of checking this case, I interviewed a number of persons in the Beallsville area, some of
  whom had seen a long cylindrical object moving at very low altitude in the vicinity of the Wells' property that night.
  There is much more detail than can be recapitulated here. My conversations with persons who know the boy, including
  his teacher, suggest no reason to discount the story, despite its unusual content. </p>
<p>
  After checking the Beallsville incident, I checked another report in which burn-injuries of a more serious nature were
  sustained in a context even more strongly indicative of overt hostility. I prefer not to give names and explicit
  citation of details here, but I remark that there appears to me, on the basis of my present information and five
  interviews with persons involved, to be basis for accepting the incident as real. Partly because of its unparalleled
  nature, and partly because some of the evidence is still conflicting, I shall omit details and state only that the
  case, taken together with other scattered reports of injuries in UFO encounters, warrants no panic response but does
  warrant far more thorough investigation than any that has been conducted to date. </p>
<h4>
  5. Ovnis et autres perturbations électromagnétiques</h4>
<p>
  Il y a tant de cas dans lesquels le passage rapproché d'un objet volant non-identifié a débouché sur une perturbation
  radio et télévision que ce mode particulier d'effet électromagnétique des ovnis semble incontestabl. Il ne faudrait
  rien de plus qu'un bruit électromagnétique de large spectre pour expliquer ces cas, bien sûr.</p>
<p>
  Il existe un nombre plus réduit de cas, dont certains ont été vérifiés par mes soins, dans lesquels le courant has
  failed only within an individual home coincident with nearby passage of a UFO. Magnetic saturation of the core of a
  transformer might conceivably account for this phenomenon. </p>
<p>
  Then there are scattered instances in which substantial power distribution systems have failed at or very near the
  time of observation of aerial phenomena similar, broadly speaking, to one or another UFO phenomenon. I have personally
  checked on several such instances and am satisfied that the coincidence of UFO observation and power outage did at
  least occur. Whether there is a casual connection here, and in which direction it may run, remains quite uncertain.
  Even during the large Northeast blackout, November 9, 1965, there were many UFO observations, several of which I have
  personally checked. I have inquired at the Federal Power Commission to secure data that might illuminate the basic
  question of whether these are merely fortuitous, but the data available are inadequate to permit any definite
  conclusions. In other parts of the world, there have also been reports of system outages coincident with UFO
  sightings. Again, the evidence is quite unclear as to casual relations. </p>
<p>
  There is perhaps enough evidence pointing towards strong magnetic fields around at least some UFOs that one might
  hypothesize a mechanism whereby a UFO might inadvertently trigger a power outage. Perhaps a UFO, with an accompanying
  strong magnetic field, might pass at high speed across the conductors of a transmission line, induce asymmetric
  current surges of high transient intensity, and thereby trip circuit breakers and similar surge-protectors in such a
  way as to initiate the outage. There are some difficulties with that hypothesis, of course; but it could conceivably
  bear some relation to what has reportedly occurred in some instances.</p>
<p>
  I believe that the evidence is uncertain enough that one can only urge that competent scientists and engineers armed
  both with substantial information on UFO phenomena and with relevant information on power-system electrical
  engineering, ought to be taking a very close look at this problem. I am unaware of any adequate study of this
  potentially important problem. Note that a problem, a hazard, could exist in this context without anything warranting
  the label of hostility.</p>
<h3><a id="summary"></a>Synthèse et recommandations</h3>
<p>
  En résumé, je souhaiterai souligné que ma propre étude du problème ovni m'a convaincu que nous devons rapidement
  escalate une attention scientifique sérieuse à ce mystère extraordinairement intriguant.</p>
<p>
  Je pense que la communauté scientifique a été sérieusement mal informée depuis 20 ans concernant l'importance
  potentielle des ovnis. Je ne souhaite pas développer ici ma propre interprétation de l'histoire derrière cette longue
  période de mauvaise information ; je souhaite seulement recommander au Commité sur la Science et l'Astronautique de
  prendre les étapes quelles qu'elles soient en leur pouvoir pour changer cette situation sans autre délai.</p>
<p>
  Le présent Symposium est une excellente étape dans cette dernière direction. J'incite fortement votre Comité à ce que
  d'autres efforts dans la même direction soient faits dans un futur proche. Je pense que des auditions étendues devant
  votre Comité, as well as before other Congressional committees having concern with this problem, are needed. </p>
<p>
  The possibility that the Earth might be under surveillance by some high civilization in command of a technology far
  beyond ours must not be overlooked in weighing the UFO problem. I am one of those who lean strongly towards the
  extraterrestrial hypothesis. I arrived at that point by a process of elimination of other alternative hypotheses, not
  by arguments based on what I could call "irrefutable proof." I am convinced that the recurrent observations by
  reliable citizens here and abroad over the past twenty years cannot be brushed aside as nonsense, but rather need to
  be taken extremely seriously as evidence that some phenomenon is going on which we simply do not understand. Although
  there is no current basis for concluding that hostility and grave hazard lie behind the UFO phenomenology, we cannot
  be entirely sure of that. For all of these reasons, greatly expanded scientific and public attention to the UFO
  problem is urgently needed. </p>
<p>
  The proposal that serious attention be given to the hypothesis of an extraterrestrial origin of UFOs raises many
  intriguing questions, only a few of which can be discussed meaningfully. Une question très standard du scepticisme est
  "Pourquoi aucun contact ?" Ici, la meilleure réponse est simplement une remarque cautionary that one would certainly
  be unjustified in extrapolating all human motives and reasons to any other intelligent civilization. It is conceivable
  that an avoidance of premature contact would be one of the characteristic features of surveillance of a less advanced
  civilization; other conceivable rationales can be suggested. All are speculative, however; what is urgently needed is
  a far more vigorous scientific investigation of the full spectrum of UFO phenomena, and the House Committee on Science
  and Astronautics could perform a very significant service by taking steps aimed in that direction.
