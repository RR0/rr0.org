  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  Even if our interest is in the study of UFO's as some sort of extraordinary physical phenomenon (whether of natural
  or, possibly, of intelligent, extraterrestrial origin), our study cannot ignore the inescapable fact that nearly all
  of our evidence comes -- not from physical measuring instruments -- but from human observers. So far, however, we have
  consistently sold the human observer short indeed, in neglecting to make use of psychologically oriented techniques
  that would more fully enable observers to bring to bear their really rather remarkable powers of perception and
  recognition, we may have been forfeiting the opportunity of obtaining evidence from independent observers that would
  be sufficiently convergent and well-defined to clarify the true nature of the phenomena.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The Extent to Which the Apparent Unpredictability of UFO Phenomena Hinders their Scientific Study</h2>
  <p>The scientific investigation of a set of phenomena becomes possible whenever those phenomena exhibit some
    discernible degree of order or pattern. Scientific study is of course greatly facilitated when, as in <a
        href="/science/discipline/hard/nat/univ/astro">astronomy</a>, the order strongly emerges in the form of a
    space-time pattern of the very occurrences themselves. For, only then, can we arrange to have suitably trained
    observers suitably "training" powerful and, hence necessarily, highly directional recording and measuring
    instruments on the right place at the right time.
  </p>
  <p>Indeed, by contrast with astronomical phenomena, those loosely classified together as "Unidentified Flying Objects'
    ("UFO's") or (with perhaps somewhat less commitment implied as to their real nature) "Unidentified Aerial Phenomena"
    sometimes appear almost inaccessible to scientific study. Certainly phenomena that are rare and fleeting are
    difficult enough but, if in addition they are totally capricious and unpredictable when they do occur, then the
    scientific method is to no avail and we are reduced to awaiting each new happening in the same primitive state of
    uncomprehending docility.
  </p>
  <p>The repeated successes of science, however, have encouraged us always to search for pattern and order even when
    none at first appears. And, although a scientific study does of course become enormously more difficult when the
    occurrences of the phenomena do not fall into any predictable pattern in space and time, it remains a possibility so
    long as some regularity exists within the phenomena themselves -- whenever they do happen to occur. Thus, in the
    field of psychopathology, even if it were the case that some psychological phenomena (such, say, as psychotic
    episodes) occurred wholly unpredictably -- striking any person at any time, quite at random, we could still study
    the internal patterns of such episodes when they do strike. We might for example find that when symptom A appears,
    it is usually accompanied by symptom B, but seldom by symptom C, and so on. This, too, is a kind of predictability
    and can even lead to a degree of understanding and perhaps, eventually, to a method of treatment.
  </p>
  <p>Similarly, in the case of UFO episodes, it may be possible to discover some regularities or patterns within these
    episodes even though any clear overall pattern in their mere occurrences (except, possibly for the tendency to
    unpredicted local concentrations in space and time) continues to elude us. This is not to say that efforts -- such
    as those of Michel <span class="source">Michel, A.: <i>Flying saucers and the straight-line mystery</i>. New York:
    Criterion Books, 1958.</span> and of Vallee and Vallee <span class="source">Vallee, J., and Vallee, J. <i>Challenge to science: The UFO enigma</i>. Chicago: Regnery, 1966.</span>
    -- to detect some overall pattern should not be pursued, but only that the attempt at a scientific study need not
    await a positive outcome of those efforts.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The Principal Sense in Which the Problem of UFO Phenomena is a Psychological Problem</h2>
  <p>In the meantime, a scientific study of these phenomena is not impossible -- just more difficult. For, we are faced
    for the most part with a problem -- not of making physical measurements -- but of interpreting verbal reports. We
    are faced, in short, with a problem amenable more to the methods of the psychologist than to those of the physical
    scientist.
  </p>
  <p>It is the principal purpose of this note to propose that, despite the relatively primitive state of development of
    psychological science, psychological and social scientists and even, indeed, law enforcement specialists have
    devised some techniques that could as well be applied to further the scientific study of UFO's.
  </p>
  <p>I do not mean to suggest by this that most reports of UFO's can probably be shown to arise from purely
    psychological aberrations such as illusions, hallucinations, delusions, after-images, and the like. On the contrary,
    a careful examination of most of the best-documented cases has convinced me -- as at least one psychologist who has
    studied rather extensively into the fields of normal and psychopathological perception -- that very few such cases
    can be explained along these lines. Indeed, I have the impression that the claims that the UFO's reported even by
    seemingly responsible citizens represent lapses of a basically psychopathological character have generally come from
    people who have neglected to study closely either into the literature on psychopathology, or into that on UFO's, or
    (in many cases, I fear) both.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The Desirability of Separating Three Psychologically Extreme Types of UFO Cases
  </h2>
  <p>I have so far ignored the reports of the so-called "contactees" and related cultists who seem to form a relatively
    distinct class and who are generally readily identifiable without the benefit of extensive psychological training.
    Insofar as possible, I should also like to disregard the reports of out-and-out hoaxters. Admittedly, however, these
    present a somewhat more troublesome problem to which we must return later -- particularly in connection with
    photographs and other types of alleged physical evidence.
  </p>
  <p>Of course there always are ambiguous cases which are difficult to place certainly within the triangle defined by
    the three, psychologically distinct "corners" representing the deluded contactee, the conscious pranksters, and the
    involuntary but responsible witness of some real but puzzling phenomenon. However, as has often been remarked, the
    existence of twilight does not deter us from distinguishing between night and day -- nor should it.
  </p>
  <p>In fact, <a href="/science">science</a> generally proceeds most rapidly by focusing first on the purest and most
    clear-cut cases, and by leaving for later any "mop-up" operation of dealing with the remaining cases that are to
    varying degrees complicated, mixed, messy, borderline, or obscure. Thus the social scientist who is primarily
    interested in studying the formation and perpetuation of delusional belief systems will do well to focus precisely
    on the members of the "<a href="/people/contactes.html">contactee</a>" cults, the archetypal examples of which are
    situated in the south-western United States and are heavily constituted by persons (often predominantly women rather
    past middle age) who have relatively little formal education together with a history of professed beliefs in the
    mystical, the spiritual, or the occult. Likewise, a clinical psychologist interested in the ways in which socially
    responsible adult behavior emerges or fails to emerge out of the play and testing behavior of childhood may learn
    something from an intensive study of any of the almost canonical cases of adolescent boys who, often in pairs and in
    accordance with an almost tiringly regular pattern, attain at least transitory notoriety by submitting their
    photograph of a "flying saucer" -- replete with dome, antenna, and, perhaps, portholes and fins.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just so, if we are, as here, primarily concerned with the possibility of unexplained but objective phenomena taking
    place within our atmosphere, then we should eschew not only the two pure sorts of cases just mentioned, but also the
    various more-or-less obscure or ill-defined cases falling somewhere within the "triangle." (Indeed, to throw all
    such intermediate cases together, without adequate regard for the reliability or credibility of each report -- as
    some investigators have tended to do for the purposes of compiling
    <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/statistique">over-all statistics concerning "UFO activity"</a> -- can, I think,
    lead to a largely uninterpretable picture. For, there is then no way of assessing or parceling out the "noise"
    contributed by the contactee, the prankster and, of course, the many well-meaning citizens who, under unusual
    circumstances, will continue to misidentify familiar phenomena.) Rather, we stand to learn most from an intensive
    study into those numerous cases represented by the remaining "corner" of the triangle in which converging evidence
    from apparently involuntary, independent, and responsible witnesses strongly points to the occurrence of an
    objective phenomenon of an unexplained character.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The potential contribution of psychological techniques to the study even of purely physical phenomena</h2>
  <p>Even though our primary interest is, then, on the unexplained objective and presumably physical phenomena that may
    give rise to such UFO reports, our problem remains as much a psychological as a physical one. For, the vast bulk of
    the data upon which we must base our scientific investigation comes -- not from physical recording or measuring
    devices -- but solely from one or more human observers. Moreover these are observers who were not, evidently,
    selected for their powers of observation or description and who have good reason to be reluctant as well --
    particularly in view of the likelihood of ridicule, often encouraged, curiously, by the very investigators who
    profess to be seeking the truth <span class="source">Fuller, J. G.: <em>Incident at Exeter</em>. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1966, (Also Berkeley Medallion
    Paperback, TM 757,375), pp. 211-220</span>
    <span class="source">Weitzel, W. ... <em>Into the middle of hell</em>. <i>Flying saucers: UFO reports #3</i>. New York: Dell Publishing
    Co., 1967. pp. 38-49.</span>.
  </p>
  <p>It is here, surely, that we have been most glaringly remiss in our attempts to put the investigation of UFO's on a
    scientific footing. We have, simply, failed to make anywhere near full use of the one recording and measuring
    instrument at our disposal; namely, our unwitting human witness.
  </p>
  <p>Now it is true that one of the more exotic psychological techniques, hypnotic regression, has already been
    attempted with interesting -- if considerably less than conclusive results in at least one UFO case of a rather
    sensational nature <span class="source">Fuller, J. G. <i>The interrupted journey</i>. New York: Dial Press, 1967, (Also Dell Paperback 4068).</span>.
    However, although astonishing claims have sometimes been made for the kind of detail that can be recovered under
    hypnosis <span class="source">e.g., par McCulloch
dans Von Foerster, H. (Ed.) <i>Cybernetics: Transactions of the eighth conference</i>. New York: Josiah Macy, Jr.
    Foundation, 1952, p. 100</span>, the results of controlled experiments on accuracy of recall have generally been
    less impressive <span class="source">Reiff, R., and Scheerer, M. <i>Memory and hypnotic age regression</i>. New York: International Univ. Press, 1959.
  </span>. More reliable, in my opinion, are some techniques based on certain psychological facts of a more mundane but
    better understood character.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>The power of methods guided by recognition rather than description in the reconstruction of a fleeting event</h2>
  <p>It is, I suppose, a fact familiar to us all that we can take in and remember much more information than we can
    readily communicate to others. Contrast, for example, how easily we recognize the face of a friend in a crowd with
    how difficult it is to describe that face so that any other person could then do it for us. Quite generally, our
    powers of recognition exceed our powers of description (and, indeed, surpass anything that we have yet been able to
    accomplish by physical instrument or machine). In an experiment on recognition memory, I once presented human
    subjects with over 600 different pictures, one right after the other, and then found that they could immediately
    distinguish between, those "old" pictures and otherwise completely comparable "new" pictures with median accuracy of
    over 98% <span class="source">Shepard, R. N. <em>Recognition memory for words,
    sentences and pictures</em>. <i>Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior</i>, 1967, 6, 156-163. (a)
  </span>. Even when the test was not given until a week later, the discriminations between "old" and "new" pictures
    were still 92% correct. Moreover, the advantage of recognition over verbal description, should become especially
    pronounced when the object or event to be remember is unfamiliar and, so, not uniquely or succinctly "captured" by
    readily available terms or labels.
  </p>
  <p>Over and over again, witnesses of "UFO's" have provided descriptions that, while they strongly suggest that a clear
    view was obtained of some well-defined but extraordinary object or phenomenon, leave the investigator frustratingly
    in the dark as to its precise appearance or behavior. A closely viewed, "spinning metallic" object is said, for
    example, to have been "mushroom-shaped," or to have resembled "an inverted top." But what does this mean? What sort
    of mushroom? With or without the stalk? And what on earth (!) is referred to, precisely, by "a 30 foot inverted
    top?"
  </p>
  <p>Some psychologists have been expressly studying the ways in which people come to describe nearly nondescript
    objects to others (e.g., Krauss & Weinheimer, 1964, 1966). Often a person will feel that the ambiguous term he comes
    up with (such, for example, as "an inverted top") does quite well. Possibly this is because he is picturing some
    particular interpretation (e.g. a particular toy that he played with as a child). For the listener who does not have
    that particular picture in mind, however, the description may prove either meaningless or, worse, completely
    misleading <span class="source">Glucksberg, S., Krauss, R. M., & Weisberg, R. Referential communication in nursery school children: Method and
    some preliminary findings. <i>Journal of Experimental Child Psychology</i>, 1966, 3, 333-342.</span>. An indication
    of the same sort of problem is the tendency of witnesses to say things like "it looked about the size of a
    football." Further circumstances make clear that they must have been referring to its apparent visual size rather
    than its real, physical size (which could, after all, hardly be estimated without also knowing its real, physical
    distance). More pertinently here, it appears that they were really talking more about its shape than its size.
    Possibly, the presence, so to speak, of a very vivid image in the mind of the witness causes him to lose sight of
    the total inadequacy of his verbal encoding of that image.
  </p>
  <p>This problem is already implicitly recognized in certain situations of more obviously pressing practical concern.
    Investigators in cases of homicide do not rest content with the weak and fuzzy descriptions typically offered by a
    witness but, in addition, may employ a skilled artist (such as Richard Kenehan of the New York Police Department) to
    work with the witness in an attempt to reconstruct a usable likeness of the murderer's face. The witness may be
    asked to select eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, or ears from series that are systematically graded in size and shape.
    The witness can then help to adjust their positions on an outlined face. This will generally provide a sufficiently
    concrete stimulus to enable the witness, finally, to become reasonably explicit about further refinements concerning
    hair, complexions, lines, scars, asymmetries, and so on. In a number of cases (such as the recent one in which
    Richard Speck was charged with the murder of several nursing students in Chicago) a likeness constructed in this way
    from a single surviving witness has proved remarkably accurate and, in more than one instance, has actually led to
    the apprehension of the criminal
    <span class="source">Schumach, M. Palette-packing cop. <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, August 24, 1958.</span>.
  </p>
  <p>This provides perhaps the most directly pertinent substantiation for the one central point that I want to leave
    with those concerned with the investigation of UFO's. Briefly, it is this: Even when an event occurs without
    warning, leaves little time for careful observation and, indeed, occasions extreme fear or anxiety, the average
    witness often retains an accurate, almost photographic record of the event -- a record, moreover, that can be
    largely recovered from him even though he lacks the words to describe it himself. Possibly then, in allowing our
    investigations to depend solely upon our informant's inadequate, his misleading and, yes, his sometimes even
    ludicrous choice of words, we have done both him -- and ourselves -- a telling disservice.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The desirability of establishing a system permitting convergence of independent reconstructions</h2>
  <p>Admittedly, in the case of UFO's, the value of information provided by a single, isolated witness -- however
    detailed that information may be -- is, by itself, always quite small (except, of course, for the witness himself!).
    For, from the standpoint of any other person, there is always at least the possibility of hallucination, delusion
    or, more likely, just plain fabrication. This is amply pointed up by the relative lack of evidential value of the
    many quite detailed photographs purported to have been taken of UFOs by solitary witnesses.
  </p>
  <p>It is only when there turns up an otherwise inexplicably close correspondence between the information furnished by
    two or more independent witnesses that the evidence becomes at all compelling at the public or scientific level. But
    we do not provide for even the possibility of a close correspondence unless we elicit sufficiently detailed
    information. Thus, when one person reports a "glowing mushroom-shaped object" while another, remote witness refers
    to the passage of an "inverted top," we have little basis for evaluating the likelihood that they have both observed
    a physical object -- let alone the same physical object.
  </p>
  <p>Now it is true that certain rather suggestive regularities have already emerged in the more or less spontaneous
    reports of observers. Among the very most common, for example, are the frequent references to disk-like shapes, to
    extraordinary velocities, to abrupt simultaneous changes of color and direction and, perhaps most strikingly, to the
    so-called "pendulum" or "falling-leaf" type of descent. Still, much more detailed information concerning such things
    as shape could presumably be extracted by techniques (akin to those already used in criminal cases) designed to take
    fuller advantage of the witnesses' usually untapped but vastly more discriminating powers of recognition.
  </p>
  <p>The point, here, is that such more detailed information is needed not merely for its own sake. It is needed, even
    before that, because the establishment of the very validity of the information in question hinges upon the
    demonstration of the kind of point-for-point correspondence between reports that becomes possible only when those
    reports are sufficiently detailed. If two, unrelated witnesses both claim to have seen a disk-shaped object at about
    the same time and place this is not sufficiently compelling. (Evidently! For it has already happened many times.)
    But, if artists working with the two witnesses, independently, construct pictures of what appears to be the very
    same object or, alternatively, if the two witnesses independently point to the very same drawing or photograph in an
    array of 50 or more different pictures of such objects, then the coincidence becomes more interesting. (And, of
    course, if the pictures reconstructed or singled out in this way just once turned out to coincide, also, with an
    actual photograph taken at the time, we should at last have opened the door for the more precise measurements of
    physical science-including the sophisticated and powerful photogrammetric methods being developed for the analysis
    and interpretation of lunar photographs.)
  </p>
  <p>The establishment of a pre-tested and standardized procedure for reconstructing information by the sort of
    psychologically oriented techniques envisaged here, moreover, would be incomparably cheaper than the implementation
    of other more physically oriented schemes that have sometimes been proposed -- such as the construction of a
    far-flung network of automatic radar-and-camera stations. For, instead of having simultaneously to cover all
    possible sites in advance, we could simply move in to recover the desired information after an incident is first
    reported.
  </p>
  <p>There is, however, one unavoidable aspect of the psychologically oriented type of approach proposed here that I,
    anyway, regard as quite regrettable. To the extent that any detailed pictures reconstructed by these techniques are
    made publicly available, we cannot guarantee that pictures obtained from subsequent witnesses will be suitably
    independent for our purposes. Consequently, rather tight security precautions would have to be imposed on the more
    detailed reconstructions, if the purely scientific purposes of the investigation are not to be compromised.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The use of concrete stimuli to provide a basis for the independent, recognition-guided process of
    reconstruction</h2>
  <p>
    The need for ensuring independence of information supplied by different witnesses is in fact so great that it is
    doubtful whether much reliance could safely be placed on different pictures reconstructed with the help of the same
    artist. Despite the best intentions of the artist, he might unwittingly guide different witnesses along somewhat
    similar channels by means of subtle, perhaps unconscious cues <span class="source">Rosenthal, R. <i>Experimenter effects in behavioral research</i>. New York: Meredith Publishing Co., 1966.</span>.
    Moreover, even if a different artist could be supplied for each witness, we would still be left with the problem of
    evaluating the likelihood that any two pictures constructed in this way could have turned out as similarly as they
    did by chance alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    For these reasons and for reasons of feasibility, convenience, and economy, it would be preferable to develop a
    standardized set of materials containing suitably representative and graded series of shapes to which each witness
    could independently respond. Some such materials would be needed, in any case, in order to provide stimuli suitable
    for tapping the witnesses' powers of recognition. Possibly even separate arrays should be constructed for
    distinguishable parts such as "domes" or other projections (just as separate series of eyes, or mouths may be
    helpful to the witness in criminal cases). By means of suitable standardization and control in the preparation and
    presentation of such materials, then, we could be reasonably sure that the responses of one witness are not unduly
    influencing the choices of another. Moreover, since each witness would make his choices from a pre-tested, fixed set
    of alternatives of known size, we would be in a favorable position to assess the probability that any coincidences
    of choice might have occurred merely by chance.
  </p>
  <p>All things considered, the best procedure might be to divide the questioning of a witness into the following three
    distinct phases:
  </p>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>the recording of the witness describing what he saw as completely as he can, in his own words, and without any
      cues (whether verbal or pictorial) that might bias him in one direction or another;
    </li>
    <li>the recording of his responses to the standardized, pictorial materials;</li>
    <li>(if the case seems to warrant it) the foil reconstruction of a new picture with the help of a suitably trained
      artist. Such a new picture, if sufficiently novel or well-defined, might then be incorporated in future revisions
      of the materials used for the second phase of the interview.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The effectiveness of the proposed procedure would depend very heavily upon the amount of thought, care, skill and,
    above all, pretesting that went into the preparation of the materials. The arrays of alternative shapes should of
    course include all types of shapes that have been clearly described, sketched, or (allegedly) actually photographed
    by some previous witness of at least reasonable reliability. One helpful attempt at systematizing the kinds of
    shapes that have been reported has in fact already been published <span class="source">Hall, R. H. (ED.) <i>The UFO evidence</i>. National
    Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, 1530 Connecticut Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C., 1964, p. 144</span>.
    However, more extensive and refined work would be necessary in order to cover the great variety of reported shapes,
    and to do this in a sufficiently concrete and realistic manner to promote recognition and, possibly, further
    specification by witnesses.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>The Use of Photographs of Alleged UFOs as a Source of Concrete Test Materials</h2>
  <p>Since photographs represent an especially tempting vehicle for the hoaxter and, in addition, are easily faked, they
    are individually of little value as evidence -- except in the rare cases in which there were independent,
    corroborating eyewitnesses. Photographs purporting to be of UFOs are, however, surprisingly numerous. (I myself have
    assembled well over 150 distinct such photographs merely from published reports.) Moreover, since at least one of
    these photographs might be authentic and since we have no sure way of knowing in advance which one it might be, we
    can not afford to eliminate any distinct type that hasn't already been proved to be a fraud. In the meantime,
    moreover, the other, spurious photographs can serve (in somewhat the same way as the non-suspects in a police
    "line-up") as a means of assessing consistency of choice or, contrary-wise, mere guessing on the part of different
    witnesses.
  </p>
  <figure class="right side">
    <figcaption>UFO Shape Array</figcaption> <img src="p229shapes.jpg" alt="UFO Shape Array"/>
  </figure>
  <p>The accompanying figure reproduces drawings in which I have tried to portray, as accurately as I could,
    representative objects from 63 of these photographs. The greater contrast of the drawings renders them more readily
    duplicatable than the original photographs. Moreover, I was also able in this way to reduce them all to uniform size
    and to eliminate background details which, although useful for estimating size or gauging authenticity, are only
    distracting for present purposes. Some of the photographs are from well documented or widely publicized cases while
    others are of more obscure or dubious origin. At least two cases have subsequently been admitted to be hoaxes, while
    circumstances surrounding some of the others make them difficult to dismiss in this way.
  </p>
  <p>Nevertheless, the single most striking tiling about these pictures -- far from [there] being any general uniformity
    in their appearance -- is their largely irreconcilable diversity. Whether or not this diversity is interpreted as
    detracting from their value as evidence, it surely cannot be taken as contributing to that value. It does, however,
    serve our immediate, rather different purpose of providing an initial sample from which to extrapolate and
    interpolate an eventual graded array of the sort that we seek for purposes of testing witnesses.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Some Incidental Comments on the Status of Photographs of Alleged UFOs as a Source of Evidence Themselves</h2>
  <p>Before leaving the photographs themselves, however, it should be noted that there are a few instances of rather
    suggestive similarities between these photographs. A frequently cited case is the striking resemblance between E6,
    reportedly taken by a farmer, Paul Trent, as he was returning home with his wife near McMinnville, Oregon in June
    1950, and ET, allegedly taken by a French military pilot near Rouen, France in <time>1954-03</time>.
  </p>
  <p>Another example, involving several different sightings, is shown in the upper right. G1, G2, and. G3 present three
    successive views of the same object purportedly taken by a photographer, Ed Keffel, of the Brazilian publication "O
    Cruziero" while he was accompanied by a journalist, Joao Martins, near Rio de Janeiro in May, 1952. The edge-on
    view, G1, is almost indistinguishable from another photograph, represented in F1, allegedly taken from an Argentine
    pursuit plane in late <time>1954</time>. The "top" view, G2, seemingly resembles F2 (the left edge of which was cut
    off by the boundary of the original photograph), which a 15-year-old boy, Michael Savage, claims to have taken near
    San Bernardino, California in <time>1956-07</time>. It also somewhat resembles the lighted object, F3, allegedly
    appearing in a color photograph taken by Joseph Sigel near Waikiki, Hawaii in June, 1959. And, finally, the "bottom"
    view, G3, presents the same general sort of configuration as that shown in G4, which is based upon a photograph
    purportedly taken by Yukuse Matsumura outside his residence in Yokohama, Japan in January 1957 (although the
    relative dimensions of the features appear slightly different in these last two photographs).
  </p>
  <p>
    There are several other instances in which photographs taken by apparently unrelated individuals might be of the
    same object. Another view (not included in the figure) showing more of the "bottom" of the object displayed in E4
    resembles the object shown in G5 and, even more closely, an object apparently hovering over a seaplane in still
    another photograph (also not included) of unknown origin. In a number of instances (e.g., F5, 6, and 7 or D6, 7, and
    8) the degree of correspondence is more difficult to assess owing to the relatively poorer definition of the images.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course even very close similarities do not in themselves guarantee authenticity. Consider, for example, C2 and C3
    which are strikingly similar despite the fact that the object in C2 appears over a mountain near Riverside,
    California in the original photograph reportedly taken by a 21-year-old man and two friends in 1951, whereas the
    object in C3 appears over a flock of grazing sheep in the photograph submitted by an Australian rancher in 1954.
    But, since the object in C2 has subsequently been admitted to be none other than a 1967 Ford hubcap, the object in
    C3 is presumably the same. (Another photograph later confessed to be fraudulent is represented in B6, and somewhat
    suspicious circumstances also surround several other photographs, including those represented in A9, B1, B8, B9, C1,
    and G8.)
  </p>
  <p>Perhaps the safest attitude to adopt is that recommended by the National Investigations Committee on Aerial
    Phenomena (cf., Hall, 1964, p. 86); namely, that the evidential value at least of still photographs depends entirely
    upon the surrounding circumstances. An isolated photograph about which little is known, no matter how impressive it
    may appear in itself, is essentially worthless -- except, possibly, in cases in which sophisticated photogrammetric
    analysis yields further detail tending to confirm the verbal account of the photographer. (I have heard that this
    has happened in at least one case; viz., that of the controversial series of Polaroid photographs -- one of which is
    represented in A8 -- taken by a California state highway employee, Rex Heflin, near Santa Ana in August 1965.) The
    photographs most worthy of further intensive investigation would seem to be those for which there also were reported
    to be many eyewitnesses as well as other, corroborating photographs -- as in the celebrated case of the
    "saturn-shaped" object (A1) that was said to have been photographed from an oceanographic vessel near the Brazilian
    island of Trindade in January 1958 <span class="source">Lorenzen, C. B. <i>Flying saucers: the startling evidence of
    the invasion from outer space</i>. New York: Signet, 1966, (Signet Paperback T3058), pp. 145-153, 164-174)</span>.

  <h2>The Assessment of the Representativeness of a Set of Recognition Test-materials.</h2>
  <p>Even though an extensive effort is made to represent every sort of shape that has been reliably described,
    sketched, or photographed, the possibility will remain that the collection of proposed test materials will not be
    sufficiently representative. Certain types of completely fraudulent shapes may unnecessarily inflate the already
    unwieldy collection and, more seriously, some significant types may still be missing. There are, however, ways of
    assessing the representativeness of any proposed collection of shapes. One is, simply, to have people describe these
    shapes and then to look for any pronounced departures of the relative frequencies of the various descriptive terms
    used from the corresponding relative frequencies in reports issuing from actual sightings of UFOs. My research
    assistant, Miss Shelley Meltzer, carried out an exploratory attempt at this sort of thing that may help to
    illustrate some of the relevant considerations.
  </p>
  <p>From our total sample of photographs, 75 that seemed suitably representative were selected for this preliminary
    study. These included most of the 63 already portrayed in the accompanying figure, but those that were known or
    strongly suspected to be fraudulent were eliminated and a number of others of less sharply defined shape were added
    (since many reports indicate that the shape was not clearly visible). Each of 19 subjects, mostly students at
    Harvard University, then looked through one of three subsets of 25 of these photographs and, for each, attempted to
    describe the pictured object in their own words. (Immediately following that, each subject then looked through
    another subset of 25 and, this time, indicated the appropriateness for each photograph of each term in a fixed set
    that we had listed in advance on a standardized rating sheet. However this part of the experiment will not be
    considered in any detail here.) Of most immediate interest are the descriptive labels spontaneously produced in the
    19 x 25 or 475 subject-photograph encounters.
  </p>
  <p>These could now be compared with the descriptive labels appearing in a sample of 206 different representative
    reports of actual UFO sightings that Miss Meltzer had already extracted (for a different purpose) from a number of
    sources (mostly Edwards <span class="source">Edwards, F.: <i>Flying saucers-serious business</i>. New
    York: Lyle Stuart, 1966, (Also Bantam paperback S3378)</span>; Hall <span class="source">Hall, R. H. (ED.) <i>The UFO evidence</i>. National
    Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, 1530 Connecticut Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C., 1964</span>; Michel
    <span class="source">Michel, A. <i>The truth about flying saucers</i>. New York: S. G. Phillips, 1956. (Also Pyramid Paperback T-1647)
  </span>; Olsen <span class="source">Olsen, T. M. (Ed.) <i>The reference for outstanding UFO sighting reports</i>. UFOIRC, Inc., Dept SM 518, P.O. Box
    57, Riderwood, Maryland, 21139, 1966.</span>; Ruppelt <span class="source">Ruppelt, E. J. <i>The report on unidentified flying objects</i>. New York:
    Doubleday, 1956. (Also Ace Books paperback G-537)</span> ; and Vallée <span class="source">Vallee, J. <i>Anatomy of a phenomenon</i>. New York: Ace Books, 1965 (Paperback).</span>).
    The accompanying table lists those descriptive terms that pertain to visual appearance but, for purposes of
    comparison with the mostly black-and-white photographs, excludes the many references to (chromatic) color. With one
    exception (#33), only terms that appeared at least twice in the sample of 206 actual reports are included, and these
    arranged in order of decreasing frequency of occurrence in that sample.

  <p>The two columns of numbers, then, present the resulting frequencies of occurrence (a) in the 206 actual UFO reports
    and (b) in the 475 opportunities for these same descriptive terms to arise in the experiment with the photographs.
    Direct numerical comparisons are somewhat hazardous owing to the different circumstances in which the two sets of
    descriptive terms arose. In terms merely of opportunities, the numbers in the second column should be about twice as
    large as those in the first. However, the totals for the two columns are nearly equal and, so, the real encounters
    evidently were relatively more productive of descriptive terms on the average. Numerically small departures or
    departures in which the second number is somewhere between the size of the first number and twice that size are
    probably not very significant therefore.
  </p>
  <p>The remaining positive and negative discrepancies of appreciable size are indicated by the plus and minus signs in
    the right-most column. Some of these are probably explainable in terms of the two-dimensional, achromatic, and
    stationary character of the photographs (e.g., #10 & 13), or in terms of differences in vocabulary to be expected
    between the unselected witnesses and the college-educated subjects of the experiment (e.g., #9 & 15). Other
    discrepancies, however, suggest either that some shapes, such as the so-called "cigar" (#7), were not adequately
    represented in the sample of photographs, or that some shapes, such as those most frequently said to resemble a
    "hat" (#33), are especially likely to have been of fraudulent origin. (Among the objects included in the above
    figure that were often said to be hat-like are C3, which we already noted is almost certainly a 1937 Ford hubcap;
    E4, which doesn't seem to fit very well with the usual descriptions of UFOs; and G2, which, although it too doesn't
    coincide with at least my notion of a "flying saucer," does however correspond rather closely with several other
    photographs.)

  <h2>The Use of the Computer in the Design of Recognition Test-Materials and in the Analysis of Results</h2>
  <p>Our sample of only 206 actual UFO cases is really too small and haphazard for the purpose of ensuring that all
    types of reported shapes are adequately represented in any proposed recognition array. Many descriptive terms that
    have repeatedly been used (such as "doughnut," "ring," "mushroom," flattened ball," "double-convex lens," "bullet,"
    "blimp," and "submarine") didn't happen to appear more than once in our particular sample). Ideally, for this work,
    one would like access to a centralized library of all reasonably documented cases -- suitably coded for retrieval
    via computer. Indeed, at present the scientific study of the UFO problem is greatly hampered by the circumstance
    that the thousands of reported sightings have not been adequately coded or systematized in any uniform way and are,
    in fact, still scattered among such diverse and often mutually hostile organizations as the U.S. Air Force, NICAP,
    APRO, and the University of Colorado Project -- not to mention a number of more-or-less private files assembled by
    individual investigators both here and abroad.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recent developments in computer technology &#8212; particularly in computer graphics &#8212; could be utilized,
    also, in the construction of arrays of shapes for a recognition test. Thus for any specified shape, the computer
    (together with suitable graphical output equipment) could automatically generate alternative pictures of the same
    object as viewed from any desired angle <span class="source">Noll, A. M. Stereographic projections by digital computer. <i>Computers and Automation</i>, 1965, 14, No. 5.</span>
    <span class="source">Zajac, E. E. <em>Programmed pictorial displays</em>. <i>Proceedings of the 1964 symposium on digital computing</i>.
    Bell Telephone Laboratories, 1964. pp. 33-44.</span>; and could even generate other test shapes intermediate between
    that shape and some other specified shape. (In fact, as on-line graphical facilities become more widely available,
    even a relatively unartistic witness, seated in front of a suitable display device, should be able to reconstruct
    his own object by techniques of these general sorts.)
  </p>
  <p>
    For the present, however, perhaps the most promising use of the computer in this connection would be in finding an
    optimum arrangement of the alternative test shapes in the recognition array. This is a matter of real concern owing
    to the large number of shapes that should be included. (Even the 63 exhibited in the above figure fall far short of
    covering all the varieties that have been sketched or described.) If the alternatives could somehow be arranged so
    that similar shapes are close together, then the witness could quickly narrow down to the most relevant region of
    the array in order to make his final, most refined discriminations.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to do this we would first need to obtain some measure of the perceived similarity between any two shapes.
    One could of course obtain a direct, subjective judgment of similarity from experimental subjects. However, it might
    be more convenient to obtain a derived measure of similarity based upon the frequency with which different subjects
    will sort the two shapes into the same pile, or upon the overlap in their application of the same descriptive terms
    to the two shapes in the kind of task described in the preceding section <span class="source">Rosenberg, S., Nelson, C., and Vivekananthan, P. W. A multidimensional approach to the structure of personality
    impressions. <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i>, 1968 (in press).</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once we have any such measure of similarity for every pair, we can apply powerful new computer-based methods for
    mapping the objects into a two-dimensional arrangement in such a way that their similarities are preserved, in so
    far as possible, in the spatial proximities among them <span class="source">Kruskal, J. B. Multidimensional scaling by optimizing goodness of fit to a nonmetric hypothesis.
    <i>Psychometrika</i>, 1964, 29, 1-27.</span> <span class="source">Shepard, R. N. <em>The analysis of proximities:
    Multidimensional scaling with an unknown distance function</em>. I. <i>Psychometrika</i>, 1962, 27, 125-140. II. <i>Psychometrika</i>,
    1962, 27, 219-246.</span> <span class="source">Shepard, R. N., and Carroll, J. D. <em>Parametric representation of nonlinear data structures</em>. In P. R.
    Krishnaiah (Ed.), <i>Multivariate analysis: Proceedings of an international symposium</i>. New York: Academic Press,
    1966. pp. 561-592.</span>. Moreover, these same methods could yield a quantitative metric of similarity that would
    then enable us to specify just how similar an object identified by one witness is to the object identified by
    another witness. Indeed, they could even tell us something about the basic dimensions along which UFO phenomena
    differ or, with the help of recently perfected methods for "hierarchical clustering" <span class="source">[Johnson,
1967]</span>, they could provide an indication of the basically different classes into which these phenomena undoubtedly
    fall.
  </p>
  <p>
    Possibly, some of these classes of unidentified aerial phenomena will turn out to be of purely natural origin. I
    once even ventured to suggest this for certain puzzling types of cases myself
    <span class="source">Shepard, R. N. <em>Tornadoes: Puzzling phenomena and photographs</em>. (Letter to Editor). <i>Science</i>, 1967,
    155, 27-28.</span> &#8212; though, admittedly, attempts to develop such explanations in terms of known principles of
    atmospheric physics, generally, have run into competent and serious criticism
    <span class="source">McDonald, J. E. <em>UFOs -- atmospheric or extraterrestrial?</em> Talk presented to the Chicago Chapter of the American Meteorological Society, May 31, 1968.
    (See, also, his contribution to this volume.)</span>. Still. even if some of the phenomena <i>are</i> of natural
    origin, a more complete and accurate characterization of their appearance and behavior should be of some interest to
    the physical scientist &#8212; indeed, all the more so to the extent that they appear to conflict with known
    physical principles.
  </p>
  <p>
    In any case, it appears that techniques now exist that could provide the basis for a psychologically oriented, but
    genuinely scientific investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena, whatever their nature may ultimately prove to
    be.
