<h2>Note de RR0</h2>
<p>Cette version a pour but : </p>
<ul>
  <li>la diffusion francophone du rapport Condon</li>
  <li>une meilleure adéquation à la lecture sur le Web
    <ul>
      <li>références numérotées remplacées par des liens hypertexte</li>
      <li>rien "retour en haut" supprimés (le bouton "back" des navigateurs suffit)</li>
      <li> balises de formatage (couleurs, fontes, positionnement) remplacées par une feuille de style</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>une meilleure adéquation à l'impression
    <ul>
      <li>pas de "sauts de page" (de toute façon indétectables sur un document Web) coupant le texte</li>
      <li>pas de liens "retour" superflus</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>une meilleure information
    <ul>
      <li>ajout de liens hypertexte vers les descriptions de personnes et affaires connues</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Les textes proposés par des liens internes (renvoyant vers des descriptifs de personnes, projets, etc.) ne font pas
  partie du document originel.</p>
<h2>Général</h2>
<p>
  Comme pour d'autres documents mis en ligne par RR0, la priorité à été donnée au contenu, à l'ergonomie et la
  lisibilité en ligne plutôt qu'une tentative de reproduction de l'apparence du document d'origine :

</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Les sauts et numéros de pages ont été enlevés, afin de ne pas couper la lecture et permettre une impression évitant
    ces "faux" sauts de page (les sauts de pages n'existent pas dans les documents Web puisqu'ils sont remplacés par
    l'hypertexete). Cela évite également les problèmes de lignes "veuves" ou "orphelines".</li>
  <li>
    GPO used two font sizes for most of the document: larger for oral statements by committee members and witnesses,
    smaller for written statements entered into the record. We have preserved this size difference, but have not
    attempted to control exactly which font the reader sees; font settings for your browser remain under your control.
    Font <i>size</i> settings also remain under your control, but you will always see a <i>difference</i> in size
    between oral and written statements.

  </li></ul>

<h2>Autres aspect de "Look and Feel"
</h2>
<p>
  Certain specific items in the Symposium record required individual treatment, either because they deviated from the
  general typographical conventions of the document, or because we found it necessary to introduce such deviations
  ourselves:

</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In the GPO format of the original record, each speaker was identified as he spoke in much the same manner as actors
    in a dramatic script, but in a style that is time-consuming to code in HTML. That style uses all uppercase letters
    with capitals differentiated by size. Here is an example:
    <blockquote>
      <big>M</big>
      <small>R</small>
      . <big>R</big>
      <small>oush</small>
      : We will now hear from Dr. Hall.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In place of this scheme, speaker identifications have been done in boldface with standard upper- and lowercase
      lettering.

    </p></li>
  <li>
    Some materials from Dr. Baker and Dr. Walker appear in typewritten form, apparently simply photocopied from their
    original papers and inserted into the record "as-is" by GPO. We have preserved this aspect of the GPO document. Your
    browser's "fixed-size" font should be set to a typewriter-like front such as Courier for this material to be seen in
    the form GPO intended.

  </li><li>
  Dr. Salisbury's written statement was a photocopy of one of his journal publications, using a three-column
  magazine-style layout. This does not work well on the screen, so the columnar layout was eliminated. Also, certain
  graphic images in Dr. Salisbury's article were positioned badly (separated physically from their associated text); we
  took the liberty of placing these images with the text that refers to them.

</li></ul>

<h2>Erreurs dans l'original</h2>
<p>
  There were several kinds of errors in the Symposium record to be dealt with:

</p>
<ul><li>
  Ordinary typos, where the correct spelling was obvious, were simply corrected without noting the correction.

</li><li>
  Omitted words, where the word that would fill the gap was fairly obvious, have been filled in with the filler word
  enclosed in square brackets.

</li><li>
  In some cases, the correct word[s] could not be determined; these have been flagged with the standard "sic" notation.

</li><li>
  Some lengthy transcription errors resulted in entire sentences being garbled. Correcting these involved an exercise of
  judgment as to what the speaker actually intended to say. Where they occur, they are explained with an "NCAS Editor's
  Note."

</li></ul>

<h2>Tableaux et graphiques</h2>
<p>
  Tables and graphics in the Symposium record were of uneven quality, so preserving their information content in the
  transition from paper to monitor screen was a persistent problem:

</p>
<ul><li>
  The photographs in the symposium record were standard halftone prints, made up of a large number of small dots similar
  to the photographs in a newspaper but with somewhat higher resolution. It was necessary to apply "gamma correction"
  and brightness/contrast adjustments to some of them, in order that the on-line images would display more shades of
  gray, plus some fine detail that had been obscured in the original raw scan.

</li><li>
  In other cases (mostly graphs and labeled drawings), the size adjustment necessary to fit the image to the screen
  resulted in an unacceptable loss of detail. In those cases, we have included a copy of the image in its original size,
  available as a link from the screen-fitting image. Even then, some fine detail such as small text labels might be
  obscure. In those cases, the image can be saved on your machine and viewed with an image editor that has a "zoom"
  feature.

</li><li>
  A number of image scans show noticeable "bleed-through" of text from the reverse side of the original page. GPO used
  unusually thin paper in printing the record, and we had only limited success in our efforts to correct this problem.

</li><li>
  The physical appearance of the tables deviates from that of the tables as typeset in the original record. The HTML
  "table" construct has been utilized to take advantage of the inherent flexibility of the browser in the display of
  tabular data. The tables will expand and contract as the user moves the margins back and forth to enhance readability.
  The data in the tables are unaltered.

</li></ul>

<h2>Navigation
</h2>
<p>
  We have incorporated a number of features similar to those in the Colorado report, to assist the reader in moving
  through the Symposium record:

</p>
<ul><li>
  Each item in the table of contents is a link to the contribution of a single Symposium participant. Some participants
  were witnesses, appearing in person and giving oral testimony; these participants also contributed written statements
  for inclusion in the record. Other participants did not appear in person, but provided written statements.

</li>
  <li>
    Inside each main item is a set of sub-links to the testimony and written
    <nobr>statement[s]</nobr>
    of the participant. In some cases, these written statements are themselves provided with sub-links. In almost every
    case, the reader is no more than five or six pages away from a "BACK" link that leads eventually all the way to the
    title page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Graphic images are shown as "thumbnails" that link to the full screen-size version of that same image. This strategy
    promotes more rapid loading of the main text pages for each participant. The browser's "back-arrow" returns the
    reader to the place where the thumbnail appears.

  </li><li>
    All the graphic images from the Symposium have been collected into an additional set of thumbnails, linked off the
    main table of contents, for convenience in browsing these images.

  </li><li>
    Dr. McDonald's written statement contained an extensive numbered and dated list of sightings that he described in
    some detail to support his position. Many of these cases have also been described and commented on by other writers
    and investigative groups. For the convenience of the reader who might wish to compare the views of these other
    investigators with those of Dr. McDonald, an auxiliary table of contents (linked off the table of contents and from
    Dr. McDonald's statement) containing links to his case descriptions has been provided. It lists the cases both
    chronologically and grouped by type in the same manner as Dr. McDonald grouped them.

  </li></ul>
