<p>
  Thank you for your kind invitation (July 22, 1968) to submit a statement to you and your colleagues in regard to the
  problem of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). I recognize some of the difficulties which confront you gentlemen,
  particularly in relation to the amount of information which becomes available to you when you wish to arrive at
  informed decisions. Also, I recognize some of the difficulties which confront college professors, especially when they
  try to be lucid and brief! </p>
<p>
  Elsewhere, a more extensive attempt has been made to present views on the psychological implications of UFO reports.
  (Sprinkle, R. L&#8222; Psychological implications in the investigations of UFO reports. In Lorenzen, L. J., and Coral
  E., <i>Flying saucer occupants</i>. N.Y.: A Signet Book, 1967. pp. 160-186.) Thus, in submitting this short statement,
  the attempt is made to present my personal views on the significance of UFO investigations. Hopefully, these personal
  views can be of some assistance to you in considering the statements being submitted to you by the distinguished
  scientists whom you have .invited to .participate in the symposium.</p>
<h3>Visions personnelles sur l'enquête sur les ovnis</h3>
<p>
  I accept the hypothesis that the earth is being surveyed by spacecraft which are controlled by representatives of an
  alien civilization or civilizations. I believe the "spacecraft hypothesis' is the best hypothesis to account for the
  wide range of evidence of UFO phenomena. (For a more informed description of various UFO hypotheses, see Salisbury, F.
  B&#8222; The scientist and the UFO. <i>Bio-Science</i>, January 1967. pp. 15-24.) </p>
<p>
  I have read thousands of reports and I have talked with hundreds of persons about their UFO observations; either I
  must accept the view that thousands of people have observed physical phenomena, or I must accept the view that some
  persons have the ability to project mental images in such a manner that other persons can observe, photograph, and
  obtain physical evidence of those metal images. (For a more extended discussion of these hypotheses, see Jung, C. G.,
  <i>Flying Saucers</i>, N.Y.: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1959, Pp. 146-158.) </p>
<p>
  On two occasions, each time in the presence of a person who shares my claim, I observed unusual aerial phenomena which
  I could neither identify nor understand. My first observation of a "flying saucer" led me to change my position from
  "scoffer" to that of "skeptic." My second observation of a UFO led me to change my position from "skeptic" to
  "unwilling believer." </p>
<p>
  As a result of my second observation, I began to join organizations (NICAP and APRO) and conduct investigations. The
  Grants-in-Aids Committee of the Society for Psychological Study of Social Issues, a Division of the America
  Psychological Association, provided a small grant, and Richard Hall, former assistant director of NICAP, cooperated in
  a study of the attitudes of persons interested in UFO reports. (See enclosure.) Later, I became a consultant to APRO.
  Mr. and Mrs. L. J. Lorenzen, directors of APRO, encouraged my interest in learning more about the psychic aspects of
  UFO phenomena. </p>
<p>
  At the present time, I am conducting a non-supported investigation of some psychological attributes of persons who
  claim to experience psychic impressions of UFO phenomena, including their impressions of possible motives of UFO
  occupants. As a member of the Parapsychological Association and the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis, i am
  interested in the possibility that reliable observations are being made by persons who claim to see UFO occupants and,
  in some unusual cases, experience "mental communication" with these UFO occupants. Use of hypnotic techniques with UFO
  observers seems to be useful procedure, in some cases, to obtain further information about UFO observations. (See
  enclosure "Personal and Scientific Attitudes: A Survey of Persons Interested in UFO Reports.")</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>
  If these reports by UFO observers are found to be reliable and valid, I believe we shall enter the threshold of a most
  exciting and challenging period in man's history. In my opinion, the attempt to achieve contact with other intelligent
  civilizations is a goal which is worthy of great personal and social effort. </p>
<p>
  I plan to do what I can in furthering investigations of these phenomena, in hopes that these efforts can assist the
  contributions of other investigators. </p>
<p>
  However, I believe that the mysteries are too deep, the investigations are too difficult, and the implications are too
  great for these efforts to be made on an informal basis. I believe that the establishment of an international research
  center is the most appropriate method to follow in reaching the goal of greater understanding of these phenomena. If
  this method is not feasible, then I believe that a national research center is needed for continuous, formal
  investigation of the physical, biological, psycho-social, and spiritual implications of UFO phenomena. </p>
<p>
  Establishment of a continuing research center could provide for those facilities, equipment, and personnel to conduct
  the necessary field work and theoretical investigations of UFO reports. In my opinion, the staff of such a research
  center should be encouraged to avail themselves of scholars and experts in various disciplines, including
  astronomical, mathematical, physical, chemical, biological, medical, psychological, sociological, military, technical,
  legal, political, theological, and parapsychological fields of knowledge. </p>
<p>
  I recognize some of the difficulties which attend such a proposal; I recognize some of the arguments which have been,
  are being, and will be raised against such a proposal. However, I trust that you gentlemen are aware that the present
  difficulties of enacting such a proposal are inconsequential when compared to the historical impact created by those
  persons who dare to exert that leadership which could determine the powers, purposes, and persons who control the
  spacecraft which we call "Unidentified Buying Objects." </p>
<p>
  Thank you for your attention to these comments. I shall be most happy to respond to any question which you may have
  about these or related views. </p>
<p>
  Respectfully submitted, </p>

<p>
  A questionnaire survey was conducted among 3 groups: 26 Ph.D. faculty and graduate students in a Psychology Department
  (Psychology); 59 graduate students enrolled in an NDEA Guidance Institute (Guidance) ; and 259 members of an
  organization which is interested in "flying saucers" or Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), the National
  Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). It was hypothesized that there would be no differences between
  the scores of the three groups on the <i>Personal Attitude Survey</i> (Form D, Dogmatism Scale, Rokeach, 1960) and the
  <i>Scientific Attitude Survey</i> (Sprinkle, 1962). </p>
<p>
  The results showed significant differences (P&lt;.001 between the 3 groups with respect to their mean scores on both
  inventories, with the NICAP group scoring higher on both "dogmatic" and "scientific" inventories, followed by the
  Guidance group and Psychology group, respectively. Also, the survey showed differences in regard to social status and
  education. Psychology and Guidance subjects received an <i>Index of Social Status</i> (McGuire &amp; White, 1955)
  which would classify them in the Upper Middle Class, while NICAP subjects would be classified mainly in the Upper
  Middle and Lower Middle Classes. The average years of education were tabulated as follows: Psychology, 18.8 years;
  Guidance, 17.2 years; and NICAP, 14.0 years. </p>
<p>
  The results suggest that the NICAP group is more "dogmatic" and more "scientific" than the Psychology and Guidance
  groups. There are two feasible interpretations of these results: 1) <i>The Scientific Attitude Survey</i> (Sprinkle,
  1962) is not useful in assessing "scientific" attitudes, and/or 2) the two inventories have assessed the tendency of
  the 3 groups to exhibit the "Yeasay-Naysay" pattern (Couch &amp; Keniston, 1960). The latter interpretation indicates
  that there may be more "Yeasayers" (those with an agreeing response set or a readiness to affirm) in the NICAP group,
  followed by the Guidance group, and Psychology group, respectively.</p>

<h3>SOME USES OF HYPNOSIS IN UFO RESEARCH</h3>
<p>
  (By R. Leo Sprinkle, University of Wyoming) </p>
<h3>
  Résumé
</h3>
<p>
  First, a brief review of UFO literature is presented. References are cited which offer hypotheses (Salisbury, 1967) to
  account for UFO observations, and positions (Sprinkle, 1967) taken by various investigators in regard to the
  significance of UFO reports. </p>
<p>
  Second, examples are described in the use of hypnotic techniques in the investigation of persons who have observed UFO
  phenomena. Advantages and disadvantages of hypnosis are discussed in regard to obtaining further information from UFO
  observers. </p>
<p>
  Third, some speculations are offered in regard to the possible relationships of paranormal or ESP processes and the
  observations of UFO phenomena. Cases are described which indicate possible relationships of hypnotic and psychic
  experiences of UFO observers. </p>
<p>
  Fourth, some suggestions are presented for further investigation of UFO phenomena through the use of hypnotic and
  parapsychological procedures. These procedures may be useful to assess the reliability of information from UFO
  observers. </p>
<p>
  In conclusion, the speaker believes that investigation of UFO reports should proceed along as many lines as there are
  interested investigators. Considerations of hypnotic procedures and techniques are only one aspect of these
  investigations, but these considerations may be helpful in obtaining and evaluating information submitted by UFO
  observers. </p>
