<p>Les OVNIs -- Objets volants non identifiés, ou soucoupes volantes comme ils sont souvent trop appelés -- sont dans
  l'esprit du public depuis au moins 22 ans. Pour un certain nombre de raisons, nous connaissons un peu plus de choses
  sur eux aujourd'hui que nous n'en savions au début. Il existe ici une grande quantité d'informations erronées sur le
  phénomène non seulement dans les esprits du public, mais tout aussi bien parmi des groupes éduqués tels que les
  scientifiques. Le but de cette série d'essais est de décrire divers aspects du phénomène, rendre clairs mes préjudices
  et leurs raisons, et de suggérer un moyen de procéder sur ce problème intéressante et potentiellement très
  significatif.</p>
<p>Mais d'abord, quelques mots sur le terme OVNI. <a href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen/index.html">J. A. Hynek</a>, un <a
  href="/people/astronomes.html">astronome</a> ayant une implication continuelle avec l'étude des ovnis depuis plus de
  20 ans, définit les ovnis comme <q>tout observation aérienne ou de surface signalée visuellement ou par retour radar
    restant inexpliquée par les moyens conventionnels même après examen par des personnes compétentes. </q>Cette
  définition... ne spécifie ni volant ni objets <span class="source">[Christian Science Monitor, May 23, 1967]</span>.
  Je serais d'accord, mais préfèrerais remplacer <q>ou retour radar</q> avec <q>ou observation instrumentale</q> et <q>même

<p>Ceux familiers avec la littérature sur les ovnis savent que les signalements d'observations n'ont pas commencé avec
  l'observation d'<a href="/people/a/ArnoldKennethE/index.html">Arnold</a> en <a
    href="/time/1947.html">1947</a>, mais qu'une phénomenologie relativement semblable à celle rapportée aujourd'hui
  peut être trouvée dans des documents remontant aux premiers temps. <a

  original documents.</p>
<p>Qu'est-ce qui fut rapporté ? Des disques lumineux, des boucliers, des globes et des <a
  href="../../../../../../../../observation/pan/aspect/forme/cigare">objets allongés</a> dans le ciel, parfois seuls,
  parfois en grands nombres. Occasionaldescriptions of interactions with the observers are also mentioned,including
  landings, and seeing and communicating with occupants. The latterevents especially were almost always interpreted in a
  religious context. Un exemple récent est <a href="../../../../../../../../enquete/dossier/1917_Fatima/index.html">l'apparition
    répétée d'une phénoménologie ovni typique à Fatima</a>, au Portugal, lors de 6 mois successifs en <a
    href="../../../../../1/7/index.html">1917</a>. Le phénomène du 13 octobre fut le mieux rapporté et fut observé par
  une foule de près de 70 000 personnes, dont un certain nombre de <a
    href="/people/scientifiques.html">scientifiques</a>, journalistes, athées et agnostiques, ainsi que de catholiques
  fidèles. Un des scientifiquement curieux fut le Dr. A Garrett de l'Université de Coimbra. La pluie, qui tombait ce
  jour-là, cessa et la foule regarda vers le haut pour voir le "soleil" maintenant visible à travers les <a
    href="../../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/nuage/index.html">nuages</a> épais. Le professeur Garrett écrivit, <q>...je
    me tournais vers ce (soleil) qui attirait tous les yeux et je pus le voir comme un disque avec un bord clairement
    découpé, avec un contour vif, lumineux et brillant, mais sans blesser quiconque. La comparaison que j'ai entendue à
    Fatima avec un disque d'argent mat, ne me semble pas exacte. C'était une couleur plus claire, plus vive, plus riche
    et avec des teintes changeantes comme le lustre d'une perle. Ce n'était pas du tout comme la <a
      href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/lune/index.html">Lune</a> par une nuit claire et transparente, for one
    saw and felt it like a living star. Pas plus que ce n'était sphérique comme la <a

    and less light. Cela avait l'air d'une roue polie cut out of mother-of-pearl. Pas plus que cela ne pouvait être
    confondu avec le <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/Soleil/index.html">Soleil</a> vu à travers une brume -- il n'y
    avait pas de brume... Ce disque tournait en rond de manière vertigineuse. Ce n'était pas comme le scintillement
    d'une étoile : il tourbillonnait sur lui-même avec une rapidité folle... Le soleil, préservant la célérité de sa
    rotation, se détacha du firmament et avança, rouge-sang, vers la terre, menaçant de nous écraser du poids de sa
    vaste et flamboyante masse. Ces moments firent une impression terrifiante </q><span class="source">[<a

<p>Because the early reports seemed to suggest airborne craft of unusualappearance and kinematics, the problem came to
  rest with the newlyorganized U.S. Air Force. Initial fears were that the country was beingoverflown by advanced
  foreign aircraft, possibly on intelligence missions.The latter was suggested by the large number of sightings from the
  WhiteSands, New Mexico area and from the vicinity of the Hanford, Washingtonatomic plant.</p>

<p>Serious inquiry proceeded for a few years without any positive results. Anumber of supposedly knowledgeable people
  spoke out pointing out thesporadic nature of the sightings, and that since the reported kinematics were inconsistent
  with current physical theory, the UFOs werenot likely to be from a foreign power. Further, they argued, no
  otherplanets in our solar system were believed to support life -- certainly notintelligent life -- and since even the
  nearest star was over four lightyears away, the hypothesis of extraterrestrial origin was simplyunacceptable from a
  scientific point of view. <a

<p>The Air Force investigative effort worked as follows: <a
  href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Ubatuba#10. The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, E. J. Ruppelt, Ace Books, Inc. G-537">(10)</a>
  Whenever asighting was made, a report was to be made out and turned in to the AirForce at base level. The report was
  forwarded to Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohiofor study. If the report was interesting enough, followup inquiry was made.By
  1952 the number of reports coming in was so large that the CIA wasconcerned that an actual attack on the country might
  not be immediatelyrecognized. A panel of scientists was then convened in January 1953 tostudy the available evidence
  and see what conclusion could be reached aboutUFOs. After seven days of hearing evidence and discussing the matter it
  wasconcluded that there was only circumstantial evidence of theextraterrestrial hypothesis. The panel recommended a
  broadened study effortwith full disclosure of investigations. In order to unplug the militaryintelligence channels,
  however, the CIA recommended that, since the UFOsapparently posed no threat, the Air Force should debunk UFO reports
  and trygenerally to discourage public interest in them, in the hope that theywould go away. <a
    href="../../../Dossier/1957-09-14_Ubatuba/index.html#11.%20UFO%27s:%20Greatest%20Scientific%20Problem%20of%20Our%20Times?%20J.%20E.%20McDonald%20UFORI,%20Suite%20311,%20508%20Grant%20Street,%20Pittsburgh,%20Pa.,%2015219">(11)</a>
</p>
<p>It was the CIA's recommendation, apparently, that was made policy, for theinvestigative procedures used since 1953
  have been vestigal and thehandling of the subject by the authorities tended to make witnesses lookridiculous. In spite
  of the unfavorable publicity accorded witnesses,reports persisted, and no doubt in response to official behavior
  severalcivilian study groups were formed to receive reports and investigatesightings. The most successful of these
  groups is the NationalInvestigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). NICAP's membership iswell dispersed
  geographically and acts to learn as much as possible fromsightings. The large number of scientific and technical
  personnel in theNICAP membership aids the quality of their evaluations. A summary ofcharacteristics of the UFO
  phenomenology published by NICAP in 1964 <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Ubatuba#12. The UFO Evidence, NICAP, 6536 Connecticut Avenue, NW., Washington D.C., 20036, 1964">(12)</a>
  contains 575 reports that were extensively checked by NICAPfor accuracy.</p>
<p>A series of sightings in 1965 and 1966 received considerable publicattention arid after the poor public reception
  given the officialexplanations, the Air Force felt compelled to contract for a 15 month(later stretched to l8 months)
  scientific study to be performed at theUniversity of Colorado under the leadership of E. U. Condon, a highlyrespected
  physicist. The Condon Committee is due to complete investigationsat the end of June 1968; its report will be reviewed
  by the NationalAcademy of Sciences (presumably to validate that the study was indeed theobjective pearl of the
  scientific method that was desired), and is expectedto be made public in October 1968. Unfortunately, the dismissal of
  twomembers of the Committee in February 1968 resulted in publicity suggestingthat the study was not, in fact,
  objective. It remains, therefore, to seethe final report to determine the worth of the study.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the respectability accorded UFOs by the $500,000 studycontract permitted a considerable amount of
  scientific interest to surface.Astronomer Hynek has made a number of public statements on the basis of hislong
  involvement as a consultant to the Air Force; atmospheric physicistJames F. McDonald has turned his attention full
  time to the subject, and anumber of scientific and technical journals have printed some dialogue -notably Science, the
  AIAA Journal, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists andthe Journal of the Astronautical Sciences. It is also noteworthy
  that theUniversity of Toronto has recently formed a UFO study group.</p>
<p>Even the Soviets, who previously refused even to discuss the subject nowadmit to having a study group with good
  qualifications. The USSR Academy ofSciences still holds to the orthodox scientific view that UFOs are anonproblem,
  however, using the same arguments we heard so long. Thesearguments are just as invalid in the USSR as in the USA.</p>
<p>It therefore appears that the subject is slowly and finally being regardedas a fit subject of scientific inquiry. It
  is hoped that enough scientistswill acquaint themselves with the subject so that progress can finally bemade.</p>

  came toconsciously ignore the subject.)</p>
<h2><a id="PART 2: UFOs -- ASTRONOMICAL ASPECTS"></a>Partie 2 : Ovnis - Aspects astronomiques</h2>
<p> The astonishing thing would be if they did not exist.Jean Cocteau</p>
<p>We saw in Part 1 that the historical aspects suggest an extraterrestrialexplanation to UFOs. While it has not been
  established that thecontemporary phenomena are extensions of the historical, there does seem tobe a continuity in the
  descriptions of the phenomena described. We shalltherefore look at contemporary astronomical knowledge and theories
  andascertain the likelihood of the existence of other highly developed lifeforms.</p>
<p>To begin with, the observable universe -- that is, the distance to which wecan observe luminous objects -- is several
  billion lightyears in radius (alight year is the distance light travels in a year at a rate of 186,300miles per
  second. The sun is 8 light minutes from the earth. Thenext-nearest star is 4.2 light years away). Within this vast
  volume we findhundreds of millions of galaxies. Our own (Milky Way) galaxy is similar tomany of those we see at great
  distances. It is a lens-shaped assemblage ofsome 100 milliards d'étoiles ayant un diamètre of about 100 000 light
  years. Thesun is but one of its component stars and lies about 30,000 light yearsfrom the center, close to the plane
  of symmetry.</p>
<p>Now let us just consider the stars in our own galaxy -- specificallyexcluding those in neighboring or distant
  galaxies. We would like toestimate the number of stars having planets roughly similar to the Earth. &gt;From the
  statistics of stars within 15 light years of the sun we find thatonly about one-third are single, the rest binary or
  multiple. Sinceplanetary orbits are often unstable in multiple systems (depending on thedetails of the configuration)
  we will say that only 30 billion stars in ourgalaxy now have a dynamical environment that permits planets to
  existaround them. Will these stars have planets? We cannot state with assurancethat they will; however, current
  knowledge supports the theory thatplanetary formation is a natural adjunct to formation of the star itselffrom the
  interstellar gas cloud.</p>
<p>We would therefore expect about 30 billion stars to have one or moreplanets. Now, we can reject certain classes of
  stars as candidates orhabitable planets, because their lifetimes are too short (these are starsof high mass). Others
  can be rejected because of variability in lightoutput, a characteristic that would make evolutionary development of
  lifemuch more difficult. In fact if we select only those stars similar to thesun (whose peak of radiation energy
  coincides with a region of terrestrialatmospheric transparency) we have only a few percent of the total -- aboutone in
  30. Therefore, we would expect about 1000 million suitable solartype stars exist. Of these, it is estimated by various
  astronomers that 200-600 million have planets at about the right distance and have beenaround long enough that life
  forms as developed as our own could exist.Implicit in further discussion are the assumptions that:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Planets and/or life evolves to a mutual compatibility;</li>
  <li> The life force, whether spontaneous or otherwise, is such thatwhenever the environment is favorable, life will
    exist;</li>
  <li> Our own history of past evolution and development is neither slownor fast, but average and typical for life
    forms. (Ours is the onlyexample available and no one has yet demonstrated that the "average"galactic life form
    should be any different.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let us turn momentarily to time scales. The sun and earth are on theorder of 5 billion years old. We might define
  modern man as being about5000 years old (Stonehenge is 4000 years old) -- just one millionth of theearth's age. The
  age of science is certainly not more than 500 years, soour scientific and technical development has thus far occupied
  only oneten-millionth of the earth's life span. We expect the sun will burn another5 billion years before significant
  changes in its brightness occur. Now theage of the galaxy is between 5 and 10 billion years; therefore among
  the200-600 millidn stars we would expect to have acceptable planets, somewould be older than the sun, some younger
  (for star formation is stillcontinuing, even though at a lesser rate than in the galaxy's earlyhistory) and some the
  same age. It should be clear from assumption <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Ubatuba#3. The Sky People, B. LePoer Trenth, London, Neville Spearman, 1960.">(3)</a>
  andthe example of our own development, that among the populated planets those younger than the sunwould be peopled by
  beings very much behind us technologically, while thoseon older planets would be extraordinarily advanced (remember
  our progressof 500 years and note that some planets could be as much as a few billionyears older). Indeed, we would be
  surprised to find someone else at justour stage of technological development. For the purposes of this paper, wecan
  ignore both the multitude younger than ourselves and those at our pointof development. Even so, we are left with the
  possibility of 100 000 000 planets in the galaxy having life forms very much advanced from us. (Thisnumber would be
  reduced significantly if life forms destroyed themselvessoon after reaching our age of development. This is a
  philosophical pointon which I am optimistic -- I believe the majority of races will learn tosurvive.) If these stars
  are uniformly distributed in the galactic disk,the average separation will be about 10 light years.</p>
<p>The usual scientist's reaction at this point is, well, even if the assumptions are correct and this number of
  advanced civilizations doesexist, contact is still impossible because of the speed of light limitation of the theory
  of relativity. An excellent example of this kind ofreasonsing can be found in Ref. <a
    Flying Metaphysics Objects Physics The
    Unidentified and href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Ubatuba#14. " of", William Markowitz, Science, 15 Sept.
  1967">14</a>. My reply is that such a statement would appear to be short sighted. For the moment, let us ignore the
  possibilitiesof overcoming the long time of travel by suspended animation and the like. Recall that our own physical
  theory has been developed in only 500 years.What can we expect in the next 500? Or 1000 or million or even
  billionyears? I suggest that _if_ a way to circumvent the speed of lightrestriction is possible, it has already been
  found by someone in our galaxy. (I haven't the faintest idea how this might be done and I fullyagree that our own
  experimental data appear to accurately confirm the existence of this limitation.) If it has been discovered by one,
  wecertainly would expect it to be used; if no other planet's inhabitants independently discovered the means, it makes
  little difference for such athing could be taught by the discoverer. Thus we may conclude that it isvery likely that
  at least one, and probably many of the 100 millionadvanced planetary populations is capable of interstellar travel.
</p>
<p>The next question is, of course, have any of them been here? That questioncannot yet be answered definitively.
  Without knowing what kind ofphenomenology extraterrestrial visitors might exhibit, I will fall back on my scientific,
  mechanistic attitudes and say it makes sense to look forsome kind of vehicle or spaceship. It appears that the class
  of phenomenology called UFO reports may contain, as a subset, actualobservations of such craft. We shall now turn to
  the reports to see whenand where things are seen and by whom and what phenomenology, if any) isrevealed by the
  reports.</p>

<h2><a id="PART 3: UFOs -- THE CHARACTER OF REPORTS"></a>Partie 3 : Ovnis - Le caractère des signalements</h2>
<p>Any collection of reports of unknown aerial sightings by the public willinclude a large percent of noise - sightings
  of something explainable. Thereports are made because the appearance falls outside the range of the observer's
  experience, and the observer believes it is sufficientlyanomalous to warrant the attention of authorities. Thus, any
  large collection of reports will include descriptions of aircraft, balloons)spacecraft, astronomical objects,
  atmospheric effects and the like. Often the practiced and perceptive analyst can recognize the stimulus,particularly
  if he has access to records of aircraft, balloon, and satellite movements, meteorological data and astronomical
  phenomenology.Recognition of stimulus is aided by a high quality report which is as quantitative as possible and which
  shows the observer to be able todifferentiate between observation and interpretation. Of course a number of reports
  will be so lacking in details that no conclusion can be reachedabout what was seen. These are of little use; they may,
  however, serve as corroborating evidence to another, higher quality, report and should not,therefore be rejected. The
  really interesting class of reports is that reporting phenomenology which is clearly extraordinary. The
  observer'squalifications may be such that the report is not only highly credible but is articulate and quantitative as
  well. It is this subclass of reports,variously estimated at 5 to 20 percent of the total, that offer hope of our
  learning what is going on.</p>
<p><a href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen/index.html">Hynek</a> considère 2 paramètres de crédibilité et étrangeté des
  rapports, et suggère que l'enquêteur n'a vraiment besoin que de se préoccuper des rapports ayant une haute étrangeté
  et une haute credibilité. Le physicien est en position d'évaluer l'étrangeté, la spécialiste des sciences sociales
  devrait être capable de fournir une mesure de la crédibilité. <a
    href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen/index.html">Hynek</a> also comments on a number of beliefs about UFOs and reports
  stating, <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Ubatuba#18. Science, 21 October 1966, letter by J. A. Hynek, p. 329">(18)</a>
  among otherthings, that most reports are made by people who previously never gave much thought to UFOs; that reports
  are not always vague; and that well educated,well trained, reliable, stable people also contri- bute reports. These
  conclusions have been reached by most people who have taken the trouble tocollect and investigate reports first hand.
</p>
<p>To illustrate the character of reports, I will quote several narrativesfrom the literature. (Narratives, of course,
  are just the beginning of anyreport. Quantitative information, usually not given in the narrative mustbe obtained by
  careful interview of the witness.) The firzt is taken from acollection of 160 reports by Olsen. <a

<p><q>"Anxious to have me see the object, my wife quickly drove the car back toour house and attracted my attention. I
  had been working in the basement. Iran out of the house and up the street for a view. by the time I saw it,the object
  appeared to be about a quarter to a half-mile away, moving in awesterly direction. I saw it as an object smaller at
  the top than at thebase, seemingly suspended in the air at an angle of about 45 degrees frommy position, and giving
  off colored lights. I know that the object was notany kind of conventional aircraft of balloon.</q></p>
<p><q>"Having had the advantage of a closer viewing than I, my wife describes theobject as follows..</q></p>
<p><q>" 'The UFO appeared to be about the size of one of the Cape Cod houses overwhich it passed, which would make it
  approximately 30 ft. in diameter andabout the same dimension in height. It was circular, surmounted by a domegiving
  off flashes of green light. The center section rotated a series ofsquare shaped "windows", each giving off a brilliant
  white light. The basesection was somewhat saucer-shaped, curved upward. Shafts of white light were directed downward
  from the base.'Unfortunately, my wife cannot recall if the exterior was metallic inappearance. In any event, the
  object had a well-defined outline. Again, itmoved silently. There was no evidence of occupants of the UFO.</q></p>
<p><q>"Approximately 20 to 25 minutes following the first sighting describedabove, the following~sighting occured:
  "Returning from taking her motherhome, my wife drove the car into our driveway alongside the house, headedwestward. In
  the rear of our home was a wooded park area. My wife walkeddown the driveway to enter the house. Coming up the
  driveway was a neighborfriend, a young lady 20 years of age. In a tone of astonishment, she calledmy wife's attention
  to the park area, from which was emerging an object ofthe same description as outlined above moving easterly at low
  level -- notover 50 ft. above ground level, as judged by the trees in the area -- theUFO proceded relatively slowly
  and without sound. It was approaching therear of our home and adjacent properties.</q></p>
<p><q>"Again, my wife called me from the basement. By the time I got outside, theobject had made a 90 degree turn
  northward and was proceeding parallel tothe backs of the houses in the same line as ours. It was perhaps 150 -
  200yards distant. My observation of the characteristics of the UFO talliedwith my wife's and the young lady's. Each of
  them independently made apencil sketch within a few minutes after the sighting, and the sketcheswere substantially
  alike. "All told, there were at least 15 persons in thevicinity who acknowledged seeing the object at about the same
  time as thesightings made by my wife and myself."</q></p>
<p>Un autre témoin, P. T. Scattergood, rapporte : <q>Vers 8 h (20 h) I stepped outthe front door, facing south and saw a
  brilliantly lighted object low inthe southern sky. At first I took it to be a jet taking off fromPhiladelphia Airport,
  which is in that general direction. But I could hearno engine noise and it was traveling too slowly to be a plane.
  Also it didnot have the usual blinking lights.</q></p>
<p><q>"It appeared to have a row of yellowish lights (which I took for thewindows of the "jet") with a clear green light
  at the top. As I watched, the row of lights appeared to be obscured as though a largepaddle-wheel were revolving and
  blotting them out, beginning with the rearlights and proceeding forward. Since the object was moving west, I saw
  theright hand side of it. The periodic appearance and disappearance of thelights was perfectly regular. The top green
  light was constantly visible. Istood on the pavement and watched the object sail leisurely to the westuntil it
  disappeared behind some trees. The observation probably lastedfrom 5 to 10 minutes."</q></p>
<p>This report has the desirable features of the UFO being seen by a number ofpeople (about 15) of which two actually
  made reports (<a href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen/index.html">Hynek</a> estime le nombre d'observations comme étant
  près de 10 fois le nombre de reports turned in). D'autres desirable aspects of this sighting are that it was made
  duringdaylight; that it was near enough that some details of its configurationwere observable; and, it was visible
  long enough to allow the observers toconsider "explanations" as they watched it.</p>
<p>The second example is reported by James F. McDonald in T. Bloecher's bookon an intense period of UFO activity in
  1947. The report was made 20 yearsafter the sighting to Prof. McDonald for the reasons given at the end ofthe
  quotation.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Olavick was in her kitchen at 2101 East Hawthorne Street, Tucson,while Mrs. Down was out in the back-year
  patio. Suddenly Mrs. Down calledher out excitedly, and both proceeded to observe what had caught Mrs.Down's eye. The
  time was just after the noon hour; Tucson's skies werecompletely cloudless. Somewhat north of their zenith lay an
  unusual,isolated, "steamy-fleecy" cloud at an altitude which Mrs. Olavick founddifficult to estimate, though she
  recalled that it seemed lower thanaverage for that time of year (thus, perhaps at or below 10,000 feet,say.). No other
  cloud was to be seen in the sky. In and out of the cloudmoved a number of dull-white disc-like objects that rose and
  fell in anerratic manner, occasionally disappearing into or above the unnaturalcloud. She said that these objects were
  round in planform but were notspherical, for they frequently tipped a bit, exposing a flattened-sphereform. She
  estimates that they watched these objects cavorting near thecloud for perhaps five or six minutes before the entire
  group suddenlydisappeared within the cloud or perhaps above it.</p>
<p>"After a minute or so, as she now recalls it, a new object, perhaps threeof four times as large as the little
  objects, came out of the cloud on itseast side. After it emerged, the small objects began to emerge also, takingup a
  V-formation pattern behind it. The V comprised a line of four-abreastjust to the rear of the large object, then a line
  of three-abreast behindthat, and finally two-abreast in the rear. Thus the point of the V was tothe rear (in the sense
  of the emergent and subsequent motion). Thisformation permitted the first accurate count of the small objects, nine
  inall. No sooner had the last pair emerged than all ten objects shot off tothe northeast, climbing out of sight in a
  time that she thought wasprobably two to three seconds. She does not recall what happened to thecloud after the ten
  objects departed.</p>
<p>"I (McDonald) have spoken with Mrs. Olavick several additional times,following her first call. Her account was
  presented in an unembellishedmanner, and her descriptions were carefully framed, specifying just whichparts had become
  less distinct in her memory. But the basic vividness ofher memory of this observation she stressed repeatedly. I had
  to explainthat it was by no means clear that the objects she saw were identical withthose reported by Kenneth Arnold
  two months later. When I queried her as towhy she had not reported them, she pointed out that she and Mrs. Down
  wereentirely convinced that they had been fortunate enough to witness some newAmerican military vehicles about which
  the general public had not yet beeninformed. Later she heard of the "flying saucers," and she and Mrs. Down,when they
  rejoined their husbands in mid-summer in Iowa, told them abouttheir own observation. The husbands, she recalled, made
  such a joke of itthat they ceased mentioning it.</p>
<p>Again we have a daytime sighting of several minutes duration, with twowitnesses. As is often the case when.the
  phenomenon appears mechanical, itwas interpreted as some secret government development. Ridicule of thesighting by
  family members and friends (if not by authorities) isfrequently mentioned as a reason for delayed reporting of
  sightings.</p>
<p>A third report is taken from a paper Prof. McDonald presented at the 12March 1968 Canadian Aeronautics and Space
  Institute Astronautics Symposium,Montreal.</p>
<p>"At about 5:15 am., PDT, on the morning of July 4, 1967, at least fivewitnesses (and reportealy others not yet
  locatable) saw an object ofunconventional nature moving over Highway 5 on the edge of Corning,California. Hearing of
  the event from NICAP, I began searching for tnewitnesses and eventually telephone-interviewed four. Press accounts
  fromthe Corning Daily Observer and Oakland Tribune afforded furthercorroboration.</p>
<p>"Jay Munger, operator of an all-night bowling alley, was drinking coffeewith two police officers, James Overton of
  the Corning force and FrankRakes of the Orland force, when Munger suddenly spotted the object out thefront windows of
  his bowling alley. In a moment all three were outsideobserving what they each described as a dark gray oval or
  disc-shapedobject with a bright light shining upwards on its top and a dimmer lightshining downward from the
  underside. A dark gray or black band encircledthe mid-section of the object. When first sighted, it lay almost due
  west,at a distance that they estimated at a quarter of a mile (latersubstantiated by independent witnesses viewing it
  at right angles to theline of sight of the trio at the bowling alley). It was barely moving, andseemed to be only a
  few hundred feet above terrain. The dawn lightilluminated the object, but not so brightly as to obscure the two
  lightson top and bottom, they stated. </p>
<p>"Munger, thinking to get an independent observation from a different partof Corning, returned almost immediately to
  telephone his wife; but shenever saw it for reasons of tree-obscuration. At my request, Mungerre-enacted the
  telephoning process to form a rough estimate of elapsedtime. He obtained a time of 1-1.5 minutes. This time is of
  interestbecause, when he completed the call and rejoined Overton and Rakes, theobject had still moved only a short
  distance south on Highway 5 (about aquarter of a mile: perhaps), but then quickly accelerated and passed off tothe
  south, going out of their sight in only about 10 seconds, far to theirsouth.</p>
<p>Paul Heideman, de Fremont (Californie), conduisait vers le Sud sur l'autoroute 5 au moment de l'observation
  ci-dessus, along with a friend, Robert King. I locatedHeideman and obtained from him an account of his observation
  made from apoint on the highway north of Corning. He saw the light from the object,and had veered east (a turn not
  seen from the more restricted viewing pointof the bowiing-alley parking lot). Heideman said that, when first seen,
  itlay almost straight down Highway 5, serving to check the estimate of theother observers that the object lay only a
  few city blocks to their west.</p>
<p>The weather was clear, no haze, no wind, according to the witnesses.Munger's concise comment was <q>"I've never seen
  anything like it before."</q> Heestimated its "diameter" at perhaps 50-100 ft, and its vertical thicknessas perhaps
  15-20 ft, with some kind of edge (band) perhaps 5-10 ft thick. No sound was ever heard. Overton stated to me that he
  had no idea what itwas, but that <q>"there was no doubt it was a craft of some sort."</q></p>
<p>The next example is from a report I personally investigated. It occurred inthe area where I was reared; the observers
  are known to my family; I amfamiliar with the natural phenomenology of the area.</p>
<p> Date: 10 October 1966</p>
<p>Lieu : Near Newton, Illinois</p>
<p>First witnesses: Mrs. A (she prefers not to be publicly identified becauseof the reaction of friends and neighbors).
  Time: 5:20 p.m.</p>
<p><q>"Mrs. A was in her kitchen preparing supper; five of her children wereplaying outdoors. The children shouted to
  her to "come out and see thesilent plane". She writes "I glanced out the south window and there it wascoming into
  sight just south of our 72 foot silo moving very slowly fromeast to west. It was about 35 feet high. My first thought
  was that it was aplane making an emergency landing, but when I saw it in full view, I knewit was no plane, not like
  anything I have ever seen. I hurried outside tojoin the children in the yard. It continued to move in a straight line
  to the west. We could see it clearlyas it drifted over a 50 by 100 foot machine shed being built at the time[the
  workers were, however, in the fields this day]. It appeared to belarger than our car, and was more oval. There was a
  bluish glow around theends, top, and bottom of it. It (the glow) wasn't bright, since it wasdaylight yet, but more
  like a low cloud, haze, or fog; or a mixture ofbluish-grey tiny bubbles floating along around it. The object was
  seenclearly. It was blue in color and appeared to be made of metal. You couldsee [longitudinal] seam lines. There was
  one black window. I thought they(assuming someone was in it) could see out but we could not see them. Ikept looking
  for someone to peep out and wave, but don't recall seeing orfeeling anything at the time. There was a brownish-gold
  design on the lowerback half. A raised part was on the top near the back which was noticed byall the children. It
  moved very quietly, making no sound at all except fora whirling or vibrating sound for 1 or 2 seconds as it drifted on
  towardthe west... We followed it down the yard and lane, continuing to watch itas it was 300 feet, then 200 feet from
  the north and south gravel road andthe REA electric line which is on the west side of the road. We weretalking
  together, all very excited about what it was, where it came from,if there were people in it, and if it would rise to
  clear the electricline. It did; it rose so quickly and was out of sight in just a fewseconds. Our eyes could not
  follow it fast enough. This was certainly afantastic thing."</q></p>
<p>The questionnaire, a lengthy correspondence, an interview in June 1967 andother checking produced the following
  details:</p>
<p> Meteorology: Clear, warm, dry weather, cloudless.</p>
<p>Astronomical: Moonset 3:51 p.m. EST</p>
<p>UFO: Prolate spheroidial shape as shown below.</p>

<p>The surface appeared to be non-specular, like dull aluminum or metal, andblue, the color probably deriving from the
  self-luminous halo. Lon-gitudinal seams were apparent, but no rivets or such were seen. The blackrectangle was assumed
  to be a window and appeared to be recessed. It wasnot shiny, but "like the dark of night." The surrounding glow was
  partlyopaque, yet self luminous. It was darker than the sky and extended about1/4 the object's length in all
  directions. The halo was particularly opaqueat the ends: of the object, obscuring the underlying parts. The design
  atthe lower rear looked like a pattern of crosses and dots like (1) or (2)</p>

<p>Mrs. A says the glow obscured the design and in any case her attention wasfixed on the "window". The only sound heard
  occurred when the UFO wasnearest the unfinished shed, being constructed of a wooden frameworkcovered with ferrous
  sheets. It is possible that some sheets were caused tovibrate. No electromagnetic effects were noted (TV was off) and
  noelectrostatic or other effects were noted by Mrs. A or her children. As theUFO disappeared, Mrs. A was just looking
  along the road for a car; two ofthe children said the UFO pitched nose-up and as it went up a light orflame of orange
  color was seen at the rear.</p>
<p>Enough angular data was provided from building and landmark placement andsizes that it is possible to estimate the
  size of the metallic portion ofthe UFO at 16 to 20 feet in length, seen at a distance of 150 to 300 feet.Its linear
  speed was about 4 to 8 miles per hour, based on the abovedistances and timings obtained by re-enactment. It was
  visible for 4minutes. Angular size was 2 3/4" at arms length. In an effort to quantifythe colors somewhat, a Nickerson
  color fan was used by the witnesses toselect the colors most nearly like those on the UFO. The color selectionswere
  made independently in direct sunlight with the color fan held in frontof a white field. The colors given were</p>

<p>Second event: Same day, 6:30 p.m., sky is now dark. Location is in town ofNewton, Illinois, about seven miles north
  west of first event.</p>
<p>Mrs. B was walking down the steps of a friend's house toward her car. <q>"As Istarted down the steps my eyes were
  drawn by something in the south easternsky. I stopped a moment and saw very clearly a luinous bluish object
  movingquite rapidly from east to west. It seemed to be rather low in the sky, butat night it is difficult to judge
  distance either as to how high it was orhow far away it was. It did appear larger than a full moon, but instead
  ofbeing round it had a definite oval shape. I would say an elongated oval.There was no sound that I could detect, and
  while it appeared to be blueand purple, there was also a whitish glow in it. The outline of the objectwas very
  distinct. I watched it until it disappeared behind some trees anda house a little less than a block from me.</q>
</p>
<p>Further correspondence and discussion brought forth the followinginformation: The major axis of the oval was
  horizontal; its path was notperfectly horizontal) but somewhat undulatory. Its color was brightest andwhitest at the
  center, becoming more blue and darker toward the edges. Mrs.B. estimated the colors as shown below (Since the
  interview was conductedin the evening) the color fan was illuminated by an incandescent lamp).</p>

<p>In itself, this last report, which describes a sighting of 15 to 20 secondsduration, contains insufficient
  information to come to any conclusion.However, when put alongside the earlier report there is the possibility ofa
  relationship -- could these be reports of the same thing seen underdiffering conditions of illumination? We'll never
  know positively but thesuggestion is quite strong.</p>
<p>As far as Mrs. A's sighting is concerned, we have obtained enough data fromfollow-up inquiry and on-site
  investigation to rule out known airbornecraft, meteorological, and astronomical phenomenon. Yet the observationsare
  sufficiently detailed to give us adequate confidence that some sort ofmachine was present, behaving in a very
  extraordinary way. Some parts ofthe object are similar to other reports (the effervescent glow, the orangecolor on
  acceleration, the very black "window" (which sounds like ablock-body absorber)). Other parts are unusual -- the UFO's
  prolatespheroidal shape and the pattern (although seeing the pattern would requirethe observer to be quite close). The
  original correspondence and datasheets on Mrs. A's sighting run to over 40 pages. In correspondence andinterviews over
  a period of 8 months no substantial inconsistencies couldbe found. The geometric data, particularly, are so
  intricately related thatit is most unlikely that the witness could have fabricated a story so well.In addition,
  acquaintances made it clear that Mrs. A. is not prone to storytelling and that "she is too busy to dream up such a
  tale". Mr. A, whoreturned from the fields that evening found the household stillconsiderably agitated four hours after
  the event. He said he had no ideawhat it was his wife and children saw, but he obviously treated thesighting seriously
  for he went to considerable trouble to comply with arequest to measure the sizes and locations of each building and
  tree on thefarm.</p>
<p>It is this kind of sighting - the kind which is clearly inexplicable incontemporary terms, which causes me (and other
  interested persons) to takethe whole subject so seriously. Hynek suggests that it is just this kind ofsighting that
  often goes unreported, because the witness -- especially ifhis education or training are appropriate -- knows that
  what he saw wasunambiguously extraordinary. And machine-like. A number of such reportswere belatedly made after the
  University of Colorado study effort got underway. Apparently the witnesses waited for therespectability the UOC study
  brought to the subject. It is hoped that thescientific and intellectual climate will change to the point
  wherewitnesses, particularly those having the best qualifications, can feel freeto report sightings and know that they
  are being taken seriously.</p>
<p>Not all reports are visual reports only. An example of a photographicobservation studied in detail is given in
  reference <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Ubatuba#20. Observations of an Anomalistic Phenomenon, R. M. L. Baker, Journal of the Astronautical Sciences, January/February, 1968">20</a>.
  Here, a 16mn movieof two objects sighted in the daytime provided the analyst enoughinformation to conclude that no
  known phenomena could have caused theimages. This report is, hopefully, the first in a series of instrumentedsightings
  carefully and adequately studied.</p>
<h2><a id="PART 4: UFO'S - PHENOMENONOLOGICAL ASPECTS"></a>Partie 4 : Ovnis - Aspects phénoménologiques</h2>
<p>Since I have made a first hand study of only a dozen sightings, thephenomenology described in this section will
  necessarily be based ondescriptions of reports collected by others, particularly NICAP, APRO,UFOIRC, and Vallee. There
  is, unfortunately, no central file of reportsaccessible to the interested scientist, although large numbers of
  reportsare in the hands of the organizations mentioned above. (The extensive AirForce files are of very limited use,
  from what I can tell, because of theextremely inconsistent quality of investigation.) In an unfortunate numberof cases
  the report consists of little more than a narrative. My experiencewith the Newton sightings suggests that quantitative
  information isavailable if the investigator takes the trouble to personally make anon-site study. True, it may not be
  the quality of an instrumented sighting,but enough quantitative data are available to permit meaningful study
  ofsighting reports.</p>
<p>NICAP's document "The UFO Evidence" contains a summary of patterns inappearance and behavior as determined from cases
  they had studied through1963. Regarding appearance, the most common type is a disc shape, followedby spherical,
  oval/elliptical, cylindrical, and triangular. The breakdownof NICAP's 575 cases goes as follows</p>

<p>Obviously, there may be some mis-classification within thefirst three groups because of projective effects. Discs
  maybe coin-shaped or lens shaped (double convex). The domed disk isplano-convex, (sometimes double convex) with a
  smaller radius bulgeatop the convex side. The saturn disk is a sphere or oblate spheroidwith a thin ring projecting
  from the equator. Similar objects are seen without the equatorial ring also. Another subset are thehemispheric
  variety, sometimes with a small protrusion at theapex and usually seen with the flat side down. All the above
  mentionedobjects are generically oblate with the axis of symmetry usually seenoriented vertically. Another group are
  prolate, having the major axishorizontal, usually. This includes the elliptical (football) variety,the triangular or
  tear drop variety, and the cylindrical or cigarshaped species.</p>

<p>It should be noted that a few reports exist suggesting that the brightnessof the object first thought by the observer
  to be reflected sunlight, wasin fact self luminosity, as ascertained by the geometry, presence of cloudsand the
  like.</p>
<p>In the dark-sky observations, the outline or shape of the UFO is often notseen. What is seen is a light or series of
  lights, sometimes extremelybright. Luminous rays are also reported, going up sometimes (particularlyfrom domed discs)
  downward (from hemispheric types principally, also fromdiscs) and from one UFO to another (spherical types). The
  luminous columnis usually not divergent. Excluding these interesting rays, the reportedcolors of UFOs seen at night

<p>Brightness and color changes are also noted, and while the sample is small(82 cases) NICAP found the following: Of
  the 25 cases showing a change inbrightness, 23 of the changes occurred at the moment of a velocity change(a change of
  either magnitude or direction). Concerning the change ofcolor, 23 cases showed a color change related to acceleration.
  While thesupporting data are not conclusive, it appears that the spectral shift isto the red upon acceleration.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that UFOs reported at night have only a star-likeappearance unless very close. Distant UFO's
  sometimes turn off and on. Whencloser to the observer, reports often indicate a number of lights, locatedat the top
  and around the rim usually. Sometimes the lights flash on andoff or change color rhythmically. Several cases have been
  reported of theUFO flashing its lights in response to the witness flashing hand orvehiclar lights. In other cases the
  lights winked off with the approach ofanother car or an aircraft, only to turn on again when the vehicle
  hadpassed.</p>
<p>While practically any luminous behavior could be produced by someone withsufficient time and money, kinematic
  behavior at odds with experience or,preferably, at odds with Newtonian behavior are suggestive ofnon-terrestrial
  origin.</p>
<p>A common kind of motion is called oscillation by NICAP and is subdividedinto "wobble on axis" (frequently described
  also as fluttering, flipping,and tipping); pendulum motion on slow ascent, hovering and decent (alsocalled "falling
  leaf motion"); and occasionally a side-to-side oscillationobserved as the UFO proceeds horizontally. These motions are
  most oftenperformed by discs, although examples of similar behavior by other formsalso exist.</p>
<p>The last class, that of violent and erratic maneuvers, most clearly lacksan explanation from current physical theory.
  Using terms like bobbing,erratic, jerky, zig-zag, dark, and shot away, witnesses describe motionsinvolving high
  angular accelerations and velocities. A number of radarobservations appear to substantiate this anomalous behavior.
  Among the 40cases showing such characteristics, NICAP finds that 28 percent werereported by scientific or other
  appropriately experienced personnel.</p>
<h3>Variation des observations avec le temps</h3>
<p>It appears that the UFO phenomenology has been with us from the earliesttimes. In the last twenty-five years,
  however, there seems to be a drasticincrease in the number of sightings. It is practically impossible toestimate the
  number of world-wide sightings because of the lack of suitabledata collection means. In the U.S., the principal
  depositories arecurrently the Air Force, NICAP and APRO. It is estimated that currentlythese sources together receive
  about 2000 reports per year. Since onlyabout one sighting in 10 is reported, the number of sightings is about20,000.
  But of these, 80 to 95% are not interesting, leaving us with "only"1000 to 4000 worthwhile sightings per year for
  North America.</p>
<p>In addition to the background of reports more or less constantly flowingin, occasional periods of intense activity
  are also noted. One such periodwas October 1954 over most of France. NICAP lists a number of these "flaps". Sometimes
  they are very localized, covering only a small portionof a state for a period of a few weeks.</p>
<p>APRO concludes, on the basis of the reports available to them, that thepatterns of appearance follow phases - atomic
  test areas and installationsin the late 1940s and early 50s, rivers, reservoirs and bodies of water inthe late 50s and
  early 60s and now electrical distribution systems.Convincing evidence to support this hypothesis has not been
  published;however, if the hypothesis were true it would certainly raise a lot ofquestion.</p>
<p>McDonald and others suggest that reports of the last few years show moresightings of objects at low altitude (or
  landed) and more sightings madefrom urban areas (in the 40s and 50s sightings were generally inverselycorrelated with
  population densities).</p>
<h3>Interactions avec l'environnement</h3>
<p>Interactions of UFOs with the environment produce a kind of believabilitythat pure visual observations will never do.
  Some examples of interactionare cases showing electromagnetic disturbances in practically every kind ofdevice --
  radio, TV, auto ignition, aircraft electronics, compass,magnetometer, magnetic automobile speedometer, etc. NICAP
  lists 106examples. NICAP also lists 81 cases of radar</p>
<p>tracking of UFOs, most of which were simultaneous with visual sightings,and a number of which involved use of
  interceptors. Among the physiologicaleffects noted are burns, temporary paralysis, prickling sensation, and
  eyesirritated as by ultraviolet light. A number of witnesses claim to haveobserved landings; depressions in the ground
  and damaged vegetation usuallyresult. At a landing site in France, only weeds grow in a nine footcircular area where a
  disc was seen to land two years ago, despite effortsto replant. <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Ubatuba#21. Flying Saucer Review, 14, 1, January/February, 1968, cover and pp. 6-12.">(21)</a>
  At another landing site, French railway officialscalculated that a weight of 30 tons would be required to make
  thedepressions found in some railroad ties where a UFO was reported to havelanded.</p>
<p>While most UFO's are silent, some have made sounds described as hissing,rushing, swishing, humming, whirring,
  whining, droning, like thunder, likeshotgun, and a series of staccato explosions. In the past the absence ofsonic
  booms from supersonic UFO's bothered many scientists; it appears nowthat that problem might be overcome by surrounding
  the craft by a coronadischarge (which incidentally would be a luminous blue glow around theobject). <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Ubatuba#23. Aviation Week and Space Technology, 22 January, 1968, p. 21">(23)</a>
</p>
<p>I will purposely not comment much on occupants, except to say that thereare a few (very few) reasonably reliable and
  carefully investigated reportsof UFO occupants. For the time being, I would prefer to concentrate onreports of the
  objects, however, as the frequency of reliable occupantreports is so low. I have no bias one way or the other along
  these lines.If UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin, they may or may not be "manned". Ifmanned, one should expect an
  occasional appearance. Readers more interestedin this aspect of UFOs are referred to reference <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Ubatuba#24. The Humanoids, special issue of Flying Saucer Review, 49a Kings Grove, Peckham, London, S.E. 15, England (1967)">24</a>.
</p>
<p>In summary, we see a wide, almost exasperating range of reportedphenomenology. By careful interviews with witnesses
  and analysis of a largenumber of reports the significant patterns in phenomenonology shouldappear. If the UFOs are a
  new manifestation of nature, they should exhibitsome pattarns of appearance or behavior which would aid in identifying
  andpredicting them. If of extraterrestrial origin and intelligently guided itmay be possible to anticipate
  appearances. This will be discussed in thenext and final essay.</p>
<h2><a id="PART 5: UFOs -- HOW TO PROCEED AND WHY"></a>Partie 5 : Ovnis - Comment procéder et pourquoi ?</h2>
<p class="exergue"> Nous sommes si loins de connaître toutes les forces de la Nature et les divers modes de leur action
  qu'il that it is not worthy of a philosopher to deny phenomena only because they are inexplicable in the present state
  of our knowledge. Plus difficile il est de reconnaître l'existence de phénomènes, et plus nous are bound to
  investigate them avec une prudence increasing <span class="source">[Laplace]</span></p>
<p>Les remarques de Laplace sont certainement aussi vraies et pleines de sens pour nous aujourd'hui que pour ses
  contemporains. Dans les essais précédents j'ai suggéré qu'il existe une classe de phénomènes rather widely occuring
  today (and perhaps sinceearliest times) qui soit élusive, intriguante et often at variance with knownscientific and
  technical experience. What are we going to do about it? Whatshould we, what can we do about it?</p>
<p><a href="/people/m/McDonaldJamesE/index.html">J. E. McDonald</a> suggère que les phénomènes ovnis résident quelque
  part dans les catégories d'explication suivantes :</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="../../../../../../../../enquete/dossier/canular/">Canulars</a>, fabrications et fraudes. Report files
    contain examples of these; investigators believe about 5 % of all reports made arein this category. Une étude
    détaillée, cependant, dévoile généralement de tels rapports.</li>
  <li> Hallucinations, hystérie de masse et phénomènes de rumeur. La compréhension actuelle de la psychologie n'admet
    pas que beaucoup des rapports significatifs soient expliqués ainsi.</li>
  <li><a href="../../../../../../../../enquete/meprise/meprises.html">Méprises</a> de phénomènes physiques bien connus
    (méteorologiques, <a href="../../../../../../../../Astronomie.html">astronomiques</a>, optiques, etc.). By far the
    largest percentage ofreports fall in this category. Study by an experienced investigatorcan usually identify these.
  </li>
  <li> Phénomènes physiques mal compris (effets électriques ou météorologiques rares, plasmas). Certainement une
    possibilité distincte dans un certain nombre de cas, il s'agit d'une catégorie méritant une étude attentive.
    Certains des cas les plus intéressants, cependant, ont suffisamment de données observationnelles pour éliminer cette
    possibilité (je fais référence aux rapports d'objets à l'apparence non ambiguë de machines).</li>
  <li>Technologies avancées (véhicules d'essai, <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/Satellites.html">satellites</a>, effets de réentrée). Encore une fois,
    certains signalements peuvent être attribués à cette cause, mais la plupart ne le peuvent pas.</li>
  <li> Poorly understood psychic phenomena (psychic projections,archetypal images, parapsychological phenomena, etc). It
    is difficultto comment on this possibility because the current lack of knowledge of parapsychology. While a (small)
    number of UFO reports do exhibitaspects of parapsychological phenomenology <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Ubatuba#25. An interesting example appears in the July, 1968 issue of Science & Mechanics, starting on page 30">(25)</a>
    general relationshipshave yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Reference <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Ubatuba#6. Flying Saucers - A Modern Myth, C. C. Jung, Harcourt, Brace & World New York, 1959">6</a>
    deals with this explanation.</li>
  <li> Extraterrestrial probes. A possibility commonly held by the publicand commonly rejected by scientists. Prof.
    McDonald believes a numberof sightings are best explained by this hypothesis.</li>
  <li> Messengers of salvation and occult truth. This explanation islisted because of the nature of certain reports
    (particularly"contact" reports -- reports involving communication of UFO occupantsand the witnesses) and because of
    the historical aspects of thephenomenology. See reference <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Ubatuba#5. Flying Saucers Through the Ages, Paul Thomas, Neville Spearman, London, 1966.">5</a>
    for elaboration.Perhaps, to play it safe, an additional category should be listed:</li>
  <li> Other</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly, the explanation of UFOs will interest someone. Psychologists havean interest in 1, 2, 3 and 6; theologians
  in category 8, scientists in 4and 7. Therefore, whatever the explanation, it is a problem of at leastaverage interest.
  If, by chance, the explanation is 7, or even 8 (andpossibly 6) the value to society would be profound and significant.
  In thissense, an identification of the phenomenon would be a task of highestpotential urgency.</p>
<h3>Comment cela pourrait-il être fait ?</h3>
<p>Because of the transient nature of UFO's we cannot expect to have theinterested scientist rush to the spot to make
  his own observations. Reportsso far accumulated, however, show that UFO's sometimes appear frequently incertain areas
  for a short period of time (a so-called "flap"). Onecharacteristic of the flap is a larger percentage of sightings of
  objectsat low levels than one normally obtains. If the reporting and analysissystem were responsive enough, men and
  instruments</p>
<p>could be dispatched when a flap was recognized with a reasonable hope ofmaking first hand observations. I would
  therefore suggest the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Organization of a central report receiving agency, staffed by apermanent group of experienced UFO investigators
    and having on callspecialists in astronomy, physics, optics, atmospheric physics, psychologyand the like for
    application when needed.</li>
  <li> This agency should be readily and instantly accessible to the public forthe purpose of reporting. (Witnesses
    should be able to turn to someoneother than the press to make reports.) Report forms could be made availablein Post
    Offices, for example. More urgent reports could be made bytoll-free telephone lines. (Radio amateurs have recently
    begun cooperatingwith NICAP to provide an alerting system.) Because many sightings are madeat night when most
    services are closed, the local police office should beprepared to receive reports of sightings. Experience indicates
    thatwitnesses usually turn first to the police, particularly if the UFO wasclose or if the witness was frightened.
    Such a local "data center" would bevery useful for identifying flaps and could possibly serve to dispatchpersonnel
    to an area of interest. Care must be taken to properly inform theofficers involved about the aims of the project and
    requests for assistanceshould be made in such a way as to minimize additional police work. Anawareness of the
    problem by a dispatcher or desk sergeant might besufficient to draw attention to a developing situation. An
    interested localscientist could then be notified, perhaps in time to make an observation.Hynek also suggests that
    the police carry cameras in their cars should theybecome involved as observers. This advice obviously applies to
    allinterested persons.</li>
  <li> A loose organization of interested scientists should be available toinvestigate reports in their local areas. A
    good start toward this has beenmade by NICAP. It is important that investigations be made rapidly and byproperly
    qualified people.</li>
  <li> The press should be encouraged to report sightings accurately and in anon-sensational manner. Suitable reporting
    would encourage other witnessesto come forth.</li>
  <li> Existing sensor records could be examined for anomalies, particularly ifvisual reports are made nearby. Since we
    don't know what to expect, it isdifficult to say what is needed; however records of electric, magnetic
    andgravitational fields, radioactivity, optical and radio frequency anomalieswould be a logical place to start.
    Radars could also contribute, if theyare designed for general purpose use. As it is, most current radardetection and
    tracking devices are designed to ignore anomalous objects.</li>
</ol>
<p>After a few years' operation in this mode, it should be possible to studythe resulting report statistics to draw
  generalities about appearance andbehavior (such as was done in Part IV) and most importantly to anticipatetimes and
  locations of appearances. Only when this is done will it bepossible to instrument sightings and therefore obtain the
  objective data sobadly needed If the explanation is #4, some environmental correlations arebound to occur. For #7 it
  is possible that appearances could beanticipated, if we are clever enough; for #6 and #8 we will likely not beable to
  anticipate appearances.</p>
<p>Certainly the conclusions drawn by NICAP from reports in their file arestartling and, if valid worthy of considerable
  scientific effort. It wouldbe much more convincing if data could be collected worldwide and if themost interesting
  reports could be most interesting reports could beintensively and completely investigated. I believe current reports
  justifythe expanded data collection and analysis effort. </p>
