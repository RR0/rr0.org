<p>On 31 August 1966, Colonel Ivan C. Atkinson, Deputy Executive Director of the Air Force Office of Scientific
  Research, addressed a letter to the University of Colorado. In it he outlined the belief of AFOSR that a scientific
  investigation of unidentified flying objects conducted wholly outside the jurisdiction of the Air Force would be of
  unusual significance from the standpoint of both scientific interest in and public concern with the subject. Colonel
  Atkinson requested "that the University of Colorado participate in this investigation as the grantee institution." The
  University was asked to undertake this scientific study with the unconditional guarantee that "the scientists involved
  will have complete freedom to design and develop techniques for the investigation of the varied physical and
  psychological questions raised in conjunction with this phenomenon according to their best scientific judgment."</p>
<p>The request of AFOSR was pursuant to the recommendation made in March, 1966, of an ad hoc panel of the United States
  Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, chaired by Dr. Brian O'Brien. Subsequently, as chairman of the Advisory Committee
  to the Air Force Systems Command of the National Academy Sciences-National Research Council, Dr. OBrien had advised
  AFOSR on the suitability of the University of Colorado as the grantee institution.</p>
<p>Following receipt of Colonel Atkinsons request in behalf of AFOSR, the University administration and interested
  members of the faculty discussed the proposed study project. The subject was recognized as being both elusive and
  controversial in its scientific aspects. For this reason alone, there was an understandable reluctance on the part of
  many scientists to undertake such a study. Scientists hesitate to commit their time to research that does not appear
  to offer reasonably clear avenues by which definite progress may be made. In addition, the subject had achieved
  considerable notoriety over the years. Many popular books and magazine articles had criticized the Air Force for not
  devoting more attention to the subject; others criticized the Air Force for paying any attention whatever to UFOs.</p>
<p>Bearing these facts in mind, the University administration concluded that it had an obligation to the country to do
  what it could to clarify a tangled and confused issue while making entirely certain that the highest academic and
  scientific standards would be maintained. Fortunately, Dr. Edward U. Condon, Professor of Physics and Fellow of the
  Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics, shared this concern and was willing to accept appointment as scientific
  director of the project. Designated as principal investigators with Dr. Condon were Dr. Stuart Cook, Professor and
  Chairman of the Department of Psychology, and Dr. Franklin E. Roach, physicist specializing in atmospheric physics at
  the Environmental Science Services Administration. Assistant Dean Robert J. Low of the Graduate School was appointed
  project coordinator.</p>
<p>The University undertook the study only on condition that it would be conducted as a normal scientific research
  project, subject only to the professional scientific judgment of the director and his aides. Freedom from control by
  the granting agency was guaranteed not only by the assertions of Colonel Atkinson, but also by the provision that the
  complete report of the findings of the study would be made available to the public.</p>
<p>In addition the University recognized that this study, as the first undertaken on a broad scale in this field, would
  have seminal effect. It therefore desired the cooperation of the scientific community at large. Assurances of support
  and counsel were forthcoming from such institutions as the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR3 and the
  Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA), and from many scientists and scientific institutions in other
  parts of the country.</p>
<p>The University also welcomed an arrangement whereby the methods and results of the study would be critically examined
  at the conclusion of the project. This cooperation was extended by the National Academy of Sciences, which announced
  in its October 1966 News Report that the Academy had agreed to review the University of Colorado study upon its
  completion in 1968. Unhesitatingly agreeing to this independent examination of the study, the ASOFR announced that it
  would consider the NAS review a "further independent check on the scientific validity of the method of
  investigation.</p>
<p>In October, 1966, the scientific director assembled a modest staff centered at the University campus in Boulder and
  work began. In addition, agreements were entered into between the University and such institutions as NCAR, the
  Institutes of ESSA, the Stanford Research Institute and the University of Arizona for the scientific and technical
  services of persons in specialized fields of knowledge bearing upon the subject under investigation. Thus it became
  possible to study specific topics both at Boulder and elsewhere and to bring to bear upon the data gathered by the
  project's field investigation teams whatever expertise might be required for full analysis of the information.</p>
<p>The report of the study that was conducted over the ensuing 18 months is presented on the following pages. It is
  lengthy and diverse in the subjects it treats, which range from history to critical examination of eye-witness
  reports; from laboratory analysis to presentation of general scientific principles. No claim of perfection is made for
  this study or for its results, since like any scientific endeavor, it could have been improved upon -- especially from
  the vantage-point of hindsight. The reader should thus bear in mind that this study represents the first attempt by a
  group of highly qualified scientists and specialists to examine coldly and dispassionately a subject that has aroused
  the imagination and emotions of some persons and has intrigued many others. No one study can answer all questions; but
  it can point out new lines for research, it can cross off some ideas as not fruitful for further inquiry, and it can
  lay to rest at least some rumors, exaggerations, and imaginings.</p>
