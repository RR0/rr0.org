<p>The decision to establish this project for the Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects stems from
  recommendations in a report dated March 1966 of an Ad Hoc Committee of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board set up
  under the chairmanship of Dr. Brian O'Brien to review the work of Project Blue Book. Details of the history of work on
  UFOs are set forth in Section V, Chapter 2. (See also Appendix A.)</p>
<p>The recommendation was:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is the opinion of the Committee that the present Air Force program dealing with UFO sightings has been well
    organized, although the resources assigned to it (only one officer, a sergeant, and a secretary) have been quite
    limited. In 19 years and more than 10,000 sightings recorded and classified, there appears to be no verified and
    fully satisfactory evidence of any case that is clearly outside the framework of presently known science and
    technology. Nevertheless, there is always the possibility that analysis of new sightings may provide some additions
    to scientific knowledge of value to the Air Force. Moreover, some of the case records at which the Committee looked
    that were listed as 'identified' were sightings where the evidence collected was too meager or too indefinite to
    permit positive listing in the identified category. Because of this the Committee recommends that the present
    program be strengthened to provide opportunity for scientific investigation of selected sightings in more detail
    than has been possible to date.</p>
  <p>To accomplish this it is recommended that:</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>Contracts be negotiated with a few selected universities to provide scientific teams to investigate promptly and
      in depth certain selected sightings of UFO's. Each team should include at least one psychologist, preferably one
      interested in clinical psychology, and at least one physical scientist, preferably an astronomer or geophysicist
      familiar with atmospheric physics. The universities should be chosen to provide good geographical distribution,
      and should be within convenient distance of a base of the Air Force Systems Command (AFSC).</li>
    <li>At each AFSC base an officer skilled in investigation (but not necessarily with scientific training) should be
      designated to work with the corresponding university team for that geographical section. The local representative
      of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) might be a logical choice for this.</li>
    <li>One university or one not-for-profit organization should be selected to coordinate the work of the teams
      mentioned under A above, and also to make certain of very close communication and coordination with the office of
      Project Blue Book.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>It is thought that perhaps 100 sightings a year might be subjected to this close study, and that possibly an
    average of 10 man days might be required per sighting so studied. The information provided by such a program might
    bring to light new facts of scientific value, and would almost certainly provide a far better basis than we have
    today for decision on a long term UFO program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These recommendations were referred by the Secretary of the Air Force to the Air Force Office of Scientific Research
  for implementation, which, after study, decided to combine recommendations A and C so as to have a single contracting
  university with authority to subcontract with other research groups as needed. Recommendation B was implemented by the
  issuance of Air Force Regulation 80-17 (Appendix B) which establishes procedures for handling UFO reports at the Air
  Force bases.</p>
<p>In setting up the Colorado project, as already stated in Section I, the emphasis was on whether deeper study of
  unidentified flying objects might provide some "additions to scientific knowledge."</p>
<p>After considering various possibilities, the AFOSR staff decided to ask the University of Colorado to undertake the
  project (see Preface). Dr. J. Thomas Ratchford visited Boulder in late July 1966 to learn whether the University would
  be willing to undertake the task. A second meeting was held on 10 August 1966 in which the scope of the proposed study
  was outlined to an interested group of the administrative staff and faculty of the University by Dr. Ratchford and Dr.
  William Price, executive director of AFOSR. After due deliberation, University officials decided to undertake the
  project.</p>
<p>The contract provided that the planning, direction and conclusions of the Colorado project were to be conducted
  wholly independently of the Air Force. To avoid duplication of effort, the Air Force was ordered to furnish the
  project with the records of its own earlier work and to provide the support of personnel at AF bases when requested by
  our field teams.</p>
<p>We were assured that the federal government would withhold no information on the subject, and that all essential
  information about UFOs could be included in this report. Where UFO sightings involve classified missile launchings or
  involve the use of classified radar systems, this fact is merely stated as to do more would involve violation of
  security on these military subjects. In our actual experience these reservations have affected a negligible fraction
  of the total material and have not affected the conclusions (Section I) which we draw from our work.</p>
<p>The first research contract with AFOSR provided $313,000 for the first 15 months from 1 November 1966 to 31 January
  1968. The contract was publicly announced on 7 October 1966. It then became our task to investigate those curious
  entities distinguished by lack of knowledge of what they are, rather than in terms of what they are known to be,
  namely, unidentified flying objects.</p>
