<p>An unidentified flying object (UFO, pronounced OOFO) is here defined as the stimulus for a report made by one or more
  individuals of something seen in the sky (or an object thought to be capable of flight but when landed on the earth)
  which the observer could not identify as having an ordinary natural origin, and which seemed to him sufficiently
  puzzling that he undertook to make a report of it to police, to government officials, to the press, or perhaps to a
  representative of a private organization devoted to the study of such objects.</p>
<p>Defined in. this way, there is no question as to the existence of UFOs, because UFO reports exist in fairly large
  numbers, and the stimulus for each report is, by this definition, an UFO. The problem then becomes that of learning to
  recognize the various kinds of stimuli that give rise to UFO reports.</p>
<p>The UFO is "the stimulus for a report . . ." This language refrains from saying whether the reported object was a
  real, physical, material thing, or a visual impression of an ordinary physical thing distorted by atmospheric
  conditions or by faulty vision so as to be unrecognizable, or whether it was a purely mental delusion existing in the
  mind of the observer without an accompanying visual stimulus.</p>
<p>The definition includes insincere reports in which the alleged sighter undertakes for whatever reason to deceive. In
  the case of a delusion, the reporter is not aware of the lack of a visual stimulus. In the case of a deception, the
  reporter knows that he is not telling the truth about his alleged experience.</p>
<p>The words "which he could not identify . ." are of crucial importance. The stimulus gives rise to an UFO report
  precisely because the observer could not identify the thing seen. A woman and her husband reported a strange thing
  seen flying in the sky and reported quite correctly that she knew "it was unidentified because neither of us knew what
  it was."</p>
<p>The thing seen and reported may have been an object as commonplace as the planet Venus, but it became an UFO because
  the observer did not know what it was. With this usage it is clear that less well informed individuals are more likely
  to see an UFO than those who are more knowledgeable because the latter are better able to make direct identification
  of what they see. A related complication is that less well informed persons are often inaccurate observers who are
  unable to give an accurate account of what they believe that they have seen.</p>
<p>If additional study of a report later provides an ordinary interpretation of what was seen, some have suggested that
  we should change its name to IFO, for identified flying object. But we have elected to go on calling it an UFO because
  some identifications are tentative or controversial, due to lack of sufficient data on which to base a definite
  identification. A wide variety of ordinary objects have through misinterpretation given rise to UFO reports. This
  topic is discussed in detail in Section VI, Chapter 2. (The Air Force has published a pamphlet entitled, "Aids to
  Identification of Flying Objects" (USAF, 1968) which is a useful aid in the interpretation of something seen which
  might otherwise be an UFO.)</p>
<p>The words "sufficiently puzzling that they undertook to make a report . . " are essential. As a practical matter, we
  can not study something that is not reported, so a puzzling thing seen but not reported is not here classed as an
  UFO.</p>
