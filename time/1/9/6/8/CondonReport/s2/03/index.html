<p>In our experience, the persons making reports seem in nearly all cases to be normal, responsible individuals. In most
  cases they are quite calm, at least by the time they make a report. They are simply puzzled about what they saw and
  hope that they can be helped to a better understanding of it. Only a very few are obviously quite emotionally
  disturbed, their minds being filled with pseudo-scientific, pseudo-religious or other fantasies. Cases of this kind
  range from slight disturbance to those who are manifestly in need of psychiatric care. The latter form an extremely
  small minority of all the persons encountered in this study. While the existence of a few mentally unbalanced persons
  among UFO observers is part of the total situation, it is completely incorrect and unfair to imply that all who report
  UFOs are "crazy kooks," just as it is equally incorrect to ignore the fact that there are mentally disturbed persons
  among them.</p>
<p>Individuals differ greatly as to their tendency to make reports. Among the reasons for not reporting UFOs are apathy,
  lack of awareness of public interest, fear of ridicule, lack of knowledge as to where to report and the time and cost
  of making a report.</p>
<p>We found that reports are not useful unless they are made promptly. Even so, because of the short duration of most
  UFO stimuli, the report usually can not be made until after the UFO has disappeared. A few people telephoned to us
  from great distances to describe something seen a year or two earlier. Such reports are of little value.
</p>
<p>Early in the study we tried to estimate the fraction of all of the sightings that are reported. In social
  conversations many persons could tell us about some remarkable and puzzling thing that they had seen at some time in
  the past which would sound just as remarkable as many of the things that are to be found in UFO report files. Then we
  would ask whether they had made a report and in most cases would be told that they had not. As a rough guess based on
  this uncontrolled sample, we estimate that perhaps 10% of the sightings that people are willing to talk about later
  are all that get reported at the time. This point was later covered in a more formal public attitude survey (Section
  III, Chapter 7) made for this study in which only 7% of those who said they had seen an UFO had reported it
  previously. Thus if all people reported sightings that are like those that some people do report, the number of
  reports that would be received would be at least ten times greater than the number actually received.</p>
<p>At first we thought it would be desirable to undertake an extensive publicity campaign to try to get more complete
  reporting from the public. It was decided not to do this, because about 90% of all UFO reports prove to be quite
  plausibly related to ordinary objects. A tenfold increase in the number of reports would have multiplied by ten the
  task of eliminating the ordinary cases which would have to be analyzed. Our available resources for field study
  enabled us to deal only with a small fraction of the reports coming in. No useful purpose would have been served
  under. these circumstances by stimulating the receipt of an even greater number.</p>
<p>Study of records of some UFO reports from other parts of the world gave us the strong impression that these were made
  up of a mix of cases of similar kind to those being reported in the United States. For example, in August 1967 Prof.
  James McDonald of Arizona made a 20-day trip to Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand in the course of which he
  interviewed some 80 persons who had made UFO reports there at various times. On his return he gave us an account of
  these experiences that confirmed our impression that the reports from these other parts of the world were, as a class,
  similar to those being received in the United States. Therefore we decided to restrict our field studies to the United
  States and to one or two cases in Canada (See Section III, Chapter 1) This was done on the practical grounds of
  reducing travel expense and of avoiding diplomatic and language difficulties. The policy was decided on after
  preliminary study had indicated that in broad generality the spectrum of kinds of UFO reports being received in other
  countries was very similar to our own.</p>
