<p>Official interest in UFOs, or "flying saucers" as they were called~ at first dates from June 1947. On 24 June,
  Kenneth Arnold, a business man of Boise, Idaho was flying a private airplane near Mt. Rainier, Washington. He reported
  seeing a group of objects flying along in a line which he said looked "like pie plates skipping over the water." The
  newspaper reports called the things seen "flying saucers" and they have been so termed ever since, although not all
  UFOs are described as being of this shape.</p>
<p>Soon reports of flying saucers were coming in from various parts of the country. Many received prominent press
  coverage (Bloecher, 1967). UFOs were also reported from other countries; in fact, more than a thousand such reports
  were made in Sweden in 1946.</p>
<p>The details of reports vary so greatly that it is impossible to relate them all to any single explanation. The broad
  range of things reported is much the same in different countries. This means that a general explanation peculiar to
  any one country has to be ruled out, since it is utterly improbable that the secret military aircraft of any one
  country would be undergoing test flights in different countries. Similarly it is most unlikely that military forces of
  different countries would be testing similar developments all over the world at the same time in secrecy from each
  other.</p>
<p>Defense authorities had to reckon with the possibility that UFOs might represent flights of a novel military aircraft
  of some foreign power. Private citizens speculated that the UFOs were test flights of secret American aircraft.
  Cognizance of the UFO problem was naturally assumed by the Department of the Air Force in the then newly established
  Department of Defense. Early investigations were carried on in secrecy by the Air Force, and also by the governments
  of other nations.</p>
<p>Such studies in the period 1947-52 convinced the responsible authorities of the Air Force that the UFOs, as observed
  up to that time, do not constitute a threat to national security. In consequence, ever since that time, a minimal
  amount of attention has been given to them.</p>
<p>The year 1952 brought an unusually large number of UFO reports, including many in the vicinity of the Washington
  National Airport, during a period of several days in July. Such a concentration of reports in a small region in a
  short time is called a "flap." The Washington flap of 1952 received a great deal of attention at the time (Section
  III, Chapters).</p>
<p>At times in 1952, UFO reports were coming in to the Air Force from the general public in such numbers as to produce
  some clogging of military communications channels. It was thought that an enemy planning a sneak attack might
  deliberately stimulate a great wave of UFO reports for the very purpose of clogging communication facilities. This
  consideration was in the forefront of a study that was made in January 1953 by a panel of scientists under the
  chairmanship of the late H. P. Robertson, professor of mathematical physics at the California Institute of Technology
  (Section V, Chapter 2). This panel recommended that efforts be made to remove the aura of mystery surrounding the
  subject and to conduct a campaign of public education designed to produce a better understanding of the situation.
  This group also concluded that there was no evidence in the available data of any real threat to national
  security.</p>
<p>Since 1953 the results of UFO study have been unclassified, except where tangential reasons exist for withholding
  details, as, for example, where sightings are related to launchings of classified missiles, or to the use of
  classified radar systems.</p>
<p>During the period from March 1952 to the present, the structure for handling UFO reports in the Air Force has been
  called Project Blue Book. As already mentioned the work of Project Blue Book was reviewed in early 1966 by the
  committee headed by Dr. Brian O'Brien. This review led to the reaffirmation that no security threat is posed by the
  existence of a few unexplained UFO reports, but the committee suggested a study of the possibility that something of
  scientific value might come from a more detailed study of some of the reports than was considered necessary from a
  strictly military viewpoint. This recommendation eventuated in the setting up of the Colorado project</p>
<p>The story of Air Force interest, presented in Section V. Chapter 2, shows that from the beginning the possibility
  that some UFOs might be manned vehicles from outer space was considered, but naturally no publicity was given to this
  idea because of the total lack of evidence or it.</p>
<p>Paralleling the official government interest, was a burgeoning of amateur interest stimulated by newspaper and
  magazine reports. By 1950 popular books on the subject began to appear on the newsstands. In January 1950 the idea
  that UFOs were extraterrestrial vehicles was put forward as a reality in an article entitled "Flying Saucers are Real"
  in True magazine written by Donald B. Keyhoe, a retired Marine Corps major. Thereafter a steady stream of sensational
  writing about UFOs has aroused a considerable amount of interest among laymen in studying the subject.</p>
<p>Many amateur organizations exist, some of them rather transiently, so that it would be difficult to compile an
  accurate listing of them. Two such organizations in the United States have a national structure. These are the Aerial
  Phenomena Research Organization (APRO), with headquarters in Tucson, Arizona, claiming about 8000 members; and the
  National Investigations Committee for Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) with headquarters in Washington, D. C. and claiming
  some 12,000 members. James and Coral Lorenzen head APRO, while Keyhoe is the director of NICAP, which, despite the
  name and Washington address is not a government agency. Many other smaller groups exist, among them Saucers and
  Unexplained Celestial Events Research Society (SAUCERS) operated by James Moseley.</p>
<p>Of these organizations, NICAP devotes a considerable amount of its attention to attacking the Air Force and to trying
  to influence members of Congress to hold hearings and in other ways to join in these attacks. It maintained a friendly
  relation to the Colorado project during about the first year, while warning its members to be on guard lest the
  project turn out to have been "hired to whitewash the Air Force." During this period NICAP made several efforts to
  influence the course of our study. When it became clear that these would fail, NICAP attacked the Colorado project as
  "biased" and therefore without merit.</p>
<p>The organizations mentioned espouse a scientific approach to the study of the subject. In addition there are a number
  of others that have a primarily religious orientation.</p>
<p>From 1947 to 1966 almost no attention was paid to the UFO problem by well qualified scientists. Some of the reasons
  for this lack of interest have been clearly stated by Prof. Gerard P. Kuiper of the University of Arizona (Appendix
  C). Concerning the difficulty of establishing that some UFOs may come from outer space, he makes the following cogent
  observation: "The problem is more difficult than finding a needle in a haystack; it is finding a piece of
  extraterrestrial hay in a terrestrial haystack, often on the basis of reports of believers in extra-terrestrial
  hay."</p>
