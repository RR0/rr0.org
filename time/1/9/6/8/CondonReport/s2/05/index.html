<p>A scientific approach to the UFO phenomenon must embrace a wide range of disciplines. It involves such physical
  sciences as physics, chemistry, aerodynamics, and meteorology. Since the primary material consists mostly of reports
  of individual observers, the psychology of perception, the physiology of defects of vision, and the study of mental
  states are also involved.</p>
<p>Social psychology and social psychiatry are likewise involved in seeking to understand group motivations which act to
  induce belief in extraordinary hypotheses on the basis of what most scientists and indeed most laymen would regard as
  little or no evidence. These problems of medical and social psychology deserve more attention than we were able to
  give them. They fell distinctly outside of the field of expertise of our staff, which concentrated more on the study
  of the UFOs themselves than on the personal and social problems generated by them.</p>
<p>Among those who write and speak on the subject, some strongly espouse the view that the federal government really
  knows a great deal more about UFOs than is made public. Some have gone so far as to assert that the government has
  actually captured extraterrestrial flying saucers and has their crews in secret captivity, if not in the Pentagon,
  then at some secret military base. We believe that such teachings are fantastic nonsense, that it would be impossible
  to keep a secret of such enormity over two decades, and that no useful purpose would be served by engaging in such an
  alleged conspiracy of silence. One person with whom we have dealt actually maintains that the Air Force has nothing to
  do with UFOs, claiming that this super-secret matter is in the hands of the Central Intelligence Agency which, he
  says, installed one of its own agents as scientific director of the Colorado study. This story, if true, is indeed a
  well kept secret. These allegations of a conspiracy on the part of our own government to conceal knowledge of the
  existence of "flying saucers" have, so far as any evidence that has come to our attention, no factual basis
  whatever.</p>
<p>The project's first attention was given to becoming familiar with past work in the subject. This was more difficult
  than in more orthodox fields because almost none of the many books and magazine articles dealing with UFOs could be
  regarded as scientifically reliable. There were the two books of Donald H. Menzel, director emeritus of the Harvard
  College Observatory and now a member of the staff of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (Menzel, 1952 and Boyd,
  19634. Two other useful books were The UFO Evidence (1964), a compilation of UFO cases by Richard Hall, and The Report
  on Unidentified Flying Objects by E. J. Ruppelt (1956), the first head of Project Blue Book. In this initial stage we
  were also helped by "briefings" given by Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla, the present head of Project Blue Book, Dr. J.
  Allen Hynek, astronomical consultant to Project Blue Book, and by Donald Keyhoe and Richard Hall of NICAP.</p>
<p>Out of this preliminary study came the recognition of a variety of topics that would require detailed attention.
  These included the effects of optical mirages, the analogous anomalies of radio wave propagation as they affect radar,
  critical analysis of alleged UFO photographs, problems of statistical analysis of UFO reports, chemical analysis of
  alleged material from UFOs, and reports of disturbances to automobile ignition and to headlights from the presence of
  UFOs. Results of the project's study of these and other topics are presented in this section and in Sections III and
  VI of this report.</p>
