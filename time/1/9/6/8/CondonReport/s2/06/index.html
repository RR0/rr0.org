<p>Early attention was given to the question of investigation of individual cases, either by detailed critical study of
  old records or by field trip investigation of current cases. From this study we concluded that there was little to be
  gained from the study of old cases, except perhaps to get ideas on mistakes to be avoided in studies of new cases. We
  therefore decided not to make field trips to investigate cases that were more than a year old, although in a few cases
  we did do some work on such cases when their study could be combined with a field investigation of a new case.</p>
<p>At first we hoped that field teams could respond to early warning so quickly that they would be able to get to the
  site while the UFO was still there, and that our teams would not only get their own photographs, but even obtain
  spectrograms of the light of the UFO, and make radioactive, magnetic, and sound measurements while the UFO was still
  present.</p>
<p>Such expectations were found to be in vain. Nearly all UFO sightings are of very short duration, seldom lasting as
  long as an hour and usually lasting for a few minutes. The observers often become so excited that they do not report
  at all until the UFO has gone away. With communication and travel delays, the field team was unable to get to the
  scene until long after the UFO had vanished.</p>
<p>This was, of course, a highly unsatisfactory situation. We gave much thought to how it could be overcome and
  concluded that this could only be done by a great publicity campaign designed to get the public to report sightings
  much more promptly than it does, coupled with a nationwide scheme of having many trained field teams scattered at many
  points across the nation. These teams would have had to be ready to respond at a moment's notice. Even so, in the vast
  majority of the cases, they would not have arrived in time for direct observation of the reported UFO. Moreover, the
  national publicity designed to insure more prompt reporting would have had the effect of arousing exaggerated public
  concern over the subject, and certainly would have vastly increased the number of nonsense reports to which response
  would have had to be made. In recruiting the large number of field teams, great care would have had to be exercised to
  make sure that they were staffed with people of adequate scientific training, rather than with persons emotionally
  committed to extreme pro or con views on the subject.</p>
<p>Clearly this was quite beyond the means of our study. Such a program to cover the entire United States would cost
  many millions of dollars a year, and even then there would have been little likelihood that anything of importance
  would have been uncovered.</p>
<p>In a few cases some physical evidence could be gathered by examination of a site where an UFO was reported to have
  landed. In such a case it did not matter that the field team arrived after the UFO had gone. But in no case did we
  obtain any convincing evidence of this kind although every effort was made to do so. (See below and in Section III,
  Chapters 3 and 4).</p>
<p>Thus most of the field investigation, as it turned out, consisted in the interviewing of persons who made the report.
  By all odds the most used piece of physical equipment was the tape recorder.</p>
<p>The question of a number of investigators on a field team was an important one. In most work done in the past by the
  Air Force, UFO observers were interviewed by a single Air Force officer, who usually had no special training and whose
  freedom to devote much time to the study was limited by the fact that he also had other responsibilities. When field
  studies are made by amateur organizations like APRO or NICAP, there are often several members present on a team, but
  usually they are persons without technical training, and often with a strong bias toward the sensational aspects of
  the subject.</p>
<p>Prof. Hynek strongly believes that the teams should have four or more members. He recommends giving each report what
  he calls the "FBI treatment," by which he means not only thorough interviewing of the persons who made the report, but
  in addition an active quest in the neighborhood where the sighting occurred to try to discover additional witnesses.
  Against such thoroughness must be balanced the consideration that the cost per case goes up proportionately to the
  number of persons in a team, so that the larger the team, the fewer the cases that can be studied.</p>
<p>The detailed discussions in Section III, Chapter 1 and in Section IV make it clear that the field work is associated
  with many frustrations. Many of the trips turn out to be wild goose chases and the team members often feel as if they
  are members of a fire department that mostly answers false alarms.</p>
<p>We found that it was always worthwhile to do a great deal of initial interviewing by long distance telephone. A great
  many reports that seem at first to be worthy of full field investigation could be disposed of in this way with
  comparatively little trouble and expense. Each case presented its own special problems. No hard-and-fast rule was
  found by which to decide in advance whether a particular report was worth the trouble of a field trip.</p>
<p>After careful consideration of these various factors, we decided to operate with two-man teams, composed whenever
  possible of one person with training in physical science and one with training in psychology. When the study became
  fully operational in 1967 we had three such teams. Dr. Roy Craig describes the work of these teams in Section III,
  Chapters 1, 3, and 4. Reports of field investigations are presented in Section IV.</p>
