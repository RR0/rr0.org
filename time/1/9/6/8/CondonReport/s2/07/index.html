<p>By definition UFOs exist because UFO reports exist. What makes the whole subject intriguing is the possibility that
  some of these reports cannot be reconciled with ordinary explanations, so that some extraordinarily sensational
  explanation for them might have to be invoked. A fuller discussion of some misinterpretations of ordinary events by
  Dr. W. K. Hartmann is given in Section VI, Chapter 2.</p>
<p>A great many reports are readily identified with ordinary phenomena seen under unusual circumstances, or noted by
  someone who is an inexperienced, inept, or unduly excited observer. Because such reports are vague and inaccurate, it
  is often impossible to make an identification with certainty.</p>
<p>This gives rise to controversy. In some cases, an identification that the UFO was "probably" an aircraft is all than
  can be made from the available data. After the event no amount of further interviewing of one or more witnesses can
  usually change such a probable into a certain identification. Field workers who would like to identify as many as
  possible are naturally disposed to claim certainty when this is at all possible, but others who desire to have a
  residue of unexplained cases in order to add mystery and importance to the UFO problem incline to set impossibly high
  standards of certainty in the evidence before they are willing to accept a simple explanation for a report.</p>
<p>This dilemma is nicely illustrated by a question asked in the House of Commons of Prime Minister Harold Wilson, as
  reported in Hansard for <time>1967-12-19</time>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Unidentified Flying Objects. Question 14. Sir J. Langford-Holt asked the Prime Minister whether he is satisfied
    that all sightings of unidentified flying objects which are reported from service sources are explainable, what
    inquiries he has authorized into these objects outside the defense aspect, and whether he will now appoint one
    Minister to look into all aspects of reports.</p>
  <p>The Prime Minister: The answers are 'Yes, except when the information given is insufficient,' 'None' and 'No.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously there is a nice bit of semantics here in that the definition of "when the information is sufficient" is
  that it is sufficient when an explanation can be given.</p>
<p>Discussions of whether a marginal case should he regarded for statistical purposes as having been explained or not
  have proved to be futile. Some investigators take the position that, where a plausible interpretation in terms of
  commonplace events can be made, then the UFO is regarded as having been identified. Others take the opposite view that
  an UFO cannot be regarded as having been given an ordinary identification unless there is complete and binding
  evidence amounting to certainty about the proposed identification.</p>
<p>For example, in January 1968 near Castle Rock, Cob., some 30 persons reported UFOs, including spacecraft with
  flashing lights, fantastic maneuverability, and even with occupants presumed to be from outer space. Two days later it
  was more modestly reported that two high school boys had launched a polyethylene hot-air balloon.</p>
<p>Locally that was the end of the story. But there is a sequel. A man in Florida makes a practice of collecting
  newspaper stories about UFOs and sending them out in a mimeographed UFO news letter which he mails to various UFO
  journals and local clubs. He gave currency to the Castle Rock reports but not to the explanation that followed. When
  he was chided for not having done so, he declared that no one could be absolutely sure that all the Castle Rock
  reports arose from sightings of the balloon. There might also have been an UFO from outer space among the sightings.
  No one would dispute his logic, but one may with propriety wonder why he neglected to tell his readers that at least
  some of the reports were actually misidentifications of a hot-air balloon.</p>
<p>As a practical matter, we take the position that if an UFO report can be plausibly explained in ordinary terms, then
  we accept that explanation even though not enough evidence may be available to prove it beyond all doubt. This point
  is so important that perhaps an analogy is needed to make it clear. Several centuries ago, the most generally accepted
  theory of human disease was that it was caused by the patient's being possessed or inhabited by a devil or evil
  spirit. Different diseases were supposed to be caused by different devils. The guiding principle for medical research
  was then the study and classification of different kinds of devils, and progress in therapy was sought in the search
  for and discovery of means for exorcising each kind of devil.</p>
<p>Gradually medical research discovered bacteria; toxins and viruses, and their causative relation to various diseases.
  More and more diseases came to be described by their causes.</p>
<p>Suppose now that instead, medicine had clung to the devil theory of disease. As long as there exists one human
  illness that is not yet fully understood in modern terms such a theory cannot be disproved. It is always possible,
  while granting that some diseases are caused by viruses, etc. to maintain that those that are not yet understood are
  the ones that are really caused by devils.</p>
<p>In some instances the same sort of UFO is observed night after night under similar circumstances. In our experience
  this has been a sure sign that the UFO could be correlated with some ordinary phenomenon.</p>
<p>For example, rather early in our work, a Colorado farmer reported seeing an UFO land west of his farm nearly every
  evening about 6:00 p.m. A field team went to see him and quickly and unambiguously identified the UFO as the planet
  Saturn. The nights on which he did not see it land were those in which the western sky was cloudy.</p>
<p>But the farmer did not easily accept our identification of his UFO as Saturn. He contended that, while his UFO had
  landed behind the mountains on the particular evening that we visited him, on most nights, he insisted, it landed in
  front of the mountains, and therefore could not be a planet. The identification with Saturn from the ephemeris was so
  precise that we did not visit his farm night after night in order to see for ourselves whether his UFO ever landed in
  front of the mountains. We did not regard it as part of our duty to persuade observers of the correctness of our
  interpretations. In most cases observers readily accepted our explanation, and some expressed relief at having an
  everyday explanation available to them.</p>
<p>We sought to hold to a minimum delays in arriving at the site of an UFO report, even where it was clear that it was
  going to be impossible to get there in time actually to see the reported UFO. Once an observer made a report, the fact
  of his having done so usually becomes known to friends and neighbors, local newspapermen, and local UFO enthusiasts.
  The witness becomes the center of attention and will usually have told his story over and over again to such
  listeners, before the field team can arrive. With each telling of the story it is apt to be varied and embellished a
  little. This need not be from dishonest motives. We all like to tell an interesting story. We would rather not bore
  our listeners if we can help it, so embellishment is sometimes added to maximize the interest value of the
  narration.</p>
<p>It is not easy to detect how a story has grown under retelling in this way. Listeners usually will have asked leading
  questions and the story will have developed in response to such suggestions, so that it soon becomes impossible for
  the field team to hear the witness's story as he told it the first time. In some cases when the witness had been
  interviewed in this way by local UFO enthusiasts, his story was larded with vivid language about visitors from outer
  space that was probably not there in the first telling.</p>
<p>Another kind of difficulty arises in interviewing multiple associated witnesses, that is, witnesses who were together
  at the time that all of them saw the UFO. Whenever several individuals go through an exciting experience together,
  they are apt to spend a good deal of time discussing it afterward among themselves, telling and retelling it to each
  other, unconsciously ironing out discrepancies between their various recollections, and gradually converging on a
  single uniform account of the experience. Dominant personalities will have contributed more to the final version than
  the less dominant. Thus the story told by a group of associated witnesses who have had ample opportunity to "compare
  notes" will be more uniform than the accounts these individuals would have given if interviewed separately before they
  had talked the matter over together.</p>
<p>One of the earliest of our field trips (December 1966) was made to Washington, D. C. to interview separately two air
  traffic control operators who had been involved in the great UFO flap there in the summer of 1952. Fourteen years
  later, these two men were still quite annoyed at the newspaper publicity they had received, because it had tended to
  ridicule their reports. Our conclusion from this trip was that these men were telling in 1966 stories that were
  thoroughly consistent with the main points of their stories as told in 1952. Possibly this was due to the fact that
  because of their strong emotional involvement they had recounted the incident to many persons at many times over the
  intervening years. Although it was true that the stories had not changed appreciably in 14 years, it was also true for
  this very reason that we acquired no new material by interviewing these men again. (See Section III, Chapter 5).</p>
<p>On the basis of this experience we decided that it was not profitable to devote much effort to re-interviewing
  persons who had already been interviewed rather thoroughly at a previous time. We do not say that nothing can be
  gained in this way, but merely that it did not seem to us that this would be a profitable way to spend our effort in
  this study.</p>
<p>In our experience those who report UFOs are often very articulate, but not necessarily reliable. One evening in 1967
  a most articulate gentleman told us with calm good manners all of the circumstances of a number of UFOs he had seen
  that had come from outer space, and in particular went into some detail about how his wife's grandfather had
  immigrated to America from the Andromeda nebula, a galaxy located 2,000,000 light years from the earth.</p>
<p>In a few cases study of old reports may give the investigator a clue to a possible interpretation that had not
  occurred to the original investigator. In such a case, a later interview of the witness may elicit new information
  that was not brought out in the earlier interview. But we found that such interviews need to be conducted with great
  care as it is easily possible that the "new" information may have been generated through the unconscious use of
  leading questions pointing toward the new interpretation, and so may not be reliable for that reason.</p>
