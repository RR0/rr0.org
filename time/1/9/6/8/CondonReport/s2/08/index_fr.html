  Généralement le 1<sup>er</sup> signalement d'un ovni est fait par un officier de la police locale ou par un
  journaliste de la <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/media/presse/index.html">presse</a> locale. Dans certains
  cas, des membres d'organisation d'étude des ovnis sont suffisamment bien connus dans la communité pour que des
  signalements leurs soient directement faits. En dépit de la publicité considérable qui fut accordée à ce sujet, une
  grande portion du public n'est toujours pas au courant de l'intérêt officiel de l'Air Force.</p>
<p>
  Even some policemen and newsmen do not know of it and so do not pass on the UFO report. In other cases, we found that
  the anti-Air Force publicity efforts of some UFO enthusiasts had persuaded observers, who would otherwise have done
  so, not to report to the Air Force. We have already commented on the fact that for a variety of reasons many persons
  who do have UFO experiences do not report promptly.

</p>
<p>
  Ideally the entire public would have known that each Air Force base must, according to <a
    href="../../s7/b/index.html">AFR 80-17</a>, have an UFO officer and would have reported promptly any extraordinary
  thing seen in the sky. Or, if this were too much to expect, then all police and news agencies would ideally have known
  of Air Force interest and would have passed information along to the nearest Air Force base. But none of these ideal
  things were true, and as a result our collection of UFO reports is extremely haphazard and incomplete.

</p>
<p>
  When a report is made to an Air Force base, it is handled by an UFO officer whose form of investigation and report is
  prescribed by APR 80-17 (<a href="../../s7/Annexe-A.html">annexe A</a>). If the explanation of the report is
  immediately obvious and trivial — some persons will telephone a base to report a contrail from a high-flying jet that
  is particularly bright in the light of the setting sun — the UFO officer tells the person


  what it was he saw, and there the matter ends. No permanent record of such calls is made. As a result there is no
  record of the total number of UFO reports made to AF bases. Only those that require more than cursory consideration
  are reported to Project Blue Book. Air Force officers are human, and therefore interpret their duty quite differently.
  Some went to great lengths not to submit a report. Others took special delight in reporting all of the "easy" ones out
  of a zealous loyalty to their service, because the more "identifieds" they turned in, the higher would be the over-all
  percentage of UFO reports explained. When in June 1967 Air Force UFO officers from the various bases convened in
  Boulder some of them quite vigorously debated the relative merits of these two different extreme views of their duty.
</p>
<p>
  Many people have from time to time tried to learn something significant about UFOs by studying statistically the
  distribution of UFO reports geographically, in time, and both factors together. In our opinion these efforts have
  proved to be quite fruitless. The difficulties are discussed in Section VI, Chapter 10.

</p>
<p>
  The geographical distribution of reports correlates roughly with population density of the non-urban population. Very
  few reports come from the densely-populated urban areas. Whether this is due to urban sophistication or to the
  scattering of city lights is not known, but it is more probably the latter.

</p>
<p>
  There apparently exists no single complete collection of UFO reports. The largest file is that maintained by Project
  Blue Book at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Other files are maintained by APRO in Tucson and <a
    href="/org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">NICAP</a> in Washington. The files of Project Blue Book are arranged by date
  and place of occurrence of the report, so that one must know these data in order to find a particular case. Proposals
  have been made from time to time for a computer-indexing of these reports by various categories but this has not been
  carried out. Two publications are available which partially supply this lack: one is <i>The UFO Evidence</i> (Ha11,
  1964) and the other is a collection of reports called <i>The Reference for Outstanding UFO Reports</i> (Olsen, ) .

  (<i><strong>NCAS editors note:</strong> No date provided for the Olsen document</i>).

</p>
<p>
  We have already mentioned the existence of flaps, that is, the tendency of reports to come in clusters at certain
  times in certain areas. No quantitative study of this is available, but we believe that the clustering tendency is
  partly due to changing amounts of attention devoted to the subject by the news media. Publicity for some reports
  stimulates more reports, both because people pay more attention to the sky at such a time, and because they are more
  likely to make a report of something which attracts their attention.

</p>
<p>
  In the summer of 1967 there was a large UFO flap in the neighborhood of Harrisburg, Pa. This may have been in part
  produced by the efforts of a local NICAP member working in close association with a reporter for the local afternoon
  newspaper who wrote an exciting UFO story for his paper almost daily. Curiously enough, the morning paper scarcely
  ever had an UFO story from which we conclude that one editor's news is anothers filler. We stationed one of our
  investigators there during August with results that are described dans le <a href="../../s4/c2/case27.htm">cas 27</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Many UFO reports were made by the public to Olmsted Air Force Base a few miles south of Harrisburg, but when this base
  was deactivated during the summer UFO reports had to be made to McGuire Air Force Base near Trenton, N. J. This
  required a toll call, and the frequency of receipt of UFO reports from the Harrisburg area dropped abruptly.

</p>
<p>
  For all of these various reasons, we feel that the fluctuations geographically and in time of UFO reports are so
  greatly influenced by sociological factors, that any variations due to changes in underlying physical phenomena are
  completely masked.

</p>
<p>
  In sensational UFO journalism the statement is often made that UFOs show a marked tendency to be seen more often near
  military installations. There is no statistically significant evidence that this is true. For sensational writers,
  this alleged but unproven concentration of UFO sightings is taken as evidence that extra-terrestrial visitors are
  reconnoitering our military defenses, preparatory to launching a military attack at some time in the future. Even if a
  slight effect of this kind were to be established by careful statistical studies, we feel that it could be easily
  accounted for by the fact that at every base men stand all night guard duty and so unusual things in the sky are more
  likely to be seen. Moreover civilians living near a military base are more likely to make a report to the base than
  those living at some distance from it.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="../../s7/b/index.html">AFR 80-17a</a> directed UFO officers at each base to send to the Colorado project a
  duplicate of each report sent to Project Blue Book. This enabled us to keep track of the quality of the investigations
  and to be informed about puzzling uninterpreted cases. Such reporting was useful in cases whose study extended over a
  long period, but the slowness of receipt of such reports made this arrangement not completely satisfactory as a source
  of reports on the basis of which to direct the activity of our own field teams. A few reports that seemed quite
  interesting to Air Force personnel caused them to notify us by teletype or telephone. Some of our field studies arose
  from reports received in this way.

</p>
<p>
  To supplement Air Force reporting, we set up our own Early Warning Network, a group of about 60 active volunteer field
  reporters, most of whom were connected with APRO or <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">NICAP</a>. They telephoned
  or telegraphed to us intelligence of UFO sightings in their own territory and conducted some preliminary investigation
  for us while our team was en route. Some of this cooperation was quite valuable. In the spring of 1968, Donald Keyhoe,
  director of <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">NICAP</a>, ordered discontinuation of this arrangement, but many
  <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">NICAP</a> field teams continued to cooperate.

</p>
<p>
  All of these sources provided many more quickly reported, fresh cases than our field teams could study in detail. In
  consequence we had to develop criteria for quickly selecting which of the cases reported to us would be handled with a
  field trip (voir <a href="../../s3/c1/index.html">section 3, chapitre 1</a>).</p>
