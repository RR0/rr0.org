<p>The idea that some UFOs may be spacecraft sent to Earth from another civilization, residing on another planet of the
  solar system, or on a planet associated with a more distant star than the Sun, is called the Extra-terrestrial
  Hypothesis (ETH). Some few persons profess to hold a stronger level of belief in the actuality of UFOs being visitors
  from outer space, controlled by intelligent beings, rather than merely of the possibility, not yet fully established
  as an observational fact. We shall call this level of belief ETA, for extraterrestrial actuality.</p>
<p>It is often difficult to be sure just what level of belief is held by various persons, because of the vagueness with
  which they state their ideas.</p>
<p>For example, addressing the American Society of Newspaper Editors in Washington on 22 April 1967, Dr. McDonald
  declared: "There is, in my present opinion, no sensible alternative to the utterly shocking hypothesis that the UFOs
  are extraterrestrial probes from somewhere else." Then in an Australian broadcast on 20 August 1967 McDonald said:
  "... you find yourself ending up with the seemingly absurd, seemingly improbable hypothesis that these things may come
  from somewhere else."</p>
<p>A number of other scientists have also expressed themselves as believers in ETH, if not ETA, but usually in more
  cautious terms.</p>
<p>The general idea of space travel by humans from Earth and visitors to Earth from other civilizations is an old one
  and has been the subject of many works of fiction. In the past 250 years the topic has been widely developed in
  science fiction. A fascinating account of the development of this literary form is given in Pilgrims through Space and
  Time -- Trends and Patterns in Scientific and Utopian Fiction (Bailey, 1947)</p>
<p>The first published suggestion that some UFOs are visitors from other civilizations is contained in an article in
  True, entitled "Flying Saucers are Real" by Donald E. Keyhoe (1950).</p>
<p>Direct, convincing and unequivocal evidence of the truth of ETA would be the greatest single scientific discovery in
  the history of mankind. Going beyond its interest for science, it would undoubtedly have consequences of surpassing
  significance for every phase of human life. Some persons who have written speculatively on this subject, profess to
  believe that the supposed extraterrestrial visitors come with beneficent motives, to help humanity clean up the
  terrible mess that it has made. Others say they believe that the visitors are hostile. Whether their coming would be
  favorable or unfavorable to mankind, it is almost certain that they would make great changes in the conditions of
  human existence.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of most reports of actual visitors from outer space that there is no corroborating witness to
  the alleged incident, so that the story must be accepted, if at all, solely on the basis of belief in the veracity of
  the one person who claims to have had the experience. In the cases which we studied, there was only one in which the
  observer claimed to have had contact with a visitor from outer space. On the basis of our experience with that one,
  and our own unwillingness to believe the literal truth of the Vilas-Boas incident, or the one from Truckee, Calif.
  reported by Prof. James Harder (see Section V, Chapter 2), we found that no direct evidence whatever of a convincing
  nature now exists for the claim that any UFOs represent spacecraft visiting Earth from another civilization.</p>
<p>Some persons are temperamentally ready, even eager, to accept ETA without clear observational evidence. One lady
  remarked, "It would be so wonderfully exciting if it were true!" It certainly would be exciting, but that does not
  make it true. When confronted with a proposition of such great import, responsible scientists adopt a cautiously
  critical attitude toward whatever evidence is adduced to support it. Persons without scientific training, often
  confuse this with basic Opposition to the idea, with a biased desire or hope, or even of willingness to distort the
  evidence in order to conclude that ETA is not true.</p>
<p>The scientists' caution in such a situation does not represent opposition to the idea. It represents a determination
  not to accept the proposition as true in the absence of evidence that clearly, unambiguously and with certainty
  establishes its truth or falsity.</p>
<p>Scientifically it is not necessary -- it is not even desirable -- to adopt a position about the truth or falsity of
  ETA in order to investigate the question. There is a widespread misconception that scientific inquiry represents some
  kind of debate in which the truth is adjudged to be on the side of the team that has scored the most points.
  Scientists investigate an undecided proposition by seeking to find ways to get decisive observational material.
  Sometimes the ways to get such data are difficult to conceive, difficult to carry out, and so indirect that the rest
  of the scientific world remains uncertain of the probative value of the results for a long time. Progress in science
  can be painfully slow -- at other times it can be sudden and dramatic. The question of ETA would be settled in a few
  minutes if a flying saucer were to land on the lawn of a hotel where a convention of the American Physical Society was
  in progress, and its occupants were to emerge and present a special paper to the assembled physicists, revealing where
  they came from, and the technology of how their craft operates. Searching questions from the audience would
  follow.</p>
<p>In saying that thus far no convincing evidence exists for the truth of ETA, no prediction is made about the future.
  If evidence appears soon after this report is published, that will not alter the truth of the statement that we do not
  now have such evidence. If new evidence appears later, this report can be appropriately revised in a second
  printing.</p>
