  Most UFO reports refer to things seen by an observer. Seeing is a complicated process. It involves the emission or
  scattering of light by the thing seen, the propagation of that light through the atmosphere to the eye of the
  observer, the formation of an image on the retina of the eye by the lens of the eye, the generation there of a
  stimulus in the optic nerve, and the perceptual process in the brain which enables the mind to make judgments about
  the nature of the thing seen.
</p>
<p>
  Under ordinary circumstances all of these steps are in fairly good working order with the result that our eyes give
  reasonably accurate information about the objects in their field of view. However, each step in the process is capable
  of malfunctioning, often in unsuspected ways. It is therefore essential to understand these physical and psychological
  processes in order to be able to interpret all things seen, including those reported as UFOs.
</p>
<p>
  The study of propagation of light through the atmosphere is included in atmospheric optics or meteorological optics.
  Although a great deal is known about the physical principles involved, in practice it is usually difficult to make
  specific statements about an UFO report because not enough has been observed and recorded about the condition of the
  atmosphere at the time and place named in the report.

</p>
<p>
  Application of the knowledge of atmospheric optics to the interpretation of UFO reports has been especially stressed
  by Menzel (1952); (Menzel and Boyd, 1963). A valuable treatise on atmospheric effects on seeing is Middleton's <i>Vision
  through the Atmosphere</i> (1952). A survey of the literature of atmospheric optics with emphasis on topics relevant
  to understanding UFO reports was prepared for the Colorado project by Dr. William Viezee of the <a
    href="/org/us/university/stanford/sri/index.html">Stanford Research Institute</a> (<a
    href="../../s6/c04/index.html">section 6, chapitre 4</a>).

  Coming to the observer himself, Menzel stressed in consulting visits to the Colorado project that more ought to be
  known about defects of vision of the observer. He urged careful interviews to determine the observers defects of
  vision, how well they are corrected, and whether spectacles were being worn at the time the UFO sighting was made.
  Besides the defects of vision that can be corrected by spectacles, inquiry ought to be made where relevant into the
  degree of color blindness of the observer, since this visual defect is more common than is generally appreciated.

  Problems connected with the psychology of perception were studied for the Colorado project by Prof. Michael Wertheimer
  of the Department of Psychology of the University of Colorado. He prepared an elementary presentation of the main
  points of interest for the use of the project staff (<a href="../../s6/c04/index.html">section 6, chapitre 1</a>).

  Perhaps the commonest difficulty is the lack of appreciation of size-distance relations in the description of an
  unknown object. When we see an airplane in the sky, especially if it is one of a particular model with which we are
  familiar, we know from prior experience approximately what its size really is. Then from its apparent size as we see
  it, we have some basis for estimating its distance. Conversely, when we know something about the distance of an
  unknown object, we can say something about its size. Although not usually expressed this way, what is really "seen" is
  the size of the image on the retina of the eye, which may be produced by a smaller object that is nearer or a larger
  object that is farther away. Despite this elementary fact, many people persist in saying that the full moon looks the
  same size as a quarter or as a washtub. The statement means nothing. Statements such as that an object looks to be of
  the same size as a coin <i>held at arm's length</i> do, however, convey some meaningful information.

  Another limitation of normal vision that is often not appreciated is the color blindness of the dark-adapted eye. The
  human eye really has two different mechanisms in the retina for the conversion of light energy into nerve stimulus.
  Photopic vision is the kind that applies in the daytime or at moderate levels of artificial illumination. It involves
  the cones of the retina, and is involved in color vision. Scotopic vision is the kind that comes into play at low
  levels of illumination. It involves the rods of the retina which are unable to distinguish colors, hence the saying
  that in the dark all cats are gray. The transition from photopic to scotopic vision normally takes place at about the
  level of illumination that corresponds to the light of the full moon high in the sky. When one goes from a brightly
  lighted area into a dark room he is blind at first but gradually dark adaptation occurs and a transition is made from
  photopic to scotopic vision. The ability to see, but without color discrimination, then returns. Nyctalopia is the
  name of a deficiency of vision whereby dark adaptation does not occur and is often connected with a Vitamin A dietary
  deficiency.

  If one stares directly at a bright light which is then turned off, an afterimage will be seen; that is, the image of
  the light, but less bright and usually out of focus, continues to be seen and gradually fades away. Positive
  afterimages are those in which the image looks bright like the original stimulus, but this may reverse to a negative
  afterimage which looks darker than the surrounding field of view. Afterimages have undoubtedly given rise to some UFO
  reports.

</p>
<p>
  The afterimage is the result of a temporary change in the retina and so remains at a fixed point on the retina. When
  one then moves his eyes to look in a different direction, the afterimage seems to move relative to the surroundings.
  If it is believed by the observer to be a real object it will seem to him to have moved at an enormous velocity. A
  light going out will seem to shrink and move away from the observer as it does so. If one light goes on while another
  is going off, it may appear as if the light that is going off is moving to the place where the other light is going
  on.
</p>
<p>
  Autokinesis is another property of the eye which needs to be understood by persons who are interested in looking for
  UFOs. A bright light in a field of view which has no reference objects in it, such as a single star in a part of the
  sky which has very few other stars in it, will appear to move when stared at, even though it is in reality stationary.
  This effect has given rise to UFO reports in which observers were looking at a bright star and believed that it was
  rapidly moving, usually in an erratic way.
