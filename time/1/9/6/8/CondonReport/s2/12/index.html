<p>The popular UFO literature abounds with photographs of alleged strange objects in the sky, many of which are clearly
  in the form of flying saucers. Some of these have been published in magazines of wide circulation. The editors of
  Look, in collaboration with the editors of United Press International and Cowles Communications, Inc. published a Look
  "Special" in 1967 that is entirely devoted to "Flying Saucers," which contains many examples of UFO pictures.</p>
<p>Photographic evidence has a particularly strong appeal to many people. The Colorado study therefore undertook to look
  into the available photographs with great care. Chapter 2 of Section III gives the story of most of this work and
  Chapter 3 of Section IV gives the detailed reports on individual cases.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between photographic prints and the negatives from which they are made. There are many
  ways in which an image can be added to a print, for example, by double-printing from two negatives. Negatives, on the
  other hand, are somewhat more difficult to alter without leaving evidence of the fact. We therefore decided wherever
  possible to concentrate our study of photographic case upon the negatives. This was not, of course, possible in every
  instance examined.</p>
<p>A barber whose shop is in Zanesville, Ohio, but whose home is in the suburb of Roseville, has made a widely
  publicized pair of UFO photographs. He did not attempt to exploit them in a big way. He merely exhibited them for
  local interest (and stimulation of his barbering business) in the window of his shop. There they remained for more
  than two months until they were discovered by a big city newspaperman from Columbus, Ohio, who arranged to sell them
  to the Associated Press. They were distributed in February 1967 and have been often printed in various magazines after
  their original presentation in many newspapers.</p>
<p>Early in the project we became acquainted with Everitt Merritt, photogrammetrist on the staff of the Autometrics
  Division of the Raytheon Company of Alexandria, Virginia. He undertook to do an analysis of the photographs. A pair of
  prints was supplied to Merritt by NICAP.</p>
<p>Each of the pair shows the home of the photographer, a small bungalow, with a flying saucer flying over it. The
  flying saucer looks like it might be almost as large as the house in its horizontal dimension. The photographer says
  that he was leaving home with a camera when he chanced to look back and see the saucer flying over his home. He says
  he quickly snapped what we call picture A. Thinking the UFO was about to disappear behind a tree, he ran to the left
  about 30 feet. and snapped picture B, having spoiled one exposure in between. He estimated that there was less than a
  two minute interval between the two pictures, with A followed by B.</p>
<p>Merritt studied the negatives themselves by quantitative photogrammetric methods, and also did some surveying in the
  front yard of the Roseville home, as a check on the calculations based on the photographs. From a study of the shadows
  appearing in the picture, he could show conclusively that actually picture B was taken earlier than picture A, and
  that the time interval between the two pictures was more than an hour, rather than being less than two minutes as
  claimed.</p>
<p>The photographic evidence contained in the negatives themselves is therefore in disagreement with the story told by
  the man who took the pictures. Two letters written to him by the Colorado project requesting his clarification of the
  discrepancy remain unanswered. </p>
<p>
  We made arrangements with Merritt for his services to be available for photogrammetric analysis of other cases. These
  methods require a pair of pictures showing substantially the same scene taken from two different camera locations.
  Unfortunately this condition is seldom met in UFO photographs. Only one other pair came to our attention which met
  this criterion. These were the much publicized pictures taken on 11 Mai 1950 near McMinnville, Ore. (<a
  href="../../s4/c3/46/case46.htm">cas 46</a>). But in this case the UFO images turned out to be too fuzzy to allow
  worthwhile photogrammetric analysis.</p>
<p>Other photographic studies were made for the Colorado project by Dr. William K. Hartmann, (Section III, Chapter
  2).</p>
<p>Hartmann made a detailed study of 35 photographic cases, (Section IV, Chapter 3) referring to the period 1966-68, and
  a selection of 18 older cases, some of which have been widely acclaimed in the UFO literature. This photographic study
  led to the identification of a number of widely publicized photographs as being ordinary objects, others as
  fabrications, and others as innocent misidentifications of things photographed under unusual conditions.</p>
<p>On p. 43 of the Look Special on "Flying Saucers" there is a picture of an allegedly "claw-shaped" marking on the dry
  sand of a beach. Some of the dark colored moist sand making up the "claw mark" was shipped to Wright-Patterson AFB and
  analyzed. The liquid was found to be urine. Some person or animal had performed an act of micturition there.</p>
<p>A report by Staff Sergeant Earl Schroeder which says <q>Being a native of this area and having spent a good share of
  my life hunting and fishing this area, I believe that the so-called 'monster' (if there was such) could very well have
  been a large black bear.</q> His report also notes that <q>during the week of July 26 the local TV stations showed a
  program called Lost in Space. In this program there were two monsters fitting their description controlled by a human
  being.</q></p>
<p>
  Summarizing, the investigation report says, <q>There was food missing from the picnic table which leads to the belief
  that some animal was responsible for the black shape portion of the total sighting. There are numerous bears and
  raccoons in the area.</q></p>
<p>
  Another photograph presented in the <i>Look</i> Special is of a pentagonal image, though called hexagonal.
  Photographic images of this kind arise from a malfunctioning of the iris of the camera and are quite commonplace. It
  is hard to understand how the editors of a national illustrated magazine could be unfamiliar with this kind of camera
  defect.</p>
