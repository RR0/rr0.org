<p>
  A wide variety of physical effects of UFOs have been claimed in the UFO literature. The most direct physical evidence,
  of course, would be the actual discovery of a flying saucer, with or without occupants, living or dead. None were
  found. Claims which we studied as direct evidence are those of the finding of pieces of material which allegedly came
  from outer space because it is a product of a different technology, so it is said, than any known on earth. Another
  kind of direct evidence studied were allegations that disturbance of vegetation on the ground, or of the soil was due
  to an UFO having landed at the place in question.

</p>
<p>
  The claimed indirect physical evidence of the presence of an UFO is of the nature of effects produced at a distance by
  the UFO. Accounts of sounds, or the lack of sounds, associated with UFOs, even though reports of visual observation
  indicated speeds of the UFO far in excess of the velocity of sound were common. Whenever a terrestrial solid object
  travels through the atmosphere faster than the speed of sound, a sonic boom is generated. The argument has been
  advanced that the absence of a sonic boom associated with UFOs moving faster than cutoff Mach (see Section VI, Chapter
  6) is an indication of their being a product of a technology more advanced than our own because we do not know how to
  avoid the generation of sonic booms. Another category of indirect physical effects are those associated with claims
  that UFOs possess strong magnetic fields, vastly stronger than those that would be produced by the strongest magnets
  that we know how to make.
</p>
<p>
  There are many UFO reports in which it is claimed that an automobile's ignition failed and the motor stopped, and in
  some cases that the headlights failed also, and that after this happened, an UFO was seen nearby. Usually such reports
  are discussed on the supposition that this is an indication that the UFO had been the source of strong magnetic field.

</p>
<p>
  Reports of both direct and indirect physical evidence were studied by various staff members of the Colorado project,
  principally by Dr. Roy Craig, whose account of these studies is contained dans les chapitres <a
  href="../../s3/c3/index_fr.html">3</a> et <a href="../../s3/c4/index.html">4</a> de la <a href="../../s3/index.html">section
  3</a>.

</p>
<p>
  These studies resulted mostly in lack of substantiation of the claims that have been made. Claims of terrestrial
  magnetic disturbances at various Antarctic bases were either unconfirmed or seemed to be closely related to a
  practical joke that was played on a base commander.

</p>
<p>
  During the period of field study of this project only one case of automobile engine malfunction came to our attention.
  There was some ground for skepticism about the report in that it was made by a diabetic patient who had been drinking
  and was returning home alone from a party at 3:00 a.m.

</p>
<p>
  Some laboratory tests showed that engine failure due to the action of an external magnetic field on the car's ignition
  coil would require fields in excess of 20,000 gauss, at the coil. Owing to the magnetic shielding action of the sheet
  steel in the car body, the strength of the field outside the car would have to be considerably greater than this. But
  magnetic fields of such intensity would alter the state of magnetization of the car itself.
</p>
<p>
  The process of forming car bodies by cold-forming the sheet steel introduces some quasi-permanent magnetization into
  all car bodies. Since all of the bodies of a given make in a given year are usually made with the same molds on the
  same presses they are all magnetized in the same pattern.

</p>
<p>
  In the case in question we found that the car body that had been subjected to the presence of the UFO was magnetized.
  The pattern of magnetization quite closely resembled that of a car of the same make and year that was found a thousand
  miles away in a used car lot in Boulder, Cob. From this we can infer that the car that was supposedly near the UFO,
  had not been subjected to a strong magnetic field, otherwise this would have permanently changed the state of
  magnetization of the body of the exposed car.

</p>
<p>
  In the area of direct physical evidence, probably the most interesting result of investigation was the analysis of a
  piece of metallic magnesium which was alleged to have come from an UFO that exploded over a stretch of tidal water at
  Ubatuba, Sao Paulo, Brazil in 1957. This was one of several pieces of magnesium from the same source that had been
  sent to the society editor of a Rio de Janeiro newspaper at the time.

</p>
<p>
  Later one of the pieces was subjected to elaborate chemical analyses in government laboratories in Brazil. The results
  of the analysis are given in great detail in the first of the Lorenzen books (1962), the full account occupying some
  forty pages. The claimed result of these studies was that the laboratory work showed the metallic magnesium to be
  purer than any ever made by man on Earth. Therefore it could not have been a product of earthly technology, therefore
  it came from an extraterrestrial source.

</p>
<p>
  <a href="/people/l/LorenzenCoralE/">Mrs. Lorenzen</a> kindly supplied one of the magnesium specimens to the Colorado
  project. We arranged to have it studied by the method of neutron activation analysis in a laboratory in Washington (D.
  C.). Le résultat, présenté en détails dans le <a href="../../s3/c3/index_fr.html">chapitre 3 de la section 3</a>, was
  that the magnesium metal was found to be much less pure that the regular commercial metal produced en <a
  href="../../../../../5/7/index.html">1957</a> by the Dow Chemical Company at Midland, Michigan. Therefore it need not
  have come from an extraterrestrial source, leaving us with no basis for rational belief that it did.
