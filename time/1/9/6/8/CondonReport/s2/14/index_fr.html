  The public became generally aware of radar at the end of World War II when the story of its important use in that war
  was told, after having been kept secret for some 12 years. A good non-technical account of this development is given
  in R. M. Page, <i>The Origin of Radar</i> (1962).

</p>
<p>
  Le mot <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar/index.html">radar</a> est un acronyme pour <i>RA</i>dio
  <i>D</i>etection <i>A</i>nd <i>R</i>anging. Basically, most radar systems operate in the following way. A transmitter
  sends out short pulses of electromagnetic energy at regular intervals. These are sent out through an antenna designed
  to radiate a narrow beam within a small angle of its main direction. This beam of pulses travels outward at the speed
  of light. If it encounters an obstacle, which may be a metallic object like an airplane, a rain storm, or a bird or a
  flock of birds, it is partially scattered in all directions from the obstacle. In particular a part of the beam is
  scattered back toward the transmitter. When it arrives back at the transmitter it is received and indicated or
  displayed in various ways, depending on the special purpose for which the system was designed. By the fact of there
  being a returned signal at all, the function of detection is accomplished. By the time delay involved between the
  transmission of the outgoing signal and the return of the back-scattered signal, the distance of the scattering object
  is inferred, thus accomplishing the function of ranging.

</p>
<p>
  To get a beam of sufficiently narrow distribution in angle as to enable inferring from what direction the scattered
  signal was returned, the antenna must have a diameter of the order of ten times the wavelength of the radio waves
  which it uses.
</p>
<p>
  In the period since <time>1945</time> the technology has had an enormous development so that nowadays there are
  elaborate networks of land and shipbased radar systems, as well as radar systems carried by most airplanes, which have
  become vitally necessary to the safe operation of civil and military aircraft. In addition to the use of radar in
  connection with navigation, it has become a valuable tool in meteorological work in that distant rain storms can be
  detected by radar. Also the trails of ionized air left by meteors can be detected and studied by radar, providing for
  the first time the means for observing meteors in the daytime.

</p>
<p>
  There are many popular misconceptions about radar. It is important at the outset to realize that the returned, radar
  signal does <i>not</i> give a a sharply focussed image or picture of the obstacle that has been detected. What one
  gets when it is displayed on a cathode-ray screen is simply a diffuse blob of light indicating that <i>something</i>
  is there, in the direction the antenna is pointed (with some exceptions) and at the distance indicated by the time
  delay between transmission and reception of the back-scattered pulse. Of course, a large airplane gives a more intense
  signal than a flock of small birds at the same range, and skilled operators learn to make valid inferences about the
  nature of the object detected from other things that they know about the general situation together with the magnitude
  of the returned signal.

</p>
<p>
  It is important also to recognize that the propagation of the outgoing and the back-scattered pulses is ordinarily
  assumed to be rectilinear and at the normal speed of light. But the actual propagation is affected by temperature and
  humidity difference in the air path along which the radio pulse travels. This can give rise to anomalous propagation
  that is analogous to but in detail not identical with the effects which give rise to mirages in the propagation of
  light through such an atmosphere. Usually the radar set operator does not know enough about the actual atmospheric
  conditions to make allowance for effects of this kind and, if they happen to be pronounced, can be led to make
  erroneous decisions. Another point is that, although the antenna sends out most of its energy in a single narrow beam,
  small amounts of energy go out in several other directions, known as sidelobes, so that a large or a nearby object in
  the direction of a sidelobe can give rise to a received signal that is indistinguishable from a small or distant
  object in the direction of the main beam.
</p>
<p>
  The overall radar system is a rather complicated set of electronic equipment which can malfunction in various ways
  giving rise to internally generated signals which the operator will tend to regard as reflections made by outside
  obstacles which are in reality not there.

</p>
<p>
  Usually the returned radar signals are displayed on the screen of a cathode ray tube and observed visually by the
  operator. On this account, subjective judgments of the operator enter into the final determination of what is seen,
  how it is interpreted and how it is reported. The data obtained from radar systems are thus not as completely
  objective as is often assumed. In some few instances subjectiveness is somewhat reduced by the fact that the cathode
  ray screen is photographed, but even when this is done there is a subjective element introduced at the stage where a
  human observer has to interpret the photograph of the radar screen.

</p>
<p>
  Radar operators do report unidentified targets from time to time and so there exists a category of UFO cases in which
  the unidentified flying object was seen on a radar screen. In a few cases there is a close correlation between an
  unknown thing in the sky seen visually and something also displayed on radar.

</p>
<p>
  However in view of the many difficulties associated with unambiguous interpretation of all blobs of light on a radar
  screen it does not follow directly and easily that the radar reports support or "prove" that UFOs exist as moving
  vehicles scattering the radio pulses as would a metallic object. Le projet du Colorado a engagé les services de l'<a
    href="/org/us/university/stanford/sri/index.html">Institut de Recherche de Stanford</a> pour réaliser une étude
  générale du fonctionnement des systèmes radar du point de vue de la relation de leurs indications aux ovnis. L'étude
  qui fut menée résultat en la production du <a href="../../s6/c05/index.html">chapitre 5 de la section 6</a>, par le
  Dr. Roy H. Blackmer, Jr. et son associé, R. J. Allen, R. T. S. Collis, C. Herold et R. I. Presnell. </p>
<p>
  Les études des signalements radar d'ovnis spécifiques et leur interprétation sont présentées dans le <a
    href="../../s3/c5/index_fr.html">chapitre 5 de la section 3</a> par <a href="/people/t/ThayerGordonD/index.html">Gordon
  Thayer</a>. <a href="/people/t/ThayerGordonD/index.html">Thayer</a> est un spécialiste de la propagation radio de
  l'équipe de l'Environmental Science Services Administration à Boulder. Dans ce chapitre, <a
    href="/people/t/ThayerGordonD/index.html">Thayer</a> présente une analyse détaillée de quelques 35 cas, certains
  étant visuels, d'autres radar, et certains les 2. Les phénomènes optiques et radar sont traités ensemble en raison de
  la similarité des problèmes de propagation d'onde impliqués.</p>
<p>
  Dans sa synthèse des résultats il indique : <q> ...il n'y a pas eu de cas où les données météorologiques disponibles
  tendaient à réfuter l'hypothèse de propagation anomale... </q>Cependant, <a href="/people/t/ThayerGordonD/index.html">Thayer</a>
  avance que des données météorologiques adéquates pour une interprétation approfondie manque souvent de sorte que
  beaucoup de données observationnelles de ce type seraient nécessaires pour pouvoir traiter une plus grande proportion
  de l'ensemble des cas radar d'ovnis signalés.</p>
<p>
  Au regard de l'importance du radar to the safe operation de tous appareils, il est essentiel que des recherches plus
  poussées soient menées pour acquérir une connaissance aussi précise que possible de la propagation anormale des
  signaux radar. Cependant, il est considéré que cela peut être mieux réalisé en s'attaquant directement au problème
  plutôt qu'au travers d'une investigation détaillée du domaine dans les cas d'ovnis.</p>
