<p>The popular UFO literature makes occasional reference. to UFOs seen by the U.S. astronauts in the space program
  operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. We do not know of similar reports by Soviet astronauts
  but they may well have seen similar things.</p>
<p>In flights conducted between 12 April 1961 and 15 November 1966, thirty U.S. and Russian astronauts spent a total of
  2,503 hours in orbit. The Colorado project was fortunate in that Dr. Franklin Roach, one of the principal
  investigators, has worked closely with the astronaut program in connection with their visual observations and so was
  already quite familiar with what they had seen and also was able to conduct further interviews with several of them on
  the basis of close personal acquaintances already established.</p>
<p>Roach presents a detailed account of what they saw as related to the UFO question in Section III, Chapter 6. Nothing
  was seen that could be construed as a "flying saucer" or manned vehicle from outer space. Some things were seen that
  were identified as debris from previous space experiments. Three sightings that are described in detail remain quite
  unidentified and are, Roach says, "a challenge to the analyst."</p>
<p>Roach emphasizes that the conditions for simple visual observation of objects near the satellite are not as good as
  might be naively supposed. As he describes them, "The conditions under which astronauts made their observations are
  similar to those which would be encountered by one or two persons in the front seat of a small car having no side or
  rear windows and a partially covered, very smudged windshield." Moreover, the astronauts were kept occupied with other
  observations and activities during their flight and so did not have extended periods of time in which to concentrate
  on visual observation of their surroundings. Most of the available visual observations therefore have to be regarded
  as a by product rather than a primary purpose of the program in which they were engaged.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that nothing definite relating to the ETH aspect of UFOs has been established as a result of these
  rather sporadic observations.</p>
