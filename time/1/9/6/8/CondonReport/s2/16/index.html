<p>Opinion polls are widely employed nowadays to measure public attitudes on various important and trivial issues. It is
  natural therefore to apply the same method to a determination of public attitudes toward various phases of the UFO
  question.</p>
<p>Studies of this sort are not studies of the UFOs themselves, but an attempt at determination of what the American
  public thinks about UFOs. Some UFOs either do or do not come from outer space, and the fact of the matter would not be
  determined by finding out what the opinion of the American people about it may be. Nevertheless we considered that
  public attitudes do play a role in policy formation in America, and therefore it was appropriate to carry on some work
  in this area.</p>
<p>In 1947, 1950 and 1966 brief surveys of public attitudes on UFOs or flying saucers were conducted by the American
  Institute of Public Opinion, popularly known as the Gallup poll. Arrangements were made by the Colorado project for a
  more detailed study to be made during the spring of 1968. This was done for us by the Opinion Research Corporation.
  Findings of the earlier studies and of the study made for us are presented in Chapter 7 of Section III.</p>
<p>The first two studies indicated respectively that 90% and 94% of the American adult public had heard of flying
  saucers. The first of these results, taken within months of the original June 1947 sightings at Mt. Rainier indicates
  the extraordinary interest which the subject aroused from the outset. The 1966 survey indicated that 96% of the adult
  public had heard of flying saucers.</p>
<p>
  In the 1966 poll people were asked, : <q>Have you, yourself, ever seen anything you thought was a 'flying saucer'?</q>
</p>
<p>The result was that 5% of the 96% who had heard of them answered yes to this question. The sample was designed to be
  representative of the American population, 21 years of age and older, of whom there are some 100 million. This is the
  basis of the oft-quoted statistic that five million Americans have said that they think they have seen a flying
  saucer.</p>
<p>In the same 1966 poll, 48% said they thought the things called flying saucers were "something real," and 31% said
  that they were "just peoples imagination." The question does not distinguish between various kinds of "real" things,
  such as weather balloons, aircraft, planets, mirages, etc., so the result by no means indicated that 48% believe they
  are visitors from outer space. That question was not included in the 1966 poll.</p>
<p>The 1966 poll asked whether the person interviewed thinks "there are people somewhat like ourselves living on other
  planets in the universe?" The question thus bears solely on ILE, not on whether such intelligences do in fact visit
  the Earth. Of the 1,575 interviewed 34% thought yes, 45% thought no, and 21% had no opinion.</p>
<p>
  There were no statistically significant regional differences between East, Midwest, South and West with regard to the
  proportion of the population which had heard of, had seen, or believed in the reality of flying saucers. However, as
  to belief in ILE, the existence of people on other planets, this belief was held by only 27 % of southerners, as
  compared with 36 % of easterners, 37 % of midwesterners and 36 % of westerners. The lower proportion of southerners
  who believe in ILE is statistically significant, that is, outside the range of chance variation due to finite size of
  sample. Although statistically significant, it is causally unexplained.

</p>
<p>
  Significant variation with age is shown in responses to belief in the reality of flying saucers, and to belief in
  intelligent life on other planets. About 50 % of persons under 60 believe in the reality of flying saucers as compared
  with about 33 % of persons over 60. On the other hand, a significantly smaller proportion of those under 50 believe in
  ILE, than do those over 50. On both of these points, the decline in the number of "believers" among older people is
  mostly due to the increase of those having "no opinion" rather than to an increase of the number of "non-believers."
  Here again the poll gives no basis for conclusions as to the reasons for these differences.</p>
<p>
  Quand à la dépendance au sexe, 22 % des hommes ou femmes n'ont pas d'opinion quant à la "réalité" des soucoupes
  volantes. Significantly more women than men believe in their reality:</p>

<p>
  The poll showed that increased amount of formal education is associated with an increased tendency to believe in the
  reality of flying saucers. Perhaps this result says something about how the school system trains students in critical
  thinking.

</p>
<p>
  An interesting correlation is found between tendency to believe in UFO reality, and to believe in ILE with having had
  a personal experience of having seen an UFO. The results are:</p>

  Comme précédemment, les relations causales ne sont pas explorées ; nous ne savons pas si voir c'est croire, ou si
  croire c'est voir.

<p>
  Dans l'étude de <a href="../../../index.html">1968</a> menée par le projet du Colorado par l'<em>Opinion Research
  Corporation</em>, 2050 adultes âgés de plus de 17 ans, vivant dans des households privées dans les Etats-Unis
  continentaux furent interrogés. In addition teenagers in the same household with an adult who was interviewed were
  also interviewed to give a sample of their views. Separate studies of opinions held by college students were
  conducted. These are reported in <a href="/time/1/9/6/8/CondonReport/s3/c7">section 3, chapitre 7</a>.</p>
<p>
  Dans l'étude de <a href="../../../index.html">1968</a>, 3 % des adultes répondirent affirmativement à <q>Avez-vous,
  vous-même, déjà vu un ovni ?</q> Ceci parallels les 5 % qui avaient répondu par l'affirmative dans le sondage Gallup
  de <a href="../../../../6/index.html">1966</a> à la question similaire : <q>Avez-vous déjà vu quoi que ce soit dont
  vous avez pensé qu'il s'agissait d'une "soucoupe volante" ?</q> On pourrait penser que le nombre plus petit en <a
  href="../../../index.html">1968</a> pouvait être expliqué par peut-être une moindre familiarité du public avec le
  terme OVNI qu'avec le terme de soucoupe volante. Ceci semble difficilement probable, cependant, in that the question
  was part of a total interview in which the meaning of the term UFO would have become clear from the general context of
  other questions in the interview. It seems to us therefore that this poll actually indicated a smaller percentage of
  sighters than the earlier one.
</p>
<p>
  An important finding is that 87 % of those who said that they had seen an UFO, also declared that they had reported it
  to no one, other than to family or friends, that is, to no one by which it would have received official attention.
  Thus only about one-eighth of sightings were reported anywhere, and not all of these were reported to the Air Force.
  Hence if all sightings were reported to the Air Force, this result indicates that the number of reports received would
  be more than eight times as many as are now being received. From the small fraction who did report to the Air Force,
  it seems a fair inference that most of these non-reporting sighters did not think that what they saw constituted a
  security hazard.

</p>
<p>
  In contrast, 56% of the non-sighters declared that they would report it to the police if they saw an UFO. We find this
  rather large discrepancy between the promised reporting behavior of the non-sighters and the actual reporting behavior
  of the sighters quite puzzling.</p>
