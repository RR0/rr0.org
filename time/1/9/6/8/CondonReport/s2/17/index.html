<p>Consideration was given to a variety of modes of conducting psychological and psychiatric research into the UFO
  phenomenon. The possibility that an "experimental UFO" might be launched and reports of its sighting studied was given
  serious consideration and rejected on three grounds: In view of the fact that this was a government-sponsored,
  university-based study, it was felt that experiments in which the public might regard itself as having been victimized
  by what amounted to a hoax were unwise. Such experiments also might give rise, we thought, to the erroneous notion
  that the study regarded UFO phenomena <i>solely</i> as the result of misinterpretation of natural or manmade
  phenomena. Finally, we were advised by some of our experts in the psychological disciplines, that a "mock-up" UFO
  would introduce unknown variables that would render inconclusive any results derived from the conduct of experiments
  with it (voir <a href="../../s6/c10/index.html">section 6, chapitre 10</a>).</p>
<p>Turning to the realm of psychiatry, we decided to refrain from mounting a major effort in this area on the ground
  that such a study could not be given priority over other investigations. This decision was buttressed by the evidence
  that we rapidly gathered, pointing to the fact that only, a very small proportion of sighters can be categorized as
  exhibiting psychopathology and that, therefore, there is no reason to consider them any more suitable for study than
  psychotic or psychoneurotic individuals who belong to any other statistical class of the population as a whole (voir
  <a href="../../s6/c03/index.html">section 6, chapitre 3</a>).</p>
