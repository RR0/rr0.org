<p>As remarked earlier, the short duration of most UFO sightings, the delays in reporting them and the delays caused by
  communication and travel, make it essentially impossible that investigators can bring physical observing equipment to
  a report site quickly enough to make UFO observations in that way. There is another way that is often proposed for
  getting better observational data than is now available; namely, to set up a permanently manned network of observing
  stations at various places in the country to observe such UFOs as might come within their range.</p>
<p>Such a network of stations might be set up solely for the purpose of UFO study, or it might be established in
  conjunction with one of the networks of stations which exist for other astronomical or meteorological purposes. This
  latter alternative, of course, would be much less expensive than the former, or could give a greater coverage for the
  same expenditure.</p>
<p>We gave considerable attention to the possibilities and difficulties in this direction (Section VI, Chapter 9). At
  first we hoped that some definite results could be obtained by such cooperation with existing stations in a way that
  would make results available for this report.</p>
<p>An all-sky camera was operated during most of August 1967 at Harrisburg, Penna. during an UFO flap in that locality
  (Case 25) but no interesting results were found on some 9,000 photographs. It would be quite expensive to operate a
  network of such cameras on a routine basis all over the United States. The likelihood or interesting images being
  recorded would be very small. Because of the short duration of an UFO appearance a proper plan for use of the all-sky
  camera would involve frequent processing and examination of the film, otherwise the presence of an UFO would not be
  recognized until long after it had disappeared. This would greatly increase the cost of operation of such a
  network.</p>
<p>Another suggestion that is often made is to make UFO studies in connection with the radar networks operating in this
  country for air traffic control under auspices of the Federal Aviation Agency. Consideration was given to this
  possibility and it was concluded that it is quite out of the question to burden this network with additional duties of
  any kind. The air traffic control operators are now heavily burdened with the work of safely guiding civil and
  military aviation. During the summer of 1968 especially, the heavy overloads that sometimes exist on the system were
  emphasized by troublesome traffic delays in the neighborhood of several of the nation's major airports. It would be
  quite out of the question to ask the air traffic controllers to assume the responsibility of watching for UFOs in
  addition to their primary responsibilities. It would likewise be impracticable for a separate group of personnel to be
  installed at these stations to watch the same radars for UFOs.</p>
<p>The Prairie Network is a group of camera stations operated in the mid-west by the Smithsonian Institution in
  connection with the Harvard Meteor Program. Its primary purpose is to detect and record meteor trails in such a way as
  to guide a search for actual meteoriitic bodies that strike the earths surface. The field headquarters of this net
  work is at Lincoln, Neb.</p>
<p>We prepared a listing of reported UFO sightings since 1965 that fell within the geographic limits of this network and
  through the kind cooperation of the Smithsonian Institution obtained the records of the network for the times and
  locations of these sightings. About half of the sightings were so lacking in specific information that, Frederick Ayer
  reports (p 1229) "even if an object had been recorded by the film it would have been impossible to correlate it with
  the sighting." About one-third of the sightings could not be traced on the film because of overcast skies. Some 18% of
  all the UFO sightings were identified on the network's records with a fair degree of probability. Nearly all of these
  were identified as astronomical objects. Some consideration was given to the costs and likelihood of success of
  adapting the Prairie Network instruments to UFO searches without interfering with their primary purpose. We think that
  something might be done along this line at reasonable expense, but we do not make a positive recommendation that such
  a program be undertaken because of the inconclusiveness of the information that we believe would be gathered.</p>
<p>Another existing program that was studied for unrecognized UFO records was that of scanning the night sky for study
  of air glow from the upper atmosphere, and of zodiacal light. Detailed study was made of two records obtained from a
  station on the Hawaiian Islands. One of these remains unidentified but is thought to be related to an artificial
  satellite for which no information is readily available. The other was definitely identified as a sub-orbital missile
  launched from Vandenberg AFB on the coast of southern California. Mr. Ayer concludes that "because of their relatively
  extensive sky coverage, scanning photometers can be considered useful instruments in the conduct of UFO searches."
  This, however, is not to be construed as a recommendation that a network of scanning photometer stations be
  established for this purpose.</p>
<p>Consideration was also given to the adaptability to UFO search purposes of radars of the type used by the Weather
  Bureau, and the radar station of the Radar Meteor Project of the Smithsonian Institution located near Havana, Ill.</p>
<p>Although frequent claims are made in the UFO popular literature of magnetic disturbances due to the presence of UFOs,
  a consideration of various official magnetometer records produced no evidence of an effect of this kind that, in our
  judgment would warrant the setting up of an observational program to look for UFOs by their alleged magnetic
  effects.</p>
