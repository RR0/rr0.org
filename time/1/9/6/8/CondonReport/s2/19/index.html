<p>In our study we gave consideration to every possibility that we could think of for getting objective scientific data
  about the kind of thing that is the subject of UFO reports. As the preceding summary shows, and as is fully documented
  in the detailed chapters which follow, all such efforts are beset with great difficulties. We place very little value
  for scientific purposes on the past accumulation of anecdotal records, most of which have been explained as arising
  from sightings of ordinary objects. Accordingly in Section I we have recommended against the mounting of a major
  effort for continuing UFO study for scientific reasons.</p>
<p>This conclusion is controversial. It will not be accepted without much dispute by the UFO amateurs, by the authors of
  popular UFO books and magazine articles, or even by a small number of academic scientists whose public statements
  indicate that they feel that this is a subject of great scientific promise.
</p>
<p>We trust that out of the clash of opinions among scientists a policy decision will emerge. Current policy must be
  based on current knowledge and estimates of the probability that further efforts are likely to produce further
  additions to that knowledge. Additions to knowledge in the future may alter policy judgments either in the direction
  of greater, or of less attention being paid to UFO phenomena than is being done at present.
</p>
<p>We hope that the critical analysis of the UFO situation among scientists and government officials that must precede
  the determination of official policy can be carried out on a strictly objective basis.</p>
<p>Attacks on the integrity of various individuals on either side of this controversy ought to be avoided. The question
  of an individual's integrity is wholly distinct from the issue of what science should do in the future about
  UFOs. </p>
<p>
  In the Congress of the United States concern about the UFO problem from a defense viewpoint is the province of the
  House Committee on Armed Services. Concern about it from the point of view of the nations scientific research program
  comes under the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Here there seems to be a valid situation of overlapping
  jurisdictions because the UFO problem can be approached from both viewpoints.
</p>
<p>A particular interest in the UFO problem has been shown by Congressman J. Edward Roush of Indiana, who is a member of
  the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. He performed a valuable service by arranging for the holding of a
  "Symposium on Unidentified Flying Objects" in Washington on 29 July 1968 (see references). As pointed out by one of
  the symposium participants, Prof. Carl Sagan of the department of astronomy of Cornell University, the presentations
  made in that symposium incline rather strongly to the side of belief that large-scale investigations of the UFO
  phenomenon ought to be supported in the expectation that they would be justified by what some speakers called
  "scientific paydirt."</p>
<p>We studied the transcript of this symposium with great care to see whether we would be led thereby to any new
  material related to this study. We did not find any new data.</p>
<p>Several of the contributors to that symposium have become trenchant advocates in the past several years of a
  continuing major government investment in an UFO program. Several have long urged a greater degree of congressional
  interest in this subject. The symposium of 29 July afforded them an occasion on which with the utmost seriousness they
  could put before the Congress and the public the best possible data and the most favorable arguments for larger
  government activity in this field.</p>
<p>Hence it is fair to assume that the statements presented in that symposium represent the maximum case that this group
  feels could be made. We welcome the fact that this symposium is available to the public and expect that its data and
  arguments will be compared with those in their report of this study by those whose duty it is to make responsible
  decisions in this area. </p>
<p>
  We have studied this symposium record with great care and find nothing in it which requires that we alter the
  conclusions and recommendations that we have presented in Section I, nor that we modify any presentation of the
  specific data contained in other sections of this report.
