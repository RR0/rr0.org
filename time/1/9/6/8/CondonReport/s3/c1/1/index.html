<p>Reports of UFO observations, elaborate in description as they sometimes are, are usually lacking information which
  would concretely define the nature of the object observed or the experience described. When specific information
  describing an unidentifiable object is presented, the reliability of that information must also be evaluated, and some
  corroboration or independent verification is necessary.</p>
<p>At its outset in November 1966, the information with which this project had to work consisted of old reports, some of
  which had been investigated quite thoroughly by official and private agencies, and press accounts of current
  sightings, in which the information was generally fragmentary. New information regarding sightings which had never
  been revealed to the public also occasionally came to our attention. In all cases, additional information, varying in
  nature for different cases, was desired. Field investigations were undertaken in an effort to obtain such
  information.</p>
