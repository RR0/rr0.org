  Résumé
</h2>
<p>
  L'équipage d'un appareil B-47 décrivit une rencontre avec une grande boule de lumière qui fut également visible
  pendant un temps soutenu à la fois par les récepteurs de surveillance <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a> embarqués et par les unités <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a> au sol. La rencontre eut lieu 10 ans avant cette étude. Le
  <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">projet Blue Book</a> n'a aucune archive le concernant. Des
  tentatives pour localiser toutes archives de l'événement, dans un effort pour connaître l'identité du phénomène
  rencontré, ont échoué à produire quelque information. Le phénomène reste non identifié.</p>
<h2> Contexte</h2>
<p>
  A une conférence soutenue par le projet pour les officiers ovnis des bases aériennes, tenue à Boulder en juin <a
    href="../../../../7/index.html">1967</a>, un des officiers révéla avoir personnellement vécu une rencontre d'ovni
  intriguante quelques 10 ans auparavant. D'après l'officier, un major au moment de la rencountre, il pilotait un B-47
  lors d'une mission d'entraînement de gunnery et contres-mesures électroniques depuis une base aérienne. La mission
  avait emmené l'équipage au-dessus du golfe du Mexique, et sur le chemin du retour au-dessus du centre sud des
  Etats-Unis où il rencontrèrent une source luisante de radiation électromagnétique à la fois visuelle et de 2800 mHz
  d'intensité stupéfiante qui, durant une partie de la rencontre, maintint une position constante par rapport au B-47
  sur une période étendue. Le radar de contrôle de vol au sol reçu également un retour de l'"object", et signala sa
  distance à l'équipage du B-47, à une position en accord avec les observations <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar">radar</a> et visuelles depuis l'appareil.

</p>
<p>
  According to the officer, upon return to the AFB electronic counter-measures, graphic data, and radar scope pictures
  which had been taken during the flight were removed from the plane by Intelligence personnel. He recalled that an
  Intelligence questionnaire regarding the experience had later been completed by the B-47 crew; however, the "security
  lid"

  shut off further information regarding the encounter. The crew learned nothing more regarding the incident, and the
  pilot occasionally had wondered about the identity of the phenomena encountered ever since his experience.

</p>
<h2> Enquête</h2>
<p>
  When no report of this incident was found in <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> or <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/adc/index.html">Air Defense Command</a> records, this project undertook to obtain leads to the
  location of data recorded during the event through detailed interview of all available members of the B-47 crew. Of
  the 6 crew members, the three most closely involved in the encounter were the pilot, co-pilot, and the officer who had
  been in charge of the most involved radar-monitoring unit.

</p>
<p>
  Details of the encounter, as best they could be recalled, were obtained by interview with the pilot and, later, with
  the 2 other officers at another air base. A11 remained deeply impressed by the experience, and were surprised that a
  report of it was not part of <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> files. Their descriptions
  of the experience were generally consistent, although the pilot did not mention that the navigator also had received a
  radar return from the object in question, as was recalled by the other officers. (The navigator, on duty in Vietnam,
  was not available for interview). The 2 other crew members, each of whom had operated a radar monitoring unit in the
  B-47 during the UFO event, were involved to a lesser extent in the incident, and were not located for interview.

</p>
<p>
  The crew's description of the experience follows:</p>

  Radar monitoring unit number two, in the back end of the B-47, picked up a strong signal, at a frequency of about 2800
  mHz., which moved up-scope while the plane was in straight flight. (A signal from a ground station necessarily moves
  down-scope under these conditions, because of forward motion of the airplane). This was noted, but not reported
  immediately to the rest of the crew. The officer operating this unit suspected equipment malfunction, and switched to
  a different monitoring frequency range. The pilot saw a white light ahead and warned the crew to be prepared for a
  sudden maneuver. Before any evasive action could be taken, the light crossed in front of the plane, moving to the
  right, at a velocity far higher than airplane speeds. The light was seen by pilot and co-pilot, and appeared to the
  pilot to be a glowing body as big as a barn. The light disappeared visually, but number two monitor was returned to
  the frequency at which the signal was noted a few moments earlier and again showed a target, now holding at the
  "two-o'clock" position. The pilot varied the plane's speed, but the radar source stayed at two o'clock. The pilot then
  requested and received permission to switch to ground interceptor control radar and check out the unidentified
  companion. Ground Control in the area informed the pilot that both his plane and the other target showed on their
  radar, the other target holding a range of ten miles from him.</p>
<p>
  After the UFO had held the two o'clock position and ten-mile range through various test changes in aircraft speed, the
  number two monitoring officer informed the pilot that the target was starting to move up-scope. It moved to a position
  dead ahead of the plane, holding a ten-mile range, and again became visible to the eye as a huge, steady, red glow.
  The pilot went to maximum speed. The target appeared to stop, and as the plane got close to it and flew over it, the
  target disappeared from visual observation, from monitor number two, and from ground radar. (The operator of monitor
  number two also recalled the B-47 navigator's having this target on his radar, and the target's disappearing from his
  radar scope at the same time). The pilot began to turn back. About half way around the turn, the target reappeared on
  both the monitor and ground radar scopes and visually at an estimated altitude of 15 000 ft. The pilot received
  permission from Ground Control to change altitude, and dove the plane at the target, which appeared stationary. As the
  plane approached to an estimated distance of five miles the target vanished again from both visual observation and
  radar. Limited fuel caused the pilot to abandon the chase at this point and head for his base. As the pilot leveled
  off at 20 000 ft. a target again appeared on number two monitor, this time behind the B-47. The officer operating the
  number two monitoring unit, however, believes that he may have been picking up the ground radar signal at this point.
  The signal faded out as the B-47 continued flight.

</p>
<p>
  The co-pilot and number two monitoring officer were most impressed by the sudden disappearance of the target and its
  reappearance at a new location. As they recalled the event, the target could be tracked part of the time on the radar
  monitoring screen, as described above, but, at least once, disappeared from the right side of the plane, appeared on
  their left, then suddenly on their right again, with no "trail" on the radar scope to indicate movement of the target
  between successive positions.

</p>
<p>
  The monitoring officer recalled that the navigator, who reported receiving his own transmitted radar signals reflected
  from the target, not only had a target on his screen, but reported target bearings which coincided exactly with the
  bearings to the source on the monitoring scope. He also indicated that the officer Operating the number one radar
  monitoring unit, which was of a different type, having a fixed APD-4 antenna instead of a spinning antenna as used
  with the number two unit, and covering all radar ranges, also observed the same display he observed on unit two. The
  sixth crew member, operating number three radar monitor, which covered a lower frequency range, was searching for
  something to tie in with the signals being observed on the other scopes, but found nothing.


</p>
<p>
  The following questions are raised by this information:

</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Could the number two monitoring unit have received either direct or reflected ground radar signals which had
      no relation to the visual sighting ?</strong> The fact that the frequency received on number two, about 2800 mHz.,
    was one of the frequencies emitted from ground radar stations (CPS6B type antennas) at an airport and other airports
    near by, makes one suspect this possibility. The number two monitoring officer felt that after the B-47 arrived over
    South Central U. S., signals from GCA sets were received, and this confused the question of whether an unidentified
    source which emitted or reflected this wave length was present. On original approach to the area, however, a direct
    ground signal could not have moved up-scope. Up-scope movement could not have been due to broken rotor leads or
    other equipment malfunction, for all other ground signals observed that night moved down-scope. A reflected signal
    would require a moving reflector in the region serving as apparent source, the movement being coordinated with the
    motion of the aircraft, particularly during periods when the UFO held constant position relative to the moving
    aircraft. Since the monitor scans 360°, if a reflected beam were displayed on the scope, the direct radar beam also
    would be displayed, unless the transmitter were below the horizon. As the event was recalled by the witnesses, only
    one signal was present during initial observations. If the UFO actually reflected radar signals transmitted from the
    B-47, and appeared in the same position on the navigator's scope as one, the number two monitoring scope, reflection
    of 2800 mHz. ground signals from these same positions seems extremely unlikely.</li>

    <strong>Les observations visuelles auraient-elle pu être des lumières d'avion, airplane afterburners ou <a

    persistance du phénomène exclut des <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/rentree/meteore">météores</a>. Les

    cohérentes avec l'hypothèse d'un <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/aeronef/avion">appareil</a>.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Were the visual observations necessarily of the same phenomenon as the radar observations ? </strong>Coincidence
    of disappearances, appearances, and indicated positions suggest a common cause.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>If the reported observations are factual and accurate, what capabilities and properties were possessed by
      the UFO ?</strong>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        Rapid motion, hovering, and instant relocation.

      <li>
        Emission of electromagnetic radiation in the visible region and possibly in the 2800 mHz. region.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reflection of radar waves of various frequencies. (From airborne radar units as well as 2800 mHz. ground units).
        Failure to transmit at the frequency of the number three radar monitor.</li>
      <li>
        Ability to hold a constant position relative to an aircraft.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Could the observed phenomenon be explained as a plasma ?</strong> Ten scientists who specialize in plasma
    research, at our October 1967 plasma conference regarded an explanation of this experience in terms of known
    properties of a plasma as not tenable.

  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Further investigation of this case centered around efforts to trace reports of this event submitted by the crew after
  the B-47 returned to the AFB. Recollections of the nature and manner of submission of such reports or records were in
  sharp divergence. As the pilot recalled the incident, the landing plane was met by their Wing Intelligence personnel,
  who took all filmed and wire-recorded data from the "back-end" crew. The crew was never extensively questioned about
  the incident. Days or weeks later, however, the crew did receive from Air Defense Command, a lengthy questionnaire
  which they completed including sketches of what they had seen and narrative descriptions of the event. The
  questionnaire also had a section to be completed by the ground radar (GCI) personnel. The pilot could not recall where
  or exactly when the completed questionnaire had been sent.

</p>
<p>
  In contrast with this recollection, the co-pilot and number two monitoring officer said that no data whatsoever had
  been recorded during the flight. The #1 monitoring unit was equipped for movie filming of its display, and #2 was
  equipped for wire recording of data. Since the flight had been merely for the purpose of checking equipment, however,
  neither film nor recording wire was taken aboard. Both these officers recalled intensive interrogation by their
  Intelligence personnel immediately after their return to the AFB. They did not recall writing anything about the event
  that day or later. According to their account, the B-47 crew left for England the following day, and heard nothing
  more of the incident.

</p>
<p>
  Since it appeared that the filmed and recorded data we were seeking had never existed, we renewed the effort to locate
  any special intelligence reports of the incident that might have failed to reach Project Blue Book. A report form of
  the type described by the pilot could not be identified or located. The Public Information Officer at ADC Headquarters
  checked intelligence files and operations records, but found no record of this incident. The Deputy Commander for
  Operations of the particular SAC Air Wing in which the B-47 crew served in 1957 informed us that a thorough review of
  the Wing history failed to disclose any reference to an UFO incident in Fall 1957.

</p>
<h2>
  Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
  If a report of this incident, written either by the B-47 crew or by Wing Intelligence personnel, was submitted in
  1957, it apparently is no longer in existence. Moving pictures of radar scope displays and other data said to have
  been recorded during the incident apparently never existed. Evaluation of the experience must, therefore, rest
  entirely on the recollection of crew members ten years after the event. These descriptions are not adequate to allow
  identification of the phenomenon encountered (cf. Section 3 Chapitre <a href="../../s3/c2/index.html">2</a> &amp; <a
