<p> Reports by the Mercury astronautes that they were able to observe very small objects on the ground aroused
  considerable interest in the general matter of the visual acuity of the astronautes. One of the criteria in the
  selection of the astronautes to begin with was that they have excellent eyesight, but it was not known whether their
  high level of visual acuity would be sustained during flight. Therefore, experiments were designed to test whether any
  significant change in acuité visuelle could be detected during extended flights. These experiments were carried out
  during Gemini 5 (8 j) et <a href="/org/us/nasa/projet/Gemini/Gemini7.html">Gemini 7</a> (14 j). </p>
<p> An in-flight vision tester was used one or more times per day, and the results were compared with preflight tests
  made with the same equipment. In addition, a test pattern was laid out on the ground near Laredo, Tex. for observation
  during flight. The reader is referred to the original report for the details of the carefully controlled experiments,
  which led to the following conclusions: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>Data from the inflight vision tester show that no change was detected in the visual performance of any of the
    four astronautes who composed the crews of Gemini 5 and Gemini 7. Results from observations of the ground site near
    Laredo, Tex., confirm that the visual performance of the astronautes during space flight was within the statistical
    range of their preflight visual performance and demonstrate that laboratory visual data can be combined with
    environmental optical data to predict correctly the limiting visual capability of astronautes to discriminate small
    objects on the surface of the earth in the daylight. </q></p>
</blockquote>
<p> In addition, the astronautes' vision was tested both before and after the flights and the test results were compared
  with preflight measurements. There were no significant differences in the level of their acuity, as shown in the
  following tabulation of test results: </p>

<p> It is clear that the men selected to participate in the space program of the U.S. have excellent eyesight and that
  the level of performance is sustained over long and tiring flights. </p>
<p> At the same time, a hindrance to top observing performance was that the astronautes were never thoroughly
  dark-adapted for any length of time. Good dark-adaptation is achieved some 30 mn after the eyes are initially
  subjected to darkness. A typical orbit period was 90 mn during which the astronautes were in full sunlight for 45 mn
  and in darkness for 45 mn. The astronautes therefore were fully dark adapted for only 15 mn out of every 90 mn orbit
  (assuming no cabin lights). </p>
