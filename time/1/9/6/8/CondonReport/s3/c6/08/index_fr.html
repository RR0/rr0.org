<p> Il y a 3 observations visuelles faites par des astronautes en orbite qui, du jugement de l'auteur, n'ont pas été
  expliquées de manière adéquate. Il s'agit de :</p>

  <li> Gemini 4, astronaute <span class="people" title="James MacDivitt">McDivitt</span>. Observation d'un objet
    cylindrique avec une protubérance. </li>
  <li>Gemini 4, astronaute <a href="/people/m/MacDivittJames/index.html">McDivitt</a>. Observation d'une lumière

</ol>
<h3> Gemini 4, objet cylindrique avec protubérance</h3>
<p> L'astronaute <a href="/people/m/MacDivittJames/index.html">McDivitt</a> décrivit voir à 03:00 (CST) le 1965-06-04 un
  objet cylindrique qui semblait avoir des bras en sortant, une description suggérant un vaisseau spatial avec une
  antenne. </p>
<p> J'ai eu une conversation avec l'astronaute <a href="/people/m/MacDivittJames/index.html">McDivitt</a> le 1967-10-03,
  au sujet de cette observation et reproduit ici ma synthèse de la conversation.</p>
<p><a href="/people/m/MacDivittJames/index.html">McDivitt</a> saw a cylindrical-shaped object with an antenna-like
  extension. The appearance was something like the second phase of a Titan (not necessarily implying that that is
  actually what be saw) It was not possible to estimate its distance but it did have angular extension, that is it did
  not appear as a "<q>point</q>." It gave a white or silvery appearance as seen against the day sky. The spacecraft was
  in free drifting flight somewhere over the Pacific Ocean. One still picture was taken plus some movie exposures on
  black and white film. The impression was not that the object was moving parallel with the spacecraft but rather that
  it was closing in and that it was nearby. The reaction of the astronaut was that it might be necessary to take action
  to avoid a collision. The object was lost to view when the sun shone on the window (which was rather dirty). He tried
  to get the object back into view by maneuvering so the sun was not on the window but was not able to pick it up again.
</p>
<p> When they landed , the film was sent from the carrier to land and was not seen again by <a
    href="/people/m/MacDivittJames/index.html">McDivitt</a> for four days. The <a
    href="/org/us/nasa/index.html">NASA</a> photo interpreter had released three or four pictures but <a
    href="/people/m/MacDivittJames/index.html">McDivitt</a> says that the pictures released were definitely not of the
  object he had seen. His personal inspection of the film later revealed what he bad seen although the quality of the
  image and of the blown-up point was such that the object was seen only "<q>hazily</q>" against the sky. But he feels
  that a positive identification had been made. </p>
<p> It is McDivitt's opinion that the object was probably some unmanned satellite. <a href="/org/NORAD.html">NORAD</a>
  made an investigation of possible satellites and came up with the suggestion that the object might have been Pegasus
  which was 1200 miles away at the time. McDivitt questions this identification. </p>
<p> The <a href="/org/NORAD.html">NORAD</a> computer facility's determination of the distances from GT-4 to other known
  objects in space at the time of the astronaut <a href="/people/m/MacDivittJames/index.html">McDivitt</a> sighting
  yielded the following tabulation. </p>

<p> A preliminary identification of the object as Pegasus B is suspect. When fully extended Pegasus B has a maximum
  dimension of 29.3 meters, which corresponds to 1/20 minute of arc at a distance of 2000 km. This is much too small an
  angular extension for the structure of the craft to be resolved and thus does not agree with the description of "<q>arms
    sticking out</q>." Later in the mission Pegasus B was at a much more favorable distance (497 km.) from the Gemini 4
  spacecraft or four times as close as during, the reported sighting. astronautes <a
      href="/people/m/MacDivittJames/index.html">McDivitt</a> and <a href="/people/w/WhiteEdward/index.html">White</a>
  reported that they were not successful in a serious attempt to visually identify the Pegasus B satellite during this
  encounter. </p>
<p> The ten objects in addition to Pegasus B in the <a href="/org/NORAD.html">NORAD</a> list were all at considerably
  greater distances away from GT-4 than an admittedly crude estimate of 10 miles (16 km.) made by <a
      href="/people/m/MacDivittJames/index.html">McDivitt</a>, and were of the same or smaller size than Pegasus B. They
  would not appear to be likely candidates for the object sighted by the astronaut. </p>
<h3> Gemini 4, moving bright light, higher than spacecraft</h3>
<p> At 50h 58m 03s of elapsed time of GT-4, astronaut McDivitt made the following report. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>Just saw a satellite, very high . . . spotted away just like a star on the ground when you see one go by, a
    long, long ways away. When I saw this satellite go by we were pointed just about directly overhead. It looked like
    it was going from left to right . . . back toward the west, so it must have been going from south to north. </q></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Although McDivitt referred to this sighting as a satellite, I have included it among the puzzlers because it was
  higher than the GT-4 and moving in a polar orbit. It was reported as looking like a "star" so we have no indication of
  an angular extension. </p>
<p> The suggestion at the time of sighting that this was a satellite has not been confirmed, so far as I know, by a
  definite identification of a known satellite. </p>
<p> Conversations with McDivitt indicate that, on one other occasion, off the coast of China, he saw a "light" that was
  moving with respect to the star background. No details could be made out by him. </p>
<h3> Gemini 7, "bogey"</h3>
<p> Des portions de la transcription (CT 7/6, bande 51, pages 4, 5, 6) de Gemini 7 sont reproduites ici. La conversation
  qui suit eut lieu entre le vaisseau spatial et le contrôle au sol à Houston et se réfèrent à une observation au début
  de la 2ᵉ révolution du vol :</p>
<p><strong>Vaisseau spatial </strong>: <q>Gemini 7 ici, Houston nous recevez-vous ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Capcom </strong>: <q>Fort et clair. 7, allez-y.</q></p>
<p><strong>Vaisseau spatial </strong>: <q>Bogey à 10 heures en haut.</q></p>
<p><strong>Capcom </strong>: <q>Ici Houston. Répétez 7.</q></p>
<p><strong>Vaisseau spatial </strong>: <q>Dit que nous avons un bogey à 10 heures en haut.</q></p>
<p><strong>Capcom </strong>: <q>Roger. Gemini 7, est-ce le booster ou est-ce une véritable observation ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Vaisseau spatial </strong>: <q>Nous avons plusieurs, looks like debris up here. Véritable observation.</q>
</p>
<p><strong>Capcom </strong>: <q>Vous avez plus d'informations ? Estimation de distance ou taille ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Vaisseau spatial </strong>: <q>Nous avons aussi le booster en vue.</q></p>
<p><strong>Capcom </strong>: <q>Compris que vous avez le booster en vue, Roger.</q></p>
<p><strong>Vaisseau spatial </strong>: <q>Ouais, nous avons a very, very many -- look like hundreds of little particles
  banked on the left out about 3 to 7 miles. </q></p>
<p><strong>Capcom </strong>: <q>Understand you have many small particles going by on the left. At what distance?</q></p>
<p><strong>Vaisseau spatial </strong>: <q>Oh about -- it looks like a path of the vehicle at 90 degrees.</q></p>
<p><strong>Capcom </strong>: <q>Roger, understand that they are about 3 to 4 miles away.</q></p>
<p><strong>Vaisseau spatial </strong>: <q>They are passed now they are in polar orbit.</q></p>
<p><strong>Capcom </strong>: <q>Roger, understand they were about 3 or 4 miles away.</q></p>
<p><strong>Vaisseau spatial </strong>: <q>That's what it appeared like. That's roger.</q></p>
<p><strong>Capcom </strong>: <q>Were these particles in addition to the booster and the bogey at 10 o'clock high?</q>
</p>
<p><strong>Vaisseau spatial </strong>: <q>Roger -- Spacecraft (Lovell) I have the booster on <i>my</i> side, it's a
  brilliant body in the sun, against a black background with trillions of particles on it.</q></p>
<p><strong>Capcom </strong>: <q>Roger. What direction is it from you?</q></p>
<p><strong>Vaisseau spatial </strong>: <q>It's about at my 2 o'clock position. (Lovell)</q></p>
<p><strong>Capcom </strong>: <q>Does that mean that it's ahead of you?</q></p>
<p><strong>Vaisseau spatial </strong>: <q>It's ahead of us at 2 o'clock, slowly tumbling.</q></p>
<p> The general reconstruction of the sighting based on the above conversation is that in addition to the booster
  travelling in an orbit similar to that of the spacecraft there was another bright object (bogey) together with many
  illuminated particles. It might be conjectured that the bogey and particles were fragments from the launching of
  Gemini 7, but this is impossible if they were travelling in a polar orbit as they appeared to the astronautes to be
  doing.</p>
