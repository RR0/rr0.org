<h2> Résumé</h2>
<p> 2 gardes en poste vers 22 h 30 signalèrent qu'un objet luisant en forme de soucoupe à une altitude 450 au Nord-Est
  descendit vers eux, puis recula. Le radar fut alerté, et signala une cible non identifiée à 95 miles directement au
  Nord, très près de l'horizon ; un chasseur fut incapable de le localiser. A strike team sent out to the site of the
  first observation reported unexplained white lights near the southeast horizon. These may have been aircraft, and the
  original object Capella. </p>
<h2> Enquête</h2>
<p> The investigators went to the AFB and talked with several persons involved in the reported UFO sightings. Their
  principal findings follow. </p>
<p> About 10:00 p.m. a guard walking his post at missile site Mike 6 reported a luminous shape at about 45� altitude in
  the northern sky. It exhibited limited lateral motion, but always came back to its original direction. It appeared
  about the width of a thumb, presumably at arm's length and continually changed color from green, to red, to blue in
  turn. It seemed dim relating to stars. When it was apparently nearest, it appeared like a luminous inverted dinner
  plate. </p>
<p> The guard was frightened and woke his partner, who was due to relieve him at 23 h 00. Both watched the object.
  Meanwhile, their captain sent out a strike team to Mike 6 and alerted the south base radar crew. </p>
<p> The latter reported about 23 h 30 that they had an unidentified target on search radar at 95 miles, azimuth 357 �. A
  little later, presumably the same target was picked up on the height finder radar at 95 mi., azimuth 360�, altitude
  2400 ft. Later it was reported at 4400 pieds and changing altitude "<q>every so often</q>;" it was observed from 2400
  à 8200 pieds altitude and varied a degree or two in azimuth, but the range of 95 mi. did not vary. The target remained
  continuously on the radar until the operator was relieved at 3 h 00. Except when a fighter was sent out, it was an
  isolated target; no other aircraft, ground clutter, or noise pips were seen within 20 miles of it. </p>
<p> The pilot of the fighter sent to intercept the radar target reported that, guided by the radar crew, he had flown
  over the target location at 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 et 5000 pieds. The radar verified that the plane passed through or
  very near the target, but the pilot saw nothing, nor did he detect anything on his radar or on his infrared
  detector. </p>
<p> By the time a strike team reached Mike 6, about 11:20 p.m. the original object was gone. However, they and several
  other men noticed one or more yellow-white lights very low on the southeastern horizon, in the direction of the
  airstrip at the base 50 miles distant. These moved irregularly over a range of about 35 à in azimuth. </p>
<p> At the request of the Colorado investigators, an officer sometime later went with one of the Mike 6 guards and the
  two members of the strike team to the Mike 6 site at night. There they pointed out as accurately as possible the
  locations of the objects they had seen. The guard, relying on a nearby fence as reference, indicated that the object
  he and his partner had first seen had ranged in azimuth from about 0� to 55� but had been at about 40� most of the
  time. It had been "<q>very high</q>." Soon after the strike team had arrived, he had been trying to watch the
  yellow-white light on the southeastern horizon, and when he looked again to the NE the original object was gone. </p>
<p> The leader of the strike team indicated that the original object had been pointed out to him by the guard at about
  20� azimuth; it was "unusually bright and very high." His partner did not see it.</p>
<p> The officer stated also that it was possible from Mike 6 to see the lights of aircraft in their landing approaches
  at the AFB; they would have been very near the horizon because of the local topography. One large airplane had landed
  at the base at midnight, and two others at 12:29 a.m. The officer thought it highly probable that the white light
  reported in that sector had been the landing lights of one or more of these aircraft.

<p>
  A situation of this kind is difficult to evaluate, because of the number of people and objects involved and vagueness
  or inconsistencies as to various details. As to the original object seen by the guards, the fact that it continually
  changed color and oscillated about a fixed position suggests a star. The sky was clear, and the bright star Capella
  was a few degrees above the north-northeast horizon. If the guards' estimate of 45� altitude was accurate, the object
  could not have been Capella; but a sleepy man on a lone guard post might quite possibly have a distorted impression,
  especially if he is not used to making such judgments. One officer commented that most guards did not report UFOs, but
  the guard who reported this one was new and had not seen one before. However, he was supported by the leader of the
  strike team, who remembered the object was "<q>very high</q>."

</p>

<p>
  Whatever the original object was, it appears unlikely that the unidentified radar target was the same object.
  Apparently the visual object disappeared at about the time the radar target was acquired. The latter was very near the
  horizon, and remained at a fixed range and very near 0� azimuth, a location and behavior entirely different from that
  reported for the visual object.

</p>

<p>
  The radar target was practically stationary except in altitude; it was very near the horizon; and no object was
  detectable by an aircraft pilot searching the target location. All of these factors suggest strongly that the target
  was generated by anomalous atmospheric propagation from a stationary object at a quite different location.</p>

<p>
  Thus, what was ostensibly a single sighting was probably three; and there is much in the situation to suggest that the
  later two--radar target and white lights--were commonplace phenomena that were endowed with significance by the
  excitement generated by the first report. The weight of evidence suggests that the original object was Capella,
  dancing and twinkling near the horizon; however, the evidence is not sufficient to justify any definite conclusion.
