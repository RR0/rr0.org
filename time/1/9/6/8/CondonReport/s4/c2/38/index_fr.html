  <h2>Résumé</h2>
  <p>Over 800 sightings of UFOs were claimed in the North East region. The sightings, most of which could be attributed
    to aircraft lights and stars, were largely stimulated by individuals engaged in UFO "research." No evidence was
    offered to support claims of close sighting of manned saucers, footprints, and saucer "nests."</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Contexte</h2>
  <p>
    Sightings of UFOs were reported almost every night at a small town, location B, seven miles SW of location A. The
    sightings were purportedly made by dozens of persons, some of whom allegedly had seen 50 or more UFOs, many of them
    in a single night. A total of over 800 sightings, was claimed in the vicinity by Mr. A, local resident and observer,
    and Mr. B, who claimed to be investigating on behalf of a civilian UFO research organization. Besides getting radio
    and newspaper publicity for the events, these individuals had arranged public meetings to discuss UFOs. At one such
    meeting, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, two Air Force representatives from a nearby airfield, and four news representatives
    were present, along with several dozen interested local people.</p>
  <p>Most sightings were of the moving-light-in-the-sky type. A notable exception was the report by two boys, aged 10
    and 12, that they observed at close range a "flying saucer" in which they saw two occupants. Another exception
    involved a report by a 55-year-old woman residing a few miles from location B. She stated that she had observed a
    large glowing light behind her house. The next morning, she found a "saucer nest" in the cattails where she had seen
    the light, according to her account. In another locality, Mr. A claimed to have taken a photograph of a strange
    footprint, as yet undeveloped.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Enquête</h2>
  <p>Project investigators interviewed 12 witnesses, and spent a part of each of three nights on a hill on the outskirts
    of location B, the locale of most of the reported sightings. Discussions with persons familiar with the situation
    brought out the following facts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The region has a high density of commercial airplane flights, at both high and low altitude.</li>
    <li>A charter air service operating out of the airport at location A has four planes equipped with the relatively
      new stroboscopic anti-collision light. On these planes, this light is mounted on top of the tail fin and can be
      seen in all directions other than directly below. The light emits 50-60 seven-second flashes/min at an intensity
      of 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> candlepower. Its use is under the control of the pilot. Mr. Allen Hayes, operator of the
      charter service said that his planes frequently fly around the area at night. Many private planes land at location
      A; a route of several commercial lines pass over this area also. Mr. Hayes felt certain that anti-collision lights
      on his and other planes were responsible for many of the local UFO reports.</li>
    <li>The sheriff's office advised that the Asplundh Tree Expert Company had perhaps been flying helicopters at night
      along the power lines for an electric and gas corporation checking for corona discharge along the lines and
      sparking from lines to vegetation. Since aerial observation of such an operation could conceivably result in UFO
      reports, the information was checked. It was found that although this company uses helicopters to spray defoliants
      along the power lines, the work is done during daylight hours, and had not been conducted within the past two
      months.</li>
    <li>Local state police were interested in the UFO reports. State Trooper Eisenberg had responded to a call from Mr.
      A, had found him and several youngsters with blankets over their

      heads, peering from under the blankets to look for UFOs. The trooper observed with them for a time, watched their
      excitement as they saw "another one," which he also observed. Trooper Eisenberg was certain he and the others were
      looking at an airplane.</li>
  </ol>
  <ol>
    <li value="5">
      Mr. John Levy, Assistant Manager of location A's Chamber of Commerce and occasional reporter for a newspaper in a
      nearby city, said he went out one evening to observe the UFOs with Mr. A, Mr. B, and the interested local
      youngsters. While he was there, the others saw three "UFOs", two of which he could identify as airplanes by the
      sound of their motors. Mr. A has insisted that were were noiseless and therefore not airplanes. (No noise whas
      heard when the plane lights were first sighted). The third "UFO" was silent, and looked to Mr. Levy like a
      satellite.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    During the investigators' observations, only airplanes and stars were seen. The first two nights were overcast with
    intermittent snow flurries. On the third night the sky was clear. A project investigator accompanied Mr. A, Mr. B,
    and one of their friends to the hill outside of location B for observation, while the other investigator remained at
    the hotel to receive incoming telephone calls.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the early evening, two calls were received which reported that an UFO was being observed at the time, still
    hanging in the sky. The UFO he now described was the bright star Sirius. After the suggestion that this might be the
    case, he phoned back to agree that he had been looking at Sirius. One caller was a high school teacher who had
    reported earlier a light-in-the-sky sighting that might have been an airplane.
  </p>
  <p>
    The sky observation party returned to location A later in the evening. The project investigator reported that when
    Sirius rose over the distant trees as he and the others were watching on the hill, his companions also immediately
    called Sirius one of the UFOs. They watched it change color, particularly when it was low in the sky. Only after
    some time did they agree that this "UFO" was a star.</p>
  <p>
    A few minutes later, a phone call reported another sighting. Mr. B spoke to the woman, and, after short
    conversation, excitedly handed the phone to a project investigator, declaring: "The woman is seeing an object which
    is spewing out green, white, and red beams . . . ." Additional comment indicated the object had emitted glowing red
    globs and was now hovering near the woman's home. The location described again was that of Sirius. The woman was
    told there that the star should appear relative to the constellation Orion, and was asked if it possibly could be
    this bright star she was observing. She did not accept this as a possibility, and relayed information to her
    daughter for checking, before going into a discussion of other UFO activity in the area. After this review, she was
    again asked about the hovering object she had originally reported. Her response was, "Yes, I guess we've been
    bamboozled again. I guess that it is just the star."
  </p>
  <p>
    Investigation of UFO reports that involved other than lights in the sky revealed the following:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The "strange foot print" which reportedly was photographed by Mr. A (photo still in camera) was described and
      sketched by him. The sketch was the size and shape of a bear track.</li>
    <li>
      A daylight search of the small swamp where the "saucer nest" in the form of a 30-ft. diameter area where "cattails
      and been squashed down and found to lie in a clock-wise spiral pattern" revealed no evidence of existence of such
      a "nest." This search took place several weeks after the event, and it could be argued that the "nest" had been
      disturbed in various ways to make it no longer obvious.
    </li></ol>

  <p>
    The woman who made this report is employed in local government service, and impressed interviewers as sincere and
    intelligent. According to her testimony, she told her sons (aged 16 and 22) the night of the observation, about
    seeing the glowing object behind the house during their absence. They were incredulous and she did not tell anyone
    about finding the "saucer nest" the next morning until some three weeks later, after the report was circulated that
    the boys had seen a saucer with occupants. The 16-year-old son of this woman said he had never gone out to look at
    the saucer nest, even after his mother reported its existence.

  </p>
  <p>
    With frequent prompting from Mr. B, the 10 and 12-year-old boys in location B told project investigators the story
    of their sighting. A tape recording of an earlier account by the boys was not entirely consistent with the new
    account and the taped accounts suggested that the mode of questioning itself was developing the story.

  </p>
  <p>
    According to the boys, they saw a large saucer-like object which hovered between a tavern-restaurant and an adjacent
    house across the street from the younger boy's home. The object tilted up, and they saw two occupants by a window on
    its near side. Instrument control panels with red and white lights were visible through the window. The object
    disappeared after about two minutes, moving upward before vanishing suddenly.

  </p>
  <p>
    There were no other observers. The reported event happened on the main street of this small town (location B) at
    about 9:30 p.m. Three dogs were said to have been howling strangely because of the object's presence. The
    12-year-old looked at his watch during this sighting to see what time it happened, according to his account.
    Discrepancies in the report, resemblance of the reported object and occupants with those pictured in a TV serial,
    and the prior association of the boys with Mr. A and the group of youngsters he influenced created serious doubts
    that the described event was real.

  </p>
  <p>
    After the visit of the project team, a reported discovery of four mysterious clearings on a densely wooded hillside
    near location A was presented in the magazine section of the local newspaper as tangible evidence that "saucers" had
    landed or hovered there. In circular or elliptical areas, from 100-150 ft. in diameter, the trees had all fallen.
    Some were uprooted, others broken off near ground level. Strange lights were reported to have been seen over the
    wooded area several months earlier.

  </p>
  <p>
    A copy of the magazine, showing photographs of the areas of forest damage, was sent for comment to Mr. C. A.
    Shields, Director, Division of Administrative Management, United States Forest Service. He sent our request to Dr.
    Carl E. Ostrom, Director, Timber Administrative Management Division, who offered several possible explanations as
    accounting for the circular patches of damage: 1) A tornado touching down briefly at several places in the forest;
    2) Islands of damage caused by heavy ice or snow. This kind of damage occurs to red and jack pine in the Northern
    Lake States; 3) Patch-like infestations of <i>Fomes annosus</i>, a root rotting organism that destroys supporting
    roots even though the trees remain green; and 4) Pine root-collar weevil, an insect that partially girdles the stem
    just below the ground line, giving rise to patches of timber collapse.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dr. Ostrom considered the most likely explanation to be 2) above, perhaps superimposed on stands already weakened by
    3) or 4). This area occasionally receives heavy ice and snow storms.
  </p>
  <p>
    The claimed connection between the areas of forest damage and UFO sightings was extremely nebulous. Since there are
    natural, ordinary explanations for such patches of damage, it seems most logical to attribute the damage to them.
  </p></section>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The lights-in-the-sky UFO reports apparently were caused by the suggestion and influence primarily of two
    individuals. Most, if not all, of these reports can be attributed to airplanes and stars.
  </p>
  <p>
    One housewife testified that she and her husband saw what appeared to be airplanes, except that they were soundless.
    Yet, she could not believe there could be that many airplanes in the sky around location B on a given evening. On
    the other hand, she was quite willing to believe there could be that many flying saucers from outer space around her
    city.
  </p>
  <p>
    This case stands out as an extreme example of the extent to which UFO excitement can be generated by one or more
    individuals in an ordinary community, where ordinary events are occurring.</p>
  <p>
    Those reported sightings involving more than lights-in-the-sky were made by people who also were members of or close
    to the group activity stimulated by Messrs. A and B. There appeared to be little convincing evidence that these
    sightings involved objects that were physically real.</p>
