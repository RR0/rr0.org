<h2>
Contexte</h2>
<p>
A private observer had reported by telephone that for several months
he had repeatedly seen in the west at evening a green light as large
as a two-story building. Sometimes it appeared round, sometimes
oblong. He reported that the object had been landing five to 20 miles
west of his house several times per week, in the period about 4:30 to
7:30 p.m. Observing through binoculars, he had seen two rows of
windows on a dome-shaped object that seemed to have jets firing from
the bottom and that lit up a very large surrounding area.

</p>
<h2>
Enquête</h2>
<p>
The investigator visited the site on a winter evening, 1967, arriving
at the observer's home about 6:30 p.m. The observer pointed out as
the object of his concern a bright planet 10-15 degrees above the
western horizon. Wadsworth suggested that the object appeared to be a
star or planet. (Both Venus and Saturn were visible about 1.3 degrees
apart, Venus being the brighter.) The observer agreed, saying that,
had he not seen it on other occasions when it appeared much nearer
and larger, he would have the same opinion. Also, he held to his
description of the surface features that he claimed to have seen
through the binoculars. His wife concurred with this statement,
supporting his allusion to windows. It was suggested that some
object other than a planet might have been involved, but no other
bright light was visible in that area of the sky.

</p>
<p>
The phenomena of scintillation and color change characteristic of
light sources low on the horizon were described to the observer, and
he seemed to accept the possibility that what he had seen was only a
planet

seen under conditions unusual in his experience. Thus what he had
observed, even with the binoculars, apparently had not been
sufficiently clear to be conclusive to him. The possibility of a
second object seems very unlikely, although at times he may have
observed stars or planets other than the one he noted at this time.
This possibility would account for the long period during which the
sightings had occurred.


</p>
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The reported "landings" apparently were the nightly settings of the
planet. The glow around the "landed" object probably was the bright
moonlit snowscape seen through the binoculars. The motion was
described as always the same, a very gradual descent to the western
horizon, where the object would "land" and shortly thereafter cut off
its lights. It is believed that the alleged size, brightness, and
surface features were largely imagined.

</p><p>
The observer seemed quite sincere and curious; however, his
description of the phenomena could not be considered scientifically
reliable. He demonstrated an inadequate grasp of basic scientific
information, and seemed unable to distinguish between objective
observations and subjective impressions.</p>
