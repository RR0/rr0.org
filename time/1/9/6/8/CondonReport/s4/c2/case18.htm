Résumé</h2>
<p>
Plusieurs signalements de lumières dans le ciel en déplacement lent et émettant des étincelles alors qu'ils disparaissaient furent attribués à des <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon/index.html">ballons</a> à air chaud préparés pour une expérience scientifique par des garçons du voisinage.</p>
<h2>Contexte</h2>
<p>
Une nuit du printemps <a href="../../../../7/index.html">1967</a>, 4 <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon/index.html">ballons</a> à air chaud furent lâchés par plusieurs étudiants de l'université. Ces <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon/index.html">ballons</a>déclenchèrent une petite <a href="../../../../../../../Vagues.html">vague</a> d'observations d'ovnis. Accounts of some of the sightings were reported in
local newspapers, and for several days the source of the objects was
unknown except to the students who launched them. Because of the
unexpected publicity, the students decided to come forth and give an
account of the event to this project.</p>
<p>
This report is intended primarily to examine the degree of
correspondence between the reports of the event and the event itself.
A description of the event based on an interview with the students is
presented, followed by report summaries of a number of the sightings.
It should be noted that the students were not attempting to make
careful observations when they launched the balloons. Their accounts
were somewhat general and lacking in details.


</p>
<h2>Description des événements signalés par les étudiants</h2>
<p>
Four balloons of the type recently publicized in various news media
and magazines were released. These balloons consisted of plastic
dry-cleaners' suit covers, sealed at the top and held open at the
bottom by crossed drinking straws attached to the edge of the
opening. Hot air was generated by a cluster of birthday candles

mounted along the straws where they crossed near the center of the
opening.

</p>
<p>
The first balloon was launched at 9:15 p.m. There was no ground wind,
and the sky was clear except for scattered patches of thin haze. This
balloon did not travel far from the launching site. It went up a
fairly short distance and then went out. The object appeared to the
students to be larger than a star. Duration of the event was
estimated at five to ten minutes.

</p><p>
By 10:00 o'clock, three more balloons were ready and were launched
one after another. They appeared to maintain three different
altitudes as they rose, and showed some flickering, growing dim and
then brightening up again. The balloons quickly became
unrecognizable as balloons and showed only as fire-colored lights.
The plastic envelopes were faintly visible as dim shapes. The lights
appeared the size of bright stars or larger.

</p>
<p>
Une des caractéristiques les plus évidentes de l'événement fut la formation triangulaire que les <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon/index.html">ballons</a> adoptèrent en gagnant de l'altitude. Ce
triangle perdura pendant plusieurs minutes ; puis des vents plus élevés commençèrent apparemment à emporter les <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon/index.html">ballons</a> dans des directions différentes. Le plus en bas dérivant loin des autres et disparut. La durée de l'événement dans son ensemble fut estimée entre 20 à 25 mn.</p>

Location: 0.25 mile WSW of launch site.

</p><p>
Description: gold or orange-yellow light, larger than a star but
smaller than a dime at arm's length, brighter than anything else in
the sky; through binoculars, observers could see an area of "stronger
density" adjacent to the light source. Direction and disappearance:
object first seen at an elevation of 45o in the east; began moving
north, receded toward the east and faded out.

Time: 9:15 p.m.

<p>
Observers: language professor and public school teacher.

</p><p>
Location: 0.4 mile ENE of launch site.

</p><p>
Description: orange-yellow object larger than a star, smaller than a
plane (which passed by at the time) but larger than the lights of the
plane.

</p><p>
Direction and disappearance: object stopped, light varied and seemed
to fizzle out, sparks dropped and light disappeared.

</p><p>
Duration: 10 minutes


</p><p></p></li><li>Time: 9:15 p.m.

<p>
Observers: two students

</p><p>
Location: Same as (2) above.

</p><p>
Description: gold-yellow object, little larger than a star, first
thought it was a satellite.

</p><p>
Direction and disappearance: object was first seen slightly south of
west and moving slowly eastward toward observers. Object came nearly
overhead, dimmed, brightened, emitted sparks and went out.

</p><p>
Duration: 5 minutes

</p><p></p></li><li>
Time: 10:00 p.m.

<p>
Observers: two women.

</p><p>
Location: 0.7 mile ENE of launch site.

</p><p>
Description: three lights in triangular formation; two on left were
yellowish, one on right was reddish. Objects were about the size of a
star when first seen, but grew larger as they moved toward the
observers. Other people in the parking lot seemed not to notice the
objects.

</p><p>
Direction and disappearance: Objects were first seen in southwest
at about 45 to 60o elevation. They then seemed to move north,
shifting from the triangle to a vertical line formation and rising.
Observers left while objects were still visible. The objects seemed
to have moved back to their original positions and become smaller.

</p><p>
Duration: 15 minutes

</p></li></ol>

<ol><li value="5">
Time: 10:05 p.m.

<p>
Observers: fine arts professor and wife.

</p><p>
Location: 0.7 mile SE of launch site.

</p><p>
Description: three red or pink lights in triangular formation at
45° elevation. Size and speed compared to Echo satellite.

</p><p>
Direction and disappearance: Objects first observed in northwest,
then began to move southeast and shift from triangle to straight line
formation. Movement continued till objects were approximately
overhead and seemed to stop. Then one went south and went out, one
north and went out, and one west and went out.

Location: 0.5 mile ESE of launch site.

</p><p>
Description: three lights like large stars in the form of a triangle.
One appeared red, the others orange.

</p><p>
Direction and disappearance: objects were overhead and somewhat to
the south when first seen. One moved to the southeast and disappeared
in haze. One stayed overhead, then flickered, moved west, and blinked
out. One arched away to the east and disappeared.

</p><p>
Duration: 5 minutes

</p><p></p></li><li>
Time: 10:00-10:30 p.m.

<p>
Observer: man.

</p><p>
Location: 0.4 mile SE of launch site.

</p><p>
Description: three yellow-orange lights in a rough line formation.
Appeared as dull glowing objects with haze around them. Observer
thought they were small and low.

</p><p>
Direction and disappearance: objects were seen first in the northwest
at an elevation of about 35o. Motion was southward, slow and
haphazard. The first one continued to move south. The second two
passed nearby overhead, seemed to move closer together, and drifted
away to the southwest.

</p><p>
Duration: 5-10 minutes

</p></li></ol>

<ol>
  <li value="8">
Time: 10:40 p.m.

<p>
Observer: astronomer.</p><p>
Location: 1.0 mile SW of launch site.

</p><p>
Description: One object visible low in the east, yellow-orange and
glowing continuously except several times when it dimmed. It was
about 2nd or 3rd stellar magnitude, and 10°-l5° above eastern
horizon. Through binoculars it remained visible only as a point of
light.

</p><p>
Direction and disappearance: Position when first viewed was about
10° north of east and l0-l5° above horizon. Motion was very
slow and difficult to determine, because of the lack of nearby
reference stars.

</p><p>
Duration: 3-5 minutes

</p><p></p></li><li>
Tine: 10-10:15 p.m.

<p>
Observer: man.</p><p>
Location: about 300 yards SE of launch site.

</p><p>
Description: two bright lights seen through the curtains of observers
apartment. From outside, they looked like blimps with fire at one
end, and were one-quarter to one-half the apparent size of full moon.
A third similar object appeared shortly after the first two.

</p><p>
Direction and disappearance: the first two appeared at 30-40°
elevation in the northwest and drifted to an overhead position, where
they separated and diminished with increasing altitude. The third
behaved similarly.

</p><p>
Duration: 10-20 minutes</p></li></ol>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
A comparison of the event as described by the launchers with the
reports of accidental witnesses reveals obvious similarities
regarding size, shape, color, and relative positions of the objects.
Taking into consideration the known inconsistencies inherent in most
eyewitness testimony, the degree of similarity between the reports
is noteworthy, especially since times of observations and locations
of observers were not the same. Certain dissimilarities should be

noted. For example, observer IX was located very near balloons. 
However, he was not able to identify the objects; nor did he
mention the triangular configuration reported by other witnesses,
probably because the objects seemed more scattered, suggesting
separateness rather than relatedness. It is interesting to note the
tendency of observers to give more detailed accounts of the event
than the launchers themselves gave.

</p><p>
The sightings all occurred within approximately one mile of the
launch site. With two exceptions, the balloons were first observed
in the direction of the launch site. The exceptions were sighting
number 6, in which case they are nearly overhead when first seen; and
number 8, when only one object remained visible. In three other
cases the balloons were reported as being overhead or nearly so at
some time during the observations. These three sightings (5, 7, and
9) along with number 6 are all located in the southeast quadrant of
the sighting area, indicating that the balloons drifted southeast. 
It should be pointed out that the balloons also were moving relative
to each other, and it was this motion that the students and most
witnesses referred to in their accounts. The limited area of
sightings is probably characteristic of cases involving these
balloons, and could be considered along with the slow aimless
drifting, the flickering, and the red-orange color as identifying
evidence in future cases.

</p><p>
In summary, we have a number of reports that are highly consistent
with one another, and those differences that do occur are no greater
than would be expected from situational and perceptual differences.</p>
<p>
Many small discrepancies could be pointed out, especially with regard
to estimates of distance and direction, but these are not great
enough to affect the overall impression of the event.

</p><p>
It would be expected that a survey of witnesses' speculations about
the nature of the objects would have shown much greater divergence,
but this report is confined to observational data.
