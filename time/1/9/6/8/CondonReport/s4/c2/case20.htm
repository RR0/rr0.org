<h2>
Résumé</h2>
<p>
Reports of "beeping" sounds emanating apparently from invisible
aerial sources were identified with the calls of small owls.

</p>
<h2>Contexte</h2>
<p>
Spring <a href="../../../../7/index.html">1967</a> this project received word that a state Department of
Civil Defense had been investigating an unidentified sound in an area
of the state. Wadsworth telephoned the same day to obtain more
complete information about the sound, and to determine whether it
might be connected with UFOs.

</p>
<p>
The investigation was being conducted by the warning officer and
communications coordinator for the state's Department of Civil
Defense, who gave further information. He described the sound as a
repetitious beeping signal of practically unvarying period and pitch
that had been heard regularly from the same location for a period of
several weeks, continuing for hours at a time without interruption.
The most puzzling aspect of the sound was the lack of any visible
source. Witnesses had approached the apparent location, only to find
that the sound seemed to come from directly overhead. This location
was at the top of a hill in a wooded area to which access was
difficult. However, local interest in the sound was so high that many
individuals had hiked into the area to hear it. Le son aurait commencé à 8 h 00 (PST) chaque nuit, et continué jusqu'à 3 h 00 ou  4 h 00.</p>
<p>
Other aspects that the Civil Defense official reported were: The
sound had been heard for about three weeks. It had been heard as far
as two miles away from its apparent source. A similar sound (believed
by some to be from the same source) had been received on a police
patrol car radio at 150 megacycles while the sound was 

being heard by persons in the above-mentioned area; visual UFO
sightings had been reported in the general area of the sound during
the same period. One sighting reported by two police officers and
several FAA men occurred two days before the reported onset of the
sound. A disc-shaped object was reportedly sighted passing overhead
beneath an overcast ceiling of 1,000 feet. The sound did not alter
perceptibly when people were in the area, even though they made
noise, shone lights, or fired guns. When local time shifted from
standard to daylight, the nightly time of onset also shifted an hour,
indicating that the sound was oriented to real time, not clock time.
The periodicity of the sound was approximately two beeps per second.
Sometimes the sound source seemed to move as much as a quarter of a
mile from its usual location in a few seconds, sometimes silently,
sometimes beeping as it moved. One explanation for the sound that had
been put forth was that it was the call of either a pygmy or a
saw-whet owl, both of which are found in that area and emit calls
similar to the reported sound.

</p>
<p>
A similar unidentified sound had been recorded elsewhere. Wadsworth
took a tape recording of the sound under investigation and the other
sound to an expert on bird calls. His opinion was that the latter was
probably a saw-whet owl. The former, however, seemed unlike any bird
or animal he had heard, although he could not be certain without
knowing what distortions had been introduced by the tape recordings.

</p><p>
A decision whether to send out a field team was suspended until more
could be learned about investigations already in progress. Any
connection between the reported sounds and UFOs was speculation, and
continued visual observations at the site of the sound had revealed
nothing significant.

</p><p>
During the following week, significant new developments were
reported. Sounds identical to that near the original location had
been heard in other locations in the state.

</p>
<p>
The Civil Defense informant reported unusual animal reactions in some cases. Frogs, which were numerous and loud in the area, had
all become silent 10-20 seconds before onset of the sound, suggesting
that they might be sensing some kind of energy other than the audible
sound. At other times, the cows and dogs in the area had suddenly
shown marked excitement, and then become suddenly quiet. In one
instance, this pattern had been repeated three times before the
beeping began.

</p>
<p>
On another occasion, a man whose house was at the bottom of the hill
where the sound seemed to originate had been frightened by the sound,
which he said came suddenly down from the hill and continued beeping
loudly just above his house. He was standing in the yard, and the
sound was so eerie that he could "take it" for only a few minutes
before going into the house.

</p><p>
The Civil Defense coordinator felt that he was at an impasse, and
urged that a team from this project be sent to investigate.


</p>
<h2>Enquête</h2>
<p>
Spring 1967, Craig and Wadsworth went with three primary objectives:

</p>
<ol>
<li>
to gather more information on the sound phenomenon and to experience
it directly;
</li>
<li>
to obtain instrumented measurements, if possible;
</li><li>
to check for possible correlative visual sightings in the areas
involved.

</li></ol>

<p>
When the team arrived, they met with the Civil Defense coordinator
and staff to plan the investigation. It was decided what area would
be the best location for a thorough surveillance of the sound, and a
base was set up in a barn about a mile below the hilltop where the
sound was usually heard.

</p><p>
Stereo tape equipment was set up in the barn, and microphones were
located about a quarter of a mile apart. The sound usually had been
clearly audible at this location.

</p>
<p>
It was learned that, although the beeps had been loud in all kinds of
weather, there was a considerably better chance of hearing them on a
clear night. It was also reported that on some occasions the sound
was very faint and of such short duration that no accurate location could be determined. It was not clear whether the occasions
of fainter sound were due to distance or to a real drop in volume.
</p>
<p>
Equipment taken to the more inaccessible field site included:
portable tape recorder; directional ultra-sonic translator; military
infrared sniper scope; directional microphone audio detector
("snooperscope"); cameras loaded with infrared, ultraviolet, and
conventional high-speed film; and two-way portable radios for
communication with the operating base at the barn.
</p><p>
Shortly before the advance group reached the top of the hill (an
hour's climb through steep, heavily forested terrain), the sound was
heard. It lasted not more than 10 seconds and seemed to come from a
direction different from its usual location. The team's subjective
impression was that it sounded like a bird.
</p><p>
Throughout the night, and until 5:00 a.m., the sound was heard
faintly eight or ten times for a few seconds each time. It did not
seem to originate from directly overhead at any time, and the
apparent direction and distance varied considerably. Part of this
series was recorded on tape, but the sound was of low amplitude and
brief duration. It was never heard at the main base below, so no
high-quality tape was obtained.

</p><p>
Descriptions of an earlier observation had related that the sound had
come from the top of a tall tree, then left the tree top and circled
around it when someone climbed the tree. Although no bird had been
seen in the darkness at the apparent source of the sound, and this
description was similar in this respect to the farmer's account of
the descent of the beeping source from the distant hill and its
circling over his farm yard, such behavior certainly seemed owl-like.
However, since the field team had heard only brief and distant
emissions of the sound, they could not positively identify it.

</p><p>
Early the next evening, this team drove to a second site. The weather
was rainy. Perhaps a dozen other cars were parked or cruising slowly
by the area. The team heard no beeping sound during two hours of
waiting.

</p>
<p>
The following morning, the team telephoned the county Sheriff's office, which had been handling the local investigation to
ask whether the sound had been heard during the previous night. They
were told that a bird had been shot by a farmer who lived adjacent to
the second location. He had told the sheriff that, when the sound
began the night before, he had gone out with a light and gun, shot
the bird while it was beeping, and brought it in as evidence.

</p>
<p>
The owl was identified as a saw-whet by a local biology teacher.
Despite this identification, some local persons expressed skepticism
that the dead owl had been the source of sounds that they believed to
be too constant in pitch and period to be generated by a bird. They
questioned whether the farmer, who had been subjected to much
harassment by the public, might not have produced the owl, hoping to
put an end to these difficulties.

</p><p>
Tape recordings of the sound, made both before and during the project
investigation, were later analyzed sonographically and compared
with sonograms of recorded calls known to have been made by pygmy,
saw-whet, and ferruginous owls. The original comparison was made with
calls recorded in Peterson's Field Guide to Western Bird Calls.
Later, other recordings of these calls were obtained from Cornell
University's Laboratory of Ornithology. The comparisons showed the
same sound structure, pitch, and period for the unidentified sound
and for the saw-whet owl. Fewer overtones were displayed on the
sonogram of the unidentified sound, but this difference probably was
due to lack of sufficient amplitude and recorder frequency range
limitations. It was concluded that the recorded unidentified sound
was made by a saw-whet owl.


</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
None of the reported visual sightings of UFOs in the vicinity was
impressive enough to warrant more intensive investigation. While the
project investigators could not be certain that owls accounted for
all of the unidentified sounds reported from various areas of the
state, they felt confident that the audible beeping was unrelated to
visual sightings of UFOs, and that owls certainly accounted for most
of the beeping sounds. The latter conclusion was based upon:

</p>
<ol>
<li>
The correspondence between sonograms of the unidentified sound and of
the beeping of a saw-whet owl;
</li>
<li>
Testimony that the dead saw-whet owl had been shot while
making the beeping sound;
</li><li>
The fact that the locations and movements of the reported apparent
sources were typical of those expected of owls.

</li></ol>

<p>
The small size of the saw-whet owl (about six inches long) may
account for the difficulty observers had in seeing it, thus allowing
them to conclude that the sound came from a point in space that was
not occupied by a physical object.</p>
