<h2> Résumé</h2>
<p>
Les opérateurs de 2 radars de l'aéroport signalèrent qu'une cible équivalente à un appareil avait suivi un vol commercial, l'avait rattrapé, et dépassé sur un côté, et procédé à environ 200 noeuds jusqu'à quitter le champ radar. Aucun objet correspondant n'était  visible de la tour de contrôle. Sur la base des rapports des témoins et des enregistrements météo, des explications basées sur une propagation atmosphérique anormale ou
réflexions anormales d'autres objets semblent inadéquates. Le  cas n'est pas expliqué de manière appropriée malgré des caractéristiques suggérant un effet de reflexion
(voir <a href="../../s3/c6/index.html">Section 3 Chapitre 6</a>).</p>
<h2>
Contexte</h2>
<p>
  Un contrôleur de traffic aérien (témoin A) à une installation de l'AF servant d'aéroport pour une ville voisine (lieu
  A), téléphona au Projet Colorado au milieu de Mai <a href="../../../../7/index.html">1967</a> pour signaler une
  anomalie radar inexpliquée. La rapport fut réferré au Dr. <a
    href="/people/m/MenzelDonaldHoward/index.html">Donald H. Menzel</a> pour commentaire, et le témoin A et 3 autres
  témoins furent interrogés à divers moments. L'information ainsi obtainue est résumée dans la section suivante.

<p>Le témoin A, un contrôleur de traffic aérien de 20 ans d'expérience,
signala les observations suivantes. Vers 16 h 40, lui et 3 autres hommes se trouvaient dans la salle IFR (radar) au terrain d'aviation. 2 radars
étaient utilisés : le radar de surveillance d'azimut (ASR), utilisé pour la détection en amont des appareils arrivants, et le radar d'approche de  précision (PAR),
utilisé pour suivre à la fois l'azimut et l'élévation d'un appareil  approchant la piste (fig. 2).</p>
<p>
Les contrôleurs suivaient l'approche d'un Boeing
720  commercial. Ils l'avaient sur l'azimut et chemin de descente corrects juste alosr qu'il passait le plafond des 3000 pieds à environ 4 miles du récepteur  radar. Un autre vol commercial, un Viscount, s'affichait sur le radar de surveillance à environ 6 miles derrière le 720. A peu près au moment où le 720 apparut dans le champ du radar de précision, opéré par le témoin A, il remarqua une cible très faible sur l'écran d'élévation (chemin de descente) à environ 2 miles derrière le 720. Il  ajusta la sensibilité de l'instrument, et la cible inconnue devint visible
également sur l'écran d'azimut. Elle semblait suivre le 720 sur le chemin de descente.

</p>
<p>
Lorsque le 720 avait avancé de 1 mile environ, le témoin A demandé à l'opérator
du radar de surveillance, le témoin B, s'il avait la cible non identifiée ; il l'avait. Le témoin A signala alors l'objet à l'équipage du Viscount, à environ 4 miles derrière. Ils ne voyaient rien, bien que la visibiltié sous la couche nuageuse, fut de 25-30 miles. Il signala alors l'objet à la tour de contrôle visuel ; mais aucun des 3 contrôleurs qui s'y trouvaient ne purent voir quoi que ce soit pour l'expliquer, même aux jumelles. A ce moment, l'homme de l'écran de départ (le radar de surveillance avait des écrans dupliqués pour suivre les arrivées et les départs) et l'homme de position de données d'arrivée se déplacèrent pour observer l'écran de précision. La cible s'affichait avec une clarté égale sur les écrans d'élévation et d'azimut.
L'objet non identifié rattrapait le 720, et se trouvait à 0,25
miles environ derrière lorsque le 720 passait le système de lumières d'approche. A ce point, l'objet pulled over, se partit vers l'Est, dépassa le Boeing sur son côté droit, et continua sur une course parallèle à une altitude de 200 pieds et à quelques 300 pieds de la piste, jusqu'à sortir du champ de l'écran de précision. Malheureusement, personne ne pensa à regarder si l'objet apparut sur l'écran de départ radar de surveillance. A la  disapparition, il est entre 1 et 1,5 mile de la tour de contrôle. Les  contrôleurs dans la tour ne virent jamais quoi que ce soit pouvant expliquer la cible.

</p>
<p>
Le Viscount arriva normalement sur le radar, sans rien qui le suivait.
Son équipage rapporta après atterrissage n'avoir rien vu entre eux et le 720 à aucun moment durant l'approche.

</p>
<p>
Le témoin A observa que le 720 n'avait pas été visible as far out as
6 miles, où le "bogie" apparut pour la 1ère fois. Il avait l'air d'une cible d'avion, bien que plus faible que d'habitude, et devint assez claire en venant plus près. Il commenta également que le bogie avait suivi la procédure correcte pour un appareil en dépassement, and that, si un pilote practique une approche aux instruments mais ne veut pas atterrir, sa procédure prescrite est de level off and cross the field at 200
ft., as the bogie appeared to do on the radar. In fact, the object
showed the flight characteristics of a Century series jet fighter
(F-100, F-104, etc.), making an approach at a speed of 200-250 knots.
However, such a jet makes a great deal of noise, and should have been
heard even in the glass-enclosed tower.

</p>
<p>
Witness A was interviewed in detail when he first telephoned the
project in Spring <a href="../../../../7/index.html">1967</a>, and questioned further on various aspects at
several later dates. Other witnesses unfortunately were not contacted
until Fall <a href="../../../index.html">1968</a>.

</p>
<p>
  Witness B, who had been monitoring the surveillance radar approach scope, was unable to recall details of the
  incident. He remembered only that it was <q>an odd thing</q> -- a radar target, but nothing visual.

</p>
<p>
Witness C was a controller of 15 years' experience, 11 on radar, who
had been in the radar room when the sighting occurred, and had
watched it on the precision scope. He recognized the difficulty in
remembering accurately after such a time interval, but felt that his
memory for the key details was good. He had been deeply impressed by
the incident, and had discussed it with Witness A and others on
various occasions.

</p>
  <p>
    He confirmed the account of Witness A in almost all respects. He was not certain that the bogie had come in on the
    ILS glide path which is indicated by a line on the elevation screen of the precision radar); it was following the
    Boeing and must have been on or near the glide path. Witness A had stated that the bogie overtook and passed the 720
    at about the approach end of the runway. Witness C, however, recalled that the bogie had overtaken the 720 and flown
    alongside <q>like a wingman</q> (i.e., slightly behind and to the

    right of the 720) for one or two miles before touchdown. Then, about a half mile from the runway, it had <q>pulled
    up</q> and flown on ahead. The 720's approach speed was about 140 knots. </p>
<p>
Witness C emphasized that the bogie target was indistinguishable from
an aircraft. He said that, if the bogie had appeared ahead of the
720, he would not have hesitated to warn the 720 off the approach.

</p><p>
He noted also that the surveillance radar was an old, faulty
instrument that sometimes missed targets that were known to be in the
field.

</p><p>
Witness D was a controller in the tower during the incident. He
remembered that the radar crew phoned about the bogie; the tower men
looked and saw the 720 coming in, but nothing else, even with
binoculars. The conditions were such that he was confident that no
such aircraft as the radars indicated could have come in without the
tower crew having seen it.

SITUATION
METEO GENERALE</q></p>
<p><q>
La situation météo générale prévalant à ... [la région générale]
was a condition of drizzle and fog with low ceilings at most all
stations east of ... [location H]. Amounts of precipitation were generally light
but the drizzle and fog continued for many hours at most stations.

</q></p>
  <p><q>
Shortly after noon colder air moved in from a northerly direction in
a layer from 1000 to 5000 feet above the surface. At ... [location
D] the drop in temperature measured between the noon and 6:00 P.M.
radiosondes was between 5o and 6o F. in this layer. This drop in
cloud layer temperatures was accompanied by increasing winds near the
surface. At 2:30 P.M. gustiness at ... [location Dl reached 30
knots. Similar increases in wind velocities began later at ...
[location A, location B, location E, and location J]. Some snow and
snow pellets fell at various stations as this mixture of colder air
took place.

</q></p><p><q>
MOST PROBABLE WEATHER AT 1640 MDT AT ... [THE] AIRFIELD

</q></p><p><q>
Two layers of scattered clouds, at 900 and 2400 feet respectively,
would have been moving rapidly from north to south in an air flow
having surface winds averaging nearly 30 mph. It occurred at 1630
MDT. Gustiness of 8-10 additional miles per hour was occurring at
this time. A layer of overcast cloudiness was estimated at 4000 feet
above the station. Visibility was greater than 15 miles.

</q></p><p><q>
A condition of very light drizzle had ended at 1530 MDT and light
snow pellets began at 1710 MDT. The differences in surface
temperatures was only lo (34 to 33) indicating that the greatest
amount of change was taking place in the air at cloud level.

</q></p><p><q>
The snow pellets which began at 1710 MDT and intermittent snow
showers continued past midnight. It is well known that water and ice
surfaces mixed together inside clouds tend to intensify radar echo
causing bright spots or bright lines to appear.

</q></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><q>
The snow pellets would have produced an increased intensity of the
radar echoes in some small shower areas. Although snow pellets were
not occurring at the station at 1640 MDT it is highly probable that
some were in the vicinity.

</q></p><p><q>
Total amounts of precipitation were light. Only .03 inch was measured
in the 24 hours ending at midnight.

</q></p><p><q>
At the same time that snow pellets and snow showers were observed at
... [the airfield, location B] reported no precipitation.

</q></p>
<p><q> RESUME
</q></p>
<p><q>
It is my opinion that fragmentary segments of two layers of scattered
clouds moving at variable speeds beneath a solid overcast would have
given a rapidly changing sky condition to any observer at or near the
airport. Reflection of any lights could have caused greater or lesser
brightness to the under surfaces of some of these scattered clouds.
The strong gusty winds were not only capable of moving the clouds
rapidly but could have carried some light substances, such as paper
to an elevation similar to the lower cloud height. The shafts of snow
pellets at a mile or more away from the base may have caused some
distortion of visibility in directions concentrated to the west and
northwest of the field.

<h2>
Hypothèses

</h2>
<p>
Anomalous targets on radar generally are caused by instrumental
defects, birds, anomalous atmospheric propagation (e.g. mirage
effects), out-of-phase echoes, or multiple reflections. Instrumental
defects appear to be eliminated in this case, since the bogie was
seen consistently on the surveillance radar and both the azimuth and
elevation beams of the precision radar.  The speed of the bogie, its
radar intensity, and the course it followed all appeared
inconsistent with a bird.</p>
<p>
Neither did this anomaly show any of the typical characteristics of
the "angels" caused by anomalous propagation; moreover, weather data
indicate no inversion was present. Both witnesses A and C had had
many years of experience with all the usual types of anomalies. The
fact that they were mystified by the phenomenon and considered it
worth reporting indicates that it was an uncommon effect.

</p><p>
Sometimes a distant, strong reflector may return a radar echo so long
delayed that it arrives after a second pulse has been emitted. It
will therefore appear at a spuriously short range. This possibility
appears to be precluded by the different pulse frequencies of the
surveillance and precision radars (1000 and 5500 per sec.,
respectively), and by the behavior of the bogie, which appeared to
relate it to the Boeing 720.

</p><p>
There remains the possibility of multiple reflections. After
reviewing a report of the incident, Menzel suggested that the bogie
had been produced by reflection of radar energy from the 720 to a
fairly efficient reflector on the ground, back to the 720, and thence
to the radar receiver. The superfluous echo would have appeared on
the line of sight from radar antenna to aircraft, and beyond the
aircraft the same distance as that from aircraft to reflector. Meuzel
suggested that a structure involving a cube-corner -- e.g., a steel
dump-truck body -- might act as a rather efficient reflector.

</p><p>
This hypothesis would explain some aspects of the observations. The
bogie appeared about two miles behind the 720 when it was about four
miles out, and gained on it at a rate roughly equal to the airplane's
own ground speed of about 120 knots, as would be expected. This would
imply that the reflector was about two miles ahead of the 720, which
would place it about half a mile south of the approach end of the
runway.  The bogie then should have overtaken the 720 at that
point.

</p>
  <p>
    Witness A said that it was about 0.25 mi. behind the 720 as the latter reached the approach light system; that would
    place the reflector approximately at the approach end of the runway. Witness C, however (a year and a half after the
    incident), stated that the bogie caught up with the 720 <q>one or two miles</q> before touchdown, flew alongside,
    and pulled ahead about a half mile from the runway. That would place the reflector about 0.5 to 1.5 mi. south of the
    runway, differing by as much as a mile from the location resulting from Witness A's account. </p>
<p>
So far, so good. Men who were a bit excited, or trying to remember
details after such an interval, might differ by a mile in their
estimates, particularly since the range scale on the precision radar
scope is logarithmic. Incidentally, half a mile from the runway the
elevation of the ILS glide path was about 200 ft. -- the elevation at
which the bogie appeared to overfly the field.

</p>
<p>
However, a target produced by such a delayed reflection would not
have appeared on the glide path. In elevation, the glide path was a
line rising at an angle of 2.7o from the ILS transmitter 7300 pieds
south of the precision radar antenna. The line of sight from the
radar to the Boeing four miles out thus intersected the glide path at
a substantial angle, so the bogie reflection, seen on the radar line
of sight, would have appeared about 0.25 in. below the line marking
the glide path on the radar scope. It does not seem likely that an
experienced controller would have failed to notice a discrepancy
amounting to some 200 ft. in elevation that if not corrected would
have been disastrous to an aircraft.

</p>
<p>
The shift of the unidentified object to the right as it overtook
the 720 can be partially explained. If it is assumed that the bogie
was a secondary echo from a reflector near the runway, then the bogie
would have been always the same distance behind the 720 as the
reflector in front of it, and would have appeared on the line of
sight from the precision radar antenna to the 720. Since the antenna
was about 400 ft. east of the runway, the bogie would have appeared
projected to the west of the approach track.  Its apparent course
would have been a gradual swerve to its right.

</p>
<p>
However, the bogie would have nearly coincided with the radar image
of the 720 as it passed low over the reflector; and immediately thereafter, as
  the 720 passed beyond the reflector, the bogie would have stopped its forward
  motion and moved laterally to the west. This
hypothetical behavior contrasts sharply with the statements of
witnesses A and C, both of whom insisted that the bogie moved over
and passed the 720 on the right (east), and that it continued on that
course, ahead of the airplane, until it left the radar field.</p>
<p>
The case is therefore not satisfactorily explained. In general, the
association of the unidentified target with the 720 and the lack of a
visible counterpart suggest strongly that it was a radar artifact.
Yet the details of its course can be reconciled with the reflector
hypothesis only by discounting the accuracy of reports by observers
who were intimately familiar with the context in which they were
working.</p>
