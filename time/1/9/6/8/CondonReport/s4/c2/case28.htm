<h2>
Résumé</h2>
<p>
Repeated sightings that began in late 1966 and recurred for many
months, arousing widespread interest, were identified as a jet
aircraft engaged in aerial refueling training practice.

</p>
<h2>
Contexte</h2>
<p>
During late <a href="../../../../6/index.html">1966</a>, mysterious lights began to appear over the central
part of an agricultural valley in the South Pacific. Local residents
soon began to report them as UFOs, and the resultant publicity led
eventually to investigation by NICAP and this project. These
sightings, instead of reaching a peak and tapering off, continued for
many months. By summer of 1967 interest was intense. Most of the
sightings were witnessed from a site near a foothills town located
at the eastern slope of the valley.

</p>
<p>
The key witness in the area was a resident (Witness I) of the town.
He and his wife had observed, logged, and photographed UFOs on
numerous occasions during the preceding months. He also coordinated
an UFO surveillance network using Citizens Band radio which covered
a radius of approximately 80 miles. As principal contact in the area,
he provided background information that included names of witnesses,
taped interviews, and photographic evidence. This material proved
invaluable in preliminary assessment of the situation.

</p>
<h3>Observations, information générale</h3>
<p>
The sightings fell into two groups: one (hereafter referred to as the
primary group) was highly homogeneous and comprised approximately 85 %
of the total number of sightings. Objects in the primary group
appeared as orange-white lights above the valley at night.</p>
<p>
These lights moved, hovered, disappeared and reappeared, and
sometimes merged with one another. This report deals with the primary group of sightings.

</p><p>
Sightings from the smaller group will be reported separately, as they
form a heterogeneous assortment that is clearly discontinuous with
the primary group.

</p>
<h3>Photographies</h3>
<p>
The high frequency of primary-group sightings provided Witness I with
numerous opportunities to take pictures with a tripod-mounted
Rolleiflex camera. The resulting photographs, while providing no
answers to what the objects were, did constitute firmer evidence than
the unsupported testimony of witnesses.

</p>
<h3>Caractéristiques de la zone</h3>
<ol type="a"><li>
The ranch home of Witness I was located in the foothills east of
the valley and 1800 ft. above the valley floor.

<p></p></li><li>
The view from the ranch was unobstructed from southeast to
southwest. Foothills in the foreground obscured in the distant
horizon from northwest to northeast.

<p></p></li><li>
Most observations from the home of Witness I were from the rear
patio, which faced south with a full view of the unobstructed horizon
as well as parts of the foreground foothills to the east and west. In
most instances he, alone, made the observations.

<p></p></li><li>
Most sightings were to the southwest over the valley floor.

<p></p></li><li>
Area residents habitually sat outside at night during the summer
because of the heat. This practice contributed to the frequency of
sightings.

<p></p></li><li>
The recurrence of sightings excited the people in the area,
thereby causing an increase in reports of low reliability.

</li></ol>

<h2>
Enquête</h2>
<p>
After detailed discussions with local NICAP people, including Witness
I and his wife, project investigators decided to try to observe the
UFOs themselves. On the night of 12 August they saw nothing unusual.
On 13 August, however, the following events occurred:

</p>
<p>
At 10:30 p.m. a light appeared low in the southern sky, travelling approximately 10°/sec. After about 10 sec., more detail became
visible and the object was identified as probably an aircraft with
conventional running lights and an anti-collision beacon.

</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, another light had appeared to the east of the presumed
aircraft, travelling west at a similar angular rate. This light was
not obviously an aircraft, but appeared as a dull orange light that
varied somewhat in intensity as it moved. The object could have been
an aircraft. Witness I, however, said that it was exactly the kind
of thing that had been reported frequently as an UFO. He was
disappointed that it had not been as near and bright as he had
observed on other occasions.

</p><p>
After about 15 sec., the UFO, which had been travelling horizontally
westward, seemed to flicker and then vanished. The original object
continued eastward, disappearing in the distance in a manner
consistent with its identification as an aircraft. Duration of both
observations was less than a minute.

</p>
<p>
  On 14 August Wadsworth and Witness I drove to a village 20 miles south of the sighting area, where several sightings
  had been reported, and west and northwest toward towns A, B, and C. This area, had been most frequently indicated by
  observers as the apparent location of the UFOs. However, interviews with area residents disclosed no significant
  information.

</p>
<p>
  Another sky watch that evening by Wadsworth, Witness I and his wife (<a
    href="/people/r/RoachFranklinE/">Roach</a> had gone) yielded nothing unusual until midnight. At 12:00 a.m. and again
  at 12:42 a.m. on 15 August UFOs were observed. They hovered, moved horizontally, and vanished. They appeared as bright
  orange lights showing no extended size and varying in intensity. Wadsworth thought they might be low-flying aircraft
  on flight paths that produced illusory hovering, but they could not be identified as such. Witness I described the
  lights as "good solid sightings," typical of the recurrent UFO sightings in the area. One of the sightings was later
  confirmed in all essentials by two women, who lived nearby.

</p>
<p>
The Monday night sighting was reported by telephone to the base
UFO officer at a nearby Air Force base. He stated that no aircraft
from that base had been in the air at the time of the sighting.</p>

<p>
Project investigators then instituted a surveillance plan for the
night of 15-16 August. About 9:00 p.m., Wadsworth drove to a fire
lookout tower atop a mountain near the sighting area. This lookout,
the highest in the area, afforded an optimum view over the entire
valley. He carried a transceiver to communicate with Witness I in the
town of sighting for coordination of sighting observations, and was
accompanied by a local NICAP member. Also present were the resident
fire lookouts at the station.

</p><p>
At midnight orange lights appeared successively over the valley in
the direction of towns A, B and C (see map, figure 3). These lights,
observed simultaneously by Wadsworth and Witness I, appeared to
brighten, dim, go out completely, reappear, hover, and move about.
Sometimes two of them would move together for a few moments and then
separate. This behavior continued for an hour-and-a-half.

</p><p>
The mountain vantage point afforded a much more comprehensive view of
the phenomena than did the valley town site. It was possible to
observe a general pattern of movement that could not have been seen
from below, because the north end of this pattern was over Town C,
which was not visible from the sighting town. Even with binoculars
Wadsworth had to study the pattern for more than an hour before he
could begin to understand what was happening.

</p><p>
Essentially, the lights made long, low runs from Town C toward Town
B, which was not visible from the sighting town. Even with binoculars
Wadsworth had to study the pattern for more than an hour before he
could begin to understand what was happening. At other times they
appeared to hover, flare up, then go out completely. Witness I
believed that the lights flared up in response to signals he flashed
at them with a spotlight. Many of his flashes were followed by
flare-ups of the UFOs, but to Wadsworth these flare-ups appeared
coincidental.

</p>
<p>
Observations lasting about two hours convinced Wadsworth that the
lights were aboard aircraft operating out of an Air Force base in
Town C. He was finally able to see the lights move along what was
apparently a runway, then lift off, circle southward, and go through
the behavior previously described before returning to land at Castle.
It should be pointed out that none of this pattern was obvious, even
to the NICAP man some thirty miles away, and visibility was limited
by haze. In checking further with the base, it was learned that most
of the aerial activity there involved tankers and B-52s in practice
refuelling operations. Between 400 and 500 sorties were launched each
month, day and night. These planes carried large spotlights that were
switched on and off repeatedly during training. This feature explains
the flare-ups and the disappear-reappear phenomena, that had been
observed from the town. The apparent hovering is accounted for by the
fact that part of the flight pattern was on a heading towards the
observer. The closing behavior followed by separation was the
refuelling contact. Maps supplied by the AFB showed flight patterns
consistent with these sightings as to the objects' locations,
motions, and disappearance-reappearance-flare-up behavior. (See fig.
3, p. 514) Since these objects were essentially identical to those
seen the previous night, it was assumed that the UFO officer had been
in error when he stated that no aircraft activity had originated at
the Air Force base.

</p>
<h2>
Résumé et conclusion

</h2>
<p>
The sightings were of interest for two reasons. First, the phenomena
were strange enough to defy simple explanation. Second, they were on
a large enough scale to arouse widespread interest. Sighting
frequency was high and did not decline with time.

</p><p>
However, the sightings were not individually spectacular, being
essentially lights in the night sky. This case is an example of
conventional stimuli (aircraft) that, by their unusual behavior,
lighting, and flight paths, presented an unconventional appearance to
witnesses.

</p>
<p>
Before the project investigation, observers had become loosely
organized around Witness I, who logged sightings, taped interviews with witnesses, and obtained photographs of the objects. He also
called on Los Angeles NICAP for further assistance. But one thing
that apparently no observer did was to drive across the valley to the
Air Force base while sightings were occurring. There may have been
two reasons for this omission. First, Witness I had phoned the base
on several occasions to report sightings, and had been erroneously
but authoritatively informed that the sightings could not be
accounted for by planes based locally. Second, few observers were
seeking a conventional explanation that would dispel the intriguing
presence of UFOs. Even when the sightings were identified by
Wadsworth, Witness I was loath to accept the aircraft explanation.
Thus a solution was not forthcoming from the local situation, which
had reached a kind of equilibrium.

</p>
<p>
After examining the previously compiled information, project
investigators decided a more direct approach was needed. The methods
of inquiry and observations that they used resulted in the discovery
of a pattern of behavior readily identified with aircraft activity
originating from the local air base.</p>
