  <h2>Résumé</h2>
  <p>
    La mort d'un cheval fut populairement admise comme étant liée à des observations d'ovnis, mais une enquête
    professionnelle n'a rien dévoilé d'inhabituel dans la condition de la carcasse. Aucune conclusion significative ne
    peut être dérivée des nombreux rapports d'observations d'ovnis.</p>
  <h2>Contexte</h2>
  <p>Au début de l'Automne <time>1967</time>, des nouvelles d'une série d'événements that were popularly held to be
    related filtra dans le projet du Colorado. Un de ces événements fut la mort d'un cheval dans des circonstances
    prétendument mystérieuses un mois auparavant. Cette mort était devenue associée dans l'esprit du public avec les
    récentes observations d'ovnis dans la région.</p>
  <p>
    Le cheval, propriété d'une femme et pâturant sur la ferme de son frère, n'était pas venu boire depuis 1 jour et fut
    retrouvé mort 2 jours plus tard. Il fut signalé que l'ensemble de la chair et de la peau avaient été enlevé de sa
    tête et de son cou selon une coupe droite juste au-dessus de l'épaule, et que de la végétation écrasée, des
    dépressions étranges dans le sol et des dark "exhaust marks" had been found nearby. The owner of the horse was a
    correspondent for a local newspaper, and a spate of releases had rapidly inflated public interest in the case.</p>
  <p>When, a few days later, word came through that a second dead horse had been found, amid persistent rumors of
    unreported UFOs, it was decided that project investigators should go to the area.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Enquête</h2>
  <p>
    The area about the carcass had been trampled by several hundred visitors. The investigators therefore considered it
    was not worthwhile to try to investigate anything at the site except the carcass. When they learned that no
    veterinarian had examined it, they called in a veterinarian, who examined the carcasses of both of the horses. His
    essential findings were:</p>
  <p>The horse's carcass was extremely old for an autopsy, but there was evidence suggesting a severe infection in a
    hindleg that could have disabled or killed the animal. There was evidence also of a knife cut in the neck, possibly
    made by someone who found the horse hope- lessly sick. Absence of nerve tissues and viscera was normal for a carcass
    dead several weeks.</p>
  <p>Magpies and other birds ordinarily cannot peck through the skin of a horse, but will eat the flesh and skin if they
    can get into it. In this case, they evidently had taken advantage of the cut and removed all accessible skin and
    flesh from the neck and head before the carcass had been found.</p>
  <p>The second horse carcass showed evidence that death had resulted from encephalitis.</p>
  <p>It had been reported that a forest ranger with civil defense training had found a high level of radioactivity near
    the "exhaust marks." When questioned by an investigator, he said that his meter had indicated only "slight" activity
    two weeks after the carcass had been found. The investigators concluded that the activity he had measured on his
    simple survey instrument had been no greater than the normal background radiation they measured three weeks
    later.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>There was no evidence to support the assertion that the horse's death was associated in any way with abnormal
    causes.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Autres observations</h3>
    <p>The investigators then turned their attention to the numerous reports of UFO sightings in the same area. Many
      were vague or involved direct lights at night. Only the more interesting cases are reported here.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        A service-station attendant and former aircraft gunner reported three sightings in ten years. The second, about
        1962, occurred while he, with three companions, was driving west at 65 mph., about 3:30 a.m. They noticed on the
        slope of a nearby mountain a point of blue light that moved toward the highway and then turned parallel to it,
        pacing the car a few feet from the ground. It soon pulled ahead and vanished over the valley. Suddenly, the
        witness saw what he assumed was the same light appear in the middle of the road some distance ahead and approach
        at high speed, so that he ran the car off into the graded ditch to avoid collision. As the light approached, it
        grew to at least the size of his car. As it passed, it shot upward a few feet, turned south, and disappeared.
        <br> In the spring of 1967, the same witness, with his wife, was driving west when he saw an object that
        resembled a box kite crossing the highway from the left. He associated it with a helicopter, although he was
        familiar with them and the apparition was silent. Thinking that it was some kind of aircraft that might land at
        the airport, he drove directly there. During this part of the trip, the object disappeared behind some
        buildings. When they arrived at the airport, it was nowhere in sight.</li>
      <li> About 5:15 a.m., late summer, 1967, a couple were driving south when they saw two extended objects outlined
        with a dull glow, at an altitude of about 15°. One was directly south over the road, and the second was
        south-southwest. The objects moved northwesterly until they were apparently "directly over [the mountain]."
        There the second moved up beside the first and they hovered for several minutes before descending rapidly to the
        ground, where they merged with the vegetation and disappeared. The witnesses estimated that the minimum distance
        to the objects was one mile, and presumably was never very much greater; however, they hovered "directly over
        [the mountain]," which was at least 8 mi. away. </li>
      <li>On an unrecalled date, late in the summer, 1966, about 5:30 a.m., two boys, ages 13 and 17, were traveling
        north when they saw an extended bright light in the road. The UFO kept ahead of them for about 20 mi., then
        disappeared. </li>
      <li> At 10:15 p.m., early fall, 1967, the owner of the horse mentioned above, with her husband, was driving west.
        They saw three pulsating red-and-green lights pass over, moving generally southwest. <br> After five to ten
        minutes, the third object seemed to explode, emitting a yellow flash, then a second flash nearer the ground, and
        a puff of smoke that the witnesses observed for ten minutes. Several fragments were seen to fall to the ground
        after the second explosion. <br> The husband and wife disagreed as to the location. He said the wreckage should
        lie somewhere between the second and fifth hill south of a nearby town, but she said she saw the explosion over
        a brown hill ten miles east of the same town. The explosion was also seen by a farmer, and his times and
        bearings supported the husband's account. Ayer drove between the second and third and the third and fourth
        hills, and he flew over the region south of the fifth hill, but he saw nothing of interest.

        <br> The data on this sighting were sent to Major Quintanilla, who reported that no satellite re-entries had
        been seen or predicted at the reported time. This finding, however, did not preclude the unobserved re-entry of
        a minor fragment that had not been tracked.</li>
      <li> Another couple reported several sightings, one of these, between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m., fall, 1967, considered
        by them to be a "meteor." Its location was not given. This sighting was also reported to Major Quintanilla, but
        no satellite had been observed to re-enter on that day.</li>
      <li> A l'automne <time>1967</time>, <q>10 mn avant l'obscurité</q>, 2 fermiers driving west saw a small
        cigar-shaped cloud, vertically oriented in a sky that had only one other cloud in it. The cigar was about the
        size of a thumb at arms length, 200 above the "horizon" and 45° south of the road, that is, southwest of the
        point of first sighting. It was slightly boat-tailed at the bottom and its outlines were not sharp. The second
        cloud was obviously a cloud, at a slightly greater altitude in the south. The two men drove about three miles
        while the "cigar" tilted slightly toward the other cloud and moved slowly toward it. They stopped the car to
        observe more closely. Pointing toward the larger cloud, the "cigar" continued to approach it. After a few
        minutes the witnesses drove on, and a few minutes later the "cigar" melted into the cloud.

      Aucun de ces signalements d'observations n'ont été considérés comme suffisamment récents ou étranges pour
