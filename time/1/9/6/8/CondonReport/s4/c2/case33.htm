<h2>Résumé</h2>
<p>
2 jeunes adolescentes dans un foyer rural signalèrent que dans la soirée un grand objet luisant had hovered nearby and that several child-sized
figures had been seen running about near the barn. Testimony of
others in the area was inconclusive, in some respects supporting and
in others weakening their account. No definite explanation was found,
but the case is considered weak.

</p>
<h2>
Contexte</h2>
<p>
Preliminary information, elaborated by interviews of the witnesses,
developed the following summary account:

</p>
<p>
Two fourteen-year-old girls in a second-story bedroom in the home of
one of them were looking out a window about 9:00 p.m., when they saw
a large glowing object above and beyond the barn, which was south of
the house. During the next hour, the object moved up and down, left
and right, and varied considerably in brightness. Both girls thought
the object was between the barn and a hill no more than a few hundred
yards beyond it. After about a half-hour they heard a sound,
apparently from the barn, like the "put-put" made by a power mower
when it fires but fails to start. Then three small figures ran from
the barn and stopped by a mail box next to the adjacent road. They
stood there for several minutes looking in the direction of the house
and then ran across the road to stop under a large tree where they
were partially hidden in shadow. Shortly afterward a car approached,
the object blacked out, and the figures ran across the road, past the
barn and disappeared into the shadows. After the car had passed, the
object began to pulsate between a very bright white and a dull red.
It also began moving diagonally from upper right to lower left. This
was repeated a number of times before a second car,

driven by the mother of the girl whose home they were in, ap-
proached the house. The object then became dim, as if reacting to the
approach of the car. The mother was able to see the object dimly, and
it remained dim throughout her observation. No attempt was made to
get a closer look, and around 10:00 p.m. the observers went to bed,
with the object still dim but visible. Nothing unusual could be found
to account for the sighting.

</p>
<h2>
Enquête</h2>
<h3>
Interviews des témoins</h3>
<p>
The two girls were interviewed in the home where the sighting had
occurred. Conditions were unfavorable as other members of the family
were present and asking them to leave would have been awkward.
Because of the initial nervousness of the girls, and since they had
already been interviewed separately by Ted Thobin of NICAP, a single
interview was held with both girls. Their accounts were generally the
same as told earlier to Thobin; however certain discrepancies in
different versions will be pointed out: Both witnesses tended to be
very general when asked to describe the sighting in a narrative
manner. Thus it became necessary to ask direct questions in order to
obtain details, so that it was difficult to avoid leading the
witness. In general, the girls seemed to lack curiosity and interest
in the sighting. They also seemed rather immature for
fourteen-year-olds, and it is difficult to evaluate the reliability
of their report.

</p>
<h3>
Témoignage associé</h3>
<p>
Two neighbors were questioned in connection with the sighting. One
lived about a quarter-mile south of the house where the sighting had
occurred; i.e., in the general direction of the sighting. She had
seen nothing unusual on the night of the sighting; however, she
remembered that several fires were burning in a swamp area about
one-half mile southeast of her house at the time of the sighting, and
were tended by someone on a motor scooter. A check of the exact
location of the fires relative to the UFO was inconclusive. The UFO
was approximately S of the house, while the fires were 10-15° E
of S. The motor scooter might account for the "put-put" sound. When
asked about this, the girls stated that the sound had come from the barn, not beyond. It should also be mentioned that
the neighbor who mentioned the fires did not see them even though she
was much nearer than the girls. The fires were about forty feet lower
than her house and sixty feet below the house where the girls were,
obscured by moderately dense timber.

</p>
<p>
A second woman, who lived almost directly across the road from the
observers' house, was originally considered a corroborating witness
to the sighting. She had reluctantly admitted having seen the object,
but emphasized that she did not wish to be involved. She told Ted
Thobin that she had seen a bright white watermelon-shaped thing when
she went out to take in the wash between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m. This,
however, was after she had teased the girls about seeing "little
green men." More detailed information sought by the project team was
refused. Her husband said that he had taken garbage out around 9:30
p.m. that night and had seen nothing unusual.

</p><p>
Another two-witness report was received later from NICAP as a
possible corroboration of the original sighting. An object described
as a clam-shaped, glowing red UFO was sighted 15 September 1967 at
7:50 p.m. from a location less than a mile from the girls' sighting.

</p><p>
A sighting made by one of the girls and her mother two nights after
the primary sighting was described as follows:

</p><p>
At 9:30 p.m., a bright star-like ojbect was seen in the SE at
25° elevation, moving W at apparent aircraft speed. When
directly S of their house (a later version said SW), the object
abruptly stopped and remained motionless for several minutes. Then an
airplane approached from the E, and the object took off toward the E,
retracing its original course and passing above the plane to
disappear from sight in the direction from which it had come. Total
duration was several minutes.

</p>
<h3>
Reconstruction de l'observation</h3>
<ol>
<li>
The object was first seen as the girls were looking up the road
from an upstairs bedroom window. The bedroom light was out, and the
only lighted room on that side of the house was the kitchen.</li>
</ol>

<ol ="">
<li value="2">
The object appeared as a bright white light that alternately
dimmed and then brightened again, seeming to grow larger. One of the
girls implied that this change of brightness was of several seconds
periodicity; the other said that the object "blinked fast," and that
it was mostly white.

<p></p></li><li>
Both girls had watched this for about half an hour when they
heard a "putting sound" from the barn. This sound ceased almost
immediately, and two or three figures ran from the barn and stopped
by the mail box next to the road. At this point, there are dis-
crepancies as to the number of figures and their behavior. One girl
initially mentioned three figures; she said two stood by the mail
box, one on either side, and then moments later all three appeared as
they ran past the barn and vanished into the shadows. NICAP's report
indicated that the two figures who stood by the mail box dashed
across the road, stopped under a tree, and then dashed back across
the road, where for the first time a third figure was visible running
with the other two past the barn. The version obtained by the project
team at first did not mention the figures having crossed the road at
all. When asked about this, the girls were vague; however, they
agreed that, after the figures stopped by the mail box, they next
appeared across the street under a tree. Neither girl remembered
seeing the figures cross the road in either direction. Only general
details of the figures were reported: height was estimated as about
4.5 ft. by comparison with the mail box; clothing seemed the same for
all three -- no details; the heads appeared disproportionately large.

<p></p></li><li>
After the figures had been momentarily observed across the road,
a car approached from behind the observers, and three figures were
seen running past the barn, where they vanished in shadow. The
figures were seen as silhouettes against background light from the
moon which was three days before full phase and from the luminous
object. The witnesses could not remember whether the lights of the
approaching car partially illuminated the figures. At the same time,
the luminous object dimmed out. One girl said that it became so dim
they could hardly see it. The other said its
lights went out and did not come back on for five minutes. Thus there
was a period during which little was seen, after which the object
brightened as before.

</li></ol>

<ol><li value="5">
Then, in addition to its changes in brightness, the object began
to move diagonally from lower left to upper right. This motion was
confined to several diameters of the object, perhaps two or three
degrees according to sketches made by the girls.

<p></p></li><li>
Another discrepancy concerned the position of the object relative
to the background. Originally, the girls had said that the object
dropped down behind the barn several times, and also appeared
sometimes against the background of trees. Upon closer questioning,
using sketches, both girls indicated that the object was never
actually below the horizon even when it seemed to drop down. This
statement, if accurate, sharply reduces the quality of the sighting,
because the original distance limits of a few hundred yards can no
longer be relied upon, and size estimates -- which are
characteristically exaggerated -- lose meaning. It should be
mentioned that the size estimate given Thobin was likened to a VW
automobile at 150 yd. The brightness was said to be equivalent to
sunlight, but later changed to four times as bright as the moon. In
reconstructing what was seen, these various estimates must be given
low reliability.

<p></p></li><li>
Details for the latter part of the sighting are sketchy. Both
girls continued to watch the object for 20 or 30 min., while it
intermittently behaved as described. It is not clear whether the
display declined, but apparently it did. No further sound was heard
or figures seen, and one of the girls stated that, by the time her
mother returned home, about 10:00 p.m., the object was very dim
though still visible. It was implied that the object dimmed in
reaction to the approach of the car, but the girls were not clear on
this later aspect of the sighting. They apparently were tired of
watching, and after showing the object to the mother, they went to
bed. The mother apparently had not noticed the object when she
returned to the house, until the girls pointed it out to her.
Evidently it was not conspicuous enough to attract her attention as
she drove into the yard.

</li></ol>

<ol><li value="8">
Nothing unusual was seen the next morning, and nothing was found
to account for the sighting. The project investigators later searched
the barn and the area beyond for burns, radioactivity, or other
evidence, but found nothing significant.

<p></p></li><li>
At the time of the sighting, the girls did not associate the
figures with the luminous object, or the object with UFOs. The
figures were assumed to be children; the object was the mystery.
Later the girls decided that, since no children of the size they had
seen lived nearby, there might be a stranger implication.

</li></ol>

<h2>
Commentaire</h2>
<p>
Essentially, this sighting was a two-witness event with additional
low-weight corroboration. The lack of independent witnesses is a
weakness for which the marginal corroboration cannot compensate.
Though no physical evidence was discovered that could account for the
sighting, the possibility of illusory elements and distortions of
memory leaves serious doubts as to the accuracy of the account.
