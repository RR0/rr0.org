<h2> Résumé</h2>
<p>
  Des officiers des forces de l'ordre dans plusieurs communes signalèrent avoir vu, pris en chasse, et être pris en
  chasse par des objets brillants non identifiés dans les premières heures du matin en 4 jours successifs. Un objet
  aurait été détecté par une unité de radar au sol alors que l'objets étaient poursuivi par 2 hommes dans un petit
  avion. Des clichés ont été pris. Lengthy interviews of observers, including participants in the airplane pursuit,
  established clearly that the pursued object was the planet <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus">Venus</a>.
  Jupiter was also involved in some of the reports.

</p>
<h2> Contexte</h2>
<p>
Initial reports of an UFO sighting suggested that it was an event
with unsurpassed UFO information content: A large bright object was
seen, that approached as close as 500 ft., and was pursued by
reliable observers in different communities; it had been seen
repeatedly on successive mornings, and might be expected therefore
to reappear while an investigator was on the scene. The pilot of a
light aircraft had reportedly seen the object rise from the river
below while ground observers were watching it, and had pursued it in
vain as it sped away from him; FAA traffic control radar had
allegedly reported that returns from both the aircraft and the
unidentified object had appeared on the radarscope during the chase.
Photographs allegedly had been taken which showed both a bright
object near the horizon during a pre-dawn chase and an apparently
solid "sombrero"-shaped object photographed in a wooded section of
the same general area by a 13-year-old boy in the afternoon.

</p>
<p>
The main observers of the pre-dawn phenomenon were law erforcement
officers on duty in 11 communities in the central part of the state.

Police officers, sheriff's officers, and highway patrolmen were
involved, sometimes in radio communication with each other during a
sighting and pursuit. The object fled from and then pursued police
cars at speeds up to 70 mph, and came close enough to one police car
to light up the interior of the car so brightly that wristwatches
could be read. It also changed color and shape while under
observation.

</p>
<h2> Enquête</h2>
<p>
The most detailed reports, as well as the airplane chase and the
photographs, centered around a town of 11000 population, Town A.
These reports were investigated by the project team. Reports from the
other towns generally fit into the same pattern, and were assumed to
arise from the same type of observation. Each aspect of the reports
was investigated in turn.

</p>
<h3> Confirmation radar </h3>
<p>
Recorded conversation between the pilot and the Flight Control radar
operator, indicated the pilot was chasing an UFO, which he said had
risen from the river area below and was now moving away from him. The
radar operator said he had a target on the scope, which he assumed to
be the plane. He also said he had a second target, seen
intermittently for a duration of about one minute. The pilot was
heading at 110°, directly toward the object. This direction
seemed to be consistent with the assumption that the second target
was the chased UFO. The time was 5:40 - 5:58 am., EDT.

</p><p>
The pilot said the object was about 1,000 ft. above him, apparently
over a small town, Town D. On first contact with the Flight Control
the Cessna was at an altitude of 2,500 ft. climbing as it chased the
UFO. The pilot said the object was a very bright light, which he
could not catch. He could not match its altitude or speed. He said
the object moved toward the ground at times, but maintained an
altitude above them at all times. It moved away when they chased it,
and came back when they turned.

</p>
<p>
The radar operator said at the time that the target on his screen was
heading at 110°, but he didn't know whether his target was
the airplane or UFO. Later, thinking about his experience he left
word at the radar tower that he wasn't at all sure he had seen a
second target. Contacted later by phone, the operator stated that he
never did identify the plane, much less a second object. He had one
steady target, which he assumed to be the aircraft, since it
disappeared when the pilot said he was at 2,500 ft. and returning to
the airport. The intermittent target painted only on two sweeps in
about a minute. This was on an ASR-5 radar (which would make 10 or 12
sweeps per minute). It was early in the morning, the operator was
somewhat tired at the time, according to his own words. He was quick
to point out that the "intermittent target" was not a "good paint",
and could well have been a ghost return.

</p>
<h3> Observation au sol </h3>
<p>
Of the numerous law enforcement officers associated with the reports,
one of the police lieutenants, a veteran of 11 years on the force,
was asked to describe the sightings. He had participated in all the
sightings reported from his town. His account of the event follows :

</p>
<h4>
Première observation</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
<q>A. L'objet était le plus proche la 1ère nuit où nous l'avons vu. Nous le remarquâmes tout d'abord à 4 h 36 (EDT) le Vendredi 20 Octobre. Au début, je pensais que c'était un nouvel éclairage de rue que nous n'avions pas vu auparavant, mais alors que nous nous approchions, il commença à s'éloigner. Nous suivîmes l'objet, qui était alors une lumière rouge, en forme de ballon de rugby [football américain], sur 8 miles environ dans le pays. Il semblait aussi grand que la <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/lune/index.html">Lune</a> dans le ciel. Nous le perdîmes de vue, et retournèrent en ville.

</q></p>
<p><q>
This object, whatever it was, caught up with us as we approached the
city limits. The other officer started making a pretty scared sound
and pointing out behind us. That is when I turned around and saw it.

</q></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p><q>
It lit the police car enough inside to make the hands on your
wristwatch visible. The whole surroundings were lit up. I radioed in
that we were being followed by a flying object. I didn't know what it
was, but it was following us. I could see the object in the rear-view
mirror, but when we stopped the car and I got out, it veered away and
disappeared behind the trees.

</q></p><p><q>
After we returned to town and got a third officer to come out with
us, the object had started climbing and had gotten about twice the
height of the tree line. We observed the object for about 20 minutes.
It changed from bright red to orange, then to real white-looking. The
object then appeared to change its shape from round to the shape of a
giant four-leaf clover.

</q></p><p><q>
Our radio operator contacted the officers in Town C. In a few minutes
they radioed back, and said they had the object in sight. It was to
the east of us, apparently hovering over Town B. From Town C, it was
to the west and appeared to be between Town A and Town B. We had it
between the two of us.

</q></p><p><q>
I started back into town, and then is when it started moving south at
a very high rate of speed.

</q></p>
<p>
(QUESTION: You said earlier that it crossed over the top of the
police car. Did it get directly overhead?) <q>No, sir, I didn't mean it
came directly over the car. It came over the wooded area, over the
top of the trees, and appeared right behind the car. I would say it
was maybe 500 feet behind us and maybe 500 or 600 feet high, roughly
guessing. When I did stop the car and jump out, I did see it when it
went back.
</q></p>
<p>
(QUESTION: What direction were you travelling when the object
reappeared behind the car?) <q>The car was headed in a westward
direction.</q></p>

<p>
(QUESTION: In what manner did the object finally disappear this first
night that you saw it?) <q>We watched it until it climbed and took a
position in the sky. It climbed to such a height that it appeared to
be a star, and that is where it was hanging when I got off duty at 7
o'clock and went home. It was still visible, and looking like a star
at that time.
</q></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
2ème observation</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
B. <q>Although the object was reported from another town on the morning
of [Day 2], it was not seen that morning in [Town A], but it was seen
here [on days 1, 3, 4, and 5].

</q></p>
<p><q>
Sunday morning, [Day 3] , I believe it was about ten minutes till
two, or ten after two, when we got a phone call from a gentleman . .
. who was on the outskirts of town. He said an object had followed
him down the highway. We went out to look for it, and two objects
were clearly visible. This was the first morning that two objects
were spotted. You can't see the higher object until the other comes
to view, then there appears this other object directly over it. It
appears to be 5,000 to 6,000 feet above the lower object. The second
object is as bright as the first, but higher and smaller.
</q></p>
<p>
(QUESTION: In what manner did these objects eventually disappear?)
<q>The sky was clear. When I left at 7 o'clock the two objects were
still hanging in the sky -- way up high.
</q></p>
<p>
(QUESTION: Were they staying about the same distance apart?) <q>Yes.
Maybe they had drifted off some, but not too much. About 8:30 or a
quarter to nine, after the sun had come up, these objects were still
visible, and I showed them to my parents at that time. The objects
were still there when I went tn bed.
</q></p>

<p>
<q>The lower object looked like a piece of floating tin foil, it looked
flat, with a bent place in it. The higher object was round, and
stationary in one place -- it was not bobbing and floating like the
other one.
</q></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
3ème observation</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
C. <q>Monday, Day 4. This is the morning the airplane went up.

</q></p>
<p><q>
Other people had already spotted it when we went out. The first
object was in view. It was bright, star-like. While we watched it,
the second object appeared through the trees -- down and to the left
of the first object. This was about a quarter to five.

</q></p>
<p><q>
The pilots scrambled to the airport, and went up after the object. We
guided the pilots in to the object -- they had gone past it when they
were looking for the object, and, after they got back into range, we
told him where to look. He said there were hundreds of objects up
there -- they were stars, I guess. I turned the police car lights on
to show the direction of the object. When I turned him directly into
it, he said he had it in sight -- he saw it. I thought he didn't see
it, because he flew under it.

</q></p>
<p><q>
The object bobbed and moved upward, but did not move to the side as
it was pursued by the plane. I thought, if it tried to escape the
plane, it would move to one side or the other, but it just moved
upward.
</q></p>
<p>
(QUESTION: Did the object appear to get dimmer or smaller, as if it
might be moving away from you and the airplane?) <q>No, it didn't appear
to get dimmer. I couldn't tell that it was moving away from the
airplane.
</q></p>
<p>
(QUESTION: How did this object finally disappear?) <q>Again, it was
still hanging in the sky at 7:30, above the city hall.</q></p>
</blockquote>
<h3> La prise en chasse par avion de l'ovni</h3>
<p>
The pilot, who flies forest service patrol for the County Forestry
Commission and had some 4,000 hrs. flying time, and a companion,
formerly with the County Sheriff's Department, took off in a Cessna
aircraft shortly after 5 a.m., in an effort to catch the object
sighted from the ground. They were in radio contact with the [Town A]
airport, and through the airport with the sheriff's officers and
others on the ground with walkie-talkies, as well as with the radar
operator at the Flight Control Center.

</p><p>
The pilot and his associate were interviewed by project
investigators, who wanted particularly to know if they themselves
had actually observed the object's rising from the river area below
them, as the pilot stated it had in his recorded radio conversation,
or if the statement was a mere repetition of the claim of ground
observers.

</p><p>
The pilot said when they first started looking for the object, they
were looking low, near the ground. One light they spotted proved to
be a yard light. They couldn't find the object at first. Ground
observers then got word to them that it was behind them -- they had
passed it. They turned back, still looking low, when the word came
"It's above you". They had seen a light above before, but hadn't paid
any attention to it, apparently assuming it was a star. Now they did
see the object, and started chasing it. "When we flew directly toward
it, it backed off, decreasing in size until it was only about the
size of the head of a pencil. We went up to about 3,500 ft., but it
kept moving higher and away from us."

</p><p>
The pilot was strongly impressed with the great decrease in the size
of the object as it "receded" from the plane. When he first spotted
the object, it appeared to him one-half to two-thirds the size of the
moon. It decreased to a fraction of its original size. He said he was
awakened about 5 a.m., and they landed the plane, after giving up the
chase, about 6 a.m. He said the color

</p>
<p>
of the object was a constant brilliant white. As they gave up the
chase and returned to [Town A], the object moved back to about its
original position, and was still there when he landed.

</p>
<h3>
Signalements depuis d'autres villes</h3>
<h4>
1) Town E, sighting early Sunday, Day 3

</h4>
<p>
As reported in local newspapers, a highway patrolman at a state
patrol station near [Town E] spotted two UFOs -- one ice blue and
about a mile high and the other one a yellow rectangle-shaped object
with a red side which was about 100 yd. above the trees.

</p><p>
Another [Town E] patrolman there said he chased a ball of light down
a road just outside [Town E]. The object was traveling above
tree-top level. According to the patrolman's report, "It was a good
distance in front of us, pulling away, so we turned around to come
back to town. The object turned on us and followed. It gained on us
and was going about 75 mph. After the object caught up with us, it
pulled into the sky, emitting a beam of bluish light that
illuminated the roadway."

</p><p>
Newspaper accounts stated also that a [Town E] police officer said a
dark blue ball chased him and then hovered over [Town E] until
daybreak. (The implication is that this experience involved a
different officer than the one just mentioned; however, this might be
another reference to the same experience.)

</p><h4>
2) Additional Reports

</h4>
<p>
A patrolman of [Town F] police department summarized reports of
sightings on [Day 1] as follows. This summary is included as an
example of the extent of the UFO activity [in this area]. All objects
described were noiseless.</p>
<p>
UFO Report 0505 hours, Day 1

</p><p>
Lt. A, [Town A] Police Department, reported that Patrolman B and
Patrolman C, [also of Town A] Police Department, reported sighting a
sphere-shaped object approximately 25 ft. in diameter, red, white
flashing red, green and white lights, traveling south from [Town L].

</p><p>
[Town D] Police Department reported an object as above traveling
south from [Town D] . Patrolmen D and E, [Town C] Police Department,
reported sighting four objects described as above traveling
northeast. Patrolmen F and C of [Town G] Police Department reported
an object described as above traveling east from [Town G] Patrolman C
from [Town G] Police Department followed the object east . . .

</p><p>
The County Sheriff's Office reported sighting an object described as
above traveling east.

</p><p>
[Town H] Police Department reported an object described as above
traveling west.

</p><p>
[Town J] Police Department . . . reported an object described as
above traveling east from [Town J].

</p><p>
[Town K] Police Department reported an object traveling west.

</p><p>
[Town L] Police Department reported two objects - one traveling south
and one traveling east.

</p><h3>
Relevant Information

</h3><p>
During the period [days 1-5] Venus had a magnitude of -4.2;
Jupiter's magnitude was -1.5. Venus rose about 2:50 a.m. local
standard time. Jupiter rose about 40 min. earlier, the time
difference varying a few minutes each day. The tremendous
brightness of Venus made its appearance spectacular, and it had been
the cause of numerous UFO reports across the country for weeks prior
to these dates.</p>
<p>
The moon which was full 15 days later, was shining in the western sky
during the early morning hours. The bright star Capella also could be
seen to the west (northwest) during the early morning hours.

</p><h3>
Analysis of the UFO Observation

</h3>
<p>
The fact that the UFO's reappeared each day during early morning
hours suggested immediately that the sightings might be related to
the earth's rotation. Timing with the appearance of Jupiter and Venus
to the east, and the fact that most reports showed the UFO or UFOs to
be to the east, made the investigators suspect immediately that the
appearance of Venus, plus suggestion and unfettered imagination,
might account for most, perhaps all, of the UFO reports in this
series. Sleepiness and fatigue also could have been significant
factors, since some police officers involved had been working double
shift.

</p><p>
Initial checks showed the radar confirmation of the presence of the
UFO to be so tenuous as to be essentially non-existent.

</p><p>
The airplane pilot revealed that he had not actually observed the
UFOs "rising from the river area," but had merely repeated the claims
of ground observers that it had done so. His description of the chase
fits nicely with the hypothesis that he was chasing a planet. The
apparent recession of the object, with apparent diminishing size,
could be accounted for by his rising above a haze layer which, by
dispersion of light, caused a magnified appearance of the planet when
he was at a lower altitude (See Section VI, Chapter 2). All reports
indicated a heavy mist or haze did exist over the river area each
morning when the UFOs were observed.

</p><p>
When the investigators suggested to the pilot that he might have been
chasing the planet Venus, and explained the reasons for its unusual
appearance, the pilot felt that this might possibly have been the
case.

</p>
<p>
As for ground observations, besides daily reappearance, the fact that
the object or objects each day eventually took a position in the sky
and looked like stars was taken as confirmation that the UFOs
indeed were planets. The positions they eventually "took in the sky"
were the positions known to be occupied at the time by Venus and
Jupiter. The police observers were shown the planet Venus during late
morning hours. (Venus was quite visible during the day during this
period, but was noticed only if one knew precisely where to look.)
They all agreed that the appearance was the same as their UFO after
it "took its position" after sun-up.

</p>
<h3> Conclusion</h3>
<p>
The conclusion that the reported UFOs were misinterpretations of
sightings of planets, particularly of Venus, seems not only tenable
but imperative.

</p>
<h3>
Photographies</h3>
<p>
The series of photographs taken during a pre-dawn chase showed a
light near the eastern horizon, and was not of special interest. The
other pair of photographs, showing an apparently solid object, shaped
much like the outline of a sombrero, suspended over a clearing in
the woods, was taken by a lone 13-year-old boy who had taken his
Polaroid camera into the woods to hunt UFOs. His hunt had been
successful, and he got two pictures of the object before it flew
away. His pictures apparently were taken with the sun shining
directly on the camera lens, diffusing light onto the film and
causing the UFO image to appear in very poor contrast with the back-
ground.

</p><p>
The photographs were examined by Dr. W. K. Hartmann who commented
that while the lack of contact made the appearance consistent with
the claim that the object was at a considerable distance, the poor
quality of the photographs prohibited significant quantitative tests.
The photographs themselves were thus not of high enough</p>
<p>
quality to allow determination of the size or distance of the object
photographed. It is believed that the object photographed had no
relation to the object pursued in the pre-dawn activity.

</p>
<h2> Conclusions</h2>
<p>
It seems quite clear that the UFO excitement was caused primarily by
the planet Venus.

</p><p>
The case serves to illustrate the extreme elaboration which can
develop from misinterpretation of a natural and ordinary phenomenon.
Suggestion, coupled with common visual effects which are not familiar
to or understood by the observer (see Section VI, Chapters 1 &amp; 2),
frees the imagination, to produce the kinds of observations described
in this case.

</p><p>
The case also illustrates the appearance of motion of a stationary
distant object, particularly that caused by the motion of the
observer; the magnifying effects of haze scattering and near-horizon
observation; and scintillation of a light near the earth's horizon.

</p>
<p>
The rapid attrition of supporting information which the initial UFO
sighting reports included also is demonstrated impressively in this
investigation. The case illuminates the inadequacy of current
education regarding fundamental astronomy and atmospheric physics.</p>
