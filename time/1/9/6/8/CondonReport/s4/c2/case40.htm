<h2> Résumé</h2>
<p>
Un lumière observée et photographiée depuis la pente d'une montagne fut analysée par photométrie grossière et une référence à une carte de la zone. Elle fut attribuée presque certainement aux phares d'un véhicule de  surface dans la vallée.</p>
<h2> Contexte</h2>
<p>
2 jeunes hommes du collège décidèrent d'aller voir des ovnis dans une vallée depuis le flanc d'un pic montagneux. Dans la soirée, ils conduisirent off une autoroute à l'Est de la ville A, au Nord d'une route environ 0,75 miles après une route d'accès à une ferme, puis tournèrent à l'Est sur une route sale à environ 0,5 mile up the
slope of a mountain. There they set up their camera on a tripod. It
was a Yashica-D with 80-mm lens, 2.25 by 2.25-in. frame, loaded with
Eastman Tri-X film. The moon was high and the sky clear.

</p>
<p>
About 1:20 a.m., a white light appeared in the valley to the west,
apparently above the valley floor but below the line of lights that
marked a well travelled highway on the valley floor. About 1 h 30,
while the light was still stationary, two photographs were taken with
exposures of 40 and 80 sec. Later the light moved northward at both
low and high speeds, then returned to its starting point. Its
apparent path is shown in Fig. 8.</p>
<h2> Enquête</h2>
<p>
The latest, unpublished Geological Survey map indicates that the
altitude of the camera site was about 7,800 ft. From this and other
known altitudes, it was deduced that the line of sight to the UFO
intersected the valley floor about seven miles from the camera. The
camera position was almost due east of city B, which lies in a valley
between a mountain to the south and other mountains to the north. These features can be approximately identified on the
photographs. They indicate that the bearing of the UFO from the
camera was 290°.

</p>
<p>
The positions and lengths of the star tracks, corrected for the
camera motion apparent on the longest exposure, indicate that the
first exposure was roughly three times as long as the second, and
that the reported exposure times were approximately correct. A
vertical microdensitometer tracing of the region to the right of the
edge of the disc of the UFO spot on the 80 sec. exposure indicated
substantial illumination of the valley floor, suggesting that the
light was on a vehicle on the ground.

</p>
<p>
The eye usually can distinguish 2 objects having an angular
separation less than one minute of arc, or about ten feet at seven
miles. This limitation would explain why the boys saw only one light,
even though the source may have been a pair of headlights.
Application of Rayleigh's criterion for resolving power to the camera
lens indicates that if of excellent quality it could have resolved
headlights at any top opening greater than f/12; presumably it was
used wide open.

</p>
<p>
However, the two headlight images would have been only 8.6 µ
apart on the camera film. Tri-X film is rather coarse-grained; the
manufacturer's specifications indicate that it cannot register
separate image details, even with poor efficiency, unless they are at
least 15 µ apart. Contrast effects between bright
headlights and the dark background would further reduce the
resolution on the film. It seems clear that a pair of headlights
could not have been distinguished from a single light in the
photographs. A horizontal densitometer trace showed three shallow
peaks of unequal height, but the separation of the two greater ones
was roughly ten times the expected value for headlights. The
shallowness of the peaks suggested they might be artifacts.

</p>
<p>
The intensity of the unknown source was determined approximately
from the geometry of the situation and the density of the image of the source on the film. If we call the intensity of the
source I, the light flux from the source into the camera lens F, the
area of the lens opening A, and its distance from the source R, then
F = IA/R<sup>2</sup>. Absorption and other losses in the lens reduce this
flux by a factor T, estimated as 0.8. The remaining light flux falls
on an image spot of area at the film. Therefore, if J is the
illumination at the image, Ja = TIA/R<sup>2</sup>.

</p>
<p>
The lens opening is assumed to have been f/3.5, or 2.28 cm. diameter.
The diameter of the image spot on the 40-sec. negative was determined
from a densitometer trace as 0.4 mm. The density of the image spot,
corrected for background, was 3.2. The H-D curve published by
Eastman for Tri-X film with antihalation base, developed seven
minutes in D-76 at 86 F., shows only the toe and straight section. If
the exposure is determined by a linear extrapolation of the straight
section, a minimum value of the illumination results, namely 4.0
meter-candles.

</p>
<p>
If the preceding equation for the intensity I of the unknown source
is solved with these data,
I = JaR<sup>2</sup>/TA = 197,000 candlepower.
However, this equation has assumed implicitly that the
unknown source was radiating uniformly in all directions. Since
headlight beams are concentrated in the forward direction, the result
above must be reduced by the ratio of the solid angle effectively
filled by the headlight beam to that of the full sphere. Since the
distribution of light in the beam is not uniform and depends on the
individual headlight design and condition, no accurate correction of
this result is possible. It can only be noted that the solid angle
effectively filled by a headlight is roughly 0,05 to 0,1 of the full
sphere, reducing the computed source intensity to an estimated
10000 to 20000 candlepower. Further uncertainties occur as to
whether the assumed headlights were pointing directly toward the
camera, and in estimating the source distance, lens stop used, and
illumination of the film.

<p>Maximum intensities of the high beams of automobile headlights lie
in the range 15000 to 50000 candlepower. The results of the photometric computation of the source intensity therefore are
compatible with automobile headlights, though subject to broad
uncertainties.</p>
<p>
The following hypothesis can nbw be advanced:  a vehicle, probably
4-wheel driven, moved in the valley along a path similar to that
shown in Fig. 8. No wheeled vehicle can move cross-country in the
valley because of the ubiquitous stiff vegetation: but a map of the
area shows crude roads or sand tracks that approximate the path
described by the boys. These roads are blocked by barbed-wire fences
along the section lines. Stopping to open take-down gates in these
fences accounts for the interrupted progress of the UFO. The fading
of the original light is explained by the change in direction of the
vehicle, and the appearance of a red color by the coming in view of a
tail-light.

</p><p>
The UFO was reported to have moved toward the boys at high speed. The
segment AB of the path marked on Fig. 8 is a straight black-topped
road, in the valley with a sufficient "toward" component to
correspond to the analogous part of the track in Fig. 8.

</p><p>
Finally, the statement that the UFO returned to its starting point is
made plausible by the circuitous pattern of roads and tracks on maps
of the area.

</p><p>
Many questions remain, not the least of which is: how is it that such
a bright light suddenly appeared in the middle of a vast expanse of
scrub, and what were the occupants of the vehicle doing at that hour?
Perhaps they were trying to jack-light deer (out of season) or
rabbits. Since such a pursuit was illegal, hunters would have chosen
a late hour to avoid being seen.

</p><p>
Thanks are due Dr. Elmo Bruner of Laboratory Atmospheric and Space
Physics for making the densitometric measurements.</p>
