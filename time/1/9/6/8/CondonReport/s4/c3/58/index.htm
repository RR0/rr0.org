<h2>Résumé</h2>
<p>
  2 objets photographiés dans des incidents non liés par Universal City Studios sont jugés être réels mais de peu de
  valeur probative dans l'établissement de l'existence d'objets volants extraordinaires. Ces objets peuvent être
  facilement attribués à des débris aériens.

  </table><p>Durant le tournage d'un film, <em>Un homme nommé Gannon</em>, 2 bobines de film, une fois développées,
  montrèrent des images non identifiées dérivant à travers le champ de vue. Dans aucun des cas l'équipe du film ou les
  acteurs ne se souviennent avoir vu l'objet. D'après le personnel de la société compagnie cinématographique, this was
  the strangest aspect of the case, because the cameramen habitually look for aircraft or contrails, especially in
  historical dramas. In situations where aircraft are filmed, the scene is immediately reshot, and the footage showing
  inappropriate detail is rejected. However, in these two cases the images were discovered only during the editing, when
  the processed film was being viewed. </p>
  <p>
    The first case, shot at Sonora, Calif., 1 November 1967, showed a small bright source drifting slowly toward the top
    of the screen (Plate 63) at the very beginning of a sequence, while the camera slate is still being shown. The slate
    is removed and the scene shows only deep blue sky and the drifting object, which leaves the upper margin near the
    left corner after roughly ten seconds, before any subsequent action starts. The object is below or near the
    resolution of the film and resembles a wide-angle shot of the moon, except that the camera was stationary and the
    object is drifting.

  </p>
  <p>
    The second case involves film shot on the Broom Ranch near Camarillo 27 December 1967. During a dialogue sequence
    the camera was focused on the head and shoulders of an actor who was astride a horse. The horizon is out of the
    picture. At this time a pale, circular extended object, which appears to be an out-of-focus image of a point source
    or a small bright source, drifts across the screen from the right edge to the left edge in roughly 15 sec. (The
    image does not reproduce well in black-and-white.) The object definitely appears to pass behind the actor as it is
    not visible against several dark portions of his clothing. Again, the camera was fixed, although there is a sudden
    offset to compensate for a movement of the horse. The shooting of this scene will not be cut from the final motion
    picture.


  </p>
  <h2>Enquête</h2>
  <p>
    At my request, Mr. William J. Wade, head of the camera department at Universal Studio, used his standard
    depth-of-field tables to check the depth of field in each case. These tables are based on a circle of confusion of
    0.002 in. diameter. In the Sonora case, the camera was focused quite close (after the slate is removed and the UFO
    has disappeared, an actor jumps into the foreground). For a 35 mm lens at f8, focussed at 25 ft., the depth of field
    is 7 ft. 2 in. to infinity. Thus an object passing anywhere in the background would be in focus. This is consistent
    with the small, apparently unresolved, bright image. In the Camarillo footage, the longer focal-length lens had less
    depth of field. For a 100 mm lens at f8, focussed at 20 ft. (the approximate distance of the actor) the depth of
    field is 16 ft. 1 in. to 27 ft. 2 in.; at 25 ft. it is 19 ft. 2 in. to 36 ft. 8 in. This restricted depth of field
    is consistent with the image being badly out of focus, assuming that the object passed at a distance greater than
    some 30 ft.

  </p>
  <p>
    There is no reason to suspect that any fabrication is involved. The officials with whom I spoke were helpful and
    appeared genuinely puzzled. There has been no evidence of any attempt to capitalize on the event. Had the studio
    wanted to fabricate a UFO, the facilities were readily available to create a much more vivid result.

  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    It is concluded that real objects were photographed in both cases, consistent with the camera geometry. The
    information content of the films is so low that the cases are of little value in establishing the existence of
    "flying saucers." In addition, it strains credulity to argue that a single film crew would unknowingly and
    accidentally photograph rare, extraordinary objects on two occasions occurring 56 days and approximately 275 mi.
    apart.

  </p>
  <p>
    Alternatively, it is easy to argue that both objects may have been some sort of wind-blown debris, either natural,
    such as a bit of milkweed-type plant debris, or artificial, such as a bit of white tissue. A two-inch diameter white
    object at about 50 ft. distance would be consistent with the observations. The camera crew, checking for aircraft,
    would not have seen anything. The object would be in focus in the Sonora case, out of focus in Camarillo. In the
    Sonora photographs the object would subtend an angle of only 0°.2 and show up as only a small bright source. During
    the shooting, the object would be unlikely to attract the attention of the camera crew, being neither "up in the
    sky" at infinity, nor in the region of focal interest.</p>
