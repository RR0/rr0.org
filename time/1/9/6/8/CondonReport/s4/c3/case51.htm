<h2>Résumé</h2>
<p>
  During a daytime launch of a Thor-Agena rocket, several tracking cameras independently recorded a bright, star-like
  object apparently passing the missile. The object has been conclusively identified as Venus.

<h2>
  Contexte
</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Heure</strong> : 13 h 54 (PST)</li>
  <li><strong>Lieu</strong> : Complexe 75-1-1, Vandenberg AFB (Californie)</li>
  <li><strong>Données de la caméra </strong> : UFO clearly shown in films from site TS1O, with a 16mm Mitchell camera
    using a 12 in. lens (frame rate: 24 FPS). Two identical cameras with 6 in. lenses did not show the UFO. Certain
    other films are also alleged to show the UFO but were not examined.</li>
  <li><strong>Conditions météo</strong> : Deep blue sky with scattered thin clouds. On the film sequence that shows the
    UFO, the sky is clear, but from the other two sites, at that moment, thin clouds were present, through which the
    rocket was still clearly recorded.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Observation, informations générales
</h2>
<p>
  The sighting was reported by <a href="/people/b/BakerRobertML/index.html">R. M. L. Baker</a> (1) as an example of an
  unidentified object with potentially discriminatory tracking data. Baker had received a copy of the tracking film
  through contacts at Vandenberg (2), and subsequently brought it to our attention.

    lumineux est visible. L'ovni, identifié comme étant <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus">Vénus</a>,

    </tr></table><p>The tracking camera films were supplied to the project by the U.S. Air Force, and a 16mm copy of the
    three sequences described above was examined. It was noted that at the moment the UFO is visible, the rocket was
    moving down in the sky on a southerly course toward the horizon. Clouds drifted upward across the screen as the
    rocket passed them. The UFO had a similar motion, suggesting that it might be fixed in the sky, rather than <q>moving
      up past the rocket.</q> This, plus the fact that the smaller lenses under poorer conditions did not record the
    object, in turn suggested the possibility that the object might be Venus, which reaches sufficient brilliance to be
    seen by the naked eye in a clear, daylight sky. La planche 41 montre une image d'exemple.

  </p>
    <p>
      Classified tracking data made available (3) predicted the altitude and azimuth of the rocket as seen from "<q>radar
      site 1,"</q> near the launch pad. From certain considerations related to the film, we know the absolute time of
      the passage of the UFO to within a few seconds, and the predicted tracking data give positions at similar
      intervals. Fig. 7 shows a plot of the predicted path of the rocket, seen from "site 1" compared to the actual
      position of Venus. It can be seen that the rocket should have passed within 2 deg of Venus within a few seconds of
      the time that the UFO was observed. The predicted data can be taken as very accurate, but the actual position of
      the camera site TSlO, some 5000 ft. east of the pad, was probably east of "radar site 1," so that parallax would
      shift the rocket's path to the right by probably not more than 1 deg.

    </p>
    <h2>
      Conclusion et synthèse
    </h2>
    <p>
      At precisely the time that the UFO was recorded, the missile was less than 2 deg from Venus, and Venus was thus
      within the camera frame. The UFO image has precisely the properties expected for Venus. This compelling evidence
      leads to the conclusion that the UFO was Venus.

    </p>
    <p>
      We have heard many allegations, sometimes detailed and more often apocryphal, of UFO's being "observed,"
      "tracked," or "photographed" during rocket tests at military bases. Many such "sightings" have been reported at
      White Sands Proving Ground in the last 20 years. In most reports there is insufficient detail to be checked. This
      case, before the films were located, had all the earmarks of such a report: an "object" was recorded on several
      different, independent cameras a mile or more apart. If assumed to have been near the rocket, the object would
      have been properly interpreted as very bright. A number of individuals had knowledge of the sighting, and
      therefore a number of rumors of a UFO passing near a rocket launched at Vandenberg could have been generated.

    </p>
    <p>
      The analysis of this case leads to the suspicion, in the absence of better data, that most if not all such
      allegations may be based on similarly inconsequential circumstances.
