<p>There is a positive side to all of this, however, The low-grade controversy generated by "devout believers in the
  existence of UFOs" (book ad in The New York Times) has attracted a great deal of attention in the news media of the
  world. A lot of rubbish about UFOs has been printed, and the entire field of speculation remains chronically
  inconclusive, but attention has also been drawn to a profound question: Are we alone in the universe? Is there life on
  other planets? And indirectly all of this has led to support and interest in governmental space programs.</p>
<p>But what of UFOs, ancient or modern? The best proposition I know for evaluating any hypothesis was offered 40 years
  ago by Bertrand Russell in <i>Skeptical Essays</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There are matters about which those who have investigated them are agreed: the dates of eclipses may serve as an
    illustration. There are other matters about which experts are not agreed. Even when all the experts agree, they may
    well be mistaken. Einstein's view as to the magnitude of the deflection of light by gravitation would have been
    rejected by all experts twenty years ago. Nevertheless, the opinion of experts, when it is unanimous, must be
    accepted by non-experts as more likely to be right than the opposite opinion. The skepticism that I advocate amounts
    only to this: 1) that when experts are agreed, the opposite opinion cannot be held to be certain; 2) that when they
    are not agreed, no opinion can be regarded as certain by a non-expert; 3) that when they all hold that no sufficient
    grounds for a positive opinion exists, the ordinary man would do well to suspend his judgments. These propositions
    seem mild, yet, if accepted they would revolutionize human life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The revolution is not yet, but as a very ordinary non-expert and a card-carrying skeptic, I will begin it by
  regarding no opinion as certain.</p>
