<title>Le "Livre de Dyzan"</title>
<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<p>A second "spot-check," made of one of the more spectacular "ancient UFO reports," has produced some fascinating
  results. It is the "UFO legend" offered by Mr. Frank Edwards in his <q>Flying Saucers -- Serious Business</q> (1966).
  In his opening chapter entitled "What Goes On Here?" Edwards, from a source not mentioned, gives us the following
  awesome account :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>A chronicle of ancient India known as the Book of Dzyan is in a class by itself, not only because of its age,
    but because of a surprising account therein. The Book is a compilation of legends passed down through the ages
    before men were able to write, and finally gathered by the ancient scholars who preserved them for us.

  </q></p>
  <p><q> They tell of a small group of beings who came to Earth many thousands of years ago in a metal craft which first
    went AROUND Earth several times before landing. "These beings," says the Book, "lived to themselves and were revered
    by the humans among whom they had settled. But eventually differences arose among them and they divided their
    numbers, several of the men and women and some children settling in another city, where they were promptly installed
    as rulers by the awe-stricken populace."

  </q></p>
  <p>
    The legend continues:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

  <p>
    <q>"Separation did not bring peace to these people and finally their anger reached a point where the ruler of the
      original city took with him a small number of his warriors and they rose into the air in a huge shining metal
      vessel. While they were many leagues from the city of their enemies they launched a great shining lance that rode
      on a beam of light. It burst apart in the city of their enemies with a great ball of flame that shot up to the
      heavens, almost to the stars. All those in the city were horribly burned and even those who were not in the city
      -- but nearby -- were burned also. Those who looked upon the lance and the ball of fire were blinded forever
      afterward. Those who entered the city on foot became ill and died. Even the dust of the city was poisoned, as were
      the rivers that flowed through it. Men dared not go near it, and gradually crumbled into dust and was forgotten by
      men. </q></p>
  <p>
    <q>"When the leader saw what he had done to his own people he retired to his palace and refused to see anyone. Then
      he gathered about him those of his warriors who remained, and their wives and their children, and they entered
      into their vessels and rose one by one into the sky and sailed away. Nor did they return." </q></p>
  <p><q> This would seem to be an account of an attempt by some extra-terrestrial group to establish a colony on Earth
    in the distant past. Like so many colonizing attempts by man, it appears to have ended in dissension and conflict.
    The most interesting portion of the story is the description of the great "lance that traveled on a beam of light,"
    which bears a surprising resemblance to a modern rocket and its jet of flame. The effect of this so-called "lance"
    brings to mind a rather detailed picture of a nuclear blast and its catastrophic sequels. If this is a mental
    concoction of some primitive writer it is at least remarkable. If it is a reasonably accurate piece of factual
    reporting, then it is even more remarkable. Since it is unverifiable, we must at this late date classify it as
    "interesting, but unproved."

  </q></p>

<p>
  This most impressive, goosepimply account of extra-terrestrial colonists who once waged nuclear war on our planet and
  then left has only one thing wrong with it -- it is completely spurious.</p><p>
  To begin with, the so-called <q>Book of Dzyan</q> is not, as Edwards writes, "a compilation of legends passed down
  through the ages . and gathered by scholars who preserved them for us." The "Book or Stanzas of Dzyan" made their very
  first appearance in 1886 in the famous book <q>The Secret Doctrine</q>, written by the high priestess of Esoteric
  Theosophy, Madame Helene Petrovna Blavatsky (1831-1891). The stanzas are the basis of her preposterous Atlantean
  "Theory of Cosmic Evolution." An unauthorized biographer declares that: "the mysterious 'Dzyan manuscript' like the
  'Senzar' language they were written in, seem wholly to have originated in Madame Blavatsky's imagination." (Roberts,
  1931).

</p><p>
  Madame Blavatsky's own account, and those of her disciples, or the origin and meaning of the "Dzyan Stanzas" quickly
  show that they were concocted for an "occult" audience with a very low threshold of mental resistance.

</p>
<p>
  That the "Stanzas of Dzyan" exist only in Madame Blavatsky's <q>The Secret Doctrine</q>, or in commentaries written by
  her disciples is clearly stated in the foreword of the only separate edition of the "Stanzas" published by the London
  Theosophical Society in 1908 :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>For the information of readers into whose hands these Stanzas may now fall, it is desirable to give some brief
    account of their source, on the authority of the Occultist Madame Blavatsky who translated and introduced them to
    the world of modern thought. The following particulars are derived from Madame Blavatsky's Secret Doctrine and Voice

    of The Silence; which Madame Blavatsky tells us form a part of the same series of long-concealed manuscript
    treasures in which the <em>Stanzas of Dzyan</em> belong.</q></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <q><em>Book of Dzyan is not in the possession of any European library, and was never heard of by European
      scholarship:</em> nevertheless it exists and lies hidden, even from the enterprising war correspondent, <em>in one
      of the mysterious rock libraries that the spurs of the Himalayas may yet contain.</em> (emphasis--SR). </q></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  In her own inimitable style Madame Blavatsky adds: "In the Tsaydam, in the solitary passes of the Kuen-Lun, along the
  Altyn-Tag" [this "Tibetan" word sounds German: "Alten-Tag" or "olden days"--SR] whose soil no European foot has trod,
  there exists a certain hamlet lost in a deep gorge. It is a small cluster of houses, a hamlet rather than a monastery,
  with a poor temple on it, and only one old Lama, a hermit, living near to watch it. Pilgrims say that the subterranean
  galleries and halls under it contain a collection of books . . . too large to find room even in the British Museum"
  (Introduction to <q>The Secret Doctrine</q>, Madame Blavatsky).</p><p>
  The preface of the London Theosophical Society's edition of the "Stanzas" explains more about them:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>The <em>Stanzas of Dzyan... are written in a language unknown to philology</em>, if indeed the word "written" is
    applicable to ideographs of which they largely consist, and this associated with the use of a colour system of
    symbology. </q></p>
  <p><q> They are given throughout, in their modern translated version, as it would be worse than useless to make the
    subject still more difficult by introducing the archaic phraseology of the original with its puzzling style and
    words. The terms used were non-translatable into English, are Tibetan and Sanskrit, and... will frequently be a
    stumbling block unless reference is made to The Secret Doctrine where the commentaries on the text will generally be
    found to supply the meaning (London Theosophical Society, 1908).

  </q></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  A thorough search of the <i>Stanzas</i> in Madame Blavatsky's books and those of her commentators has failed to
  divulge the enthralling "legend from the Book of Dzyan" quoted by Edwards. Now since the <q>Stanzas</q> exists only in
  <q>The Secret Doctrine</q>, and they, in turn, exist only "in the imagination of Madame Blavatsky," then the question
  arises: Where did the additional long account of "extra-terrestrial colonists"-- come from? It seems that Edwards had
  "been had" by one of his sources, and has innocently passed on to his readers a fabrication superimposed on a gigantic
  hoax concocted by Madame Blavatsky.</p>
