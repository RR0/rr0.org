<p> Certaines personnes dans l'établissement de la Défense commençèrent à s'inquiéter de la tendance à un intérêt du
  public pour les ovnis d'un point de vue différent, c'est-à-dire, la possibilité que les canaux de communication
  militaire puissent être encombrés de signalements d'observations à un moment où un un énemi lançait une attaque sneak
  sur les Etats-Unis. D'un autre côté, il y avait la possibilité qu'un énemi, avant de lancer une telle attaque,
  pourrait délibérément générer une <a href="../../../../../../../../Vagues.html">vague de signalements d'ovnis</a> dans
  le but-même d'encombrer les canaux de communication militaire. L'<a
      href="/org/us/ic/cia">Agence Centrale de Renseignement</a> entreprit d'évaluer la situation avec l'aide d'un <a
      href="/org/us/ic/cia/projet/Robertson">Panel Spécial</a> de 5 scientifiques s'étant distingués en recherche
  physique et dans leurs contributions à la recherche militaire durant et après la 2<sup>nde</sup> guerre mondiale. Le
  panel passa 1 semaine à étudier les rapports de cas séléctionnés et examiner des films et photographies tels que
  disponibles à l'époque. A la mi-<a href="../../../../../../5/3/01">janvier 1953</a>, le panel produisit un rapport qui
  fut classé secret jusqu'à être partiellement déclassé en <a
      href="../../../../../6">1966</a> <span class="source">Lear,1966</span>. Le rapport toujours classé partiellement
  dans la mesure où les noms de certains des membres sont effacés des archives déclassées des actes. </p>
<p> Feu le professeur <a href="/people/r/RobertsonHaroldP">H. P. Robertson</a> de l'<a
  href="/org/us/region/ca/Caltech">Institut de Technologie de Californie</a> served as chairman of the panel. He had
  been a member of the Mathematics Department of Princeton University form 1928 to 1947 when he joined the faculty of
  Calif. Inst. of Tech. In academic work he distinguished himself by his research in cosmology and the theory of
  relativity. During the war he made important contributions to operation research of the Allied forces in London
  (Jones, 1968). After the war he served from 1950-52 as research director of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group in
  the office of the Secretary of Defense and in 1954-56 was scientific advisor to the Supreme Allied Commander in
  Europe.</p>
<p> Le professeur <a href="/people/g/GoudsmitSamuelA">Samuel A. Goudsmit</a>, avec le professeur George Uhlenbeck,
  découvrit le spin de l'électron while they were young students in Leiden, Holland, in 1925. Soon after that both came
  to the University of Michigan where they developed a great school of theoretical physics which contributed greatly to
  the development of research in that field in America. </p>
<p><a href="/people/g/GoudsmitSamuelA">Goudsmit</a><a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051125115116/https://rr0.org/GoudsmitSamuelA/"></a> is best known outside of
  academic physics circles as having been scientific chief of the Alsos Mission toward the end of the war. This mission
  was the intelligence group that was sent to Germany to find out what the Germans had accomplished in their efforts to
  make an atom bomb (Goudsmit, 1947; Groves, 1962; Irving, 1967). Most of the post-war period he has served on the
  physics staff of the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. </p>

  Durant la 2nde guerre mondiale il fut membre du Laboratoire de Radiations au <a

  contribution
  particulièrement exceptionnelle au développement d'un système de radar micro-ondes pour guider les atterrissages
  d'avions lors de brouillards épais. La recherche aujourd'hui connue sous le nom de <em>Ground Controlled
    Approach </em>(GCA) fut d'une importance décisive dans la guerre. La localisation de l'appareil arrivant est suivie

<p><a href="/people/b/BerknerLloydV">Lloyd Berkner</a>, né <time>1905</time>, fut un ingénieur de l'Expédition
  Antarctique <a href="/people/b/ByrdRichardE">Byrd</a> en tant que youngster en 1928-30. Most of the pre-war period he
  was a physicist in the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. At the beginning
  of the war he became head of the radar section of the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, and for a time at the end of the
  war was executive secretary of the Research and Development Board of the Department of Defense. In <time>1949</time>
  he was special assistant to the Secretary of State and director of the foreign military assistance program. While in
  the Department of State he prepared the report which led to the posting of scientific attaches to the principal
  American embassies abroad. From <time>1951/1960</time> he was active in managing the affairs of Associated
  Universities, Inc., the corporation which operates Brookhaven National Laboratory, and toward the end of that period
  was its president. In 1960 he went to Dallas, Tex. where he organized and directed the new Graduate Research Center of
  the Southwest. During most of his life he was a member of the U. S. Naval Reserve, and rose to the rank of rear
  admiral. The concept of an International Geophysical Year, (1957-58) -- the greatest example of international
  scientific cooperation that has yet occurred -- was his brainchild. </p>
<p> Le professeur <a href="/people/p/PageThornton">Thornton Page</a> a été professeur d'astronomie à l'Université

      href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051125115116/https://rr0.org/1958.html">1958</a>. During the war he did
  research at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory, mostly in connection with design of underwater ordnance and operations
  research on naval weapons. This year (1968) he is vice-president for astronomy of the American Association for the
  Advancement of Science. In astronomy he has worked mostly on the atomic spectra of planetary nebulas. </p>
<p> The panel has been criticized for not having spent more time studying its problem. But in January 1953, the subject
  only had a four and a half year history and it was really quite possible for a group of this competence to review the
  whole situation quite thoroughly in a week. The panel has also come under incessant fire from UFO enthusiasts because
  of its recommendations.</p>
<p> It might have been possible to put together other panels that would have performed as well, but it would not have
  been possible to choose one superior in scientific knowledge, background of military experience, and soundness of
  overall judgment. </p>
<p> The Robertson panel report was originally classified "Secret" and declassified in the summer of 1966. Because of its
  central importance to the UFO story, and especially because it has been the subject of many misrepresentations, we
  present here the text of its main conclusions, and in Appendix U the full text of the declassified report just as it
  was released to the public with the names of certain participants deleted.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Pursuant to request ... the undersigned Panel of Scientific Consultants has met to evaluate any possible threat
    to national security posed by Unidentified Flying Objects ("Flying Saucers"), and to make recommendations thereon.
    The Panel has received the evidence as presented by cognizant intelligence agencies, primarily the Air Technical
    Intelligence Center, and has reviewed a selection of the best documented incidents. </li>
  <li> As a result of its considerations, the Panel concludes:
    <ol type="a">
      <li> That the evidence presented on Unidentified Flying Objects shows no indication that these phenomena
        constitute a direct physical threat to national security.
        <p> We firmly believe that there is no residuum of cases which indicates phenomena which are attributable to
          foreign artifacts capable of hostile acts, and that there is no evidence that the phenomena indicates a need
          for the revision of current scientific concepts. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> The Panel further concludes:
    <ol type="a">
      <li> That the continued emphasis on the reporting of these phenomena does, in these parlous times, result in a
        threat to the orderly functioning of the protective organs of the body politic.
        <p> We cite as examples the clogging of channels of communication by irrelevant reports, the danger of being led
          by continued false alarms to ignore real indications of hostile action, and the cultivation of a morbid
          national psychology in which skillful hostile propaganda could induce hysterical behavior and harmful distrust
          of duly constituted authority.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> In order most effectively to strengthen the national facilities for the timely recognition and the appropriate
    handling of true indications of hostile action, and to minimize the concomitant dangers alluded to above, the Panel
    recommends:
    <ol type="a">
      <li> That the national security agencies take immediate steps to strip the Unidentified Flying Objects of the
        special status they have been given and the aura of mystery they have unfortunately acquired; </li>
      <li> That the national security agencies institute policies on intelligence, training, and public education
        designed to prepare the material defenses and to react most effectively to true indications of hostile intent or
        action. We suggest that these aims may be achieved by an integrated program designed to reassure the public of
        the total lack of evidence of inimical forces behind the phenomena, to train personnel to recognize and reject
        false indications quickly and effectively, and to strengthen regular channels for the evaluation of and prompt
        reaction to true indications of hostile measures.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p> Le Tableau 3 shows the number of cases studied by Project Blue Book in the years 1953-1965 and how the Air Force
  classified them. </p>
<p> So far as can be determined, little was done to implement the recommendations contained under 4a and 4b of the
  report of the Robertson panel. It would have been wise at that time to have declassified all or nearly all of the
  previous reports of investigations of flying saucer incidents such as those waking up the bulk of the Project Grudge
  and Project Blue Book reports 1 - 12. In fact they were not declassified until 9 September 1960. Had responsible
  press, magazine writers, and scientists been called in and given the full story, or had a major presentation of the
  situation been arranged at a large scientific convention, such as at an annual meeting of the American Association for
  the Advancement of Science, they would have seen for themselves how small was the sum of all the evidence and in
  particular how totally lacking in positive support was the ETH idea. The difficulty of attempting to base a careful
  study on the anecdotal gossip which was the bulk of the raw material available for the study of UFOs would have been
  clear. </p>
<p> But secrecy was maintained. This opened the way for intensification of the "aura of mystery" which was already
  impairing public confidence in the Department of Defense. Official secretiveness also fostered systematic
  sensationalized exploitation of the idea that a government conspiracy existed to conceal the truth.</p>

<p>There are those who still cling to this idea of a government conspiracy to conceal a portentous "truth" from the
  American people. Soon after our study was announced a woman wrote me as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>Since your committee is using moneys appropriated by the people, it is your duty to level with the citizens of
    this country and tell the truth. Don't bend facts to suit the Silent Group. People are intelligent. Have faith in
    the adaptability of our citizens to take the truth. The public didn't collapse under the facts of A bombs, H bombs
    and the L bombs. It took our space program in stride. It adopted the use of "miracle" drugs. We, as citizens, can
    manage to live with the truth about saucers. DO NOT knuckle under to the censorship boys. If you want a place in
    history that is honorable -- report the truth to the public about UFOs, because millions of us already know and
    believe. I have seen "flying saucers". I have heard a man talk who has been to Mars and he can prove it, I'm sure.
    Of course the planets and stars are inhabited. Our government is acting like the small child who was punished for an
    act which endangered the lives of his brothers and sisters. Our government should be big enough to face facts as our
    citizens are able to face the facts. JUST TELL THE TRUTH. It is the easiest way and the only way. </q></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Where secrecy is known to exist one can never be absolutely sure that he knows the complete truth. There is an
  ironic recognition of this fact in Lt. Gen. Nathan Twining's letter of 23 September 1947 (See p.884) in which he
  acknowledges that consideration must be given to "the possibility" that UFOs "are of domestic origin -- the product of
  some high security project not known to AC/AS-2 or this Command." </p>
<p>We adopted the term "conspiracy hypothesis" for the view that some agency of the Government either within the Air
  Force, the Central Intelligence Agency, or elsewhere knows all about UFOs and is keeping the knowledge secret. Without
  denying the possibility that this could be true, we decided very early in the study, that we were not likely to
  succeed in carrying out a form of counter-espionage against our own Government, in the hope of settling this question.
  We therefore decided not to pay special attention to it, but instead to keep alert to any indications that might lead
  to any evidence that not all of the essential facts known to the Government were being given to us.</p>
<p> Although we found no such evidence, it must be conceded that there may be a supersecret government UFO laboratory
  hidden away somewhere of whose existence we are not aware. But I doubt it. I do not believe it, but, of course, I can
  not prove its non-existence! </p>
<p> About half way through this study, a young woman on the editorial staff of a national magazine telephoned from New
  York to Boulder. She wanted my comment on a report that had come to her editor that the Colorado study was merely
  pretending to be a study of UFOs, that this was a cover story. What we were really doing, she was told, was to carry
  on a "Top Secret" study for the Defense Department's "Martian Invasion Defense Program (MIDP)," that is, a war plan
  for a response by our defense forces in the event of an invasion of Earth by the Martians. She wanted to know whether
  this was true! </p>
<p> I could only tell her, "If it were true, I think it would certainly be Top Secret; then I would not be at liberty to
  tell you about it. This being the case, if I tell you that it is not true, you do not have the slightest idea as to
  whether I am telling the truth or not." </p>
<p> Her problem was like that of the man who thought his wife was unfaithful. He set all kinds of clever traps to catch
  her, but he never got any evidence. From this he concluded that she was deucedly clever about her infidelity. </p>
<p> In 1953 the general level of suspicion and mistrust was pervasive. The new administration was re-opening old
  security cases. The whole system of security investigations was being elaborated. This was the peak year in the career
  of the late Senator Joseph McCarthy. This was the year that charges were made against the late J. Robert Oppenheimer,
  culminating in AEC denial of his clearance in the spring of 1954.</p>
<p> In this atmosphere all kinds of dark suspicions could and did take root and grow -- including the belief -- and the
  commercial exploitation of the pretended belief -- that the government knew much about UFOs that it was concealing, or
  that the Government was woefully ignorant of the real truth. </p>
<p> In 1956 the National Investigations Committee for Aerial Phenomena was founded by Donald E. Keyhoe, a retired Marine
  Corps major. As its director he now claims that NICAP has some 12,000 members. Although organized for the purpose of
  studying UFO cases on an amateur basis, a large part of its effort has gone into promulgation of attacks on the
  government's handling of the UFO matter. In October 1953, Keyhoe 's second book appeared, <em>Flying Saucers from
    Outer Space</em> and soon was found on best-seller lists. Of it, E. J. Ruppelt commented, "To say that the book is
  factual depends entirely upon how one uses the word. The details of the specific UFO sightings that he credits to the
  Air Force are factual, but in his interpretations of the incidents he blasts way out into the wild blue yonder."
  (Ruppelt, 1956). </p>
<p> Here is how Keyhoe links the conspiracy hypothesis with the ETH:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>Three years ago this proposal would have amazed me. In 1949, after months of investigation, I wrote an article
    for True magazine, stating that the saucers were probably interplanetary machines. Within 24 hours the Air Force was
    swamped with demands for the truth. To end the uproar the Pentagon announced that the saucer project was closed. The
    saucers, the Air Force insisted, were hoaxes, hallucinations, or mistakes. </q></p>
  <p><q> Later, in a book called The Flying Saucers are Real I repeated my belief that the Air Force was keeping the
    answer secret until the country could be prepared. Several times officers at the Pentagon tried to convince me I'd
    made a bad mistake. But when I asked them to prove it by showing me the secret sighting reports, I ran into a stone
    wall...</q><span class="source">Keyhoe, 1953</span>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Another sensational book of this period was <a
    href="/people/w/WilkinsHaroldT">Harold T. Wilkins</a>' <q>Flying Saucers on the Attack</q><span class="source">Wilkins, 1954</span>.
  It is characterized by its publishers as <q>A book of facts that is more astounding and incredible than science
    fiction and which is an introduction to events that may dwarf our civilization. Has the invasion of Earth by beings
    from another world already begun? The most startling revelations yet made about mysterious visitors from outer
    space</q>. <a
      href="/people/w/WilkinsHaroldT">Wilkins</a> too professed to believe that the government was concealing these
  "astounding and incredible" facts from the people. </p>
<p> The late newscaster, <a href="/people/e/EdwardsFrank">Frank Edwards</a>, found the Air Force's secrecy baffling and
  difficult to deal with. In <q>Flying Saucers -- Serious Business</q> <span
      class="source">Edwards, 1966</span> he recalled:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>Through the Washington grapevine, various friends in the news business had told me that the Pentagon was very
    unhappy because I continued to broadcast reports of UFO sightings. By late 1953 the news services had virtually
    ceased to carry such reports; if they were carried at all it was on a strictly local or regional basis. The major
    leak -- and just about the only major leak in the censorship of UFO's -- was my radio program. </q></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Developments of this kind leave no doubt in my mind that a serious mistake was made in early 1953 in not
  declassifying the entire subject and making a full presentation of what was known, as recommended in the report of the
  Robertson panel. </p>
<p> Another major recommendation of the Robertson panel favored the launching of an educational program to inform the
  public about UFOs. If any attention was given to this proposal the effort was so slight that there was no discernible
  effect. But in any event such a program could hardly have been expected to be effective while the "aura of mystery"
  continued because of continued secrecy surrounding much of Project Blue Book's activities. </p>
<p> Much of the attack on the Robertson panel report centers on the fact that the report declared that a broad
  educational program should have two major aims, "training and 'debunking'". Training would be broadly concerned with
  educating pilots, radar operators, control tower operators and others in the understanding and recognition of peculiar
  phenomena in the sky. The panel concluded that, "this training should result in a marked reduction in reports caused
  by misidentification and resultant confusion." </p>
<p> The word <i>debunking</i> means to take the bunk out of a subject. Correctly used, one cannot debunk a subject
  unless there is some bunk in it. Over the years, however, the word has acquired a different coloration. It now
  sometimes means presenting a misleading or dishonest account of a subject for some ulterior purpose. The critics of
  the Robertson panel insist that this latter meaning is what the group had in mind. That the earlier definition of <i>debunking</i>
  was what the panel meant is evident from the following statement explaining how the "debunking" would be carried out:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>The "debunking" aim would result in reduction in public interest in "flying saucers" which today evokes a strong
    psychological reaction. This education could be accomplished by mass media such as television, motion pictures and
    popular articles. Basis of such education would be actual case histories which had been puzzling at first but later
    explained. As in the case of conjuring tricks, there is much less stimulation if the "secret" is known. Such a
    program should tend to reduce the current gullibility of the public and consequently their susceptibility to clever
    hostile propaganda. </q></p>
</blockquote>
<p> So far as we can determine, no official steps were ever taken to put into effect the training and "debunking"
  recommendations of the Robertson panel. A private effort was not to be expected, since such a program would not be
  commercially attractive and would conflict with books that were beginning to make money by exploiting popular
  confusion about the ETH and alleged government conspiracies.</p>
<p> In 1953, <a href="/people/m/MenzelDonaldH">Donald H. Menzel</a>, then director of the Harvard College Observatory
  published an excellent book <span class="source">Menzel, 1953</span>. It emphasizes the optical mirage aspects of the
  subject (<a href="../../../s6/c04">Section 6, Chapter 4</a>), and is generally regarded as "debunking" and "negative."
  Menzel's book never achieved a large enough market to be issued as a paperback and is now out of print. </p>
<p> By contrast, a book, by <a href="/people/l/LeslieDesmond">D. Leslie</a> and <a href="/people/a/AdamskiGeorge">George
  Adamski</a> entitled, <em>Flying Saucers Have Landed</em> was published in 1953 <span class="source">Leslie
  and Adamski, 1953</span>. Best known for its full account of <a
    href="/people/a/AdamskiGeorge">Adamski</a>'s alleged interview with a man from Venus on the California desert on 20
  November 1952, it enjoyed widespread popularity in hardcover and paperback editions. </p>
<p> It is difficult to know how much of the UFO literature is intended to be taken seriously. For example, <a
    href="/people/l/LorenzenCoralE/">Coral Lorenzen</a>'s first UFO book was first published under the title, <em>The
  Great Flying Saucer Hoax</em>, but in the paperback edition it became, <em>Flying Saucers: the Startling Evidence of
  the Invasion from Outer Space</em>, subtitled "An exposure of the establishment's flying saucer cover-up" (Lorenzen,
  1962, 1966). </p>
<p> The paperback edition contains an introduction by Prof. <a
    href="/people/s/SprinkleRonaldLeo">R. Leo Sprinkle</a> of the department of psychology of the University of Wyoming.
  In this introduction, Prof. Sprinkle writes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>Coral Lorenzen has been willing... to describe her fears about potential dangers of the UFO phenomena; to
    challenge sharply the statements of those military and political leaders who claim that citizens have not seen
    "flying saucers;" and to differ courageously from those who take a "head in the sand" approach... She realizes that
    censorship is probably controlled at the highest levels of governmental administration... </q></p>
  <p><q> It may be that the earth is the object of a survey by spacecraft whose occupants intend no harm to the United
    States. However, regardless of the intent of UFO occupants, it behooves us to learn as much as possible about their
    persons, powers and purposes. Mrs. Lorenzen realizes that her present conclusions may not all be verified, but she
    is also aware that it may be too late for mankind to react to a potential threat to world security. It is to her
    credit that she has avoided feelings of panic on one hand and feelings of hopelessness on the other. She has
    demonstrated a courageous approach: the continuation of the process of gathering, analyzing, and evaluating of
    information, and the encouragement of the efforts of others to come to grips with the emotional and political and
    scientific aspects of the UFO phenomena. </q></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Her book is largely taken up with vivid accounts of UFO incidents that are alleged to be factual and to support the
  idea of ETA, of actual visits to Earth of extra-terrestrial intelligences. A sample of the kind of material presented
  is the following condensation of an incident in Brazil which is said to have occurred on 14 October 1957 (p. 64 et
  seq.). </p>
<p> On that evening <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/VillasBoas">Antonio Villas-Boas</a> was plowing a field
  with a tractor when an UFO shaped like an elongated egg landed about 15 yd. away from him. The tractor engine stopped
  and Villas-Boas got out of the tractor and tried to run away when he <q>was caught up short by something grasping his
    arm. He turned to shake off his pursuer and came face-to-face with a small 'man' wearing strange clothes, who came
    only to his shoulder</q>. He knocked the little fellow down and several more came to the aid of the first one. They
  <q>lifted him off the ground and dragged him toward the ship</q>, which had a ladder reaching to the ground. </p>
<p> There follows a description of the interior of the ship and of the way in which the unearthly visitors talked with
  each other which <q>reminded Antonio of the noises dogs make, like howls, varying in pitch and intensity</q>. He was
  forced to undress and to submit to various medical procedures, but then: </p>
<p><q>After what seemed like an eternity to Villas-Boas the door opened again and in walked a small but well built and
  completely nude woman.</q> There follows a description of her voluptuous, distinctly womanly figure. </p>
<p><q>The woman's purpose was immediately evident. She held herself close to Villas-Boas, rubbing her head against his
  face. She did not attempt to communicate in any way except with occasional grunts and howling noises, like the 'men'
  had uttered. A very normal sex act took place and after more pettings she responded again... The howling noises she
  made during the togetherness had nearly spoiled the whole act for they reminded him of an animal.</q></p>
<p> Villas-Boas' clothing was then returned to him and he was shown to the UFO's door. <q>The man pointed to the door
  ... then to the sky, motioned Antonio to step back, then went inside and the door closed. At this, the saucer-shaped
  thing on top began to spin at great speed, the lights got brighter and the machine lifted straight up..." </q></p>
<p> Meanwhile, back at the tractor, <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/VillasBoas">Villas-Boas</a> consulted his watch and concluded that he had
  been aboard for over four hours. </p>
<p> Mrs. Lorenzen comments:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>The above is condensed from a 23-page report which was submitted to APRO by Dr. Olivo Fontes, professor of
    medicine at the Brazilian National School of Medicine... My own first reaction was almost one of scoffing until I
    began to add up some important factors: </q></p>
  <p><q> If an alien race bent on contact and possible colonization were to reconnoiter this planet, one of their prime
    tasks would be to learn if the two races could breed. To do this they would need a human subject. Either sex would
    be all right, but it would be much more efficient to pick a male by some means. If a human female subject were used,
    the chances of no conception, or conception followed by miscarriage, would be great due to the considerable nervous
    strain of removing that female subject from her familiar surroundings to a completely foreign location and alien
    companions, and then literally subjecting her to forcible rape. It should be quite well known, especially to an
    advanced culture, that the psychological makeup of women, especially where sex is concerned, is considerably more
    delicate than that of her male counterpart. The ideal situation, then, would be for the experimenters to pick their
    own female subject whose ovulation period would be known beforehand and proceed exactly as the strange UFO occupants
    apparently did with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051125115116/https://rr0.org/VillaBoasAntonio.html">Villas-Boas</a>.
  </q></p>
</blockquote>
<p> She says that it was not possible at that time to have Villas-Boas examined by a psychiatrist and that Villas-Boas
  has subsequently married and <q>does not care to dwell on the subject because of his wife's feelings in the matter.
    Preliminary examination by Dr. Fontes, however seems to assure us that Villas-Boas is stable, not a liar, and
    certainly not knowledgeable about certain information which he would have to have in order to concoct such a <em>logical</em>
    tale." </q></p>
<p> Mrs. Lorenzen's final comment is: <q>It is unnerving to me that, along with the thousands of sightings of flying,
  landed and occupied unconventional aerial objects, an incident such as the above could take place and not be
  objectively scientifically and logically analyzed because of <em>emotional predisposition!</em></q> But in her account
  there is no indication of any corroboration: the story stands or falls entirely on the veracity of Villas-Boas. </p>
<p> Her book is a compilation of reported incidents of which the preceding is fairly typical. What is of particular
  interest for a <em>scientific</em> study of UFOs is that in many instances the investigations, like that of the
  Villas-Boas case in Brazil, are carried out by a person having an advanced degree and an academic position. The next
  one in the book describes the case of some men who were bow-hunting on 4 September 1963 near Truckee, Calif. One of
  them became separated from the others and was chased up a tree by some "robots" also called "entities," who belched
  out puffs of smoke which would cause the man to lose consciousness. She writes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>He said he felt that the "robots" were guided by some kind of intelligence, for at times they would get "upwind"
    of him to belch their sleep-inducing "smoke." </q></p>
</blockquote>
<p> After a harrowing night the man escaped and <q>dragged himself toward camp, finally collapsing on the ground from
  exhaustion</q>. </p>

  Congrès <a href="/people/r/RoushJEdward">J. Edward Roush</a> de l'Indiana (29 Juillet 1968). Dans ce témoignage au
  Congrès, le <a
      href="/people/h/HarderJamesA">Dr. Harder</a> a déclaré :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>...there have been strong feelings aroused about UFOs, particularly about the extra-terrestrial hypothesis for
    their origin. This is entirely understandable, in view of man's historic record of considering himself the central
    figure in the natural scene; the extra-terrestrial hypothesis tends inevitably to undermine the collective ego of
    the human race. These feelings have no place in the scientific assessment of facts, but I confess that they have at
    times affected me... </q></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>Indeed, there are flying saucer cultists who are as enthusiastic as they are naive about UFOs -- who see in them
    some messianic symbols -- they have a counterpart in those individuals who exhibit a morbid preoccupation with
    death. Most of the rest of us don't like to think or hear about it. This, it seems to me, accurately reflects many
    of our attitudes toward the reality of UFOs -- natural, and somewhat healthy, but not scientific. </q></p>
</blockquote>
<p> In the second Lorenzen book, a considerably more detailed account of the Truckee, Calif. incident than the first one
  is given including this comment:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>At present the preliminary interviews by a qualified psychiatrist have been made preparatory to either sodium
    amytol or hypnotic trance questioning. We feel that Mr. S. [the man who was up the tree] may have information buried
    at a subconscious level which may shed considerably more light on the whole incident. We are reasonably certain that
    the whole incident took place and was a true physical experience, and therefore the trance questioning will not be
    done to attempt to discredit him in any way. </q></p>
