<p> La responsabilité de la mise en oeuvre de la recommandation du rapport O'Brien fut affectée au <a href="/org/us/dod/af/AFOSR.html">Bureau de la Recherche Scientifique de l'Air Force (AFOSR)</a> par le Secrétaire à l'Air Force. Ce faisant, il leur donna latitude pour toute étude ultérieure des détails spécifiques des recommandations et la décision de partir de la formulation
  exacte donnée dans ce rapport. As a result of study within that office, it was
  decided to concentrate the project in a single university rather than
  to make contracts with a number of universities. </p>
<p> Recommendation B was incorporated into AFR 80-17 which replaced AFR
  200-2. This was made effective 19 September 1966. </p>
<p> The staff of the AFOSR studied the question of which University to
  invite to take on the study, and also took counsel on this question
  with a number of outside advisers. As a result of this inquiry in the
  late spring and early summer of 1966, they decided to ask the
  University of Colorado to accept a contract for the work, and in
  particular asked me to take on the scientific direction of the
  project. </p>
<p> This request was made to me on 31 July 1966 by Dr. J. Thomas
  Ratchford of the scientific staff of AFOSR, who was introduced by Dr.
  W. W. Kellogg, associate director of the <a href="/org/ca/NCAR.html">National Center for
    Atmospheric Research</a> and at that time a member of the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/AFSAB.html">Air Force
      Scientific Advisory Board</a>. </p>
<p> This request was unwelcome for a variety of reasons. I was planning
  to write a new book on the theory of atomic spectra and in fact had
  started on it. This was to replace one written more than thirty years
  earlier with Dr. G. H. Shortley <span class="source">Condon and Shortley, 1935</span>.</p>
<p> Despite its age it has been the standard work in the field for all
  those years but naturally is now quite out of date. I had at last
  arranged things so that I could do this writing and regarded it as
  the most useful professional activity in which I could engage before
  retirement. </p>
<p> Although I knew only a small fraction of what I now know, I was aware
  that the UFO subject had had a long history of confused and ambiguous
  observational material making a truly scientific study extremely
  difficult if not impossible. This would make the subject unattractive
  not only to myself but to scientific colleagues on whom one would
  have to call for help. Moreover, all of them were engaged in
  scientific work that was more to their liking, which they would be
  reluctant to set aside. </p>
<p> I had some awareness of the passionate controversy that swirled
  around the subject, contributing added difficulty to the task of
  making a dispassionate study. This hazard proved to be much greater
  than was appreciated at the outset. Had I known of the extent of the
  emotional commitment of the UFO believers and the extremes of conduct
  to which their faith can lead them, I certainly would never have
  undertaken the study. But that is hindsight. It may nevertheless be
  of value to some scientist who is asked to make some other UFO study
  in the future to have a clear picture of the experiences of this sort
  which we had. </p>
<p> These objections were met by counter-arguments in the form of an
  appeal to patriotic duty. A good deal of emphasis was placed on the
  shortness of the task, then envisioned as requiring only fifteen
  months. </p>
<p> I objected to the selection of myself, mentioning the names of
  various scientists of considerable distinction who had already taken
  an active interest in UFOs. To this the reply was made that these
  individuals were essentially disqualified for having already "taken
  sides" on the UFO question. </p>
<p> After several hours' discussion along these lines, I agreed to
  discuss the matter informally with a number of colleagues in the
  Boulder scientific community and, in the event that enough interest
  was shown in such preliminary conversations, to arrange a meeting at
  which representatives of AFOSR could present the story to a larger group
  and answer their questions. From this would come an indication of the
  willingness of some of them to take part in such a project if it were
  set up.</p>
<p> At this stage there was also the question of whether the University
  should allow itself to be involved in so controversial an
  undertaking. Several members of the faculty had grave misgivings on
  this score, predicting that the University might be derided for doing
  so. </p>
<p> In preparation for the meeting with <a href="/org/us/dod/af/AFOSR.html">AFOSR</a> staff which was set for 10
  August 1966, Robert J. Low, then assistant dean of the graduate
  school, wrote some of his thoughts in a memorandum dated 9 August
  1966 which he sent to E. James Archer, then dean of the graduate
  school, and T. B. Manning, vice president for academic affairs. </p>
<p> The Low memorandum has acquired undue importance only because a copy
  was later stolen from Low's personal files and given wide
  distribution by persons desirous of discrediting this study. Portions
  of it were printed in an article by John G. Fuller <span class="source">Fuller, 1968</span>  which misconstrues it as indicating a conspiracy on the part of the
  University administration to give the Air Force a report which would
  support its policies instead of those being advocated by <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">NICAP</a>. </p>
<p> Commenting on Fuller's article, Low wrote in July 1968,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>The suggestion that I was engaged, along with Deans Archer and
    Manning, in a plot to produce a negative result is the most
    outrageous, ridiculous and absurd thing I ever heard of. My concern
    in writing the memo, was the University of Colorado and its standing
    in the university world; it was a matter of attitudes that the
    scientific community would have toward the University if it undertook
    the study. It had nothing to do with my own personal outlook on the
    UFO question. </q></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Nor did it represent official policy of the University, since it was,
  at most, a preliminary "thinking out loud" about the proposed project
  by an individual having no authority to make formal decision for the administration, the department of physics, or any other
  university body. Indeed, one of the proposals Low makes in it runs
  exactly contrary to the procedure actually followed by the project.
  Low proposed "to stress investigation, not of physical phenomena, but
  rather of the people who do the observing -- the psychology and
  sociology of persons and groups who report seeing UFO's." It should
  be evident to anyone perusing this final report, that the emphasis
  was placed where, in my judgment, it belonged: on the investigation
  of physical phenomena, rather than psychological or sociological
  matters. It should be equally obvious that, had the University
  elected to adopt Low's suggestion, it would have hardly chosen a
  physicist to direct such an investigation. </p>
<p> I will, for purposes of record, go a step further in this regard. If
  nevertheless the University had asked me to direct this study along
  psychological and sociological lines, I would have declined to
  undertake the study, both on the ground that I am not qualified to
  direct an investigation having such an emphasis, and because in fact
  the views in the Low memorandum are at variance with my own. But the
  fact is that I was not aware of the existence of the Low memorandum
  until 18 months after it was written. This was long after the project
  had been set up under my direction, and, since I knew nothing of the
  ideas Low had expressed, they had no influence on my direction of the
  project. </p>
<p> The 10 August meeting lasted all day. At the end, it seemed that
  there was enough faculty interest to go ahead with the task for
  AFOSR. During September 1966, details of the proposed research
  contract were worked out in conferences between Low and myself and
  the staff of AFOSR. The contract was publicly announced on 7 October
  1966, with work to start as soon after 1 November as possible.
  Because of other commitments, I could devote only half-time to the
  work. After 1 February 1968, I devoted full time to the project. </p>
<p> The O'Brien report had stressed the importance of using psychologists
  as well as physicists on the staff. Dr. <a href="/people/c/CookStuartW.html">Stuart Cook</a>, chairman of the
  department of psychology, accepted appointment as a principal
  investigator on an advisory basis but could devote only a small
  fraction of his time to the study because of other commitments. In a
  short time he made arrangements for the project to have the part-time services of
  three of his professors of psychology: Drs. <a href="/people/s/SaundersDavidR/index.html">David R. Saunders</a>,
  William B. Scott, and Michael Wertheimer. Saunders had worked on
  machine statistics in relation to problems in educational psychology.
  Scott's field was social psychology. He made some useful initial
  contributions but soon found that his other duties did not permit him
  to continue. Wertheimer is well known as a specialist in psychology
  of perception. He worked with members of the field teams and has
  contributed a chapter to this report (Section VI, Chapter 1).</p>
<p> The initial staff also included Dr. <a href="/people/r/RoachFranklinE.html">Franklin E. Roach</a> as a principal
  investigator. <a href="/people/r/RoachFranklinE.html">Roach</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051125115116/https://rr0.org/RoachFranklinE.html"></a> is an astronomer who has specialized in the study
  of air glow and other upper atmosphere optical phenomena. He was at
  the time near retirement after a long career with the National Bureau
  of Standards and the Environmental Science Services Administration
  and so was able to devote full time to the project. His experience
  was valuable as including a wide range of working contacts with the
  astronomers of the world, and also as a consultant with the NASA
  program which brought him into working relations with the American
  astronauts. </p>
<p> Low was able to obtain a leave from his position as assistant dean
  and assumed full-time appointment as project coordinator. Besides
  administrative background, he brought to the project a wide general
  knowledge of astronomy and meteorology derived from some twenty years
  of work with Walter Orr Roberts on the staff of the High Altitude
  Observatory of the University of Colorado, and later with the
  National Center for Atmospheric Research during its formative years. </p>
<p> Announcement of the project received a large amount of newspaper
  attention and editorial comment. This was natural in view of the long
  history of UFO controversy, even extending into Congress, which had
  preceded the setting up of the study. Possibly the most prescient of
  comments was an editorial in The Nation for 31 October 1966, which
  declared, "If Dr. Condon and his associates come up with anything
  less than the little green men from Mars, they will be crucified."</p>
<p> The project's investigative phase ended on 1 June 1968, and the task
  of preparing a final report of the project's multifarious activities
  began. The results of those labors are presented here. </p>
<p> It seems hardly likely, however, that we have said the last word on
  this subject. Indeed, as this report is prepared the Library of
  Congress has announced publication of UFOs, an annotated
  bibliography. Prepared for the Air Force Office of Scientific
  Research (OAR) , and scheduled for publication in 1969 by the U.S.
  Government Printing Office, the bibliography contains more than 1,600
  references to works on the subject of UFOs. It will be offered for
  sale by the Superintendent of Documents. </p>
<p> Private organizations or government sponsored groups may well
  undertake to do more work on UFO phenomena, either in the name of
  science or under another rubric. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, the Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects was
  brought to a definitive close when, on 31 October 1968, this final
  report on its researches was turned over to the Air Force for review
  by the National Academy of Sciences and subsequent release to the
  public. We thank those of the public who communicated to us their
  experiences and opinions. However, as the study is now at an end, it
  would be appreciated if no more UFO material is sent to the
  University of Colorado.</p>
