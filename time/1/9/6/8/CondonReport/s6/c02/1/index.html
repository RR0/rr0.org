<p>The preceding chapter outlined the sequence of events, physical, physiological, and psychological, by which
  perception of a phenomenon is combined with previous conceptions. In this chapter we will review some evidence on how
  this proceeds in fact, and on how the conceptions, sometimes after significant interpretation, produce a report.</p>
<p>The question underlying this discussion is this: Are misinterpretation and misreporting sufficiently common as to
  make credible the assertion that the entire UFO phenomenon, or at least the residual of unidentified cases, is the
  result of these processes (plus deliberate hoaxes)? The data show that this assertion is indeed credible, although, of
  course, we cannot prove that this accounts for the unidentified objects.</p>
