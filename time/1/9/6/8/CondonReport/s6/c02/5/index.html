<p> C. A. Chant (1913a), dans un rapport de 71 pages, donne un récit détaillé de l'apparition météoritique spéctaculaire
  du 9 Février <a href="../../../../../1/3/index.html">1913</a>. La série de bolides en désintégration passa de
  Saskatchewan ESE au-dessus des Grands Lacs et au-dessus de la côte du New Jersey. Plusieurs "vagues" d'objets en
  groupe furent observées, noise was heard at least 50 miles from the sub-bolide point, and ground shocks were reported.
  Other remarkable sporadic meteors were seen in various scattered locations around the world for a period of some days.
  Chant deduced that the height of the path, which followed the earth's curvature, was about 26 miles and that the
  geocentric velocity was in the range 5-10 miles/s. M. Davidson (<a href="../../../../../1/3/index.html">1913</a>)
  réanalysa les données de Chant, plus des observations depuis les Bermudes, et conclurent que l'objet avait une
  altitude de quelques 46 miles au-dessus de l'Ontario, et Chant (1913b) subsequently inferred that they reached perigee
  over Ontario, but were not destroyed, moving out into a new orbit when seen from Bermuda.</p>
<p> The phenomenon appeared rather like the Zond IV re-entry. It is well-described in the "extended extracts" from
  letters published by Chant. Clusters of stellar-like objects passed overhead, with tails several degrees long and
  accompanied by smaller, fainter objects. It is a subjective judgment, possibly influenced by some editing of the
  letters by Chant, that the <a href="../../../../../1/3/index.html">1913</a> reports are on the whole more objective
  than those of this decade. There are probably two reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
  <li> In <a href="../../../../../1/3/index.html">1913</a> la démarcation entre les personnes "éduquées", from whom
    Chant was likely to receive letters, and "<q>uneducated persons</q>," was greater. </li>
  <li> In <a href="../../../../../1/3/index.html">1913</a>, there was no widely known conception (i.e. pre-conception of
    mysterious saucer-shaped aircraft or spaceship (although several reports refer to the object as an airship).
    Further, the 1913 reports (as published) tend to be more descriptive; the word "meteor" is used in a non-generic
    sense simply to mean a bright object passing across the sky. There is little attempt among the correspondents to
    infer what the objects were.</li>
</ol>
<p> Chant himself indicates that the reports varied in quality due to the process of conception and interpretation: <q>The
  reader ... will ... . see that intelligent people can differ widely in describing a phenomenon, and will be able to
  appreciate the difficulty I have had in discriminating between very discordant observations.</q> He presents reports
  of nearly 150 witnesses. </p>
<p> The "airship effect" is clearly present. Consider these reports: </p>
<ol>
  <li><q>The series of lights traveled in unison and so horizontal that I could think only of a giant flying machine.
    The lights were at different points, one in front, one further back, and a rear light, then a succession of small
    lights in the tail.</q></li>
  <li><q>They ... did not seem to be falling as meteors usually do, but kept a straight course ... above the horizon.
    Our first impression was that a fleet of illuminated airships of monstrous size [was] passing. The incan- descent
    fragments themselves formed what to us looked like the illuminations while the tails seemed to make the frame of the
    machine. They looked like ships travelling in company.</q></li>
  <li><q>The meteor resembled a large aeroplane or dirigible, with two tiers of lights strung along the sides.</q></li>
  <li> The witnesses <q>"reported that they had seen an airship going east. The heavens were brilliantly illuminated,
    and with the passage of the meteors a shower of stones was seen to fall. </q>(This last element is not mentioned
    elsewhere and appears to be spurious.)</li>
  <li><q>I took it for an aeroplane with both headlights lit, and as it came nearer the sparks falling behind it made it
    appear still more like one. However after a minute or a minute and a half I could see it was a meteor ... It was
    very low, apparently just above the hills.</q></li>
  <li><q>My brother shouted to me, "An airship!" And I said, "Mrs. M--- 's chimney is on fire! It looked that near ...
    To the eye they were little above the housetops.</q></li>
  <li><q> ... a voice from a group of men was heard to say: "Oh, boys, I'll tell you what it is - an aeroplane
    race."</q></li>
</ol>
<p> We have already noted in the Zond IV case that the angular size, a relatively objective estimate, was consistently
  measured. In this case the description of the noise is remarkably consistent, perhaps because of the ready
  availability of a charming simile. Here are five consecutive descriptions of the noise: </p>
<ol>
  <li><q> ... a heavy noise like a clap of thunder at a distance;</q></li>
  <li><q> ... a low rumble which at first made me think it was a buggy going along the road from church;</q></li>
  <li><q>... like thunder, loud at first and rumbling every two or three seconds;</q></li>
  <li><q> ... like a horse and rig going over a bridge;" (5) " ... like a wagon passing over a rough road.</q></li>
</ol>
<p> There was more difficulty with conceptions such as angular elevation and distance. As usual, the latter was grossly
  underestimated. </p>
<ol>
  <li><q> ...midway between the horizon and the sky...</q></li>
  <li><q> ...midway between the earth and the sky...</q></li>
  <li><q>They traveled no faster than a crow flies.</q></li>
  <li><q>...never have I [seen] so many heavenly bodies moving at one time, or any moving so slowly or in so low an
    altitude.</q></li>
  <li><q>They looked to pass about one mile south and at an elevation of about 300 feet.</q></li>
  <li><q>...I saw [it] for about half a minute. In that time it seemed to go about 150 yards.</q></li>
  <li><q>The position in the sky of the first one seemed very low, so low that at first I thought it was a rocket</q>
    (Skyrockets, of the fireworks type, were a common analogue). </li>
</ol>
<p> Many more reports could be cited, illustrating comparison with familiar objects (kites, funnels, ships in
  formation), in some cases misleading, even though the reports taken together present a relatively clear picture. We
  again can conclude that a substantial number of misleading reports will be introduced in observations of unusual
  phenomena.</p>
