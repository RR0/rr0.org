<p>An optical mirage is a phenomenon associated with the refraction of light in the gaseous (cloud-free) atmosphere.
  During mirage a visible image of some distant object is made to appear displaced from the true position of the object.
  The image is produced when the light energy emanating from the distant source travels along a curvilinear instead of a
  rectilinear path, the curvilinear path, in turn, arises from abnormal spatial variations in density that are
  invariably associated with abnormal temperature gradients.</p>
<p>The visible image of the mirage can represent shape and color of the "mirrored" object either exactly or distorted.
  Distortions most commonly consist of an exaggerated elongation, an exaggerated broadening, or a complete or partial
  inversion of the object shape. Frequently, mirages involve multiple images of a single source. Under special
  conditions, refractive separation of the color components of white light can enhance the observation of a mirage.
  Atmospheric scintillation can introduce rapid variations in position, brightness, and color variations of the
  image.</p>
<p>When both the observer and the source are stationary, a mirage can be observed for several hours. However, when
  either one or both are in motion, a mirage image may appear for a duration of only seconds or minutes.</p>
<p>Although men have observed mirages since the beginning of recorded history, extensive studies of the phenomenon did
  not begin till the last part of the 18th century. Since that time, however, a large volume of literature has become
  available from which emerges a clear picture of the nature of the mirage.</p>
<p>The comprehensive body of information presented here is based on a survey of the literature, and constitutes the
  state-of-the-art knowledge on optical mirages. The report provides a ready source of up-to-date information that can
  be applied to problems involving optical mirages.</p>
<p>No claim is made that all existing pertinent writings have been collected and read. The contents of many
  publications, especially of those dating back to the last part of the 18th Century and the beginning of the 19th
  Century are evaluated from available summaries and historical reviews. Also, when a particular aspect of the mirage
  phenomenon is considered, the collection of pertinent literature is discontinued at the point where the
  state-of-the-art knowledge appears clearly defined. The collected volume of literature covers the period 1796 to
  1967.</p>
<p>In essence, the literature survey yields the following principal characteristics of the mirage:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Mirages are associated with anomalous temperature gradients in the atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Mirage images are observed almost exclusively at small angles above or below the horizontal plane of view;
    mirages, therefore, require terrain and meteorological conditions that provide extended horizontal visibility.</li>
  <li>A mirage can involve the simultaneous occurrence of more than one image of the "mirrored" object; the images can
    have grossly distorted forms and unusual coloring.
  </li>
  <li>Extreme brightening and apparent rapid movement of the mirage image in and near the horizontal plane can result
    from the effects of focussing and interference of wavefronts in selected areas of the refracting layer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only minor shortcomings appear to be evident in present knowledge of mirage phenomena. Ultimately, a unified theory
  is desirable that can deal with both the macroscopic and microscopic aspects. Currently, the behavior of light
  refraction on a large scale is represented by means of rays while the finer details are treated with the wave theory.
  More observations are needed that deal with the microscopic optical effects of the mirage. The finer details that
  arise mostly from focussing and interference are not commonly observed. They require close examination of areas that
  are highly selective in time and place.</p>
