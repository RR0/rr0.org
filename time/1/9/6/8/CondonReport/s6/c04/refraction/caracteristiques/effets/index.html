  A recent theoretical and experimental investigation of the optical mirage is presented by Sir C. V. Raman (1959). Sir
  C. V. Raman demonstrates that multiple, inverted images of a single object can arise from interference and focussing
  of the incident and reflected wavefronts near the boundary of total reflection. Raman's work, which is entirely based
  on wave theory, suggests the interaction of wavefronts within a refracting layer as a mechanism in mirage formation.

</p>
<p>
  The occurrence of focussing and interference in situations that give rise to mirage, examined specifically by Raman,
  is also evident from various investigations based on geometrical optics. For example, the crossing of light rays
  mentioned in connection with image inversion implies interference of wavefronts at the points of intersection.

</p>
<p>
  The visual effects from focussing and interference must be considered in particular when plane-parallel radiation
  (radiation from a very distant source) is incident on a layer of total reflection. In this case, there is a constant
  crossing of light rays within a relatively narrow region of the refracting layer, as illustrated in Fig. 12 (for the
  sake of clarity, height and elevation angles are exaggerated). In Fig. 12, a circular collimated light-beam of
  diameter A is incident on the lower boundary of a temperature-inversion layer at angle equal to or exceeding the
  critical angle for total reflection. Interference of the incident and reflected wavefronts occurs in a selected layer
  near the level of total reflection. This layer, shaded in Fig. 12, has a maximum thickness <i>B</i>, which is
  dependent on <i>A</i>. In the absence of absorption, the amount of radiant energy, flowing per unit time through <i>Pi·A<sup>2</sup></i>
  equals that flowing through <i>Pi·B<sup>2</sup></i>. When <i>B</i> is less than <i>A</i>, the energy density at
  <i>B</i> is larger than at <i>A</i>, so that the brightness of the refracted light beam increases in the layer of
  interference.</p>

  <p>An example of the ratio of <i>A</i> to <i>B</i> can be Given with the aid of Eq. (3). It is assumed that the
    optical refractive index through the inversion layer varies from

    <nobr>
      <i>n<sub>o</sub></i> = 1,00029 à<i> n</i> = 1,00026
    </nobr>

    according to

    <nobr>
      <i>n</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>n</i><sub>o</sub><sup>2</sup> - z.
    </nobr>

    When the angle of incidence is near the critical angle for total reflection

    <nobr>
      (Theta<sub>o</sub> ~ 89.5°),
    </nobr>

    the light rays within the inversion layer are parabolas and the level of total reflection coincides with the upper
    boundary of the inversion layer. Under these conditions, it can be shown that

    <i>B/A = A/16H</i> where <i>H</i> is the thickness of the temperature-inversion layer. When the diameter <i>A</i> of
    the incident light beam is less than 16<i>H</i>, <i>B</i> is less than <i>A</i> and a brightening or focussing
    occurs near the top of the inversion. When the angle of incidence of the light beam is larger than the critical
    angle, ~89.5°, the level of total reflection lies below the upper boundary of the inversion layer. In this case,
    brightening can still occur near the level of total reflection, but the restrictions on the required beam-diameter
    become rather severe. The above example, based on a special case, demonstrates that sudden brightening can be
    encountered near the upper boundary of a refracting layer <i>when optical mirages are associated with a refracting
      layer that is thick with respect to the diameter of the incident light beam from a distant source and when the
      angle of incidence is near the critical angle</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Observations of the brightening phenomenon must be considered rare in view of the selective location of its
    occurrence within the temperature-inversion layer and the requirement of plane-parallel incident radiation.
    Upper-level inversions seem most likely to produce the phenomenon. Some photographs showing apparent brightening of
    "spike" reflections on the edge of the setting sun are shown in O'Connell (1958, c.f., p. 158).

    </table><p>Microscopic effects due to interference of wavefronts within the area of brightening are illustrated in
    Fig. 13. Wavefronts are indicated rather than light rays. Unless absorption is extremely large, light rays are
    normal to the wavefront. A train of plane-parallel waves is assumed incident on the lower boundary of a refracting
    layer in which the refractive-index decreases with height. When the angle of incidence equals the critical angle,
    the incident waves are refracted upon entering the refracting layer and are totally reflected at the upper boundary
    The crests and troughs of the waves are indicated by solid lines and dashed lines, respectively. At the upper
    boundary, the wavefronts of the incident and reflected waves converge to a focus. The focus is called a cusp. The
    upper boundary of the refracting layer resembles a caustic, i.e., an envelope of the moving cusps of the propagating
    wavefronts. Because of the focussing of wavefronts, a large concentration of radiant energy is usually found along
    the caustic (see Raman, 1959). In the area where the incoming and outgoing wavefronts interact, destructive
    interference is found along <i>AA'</i> and <i>CC'</i> (troughs meeting crests), while constructive interference is
    found along <i>BB'</i> (incident and reflected waves have similar phase). Hence, brightness variations can be
    expected in the interference layer, as demonstrated by Sir C. V. Raman (1959). To what extent the microscopic
    effects from interference and focussing can be observed under actual atmospheric conditions of mirage is not known.
    Undoubtedly, the proper relation between refracting layer and distant light source must be combined with an
    observer's position near the upper boundary of the refracting layer. If the dark and bright bands in the area of
    interference can be observed, the observer could easily get the impression that he is viewing a rapidly oscillating
    light or a light that is drawing near and moving away at rapid intervals. Nighttime observations by airplane are
    most likely to provide proper evidence of this effect.</p>
    <p>
      Currently, the focussing and interference effects are the least explored and consequently the least discussed of
      the various aspects associated with optical mirage.
