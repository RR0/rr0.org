  Due to the wavelength dependence of the optical refractive index, systematic refraction of white light leads to a
  separation of the composing colors. <i>Visible effects of color separation are most frequently associated with
  astronomical refraction.</i> In this case, the light enters the atmosphere at an upper boundary where <i>n</i>
  approaches unity for all wavelengths. At an observation site near sea level <i>n</i> is wavelength-dependent, so that
  from the upper boundary of the atmosphere to the observation site the individual color components are refracted at
  different angles. The basic composing color of white light Mai be assumed to be red (24%), green (38%), and
  blue-violet 38%); the red is refracted less than the green, while the green is refracted less than the blue-violet.
  The visual effects of color separation depend on the zenith angle of the extraterrestrial light source. When a white
  light source is more than 50° above the horizon, the color separation is simply too small to be resolved by the eye.
  Close to the horizon it can be observed only in the case of very small light sources. The principle of color
  separation in astronomical refraction is illustrated in Fig. 14. The light from an extended source enters the top of
  the atmosphere and is separated with respect to color in the order red, green, blue, and violet. A bundle of light
  rays of diameter <i>D</i> can be selected for which all colors, upon refraction, converge at <i>O</i>. Hence, an
  observer at <i>O</i> sees the entire color mixture as white. When the extended source has a diameter larger than
  <i>D</i>, an area rather than a single point of color blending is formed. However, when the diameter of the source
  becomes less than <i>D</i>, the point of color convergence, <i>O</i>, recedes from the location of the observer. Now
  the observer begins to see a gradual refractive separating of color such that red tends to lie below green, and green
  tends to lie below blue-violet (see Fig. 14).</p>

  </table><p>The diameter of the light beam from a given extraterrestrial source decreases with respect to an
  earth-bound observer, with increasing distance from the zenith, as illustrated in Fig. 14. Thus, when the zenith angle
  increases, the <i>apparent</i> diameter <i>D</i> of the light source decreases rapidly to a minimum value on the
  horizon. Hence, the chance of having a light source of diameter less than <i>D</i> is greatest on the horizon. <i>Therefore,
    color separation is observed most frequently on the horizon, when the light source is reduced to a bright point like
    a star or a minute portion of the solar or lunar disc.</i> A prominent example of the visible effects of color
  separation is the so-called Green Flash. This phenomenon is sometimes observed when the sun disappears in a clear sky
  below a distant horizon. The last star-like point can then be seen to change rapidly from pale yellow or orange, to
  green, and finally, blue, or at least a bluish-green. The vividness of the green, when the sky is exceptionally clear,
  together with its almost instant appearance and extremely short duration, has given rise to the name "green flash" for
  this phenomenon.</p>
  <p>
    The same gamut of colors, only in reverse order, occasionally is seen at sunrise. The observations of the Green
    Flash require an unusually clear atmosphere such that the sun is yellowish, and not red, as it begins to sink below
    the horizon. A red setting sun means that the blue and green portions of the spectrum are relatively strongly
    attenuated by the atmosphere and hence indicates that conditions are not favorable for seeing the greenish segment.
    Thus, the meteorological conditions required for observing color separation are even more stringent than those
    required for observing optical mirages. Examples of color separation associated with astronomical refraction are
    given on the following page in excerpts from <i>The Marine Observateur</i>.

  </p>

    In terrestrial refraction the composing colors of white light are very seldom separated to the extent that the
    effects can be observed with the naked eye. When the wavelength dependence of the refractive index is put back into
    Eq. (4),</p>

    Hence, for a given temperature inversion, the refractive index (<i>n</i>) decreases somewhat faster with height (<i>z</i>)
    for

    <i>Lambda</i> = 0.4µ

    (blue) than for

    <i>Lambda</i> = 0.7µ

    (red), so that the blue rays are refracted more than the red rays. However, the difference is generally too small to
    be resolved by the eye. Only under very special conditions can a visible effect be imagined. For example, when a
    100-m-thick inversion layer is assumed to be associated with a

    <i>Delta</i>·T = 30°C,

    the change of the refractive index for blue light and red light is respectively,</p>
  <p><em><strong>&Delta;n(0,4&micro;) &asymp; 3,01x10<sup>-5</sup></strong></em></p>
  <p>et</p>
  <p><em><strong>&Delta;n(0,7&micro;) &asymp; 2,93x10<sup>-5</sup></strong></em></p>
  <p>
    When the optical refractive indices at the lower boundary of the inversion are</p>
  <p><em><strong>n<sub>0</sub>(0,4&micro;) &asymp; 1,000282</strong></em></p>
  <p>et</p>
  <p><em><strong>n<sub>0</sub>(0,7&micro;) &asymp; 1,000275</strong></em></p>
  <p>
    (corresponding to <i>P</i> =1013.3 mb and T = 15°C), values at the upper boundary are :</p>
  <p><em><strong>n<sub>0</sub>(0,4&micro;) &asymp; 1,000252</strong></em></p>
  <p>et</p>
  <p><em><strong>n<sub>0</sub>(0,7&micro;) &asymp; 1,000246</strong></em></p>
  <p>
    When white light is incident at the lower boundary of the inversion at an angle <i>Phi<sub>o</sub></i> such that

            28th Janvier, 1956. At sunset the sun, when half a diameter above the horizon, became lemon-coloured,
            although the shape remained normal. The final visible segment of the sun turned to a vivid electric blue.
            Visibility excellent. The sky after sunset was colourful with great clarity of cloud shapes and colours.

            <i>Note</i>. The name of this phenomenon at sunset or sunrise is the "green flash ", green being the colour
            most usually seen. It would not be practicable to name it according to the colour observed, as these
            comprise various shades of green and blue, also purple or violet. We have had more observations of blue,
            purple or violet flashes in recent years. While these colours are admittedly much less frequently seen than
            various shades of green, it does appear that they are not as rare as was form ly supposed; a probable
            explanation of this is that more observers are now watching for the phenomenon.

            3 Décembre 1950, 17 h 55 (GMT). Jupiter on setting showed a red spot on the side nearest to the horizon. The
            spot was visible through binoculars and telescope but not to the naked eye. The sky was clear in the
            vicinity and the phenomenon was visible from the time that the planet was 20° above the horizon.

            <i>Note</i>. When abnormal refraction is present the light of stars or planets near the horizon tends to be
            elongated into a short spectrum with the red nearest the horizon and the green and blue farthest from the
            horizon. Many varieties of phenomena result, especially in the case of the bright planets Jupiter and Venus;
            these are more often seen with binoculars than with unaided vision. At times the planet Mai appear double,
            one red and one green, or the colour of the planet Mai change from red to green. In cases of extreme
            refraction the planet Mai be seen to "swim" out with a lateral motion, accompanied by changes of colour,
            usually from red to green, with momentary returns to the normal colour of the planet. The green flash of
            sunrise or sunset is an example of the same thing; the uppermost green image of the sun limb is visible for
            a fraction of a second after the sun has set.

    89° 33' 30" to 89° 33' 54", are illustrated in Fig. 15. It is assumed that the white-light source is far away so
    that the incident rays are near parallel. For <i>Phi</i> ~ 89° 33' 30" the blue rays are totally reflected but the
    red rays penetrate the upper boundary of the inversion. When <i>Phi<sub>o</sub></i> varies from 89° 33' 30" to 89°
    33' 54" the red rays are alternately transmitted and totally reflected. Hence, an observer near <i>A</i> Mai see an
    elevated image that is alternately bluish and white, while an observer at <i>B</i> Mai see a reddish image that
    disappears and reappears. The small fluctuation in <i>Phi<sub>o</sub></i> can be produced by atmospheric turbulence
    or short-period changes in the lower boundary of the inversion. Color changes from red to green that frequently
    occur when distant lights are observed can be similarly explained. In general, visible color separation is the
    result of a combined action of random and systematic atmospheric refraction.

  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, unusual color effects that can be observed with the unaided eye can be associated with mirage phenomena.
    Occurrence of these effects, however, must be considered unusual in view of the special set of circumstances
    required for their development.
