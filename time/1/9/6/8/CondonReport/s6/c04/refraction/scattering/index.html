  An apparent optical image formed by light scattered out of a beam by a thin haze layer may be mistaken for a mirage.
  The theory of optical propagation in a scattering, attenuating atmosphere is well covered by Middleton (1952), an
  excellent reference containing much material on vision and the visibility of objects seen through the atmosphere.

</p>
<p>
  The luminance or brightness, B, in e.g. lumens/m<sup>2</sup> , of an extended object or optical source is invariant
  with distance except for losses due to scattering or absorption along the propagation path. Except under conditions of
  heavy fog, clouds, or smog, absorption is small compared to scattering, and Mai be neglected. If the scattering
  coefficient per unit length, <i>O</i> , is constant, attenuation of a light source of intrinsic brightness B is given
  by</p>
<center>
  <img alt="Attenuation" src="../../s6c04e55.gif">
</center>

<p>
  where R is the distance of range travelled by the light from the source to the point of observation. The portion of
  brightness lost by scattering out of the path is given by</p>
<center>
  <img alt="Brightness Loss" src="../../s6c04e56.gif">
</center>

<p>
  this loss represents light that is scattered in all directions by the molecules of air and aerosol particles present
  in the propagation path. Secondary scattering is neglected.

</p>
<p>
  The quantity <i>Sigma</i>·R is often called the optical depth of an atmospheric layer, although it is a dimensionless
  quantity. Thus for thin layers where <i>Sigma</i>·R is small, the scattered light flux, F, in e.g. lumens, is</p>
<center>
  <img alt="Scattered Light (Lumens)" src="../../s6c04e57.gif">
</center>

<p>
  where F is the light flux incident on the layer.</p>
<p>
  The intensity, <i>I<sub>s</sub></i> or light flux per unit solid angle, of the light scattered from a small volume of
  air, <i>v</i>, is the product of the incident light lfux, <i>F<sub>o</sub></i>, the volume scattering function, <i>Beta'(Phi)</i>,
  and the average thickness of the volume. The scattering angle, <i>Phi</i>, is defined in Fig. 16. The intensity of
  light scattered at an angle <i>Phi</i> with respect to the incident beam is usually defined in terms of the incident
  illuminance, <i>E</i>, or flux per unit area in e.g., lumens/m<sup>2</sup> on an element of volume <i>dv</i>. This
  results in</p>

<p>
  hence,</p>
<center>
  <img alt="Intensity Function, Integrated" src="../../s6c04e59.gif">
</center>

<p>
  which, in the case of a small scattering volume where <i>E</i> and <i>Beta'(Phi)</i> Mai be considered nearly constant
  over the entire volume, reduces to</p>
<center>
  <img alt="Intensity Func, Small Scattering Vol" src="../../s6c04e60.gif">
</center>

<p>
  The units of <i>Beta'(Phi)</i> are typically lumens scattered per unit solid angle per unit volume per lumen incident
  light per unit area; <i>I(Phi)</i> then is expressed in candles, a unit of light intensity equal to one lumen per
  steradian. The volume scattering function is normalized by</p>

<p>
  hence for an isotropic scatterer, for which</p>

  </table><p>As an example of a scattering situation, consider a very clear atmosphere with a total vertical optical
  depth of 0.2; this is about twice the optical depth of a standard atmosphere of pure air (Middleton, (1952). The
  linear scattering coefficient, <i>Phi</i>, for this atmosphere will be about 2x10<sup>-5</sup> m<sup>-1</sup> near the
  ground. Assume that a haze layer one meter in thickness and with an optical depth of 0.02 exists at 100 m above the
  ground; the total optical depth of the composite atmosphere will be 0.22. The value of <i>Sigma</i> appropriate to the
  haze layer is 2x10<sup>-2</sup> m<sup>-1</sup>, a factor of 10<sup>3</sup> greater than for the "clear" atmosphere
  above and below.</p>
  <p>
    To an observer on the ground, the additional extinction of light caused by the presence of the haze layer, amounting
    to only 1.6% of the incident light from a source near the zenith, would not be perceptible except possibly very
    close to the horizon. However, light scattered out of an intense beam by the haze layer could be easily visible.
    Assume that a fairly powerful light source is aimed straight up from the ground; taking as typical values, e.g., for
    an automobile sealed beam unit, an intensity, <i>I<sub>o</sub></i>, of 3x10<sup>4</sup> candles (30,000 candlepower)
    and a beam width of 6°, the light flux <i>F<sub>o</sub></i> incident on the layer at h = 100 m is 236 lumens,
    neglecting attenuation in the air below the layer. The beam solid angle, <i>w<sub>o</sub></i>, is
    7.85xl0<sup>-3</sup> steradians. The incident illuminance, <i>E<sub>o</sub></i>, on the layer is</p>
  <center>
    <img alt="Illuminance" src="../../s6c04e69.gif">
  </center>

  <p>
    where the illuminated area,

    <i>A = w<sub>o</sub>h<sup>2</sup></i>,

    is 78.5m<sup>2</sup>. The scattering volume, <i>v</i>, is 78.5m<sup>3</sup> since the layer is one meter thick, and
    the intensity of the scattered light is</p>
  <center>
    <img alt="Scattered Light Intensity" src="../../s6c04e70.gif">
  </center>

  <p>
    If an observer is located 100 m from the light source, he will observe the scattered light at a distance of ~140 m
    and a scattering angle, <i>Phi</i>, of 135°. The apparent source of the scattered light will appear to be
    elliptical, roughly 4° wide and 3° high, and will present an area normal to the observer, <i>A<sub>n</sub></i>, of
    62.6 m<sup>2</sup>. The value of f(<i>Phi</i>) for a strongly scattering medium at <i>Phi</i> = 135° is about 0.2;
    therefore the light <i>I<sub>s</sub></i> scattered toward the observer is approximately 7.5x10<sup>-2</sup> candles,
    and the apparent brightness, <i>B</i>, of the scattering volume will be</p>
  <center>
    <img alt="Scattering Volume Brightness" src="../../s6c04e71.gif">
  </center>

  <p>
    A fairly dark, moonless night sky has a background brightness, <i>B<sub>b</sub></i> of about 10<sup>-3</sup>
    c/m<sup>2</sup>; the scattered image would therefore have a total brightness of ~2.2x10<sup>-3</sup> c/m<sup>2</sup>
    and a contrast against the night sky of</p>
  <center>
    <img alt="Contrast" src="../../s6c04e72.gif">
  </center>

  <p>
    At this background brightness, data given by Middleton (1952) show that the contrast required for 50% probability of
    detection for an object of 3°-4° diameter is about 5.7x10<sup>-2</sup>; thus the image hypothesized in this example
    would have a brightness about 20 times greater than the minimum detectable, and would no doubt be easily visible as
    a pale, glowing, elliptical object.

  </p>
  <p>
    In contrast, the air immediately above and below the haze layer with

    <nobr>
      <i>Sigma</i> = 2x10<sup>-5</sup> m<sup>-1</sup>
    </nobr>

    and

    <nobr>
      f(<i>Phi</i>) ~ 1.1
    </nobr>

    at

    <nobr>
      <i>Phi</i> = 135°
    </nobr>

    would yield a scattered brightness of only about 6.6x10<sup>-6</sup> c/m<sup>2</sup> per meter thickness. The
    contrast against the night sky of the light scattered from the beam above or below the layer would therefore be on
    the order of

    7x10<sup>-3</sup>, which is not detectable with a background brightness of 10<sup>-3</sup> c/m<sup>2</sup> according
    to Middleton (1952).

  </p>
  <p>
    Increasing the background brightness to 10<sup>-2</sup> c/m<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to a bright, moonlit night,
    would decrease the contrast of the scattered image to 1.2x10<sup>-1</sup>, which is about six times the minimum
    detectable contrast at that background brightness and the image would therefore still constitute a fairly obvious
    (object). Perception of light scattered from the rest of the beam under this increased background brightness, with

    <nobr>
      <i>Epsilon</i> = 6.6x10<sup>-4</sup>,
    </nobr>

    would be out of the question.

  </p>
  <p>
    The level of background brightness for which the contrast of the image in this example would be reduced to the point
    where there is only a 50% probability of detection by an observer looking in the right direction is roughly 10<sup>-1</sup>
    c/m<sup>2</sup>; this value corresponds to the brightness of a clear sky about 1/2 hour after sunset.

  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, scattering of light from sources of small beam width by localized haze layers in the lower atmosphere Mai
    cause the appearance of diffuse, glowing patches of light, moving with movement of the light source, that could
    easily be interpreted as a UFO by an observer unfamiliar with such phenomena. Data given by Middleton (1952) show
    that with common light sources and under average nighttime sky conditions, the main beam of light could easily be
    imperceptible by scattered light, while at the same time the light scattered from a haze patch or layer would be
    easily visible to an observer; thus the source of the UFO-like image would not be apparent.</p>
