<h2><a id="s1"></a>Introduction</h2>


<p>
  Les observateurs d'objets volants non identifiés signalent une variété d'effets sonores associés au phénomène.
  Certains rapportent un son pointu, explosif lors d'une accélération rapide ou d'un vol à haute vitesse. D'autres font
  référence à un son de ronflement, de whining ou de vrombissement alors que l'ovni stationne ou se déplace à des
  vitesses relativement basses (Hall, 1964). D'autres encore mentionnent des sons de sifflement ou de swishing suggérant
  un déplacement d'air.

</p>
<p>
  More remarkable than any of the foregoing, however, are reports that describe the UFO as moving at velocities far in
  excess of the maximum speed of sound in the earth's atmosphere without producing any noise or shock wave that would
  normally be expected under such conditions of atmospheric displacement. No characteristic "boom" is heard in these
  instances.

</p>
<p>
  The absence of a sonic boom in these cases remains a mystery. Possible explanations are that:

</p>
<ol type="a">

  <li>
    actual speed was overestimated;

  </li><li>
  a natural atmospheric effect that could suppress the sonic boom was present; or

</li><li>
  the object or phenomenon did not displace the atmospheric gases through which it was passing at supersonic speeds.

</li></ol>

<p>
  In this chapter we shall present the basic concepts involved in the production of the sonic boom or shock wave
  resulting from the passage of an object through the atmosphere at speeds greater than that of sound at the altitude of
  flight. Natural effects that are theoretically capable of rendering such shock waves inaudible at ground level will
  also be discussed, as will current research aimed at suppression of sonic booms by aircraft design modification and
  other means.

</p>
<p>
  In general, it would be unrewarding to analyze each UFO report in conjunction with meteorological data to determine if
  a sonic boom from a particular object flying at supersonic speed would be heard at ground level. The difficulties are
  two-fold: first, the existing state of knowledge concerning meteorological effects on sonic booms is sufficient only
  to provide information in terms of statistical probabilities (Roberts, 1967); and second, local meteorological

  features which occur between weather observing stations and/or which occur between the times of scheduled observations
  would not be observed.

<p>Sound waves are a manifestation of the compressibility of air. A source capable of compressing air produces pressure
  fluctuations, called sound or compression waves, which travel through the atmosphere. The peaks and troughs of the
  waves correspond to maxima and minima of the pressure fluctuations. The leading edge of the wave or wave front is
  approximately spherical in shape, and the pressure disturbance propagates away from the source in a series of
  concentric spheres. The speed of propagation of these waves, the sound speed, varies with the temperature and pressure
  of the air through which the waves travel. The maximum value for speed of sound waves is generally at ground level and
  reaches about 760 mph. The sound speed may show considerable variation in the atmosphere, alternately decreasing and
  increasing with altitude. A minimum value of 580 mph is reached at approximately 50 miles above the earth's surface.
  However, these values are principally a function of altitude, but they also vary with the time of day, season and
  latitude and longitude. The following are approximate average values:</p>
<figure class="right side">
  <figcaption>
    Figure 1a - Shock waves created by the passage through the air of a supersonic airplane coalesce into two large
    cone-shaped shock fronts, shown here in cross section, that are carried along with the airplane. Each front is a
    region of compressed air that creates a distinct "pressure jump" at the ground. The changes in atmospheric pressure
    are heard by an observer as two sonic booms in succession.</caption>
    <td><img alt="Figure 1" height="479" src="s6c06f1a.jpg" width="851"></td>
    </tr></table><p>Pressure disturbances are generated whenever a body, such as an airplane, moves through the
    atmosphere and displaces the air around it. In subsonic flight the speed of the aircraft is less than the local
    sound speed and the wave disturbances propagate away from the plane in all directions. These pressure variations are
    generally weak and too slowly varying to be detected by the ear (Carlson, 1966).

  </p>
    <p>
      An aircraft traveling at supersonic speeds moves faster than the pressure disturbances it generates. When this
      occurs the plane is always ahead of the wave front and the spherical waves emitted at successive points alongthe
      flight path become tangent to lines sloping backward from the bow of the plane. These lines form a cone, the
      surface of which is the shock wave. Shock waves are formed by each protuberance on the plane's exterior. However,
      with distance, the various shock fronts tend to coalesce into two large shock fronts, usually attributed to the
      bow and to the tail of the plane. Fig. 1a shows how the fronts intersect level ground from a hypothetical flight
      path parallel to the ground surface at constant sound speed and with no wind. The indicated abrupt pressure rise
      and fall is responsible for the sonic booms heard at the earth's surface. Two booms will be heard as the "bow" and
      "tail" shocks successively pass over an observer but the ear may not always register the separate shocks when they
      are of different intensities (Carlson, 1966) or when the observer is taken by surprise.</p>
    <p>The ratio of aircraft speed to the sound speed at its altitude is called the Mach number. The limiting value at
      which no sonic boom is heard, because of atmospheric effects, is called the cutoff Mach number (Wilson, 1962).
      Studies made by Wilson (1962), &gt;Kane (1966) and Roberts (1967) have established that the cutoff Mach number
      ranges roughly between about 1.0 and 1.3 depending on atmospheric conditions and the altitude of the plane. This
      means that sonic booms produced by objects moving faster than 1.3 times the sound speed should be heard at ground
      level.</p>
    <figure class="left side">
      <figcaption>
        Figure 1b - Sonic Boom arises because a supersonic airplane moves faster than the pressure disturbances, or
        sound waves, it propagates. A stationary source (<i>left</i>) emits spherical sound waves that move outward like
        concentric ripples. If the source moves less that the speed of sound (<i>middle</i>), waves emitted at
        successive positions are crowded in the direction of movement. They overtake the moving source and "warn" the
        air of its approach. But disturbances from the earlier emissions of a supersonic source (<i>right</i>) cannot
        overtake the source, which arrives without warning and creates a shock wave. The spheres become tangent to the
        sides of the shock wave cone.</caption>

        </tr></table><p>The angle between the shock front and the ground becomes smaller as the aircraft speed increases
        relative to the sound speed. In this situation the sonic boom may not be heard at ground level until the plane
        has passed from view. Wilson (1962) has estimated that the plane may be as much as 25 miles away from the point
        on the ground where the sonic boom is heard.</p>
        <h2><a id="s3"></a>Effets atmosphériques sur la propagation du bang sonique</h2>
        <p>
          When the actual wind and temperature variations that occur in the atmosphere are taken into account, the
          simple conical pattern of the shock front may become quite distorted. The sound speed generally decreases with
          altitude between the ground and the plane. Therefore, as a propagating shock wave descends toward the ground,
          the portion of the wave front closest to the earth moves faster than the portions above. If the sound speed
          decreases sufficiently rapidly with altitude, the wave front may become perpendicular to the ground. In this
          situation the shock never reaches the ground because it begins to travel parallel to the ground before it gets
          there (Carlson, 1966). Physical requirements for such an effect, however, are unlikely, even under extremely
          abnormal atmospheric conditions. In any event, an object moving through the atmosphere at any altitude
          parallel to. the earth's surface, at a speed greater than the speed of sound at ground level would inevitably
          produce a sonic boom.

        </p>
        <p>
          The decrease of sound speed with altitude also affects the portion of the wave front that spreads out to the
          sides of the plane. An investigation of the effect by Kane (1966), under conditions of no wind, shows that the
          lateral extent of the sonic boom at ground level ranges from about 10 to 35 miles on either side of the ground
          track of the plane. Furthermore, the intensity of the shock wave will be diminished as it spreads out.
          Consequently the boom will become less intense on either side of the flight track.

        </p>
        <p>
          When wind is present, the wave front progresses at a rate which is the sum of the sound speed and the wind
          speed. Therefore the effect on the wave front by the temperature decrease is counteracted if a tail wind
          increases with altitude. If a tail wind decreases with altitude the distortion of the wave front caused by the
          temperature variation is reinforced, while a head wind produces the opposite effect. The situation becomes
          more complicated when the horizontal variations of wind and temperature are considered.</p>
        <p>
          Other atmospheric features could produce unusual sonic boom patterns at the ground. Among these are: turbulent
          air motions in the lowest few thousand feet of the atmosphere, the type of clouds present and their spatial
          distribution, and temperature inversions. None of these meteorological phenomena have been studied in
          sufficient detail to produce conclusive results about their effects on sonic booms. However preliminary
          investigations have been reported (Roberts, 1967).
        </p>
        <h2><a id="s4"></a>Design Modifications and Maneuvers</h2>
        <p>
          Although various government agencies, industrial organizations and university research projects are currently
          engaged in seeking methods to reduce sonic boom intensities, all known practical supersonic airplane designs
          will produce sonic booms (National Academy of Sciences, 1967). Furthermore, according to the Academy report,
          "The possibility that unconventional configurations may be devised which will yield significant reductions
          cannot be disallowed but, at present, the future must be viewed in terms of small reductions obtained through
          better understanding of theory, design refinements of conventional aircraft and improvements in propulsive
          efficiency and operating procedures." Research efforts are continuing in an effort to find an unconventional
          design, with practical aerodynamic. characteristics, which would minimize or eliminate the sonic boom.

        </p>
        <p>
          The various research efforts to suppress sonic boom intensities which are under investigation are reviewed
          below.

        </p>
        <p>
          The pressure distribution at ground level, shown in Fig. la and lb is the so-called "farfield" signature. The
          shock fronts emanating from protuberances on the aircraft have little effect on the pressure pulse at ground
          level. The sonic boom can be reduced, but not necessarily eliminated, if the aircraft climbs at subsonic
          speeds before making the transition to supersonic speeds at high-altitude cruising levels. Optimization of the
          arrangement of the various components, such as the shape and position of the wings, may lessen sonic boom
          intensity. Long, slender and blended configurations appear to offer the best compromise between maximum
          aerodynamic performance and low sonic boom levels. Reduction of the peak pressures at ground level by design
          modifications is also being attempted. For example, a "stretched" design would alter the point at which the
          various waves form a bow and tail shock. With this type of design a less rapid rate of pressure rise would be
          produced at ground level and consequently a less audible boom would result (McLean, 1966; NAS, 1967).

        </p>
        <p>
          Aircraft accelerations and maneuvers at various altitudes cause sonic booms of varying intensities in localize
          regions at or above ground level. It is possible, during common flight maneuvers, to produce local pressure
          buildups which may be more than twice as large as those produced by the same aircraft in level, unaccelerated
          flight. The subsequent "superbooms" occur at isolated points at ground level in contrast to the ordinary booms
          that move with the aircraft. Limitations on rapid accelerations and maneuvers would reduce the intensity and
          frequency of "superbooms" but could not be expected to suppress sonic booms altogether (Maglieri, 1966).

        </p>
        <p>
          In subsonic flight, pressure disturbances propagate ahead of the aircraft altering the airstream in such a way
          that abrupt pressure changes do not occur. In supersonic flight however, pressure disturbances cannot
          propagate ahead. In order to prevent the buildup of a shock wave in supersonic flight, the Northrup
          Corporation is currently working on a method to modify the airstream through an electromagnetic force field
          concentrated at the nose of the aircraft. This work is still in preliminary stages and experiments have only
          been undertaken in wind tunnels (Aviation Week and Space Technology, 1968).
        </p>
        <h2><a id="s5"></a>Commentaires</h2>
        <p>
          Although sonic boom research has progressed rapidly since the early 1950's, the complete suppression of sonic
          booms at ground level by means of present technology does not appear imminent. This does not mean that sonic
          booms are always heard in conjunction with supersonic flight. Some meteorological factors occasionally could
          reduce sonic boom intensities or, even more rarely, prevent sonic booms from reaching the ground at all.
          However, the reported total absence of sonic booms from UFOs in supersonic flight and undergoing rapid
          accelerations or intricate maneuvers, particularly near the earth's surface, cannot be explained on the basis
          of current knowledge. On the contrary, intense sonic booms are expected under such conditions.
