<h2><a id="s1"></a>Types de ballons</h2>
<p>
  Three kinds of balloons can give rise to UFO sightings: neoprene or rubber balloons which expand during ascent from
  six feet to 30 ft. in diameter; polyethylene balloons which are partially inflated on the ground and fill out at float
  altitude to a diameter of 100 ft. to 400 ft.; and small super-pressure balloons called "ghost" balloons.</p>
<h3> Ballons de néoprène
</h3>
<p>
  When neoprene or rubber balloons which are used to carry radiosondes begin their ascent, they have a diameter of six
  feet. They continue to expand as they rise, and the balloons that reach an altitude of 140000 ft. are 55 ft. in
  diameter. All of these balloons shatter when they reach a volume at which a weakness develops. One of these balloons
  has flown as high as 156,000 ft., higher than the largest polyethylene balloons. These balloons are used to make
  measurements of air temperature, humidity, and winds. Approximately 90% of the neoprene balloons reach 80000 ft.;
  probably 50% of them reach 100000 ft. The neoprene balloon at any altitude has a brighter reflectance than either the
  polyethylene or the "ghost" balloon. It is opaque on the ground. As it rises and expands, its skin becomes thinner and
  reflects and scatters light. They are used in quite large numbers in many places for routine observation because of
  their low cost. About 100000 of these a year are flown in the United States, with most launches at scheduled times
  from airports and military installations. During their ascent up to 20000 ft., the neoprene balloons are visible to
  the naked eye during the daytime, but once they attain an altitude of 20000 ft. or higher they cannot be seen from the
  ground.</p>
<h3>Ballons à super-pression</h3>
<p>
  The other small balloons are the super-pressure "ghost" balloons. In general these have payloads of a few grams. The
  balloons are usually

  spherical and size is a function of altitude; five feet in diameter at 20000 ft., seven feet at 40000 ft., ten feet at
  60000 ft. A few larger balloons have been flown at higher altitudes. Over 300 super- pressure balloons have been flown
  in the Southern Hemisphere. Several balloons have flown for over 300 days in the Southern Hemisphere with two balloons
  still flying which have been in the air for more than 11 mo. Not more than 20 long duration flights have been made in
  the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<h3>Ballons de polyéthylène</h3>
<p>
  At launch polyethylene balloons are filled with a gas bubble varying from 20 - 70 ft. in diameter. Twenty feet of gas
  will lift a small balloon to 100000 ft. A 70-ft. bubble is required to carry the Stratoscope II with a 7,000-lb.
  telescope. Scientists flying this type of balloon usually want to attain altitudes between 80000 and 120000 ft. to
  gather data on atmospheric radiation or composition. The "cosmic ray community" is the largest user of "ghost"
  balloons. The diameter of these balloons at altitude is anywhere from 60 - 250 ft. The 250-ft. size is for the
  Stratoscope II system. The largest balloons, those approximating 300 ft., are designed for very high altitudes. The
  largest balloon that has been flown to date holds 2.6 x 10^7 cu. ft. of gas and-is just under 400 ft. in diameter.
  There are a large number of 10000000 cu. ft. balloons being flown approximately half from Palestine, Tex. A few years
  ago the most common balloon was the 3000000 cu. ft. size.
</p>
<h2><a id="s2"></a>Visibilité</h2>
<p>
  The relative visibility of a balloon depends on its type, size, material, time-of-day, and altitude. The human eye can
  usually detect a balloon against a bright sky background when the intercepted arc is 0.5 mil or greater. The
  radiosonde balloon is visible in daylight to a distance of two to four miles. During ascent, the "ghost" balloon is
  visible against the bright sky background at a distance of about two miles. At altitude the intercepted arc of "ghost"
  balloon varies from between 0.2 - 0.6 mil. The polyethylene balloon provides a target of one to two mils at
  altitude.</p>
<p>
  The large polyethylene balloons absorb about 5% of sunlight; however, they scatter and reradiate as much as 20 - 30%
  of the inci- dent light. This scattering is very much a function of angle. Polyethylene balloons are always visible at
  altitude during daylight hours when the sky is clear. It is often difficult to focus the eyes on the balloon, but once
  seen it is easy to relocate the balloon. The "ghost" balloon is not visible above 20,000 ft. during daylight hours.

</p><p>
  Polyethylene balloons are shaped more like a pear than a sphere, although they always appear spherical from the ground
  to the naked eye. Glass fiber tapes affixed to the gore seams are used to strengthen polyethylene balloons carrying
  heavy payloads. Observed from the ground through a telescope, a shell effect gives a taped balloon a saucer-like
  appearance. The tape itself, which is the basic reflecting element, is quite shiny and reflects well. On very lightly
  loaded systems the balloons are tapeless; heavier loads require the glass fiber tapes. As seen through the telescope,
  then, the taped balloons appear much shinier and are distinguished by their scalloped appearance.</p>
<h2><a id="s3"></a>Derelicts and cutdown</h2>
<p>
  Another phenomenon that might be witnessed by an observer during the day is what is known as the "cutting down" of a
  balloon. When the decision has been made to terminate a balloon's flight, the tracking aircraft will send a destruct
  signal to the balloon's control and command mechanism and a squib will fire. This will detach the payload and shatter
  the balloon. The payload is then tracked by the plane as it parachutes to the ground. Occasionally, however, the
  balloon will not shatter.

</p>
<p>
  The shattering of a balloon during payload detachment is easily visible (especially in the late afternoon or early
  morning). However, the entire operation is not. The payload chute is only 60 ft. in diameter so that it is barely
  visible. The tracking plane which sends the destruct signal may be 30 - 40 mi. away from the balloon. The "cutting
  down" of a balloon is usually accomplished one or two hours before sunset or just after dawn so that the pilot can
  visually track the parachute down. When the balloon does shatter, a large part of the balloon comes down in one piece
  as a flapping mass. There is little side motion or apparent hovering. Its speed of decent depends on how the balloon
  breaks up.

</p>
<p>
  With improved balloon materials, there were a number of cases in 1966 where the balloon did not shatter but continued
  its ascent. Normally, if the balloon does not shatter, it should rise so fast after the shock that the gas does not
  escape rapidly enough to prevent bursting. Occasionally the balloon will begin to stretch, and if there is no weakness
  in it, the balloon could remain aloft at that higher altitude for four or five days. It might fly at 130000 or 140000
  ft. until sunset at which time the gas will cool, reducing the volume by 5%. This causes the balloon to descend a few
  thousand feet. In daytime, at high altitudes the balloon's skin tends to run colder than the atmospheric temperature.
  As the balloon cools in the evening, it starts to descend because it has lost its volume. When it gets to
  approximately 60,000 - 70,000 ft., where the atmospheric temperatures are colder, the balloon is warmer than ambient
  temperature. It then picks up the 5% lost solar heat and continues to float along at this altitude until the next
  morning when it warms up and returns. to maximum altitude.

</p>
<p>
  For example, a 1000000 cu. ft. balloon, launched in France came down in Montana in August 1966, after having remained
  aloft for 27 days. This balloon had been traveling at 60000 to 100000 ft.
</p>
<h2><a id="s4"></a>Mouvement de ballon</h2>
<p>
  Actual balloon movement during the day is no more discernible than the movement of hands on a clock. At many times a
  balloon will appear to move if there are clouds in the sky just as a flagpole might seem to fall over when one is
  looking at it while lying on his back. The moon demonstrates this same phenomenon when it seems to move across fields
  and jump fences while looked at from a moving automobile. Anytime there are clouds, a balloon may appear to move at
  extreme speed.

</p>
<p>
  A small balloon observed in the first few thousand feet of ascent, of course, will be quite obviously moving. Our very
  large balloons climb at a rate of 700 - 1000 ft/mm; radiosonde balloons ascend at 1000 - 1200 ft/min. As these
  balloons reach higher altitudes, they could encounter strong wind shears (changes in velocity associated with changes
  in altitude) of the order of 30 knots/1000 ft. Hence, velocity could change by as much as 30 knots in a minute, but
  even this would not make a large change in position. The angular movement would always be small over any one-minute
  period.

</p>
<p>
  With respect to daylight sightings, pilots invariably estimate that balloons they see are considerably lower than
  their true height. For example, a pilot flying at 30000 or 40000 ft. will always report that the balloon is between
  10000 and 40000 ft. above him. He will never say it is 100000 ft. above him. The difficulty arises because no one
  conceives of a balloon 300 ft. in diameter. There is no depth to the balloon and no background which permits an
  estimate of either size or distance.

</p>
<p>
  A frequent occurrence in Boulder, Cob., when searching for a balloon which has been recently launched, is to focus on
  the fluffy balls from a cottonwood tree floating 50 - 100 ft. above the observer. The cottonwood ball has been tracked
  on several occasions for two to three minutes before its motion convinced the observer that it was a one-inch
  cottonwood ball at 100 ft. and not a 10-ft. balloon at 10000 ft.
</p>
<h2><a id="s5"></a>Twilight effects</h2>
<p>
  Just after sunset, a balloon may still be in sunlight. At this time the contrast becomes sharp and the balloon is
  clearly visible. A good bright balloon appears at least as bright as the brightest we ever see Venus when the planet
  is high in the sky : This "twilight effect" may continue from 20 mm. to two hours.</p>
<p>
  At high altitudes we have another striking effect for the last few minutes before the sun sets at balloon altitude.
  This is caused by the sun reflecting off the balloon producing a rosy pink and later bright red color as the sun's
  rays pass through a hazy atmosphere and only the red end of the spectrum reaches the balloon. This has generated
  reports of fiery objects in the sky.

</p><p>
  The neoprene balloons are also visible at twilight. An Australian scientist made experiments at NCAR for about a year
  using a new technique for measuring ozone. He flew a neoprene balloon with a little stopper attached which permitted
  the gas to escape and enabled the balloon to remain aloft for one or two hours at altitude instead of ascending and
  bursting. To make measurements of the reflectance of the sun on the balloon and determine the ozone concentration, he
  launched the balloons so that they would reach 100,000 ft. above the observing site just after sunset. These balloons
  were plainly visible about sunset, continued to become brighter and brighter, and then receded to a faint glow before
  disappearing.
</p>
<h2><a id="s6"></a>Ballons éclairés</h2>
<p>
  Small rubber pilot balloons are still being used in many countries. For night soundings these two-foot diameter rubber
  balloons are tracked by small candles placed under the balloon. A single candle in a little holder has been used. The
  holder creates an even glow and keeps the candle from going out. The candle has been replaced in most countries by
  small battery-powered bulbs of approximately two candle power. Although the pilot balloon tracked by theodolite is no
  longer in common use in the U. S., a light is still used on radiosonde balloons at night to assist the observer to
  acquire the balloon, particularly if the night is dark and the trackers have had difficulty locking the radar set on
  the target. The blinking, bobbing light swaying under a pilot balloon or radiosonde balloon produces an exciting and
  attractive UFO. The FAA requires that large polyethylene scientific balloons carry lights when below 60000 ft. at
  night. They can provide an awesome sight as they slowly ascend.</p>
<h2><a id="s7"></a>Fréquence des vols</h2>
<p>
  About 100 polyethylene balloons are flown each year from Palestine, Tex. San Angelo, Tex. has been an active launch
  area with as many as 100 - 200 per year. Chico, Calif., during the winter months has about ten flights, and Holloman
  AFB, N. M. (White Sands), has approximately 50 - 100 per year. Minneapolis remains still a center of balloon
  activities with 20 - 50 flights per year -- usually of small polyethylene balloons.

</p><p>
  In addition, there are other field programs during the year that are undertaken by universities and manufacturers. Ten
  to 20 flights are made from Cardington, England each summer. A continuing flight program is conducted from Aire sur
  L'Adior, France. Australia, Russia, India, and Brazil have active flight programs using large polyethylene balloons.

</p>
<p>
  About 100000 of the small neoprene balloons are flown each year in the United States for routine observation.
  Radiosonde balloon flights constitute a vast undocumented area. They are generally sent up four times a day. Flight
  schedules are all based on Greenwich time. At some times of the year at some places in the country, the balloons will
  be going into altitude at twilight. There are approximately 100 sites in the United States that send up radiosondes
  four times a day. Records of launch time and location for these balloons are kept in Asheville, N. C.

</p>
<p>
  A radiosonde balloon ascending to 100000 ft. at twilight and then shattering can be the source of reports of a fiery
  object in the skies which disappears in a burst of flame.
</p>
<h2><a id="s8"></a>Balloon UFOs</h2>
<p>
  Two situations are illustrated that have produced UFO reports. In January 1964, a large balloon was flown from the
  Glen Canyon Dam area near Pago, Ariz. It was a 6000000 cu. ft. balloon with a light payload. The balloon, which was
  flying at 135000 ft., had encountered extremely strong winds. About three hours after it reached altitude it was
  decided to cut the balloon down. By this time the balloon was over Okla. It did not burst during payload detachment,
  but maintained its integrity and continued to ascend to 140000 ft. When, just after sunset, it came over the East
  Coast at 140000 ft., a number of pilot reports were received of a balloon sighted at 60000 - 70000 ft. Because it was
  at twilight on a very clear day, a number of people saw the balloon. This triggered a rash of flying saucer stories.
  For example, in Va. the people of a small town gathered a posse together to go out into a field to pick up the little
  green men. The sheriff attempted to halt them, but after a gun-waving encounter was forced to give up. The townspeople
  then went out into the field and fortunately failed to find their little men.

</p>
<p>
  At altitudes of 5000 - 10000 ft. we fly a different kind of "ghost" balloon. This cylinder-shaped balloon is
  approximately 20 ft. long and about two feet in diameter. We flew one of these from Boulder on 23 June 1965 at an
  altitude of 6,500 ft. We lost the balloon after a few hours. It went through some rather heavy showers, and seventeen
  days later over the Azores a silvery object like a long spear was sighted in the sky. At the same time as the silvery
  object was seen -- all of the clocks on the Azores stopped. Later investigation determined that an electrician
  short-circuited the island's clock power supply while he was working on a fuse box.
</p>
<h2><a id="s9"></a>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
  The public at large and even many scientists are unaware of the great number of balloon launchings that occur every
  year in all parts of the world. The majority of such launchings are for meteorological studies, but some relate to
  other atmospheric or astronomical research.

</p>
<p>
  By far most of the balloons launched for whatever purpose go unobserved except by those directly interested in their
  performance. They perform their missions and are cutdown or burst unnoticed by the public. This is due to the fact
  that most launchings take place at times and under conditions which make observation -- and misidentification -- of
  them unlikely or impossible. As a result, when a balloon is observed under unusual conditions by individuals not
  familiar with the kinds of devices described in this chapter it may be erroneously reported as an UFO.
