  <p>
    The University of Colorado, under sponsorship of the U.S. Air Force, is conducting a study of UFO's. Since "ESSA
    scientists and personnel are among the most skilled and careful observers to be found," the University has asked our
    cooperation.

  </p>
  <p>
    All reports submitted for this project are on a voluntary basis and will be held in strict confidence by the
    University of Colorado.

  </p>
  <p>
    Weather Bureau observers at stations in the 48 contiguous United States are requested to report any UFO sightings to
    the University of Colorado by FTS system, telephone 303-447-1000 and request number 443-6762. When the switchboard
    operator at the University of Colorado answers, advise that the Weather Bureau is calling with a UFO report and the
    party designated to accept the call will be connected.

  </p>
  <p>
    Include in the report such information as:

  </p>
  <ol>
    <p></p>
    <li>
      Time, place and duration of sighting

      <p></p></li>
    <li>
      Number of objects seen

      <p></p></li>
    <li>
      Size, distance and motion if known

      <p></p></li>
    <li>
      Your name and station
    </li></ol>

  <p>
    The University may arrange an interview with, and at the convenience of, the person making the report if the
    sighting holds special interest for UFO research.

  </p>
  <p>
    Your cooperation in this important project is appreciated.

  </p>
  <p>
    This OML is intended for information only at stations in Alaska and in the Pacific since they are not included in
    this program.
