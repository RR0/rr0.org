<p>Qu'est-ce qu'un <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/OVNI.html">Object Volant Non-Identifié (OVNI)</a> ? Eh bien, selon le <a
    href="../CondonReport/s7/appndx-b.htm">Réglement 80-17</a> de la <a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Force
  Aérienne</a> des <a href="/org/us/index.html">Etats-Unis</a> (daté du 19 septembre <a
    href="../../6/index.html">1966</a>), un ovni est <q>tout phénomène ou objet aérien qui soit inconnu ou parait sortir
  de l'ordinaire pour l'observateur</q>. Ceci est une définition très large qui s'applique tout aussi bien à un individu
  voyant son premier <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/nuage/index.html">nuage</a> au crépuscule qu'à un
  autre individu voyant son hélicoptère. Cependant, actuellement la plupat des gens considère le terme ovni comme
  désignant un objet se comportant de manière étrange ou erratique alors qu'il se déplace dans l'atmosphère terrestre.
  Ce phénomène étrange a évoqué de fortes émotions et une grande curiosité au sein d'un grand segment de notre
  population mondiale. La personne moyenne est intéressée parce qu'elle aime un mystère, le militaire de carrière est
  impliqué parce en raison de la menace possible pour la sécurité nationale, et des scientifiques sont intéressés de par
  la curiosité de base qui les amène à devenir chercheurs.</p>
<p>La littérature sur les ovnis est si vaste, et les histoires si nombreuses et variées, que nous ne pouvons présenter
  qu'un contour grossier du sujet dans ce chapitre. Ce contour inclut des classifications de description, des domaines
  d'opération (temporel et spatial), des théories quant à la nature du phénomène ovni, des réactions humaines, des
  tentatives de s'attaquer au problème scientifiquement, et des propositions de conclusions. Si vous souhaitez to read

<h2>33.1 Descripteurs</h2>
<p> One of the greatest problems you encounter when attempting to catalog UFO sightings, is selection of a system for
  cataloging. No effective system has yet been devised, although a number of different systems have been proposed. The
  net result is that almost all UFO data are either treated in the form of individual cases, or in the forms of
  inadequate classification systems. However, these systems do tend to have some common factors, and a collection of ces
  facteurs is as follows: </p>

<h2>33.2 OPERATIONAL DOMAINS - TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL</h2>
<p> What we will do here is to present evidence that UFO's are a global phenomenon which may have persisted for many
  thousands of years. During this discussion, please remember that the more ancient the reports the less sophisticated
  the observer. Not only were the ancient observers lacking the terminology necessary to describe complex devices (such
  as present day helicopters) but they were also lacking the concepts necessary to understand the true nature of such
  things as television, spaceships, rockets, nuclear weapons and radiation effects. To some, the most advanced
  technological concept was a war chariot with knife blades attached to the wheels. By the same token, the very lack of
  accurate terminology and descriptions leaves the more ancient reports open to considerable misinterpretation, and it
  may well be that present evaluations of individual reports are completely wrong. Nevertheless, let us start with an
  intriguing story in one of the oldest chronicles of India...the Book of Dzyan. </p>
<p> The book is a group of "story-teller" legends which were finally gathered in manuscript form when man learned to
  write. One of the stories is of a small group of beings who supposedly came to Earth many thousands of years ago in a
  metal craft which orbited the Earth several times before landing. As told in the Book "These beings lived to
  themselves and were revered by the humans among whom they had settled. But eventually differences arose among them and
  they divided their numbers, several of the men and women and some children settled in another city, where they were
  promptly installed as rulers by the awe-stricken populace. </p>
<p>"Separation did not bring peace to these people and finally their anger reached a point where the ruler of the
  original city took with him a small number of his warriors and they rose into the air in a huge shining metal vessel.
  While they were many leagues from the city of their enemies, they launched a great shining lance that rode on a beam
  of light. It burst apart in the city of their enemies with a great ball of flame that shot up to the heavens, almost
  to the stars. All those who were in the city were horribly burned and even those who were not in the city - but nearby
  - were burned also. Those who looked upon the lance and the ball of fire were blinded forever afterward. Those who
  entered the city on foot became ill and died. Even the dust of the city was poisoned, as were the rivers that flowed
  through it. Men dared not go near it, and it gradually crumbled into dust and was forgotten by men." </p>
<p>"When the leader saw what he had done to his own people he retired to his palace and refused to see anyone. Then he
  gathered about him those warriors who remained, and their wives and children, and they entered their vessels and rose
  one by one into the sky and sailed away. Nor did they return." </p>
<p> Could this foregoing legend really be an account of an extraterrestrial colonization, complete with guided missile,
  nuclear warhead and radiation effects? It is difficult to assess the validity of that explanation... just as it is
  difficult to explain why Greek, Roman and Nordic Mythology all discuss wars and contacts among their "Gods." (Even the
  Bible records conflict between the legions of God and Satan.) Could it be that each group recorded their parochial
  view of what was actually a global conflict among alien colonists or visitors? Or is it that man has led such a
  violent existence that he tends to expect conflict and violence among even his gods? </p>
<p> Evidence of perhaps an even earlier possible contact was uncovered by Tschi Pen Lao of the University of Peking. He
  discovered astonishing carvings in granite on a mountain in Hunan Province and on an island in Lake Tungting. These
  carvings have been evaluated as 47,000 years old, and they show people with large trunks (breathing apparatus?...or
  "elephant" heads shown on human bodies? Remember, the Egyptians often represented their gods as animal heads on human
  bodies.) </p>
<p> Only 8,000 years ago, rocks were sculpted in the Tassili plateau of Sahara, depicting what appeared to be human
  beings but with strange round heads (helmets? or "sun" heads on human bodies?) And even more recently, in the Bible,
  Genesis (6:4) tells of angels from the sky mating with women of Earth, who bore them children. Genesis 19:3 tells of
  Lot meeting two angels in the desert and his later feeding them at his house. The Bible also tells a rather unusual
  story of Ezekiel who witnessed what has been interpreted by some to have been a spacecraft or aircraft landing near
  the Chebar River in Chaldea (593 B.C.). </p>
<p> Even the Irish have recorded strange visitations. In the Speculum Regali in Konungs Skuggsa (and other accounts of
  the era about 956 A.D.) are numerous stories of "demonships" in the skies. In one case a rope from one such ship
  became entangled with part of a church. A man from the ship climbed down the rope to free it, but was seized by the
  townspeople. The bishop made the people release the man, who climbed back to the ship, where the crew cut the rope and
  the ship rose and sailed out of sight. In all of his actions, the climbing man appeared as if he were swimming in
  water. Stories such as this makes one wonder if the legends of the "little people" of Ireland were based upon
  imagination alone. </p>
<p> About the same time, in Lyons (France) three men and a women supposedly descended from an airship or spaceship and
  were captured by a mob. These foreigners admitted to being wizards, and were killed. (No mention is made of the
  methods employed to extract the admissions.) Many documented UFO sightings occurred throughout the Middle Ages,
  including an especially startling one of a UFO over London on 16 December 1742. However, we do not have room to
  include any more of the Middle Ages sightings. Instead, two "more-recent" sightings are contained in this section to
  bring us up to modern times. </p>
<p> In a sworn statement dated 21 April 1897, a prosperous and prominent farmer named Alexander Hamilton (Le Roy,
  Kansas, U.S.A.) told of an attack upon his cattle at about 10:30 p.m. the previous Monday. He, his son, and his tenant
  grabbed axes and ran some 700 feet from the house to the cow lot where a great cigar-shaped ship about 300 feet long
  floated some 30 feet above the cattle. It had a carriage underneath which was brightly lighted within (dirigible and
  gondola?) and which had numerous windows. Inside were six strange looking beings jabbering in a foreign language.
  These beings suddenly became aware of Hamilton and the others. They immediately turned a searchlight on the farmer,
  and also turned on some power which sped up a turbine wheel (about 30 ft. diameter) located under the craft. The ship
  rose, taking with it a two-year old heifer which was roped about the neck by a cable of one-half inch thick, red
  material. The next day a neighbor, Link Thomas, found the animal's hide, legs and head in his field. He was mystified
  at how the remains got to where they were because of the lack of tracks in the soft soil. Alexander Hamilton's sworn
  statement was accompanied by an affidavit as to his veracity. The affidavit was signed by ten of the local leading
  citizens. </p>
<p> On the evening of 4 November 1957 at Fort Itaipu, Brazil, two sentries noted a "new star" in the sky. The "star"
  grew in size and within seconds stopped over the fort. It drifted slowly downward, was as large as a big aircraft, and
  was surround by a strong orange glow. A distinct humming sound was heard, and then the heat struck. One sentry
  collapsed almost immediately, the other managed to slide to shelter under the heavy cannons where his loud cries awoke
  the garrison. While the troops were scrambling towards their battle stations, complete electrical failure occurred.
  There was panic until the lights came back on but a number of men still managed to see an orange glow leaving the area
  at high speed. Both sentries were found badly burned...one unconscious and the other incoherent, suffering from deep
  shock. </p>
<p> Thus, UFO sightings not only appear to extend back to 47,000 years through time but also are global in nature. One
  has the feeling that this phenomenon deserves some sort of valid scientific investigation, even if it is a low level
  effort. </p>
<h2>33.3 SOME THEORIES AS TO THE NATURE OF THE UFO PHENOMENON</h2>
<p> There are very few cohesive theories as to the nature of UFO's. Those theories that have been advanced can be
  collected in five groups:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li type="a"> Mysticism </li>
  <li type="a"> Hoaxes, and rantings due to unstable personalities </li>
  <li type="a"> Secret Weapons </li>
  <li type="a"> Natural Phenomena </li>
  <li type="a"> Alien visitors </li>
</ol>
<h3>Mysticism</h3>
<p> It is believed by some cults that the mission of UFO's and their crews is a spiritual one, and that all
  materialistic efforts to determine the UFO's nature are doomed to failure. </p>
<h3>Hoaxes and Rantings due to Unstable Personalities</h3>
<p> Some have suggested that all UFO reports were the results of pranks and hoaxes, or were made by people with unstable
  personalities. This attitude was particularly prevalent during the time period when the Air Force investigation was
  being operated under the code name of Project Grudge. A few airlines even went as far as to ground every pilot who
  reported seeing a "flying saucer." The only way for the pilot to regain flight status was to undergo a psychiatric
  examination. There was a noticeable decline in pilot reports during this time interval, and a few interpreted this
  decline to prove that UFO's were either hoaxes or the result of unstable personalities. It is of interest that NICAP
  (The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) even today still receives reports from commercial pilots
  who neglect to notify either the Air Force or their own airline. </p>
<p> There are a number of cases which indicate that not all reports fall in the hoax category. We will examine one such
  case now. It is the Socorro, New Mexico sighting made by police Sergeant Lonnie Zamora. Sergeant Zamora was patrolling
  the streets of Socorro on 24 April 1964 when he saw a shiny object drift down into an area of gullies on the edge of
  town. He also heard a loud roaring noise which sounded as if an old dynamite shed located out that way had exploded.
  He immediately radioed police headquarters, and drove out toward the shed. Zamora was forced to stop about 150 yards
  away from a deep gully in which there appeared to be an overturned car. He radioed that he was investigating a
  possible wreck, and then worked his car up onto the mesa and over toward the edge of the gully. He parked short, and
  when he walked the final few feet to the edge, he was amazed to see that it was not a car but instead was a weird
  eggshaped object about fifteen feet long, white in color and resting on short, metal legs. Beside it, unaware of his
  presence were two humanoids dressed in silvery coveralls. They seemed to be working on a portion of the underside of
  the object. Zamora was still standing there, surprised, when they suddenly noticed him and dove out of sight around
  the object. Zamora also headed the other way, back toward his car. He glanced back at the object just as a bright blue
  flame shot down from the underside. Within seconds the eggshaped thing rose out of the gully with "an ear-splitting
  roar." The object was out of sight over the nearby mountains almost immediately, and Sergeant Zamora was moving the
  opposite direction almost as fast when he met Sergeant Sam Chavez who was responding to Zamora's earlier radio calls.
  Together they investigated the gully and found the bushes charred and still smoking where the blue flame had jetted
  down on them. About the charred area were four deep marks where the metal legs had been. Each mark was three and one
  half inches deep, and was circular in shape. The sand in the gully was very hard packed so no sign of the humanoids'
  footprints could be found. An official investigation was launched that same day, and all data obtained supported the
  stories of Zamora and Chavez. It is rather difficult to label this episode a hoax, and it is also doubtful that both
  Zamora and Chavez shared portions of the same hallucination. </p>
<h3>Secret Weapons</h3>
<p> A few individuals have proposed that UFO's are actually advanced weapon systems, and that their natures must not be
  revealed. Very few people accept this as a credible suggestion. </p>
<h3>Natural Phenomena</h3>
<p> It has also been suggested that at least some, and possibly all, of the UFO cases were just misinterpreted
  manifestations of natural phenomena. Undoubtedly this suggestion has some merit. People have reported, as UFO's,
  objects which were conclusively proven to be balloons (weather and skyhook), the planet Venus, man-made artificial
  satellites, normal aircraft, unusual cloud formations, and lights from ceilometers (equipment projecting light beams
  on cloud bases to determine the height of the aircraft visual ceiling). It is also suspected that people have reported
  mirages, optical illusions, swamp gas and ball lightning (a poorly-understood discharge of electrical energy in a
  spheroidal or ellipsoidal shape...some charges have lasted for up to fifteen minutes but the ball is usually no bigger
  than a large orange.) But it is difficult to tell a swamp dweller that the strange, fast-moving light he saw in the
  sky was swamp gas; and it is just as difficult to tell a farmer that a bright UFO in the sky is the same ball
  lightning that he has seen rolling along his fence wires in dry weather. Thus accidental misidentification of what
  might well be natural phenomena breeds mistrust and disbelief; it leads to the hasty conclusion that the truth is
  deliberately not being told. One last suggestion of interest has been made, that the UFO's were plasmoids from
  space...concentrated blobs of solar wind that succeeded in reaching the surface of the Earth. Somehow this last
  suggestion does not seem to be very plausible; perhaps because it ignores such things as penetration of Earth's
  magnetic field. </p>
<h3>Alien Visitors</h3>
<p> The most stimulating theory for us is that the UFO's are material objects which are either "Manned" or
  remote-controlled by beings who are alien to this planet. There is some evidence supporting this viewpoint. In
  addition to police Sergeant Lonnie Zamora's experience, let us consider the case of Barney and Betty Hill. On a trip
  through New England they lost two hours on the night of 19 September 1961 without even realizing it. However, after
  that night both Barney and Betty began developing psychological problems which eventually grew sufficiently severe
  that they submitted themselves to psychiatric examination and treatment. During the course of treatment hypnotherapy
  was used, and it yielded remarkably detailed and similar stories from both Barney and Betty. Essentially they had been
  hypnotically kidnapped, taken aboard a UFO, submitted to two-hour physicals, and released with posthypnotic
  suggestions to forget the entire incident. The evidence is rather strong that this is what the Hills, even in their
  subconscious, believe happened to them. And it is of particular importance that after the "posthypnotic block" was
  removed, both of the Hills ceased having their psychological problems. </p>
<p> The Hill's description of the aliens was similar to descriptions provided in other cases, but this particular type
  of alien appears to be in the minority. The most commonly described alien is about three and one-half feet tall, has a
  round head (helmet?), arms reaching to or below his knees, and is wearing a silvery space suit or coveralls. Other
  aliens appear to be essentially the same as Earthmen, while still others have particularly wide (wrap around) eyes and
  mouths with very thin lips. And there is a rare group reported as about four feet tall, weight of around 35 pounds,
  and covered with thick hair or fur (clothing?). Members of this last group are described as being extremely strong. If
  such beings are visiting Earth, two questions arise: 1) why haven't there been any accidents which have revealed their
  presence, and 2) why haven't they attempted to contact us officially? The answer to the first question may exist
  partially in Sergeant Lonnie Zamora's experience, and may exist partially in the Tunguska meteor discussed in Chapter
  XXIX. In that chapter it was suggested that the Tunguska meteor was actually a comet which exploded in the atmosphere,
  the ices melted and the dust spread out. Hence, no debris! However, it has also been suggested that the Tunguska
  meteor was actually an alien spacecraft that entered the atmosphere to rapidly, suffered mechanical failure, and lost
  its power supply and/or weapons in a nuclear explosion. While that hypothesis may seem far fetched, sample of tree
  rings from around the world reveal that, immediately after the Tunguska meteor explosion, the level of radioactivity
  in the world rose sharply for a short period of time. It is difficult to find a natural explanation for that increase
  in radioactivity, although the suggestion has been advanced that enough of the meteor's great kinetic energy was
  converted into heat (by atmospheric friction) that a fusion reaction occurred. This still leaves us with no answer to
  the second question: why no contact? That question is very easy to answer in several ways: 1) we may be the object of
  intensive sociological and psychological study. In such studies you usually avoid disturbing the test subjects'
  environment; 2) you do not "contact" a colony of ants, and humans may seem that way to any aliens (variation: a zoo is
  fun to visit, but you don't "contact" the lizards); 3) such contact may have already taken place secretly; and 4) such
  contact may have already taken place on a different plane of awareness and we are not yet sensitive to communications
  on such a plane. These are just a few of the reasons. You may add to the list as you desire. </p>
<h2>33.4 HUMAN FEAR AND HOSTILITY</h2>
<p> Besides the foregoing reasons, contacting humans is downright dangerous. Think about that for a moment! On the
  microscopic level our bodies reject and fight (through production antibodies) any alien material; this process helps
  us fight off disease but it also sometimes results in allergic reactions to innocuous materials. On the macroscopic
  (psychological and sociological) level we are antagonistic to beings that are "different". For proof of that, just
  watch how an odd child is treated by other children, or how a minority group is socially deprived, or how the Arabs
  feel about the Israelis (Chinese vs. Japanese, Turks vs. Greeks, etc.) In case you are hesitant to extend that concept
  to the treatment of aliens let me point out that in very ancient times, possible extraterrestrials may have been
  treated as Gods but in the last two thousand years, the evidence is that any possible aliens have been ripped apart by
  mobs, shot and shot at, physically assaulted, and in general treated with fear and aggression. In Ireland about 1,000
  A.D., supposed airships were treated as "demon-ships." In Lyons, France, "admitted" space travelers were killed. More
  recently, on 24 July 1957 Russian anti-aircraft batteries on the Kouril Islands opened fire on UFO's. Although all
  Soviet anti-aircraft batteries on the Islands were in action, no hits were made. The UFO's were luminous and moved
  very fast. We too have fired on UFO's. About ten o'clock one morning, a radar site near a fighter base picked up a UFO
  doing 700 mph. The UFO then slowed to 100 mph, and two F-86's were scrambled to intercept. Eventually one F-86 closed
  on the UFO at about 3,000 feet altitude. The UFO began to accelerate away but the pilot still managed to get within
  500 yards of the target for a short period of time. It was definitely saucer-shaped. As the pilot pushed the F-86 at
  top speed, the UFO began to pull away. When the range reached 1,000 yards, the pilot armed his guns and fired in an
  attempt to down the saucer. He failed, and the UFO pulled away rapidly, vanishing in the distance. This same basic
  situation may have happened on a more personal level. On Sunday evening 21 August 1955, eight adults and three
  children were on the Sutton Farm (one-half mile from Kelly, Kentucky) when, according to them, one of the children saw
  a brightly glowing UFO settle behind the barn, out of sight from where he stood. Other witnesses on nearby farms also
  saw the object. However, the Suttons dismissed it as a "shooting star," and did not investigate. Approximately thirty
  minutes later (at 8 p.m.), the family dogs began barking so two of the men went to the back door and looked out.
  Approximately 50 feet away and coming toward them was a creature wearing a glowing silvery suit. It was about three
  and one-half feet tall with a large round head and very long arms. It had large webbed hands which were equipped with
  claws. The two Suttons grabbed a twelve gauge shotgun and a 22 caliber pistol, and fired at close range. They could
  hear the pellets and bullet ricochet as if off of metal. The creature was knocked down, but jumped up and scrambled
  away. The Suttons retreated into the house, turned off all inside lights, and turned on the porch-light. At that
  moment, one of the women who was peeking out of the dining room window discovered that a creature with some sort of
  helmet and wide slit eyes was peeking back at her. She screamed, the men rushed in and started shooting. The creature
  was knocked backwards but again scrambled away without apparent harm. More shooting occurred (a total of about 50
  rounds) over the next 20 minutes and the creatures finally left (perhaps feeling unwelcome?) After about a two hour
  wait (for safety), the Suttons left too. By the time the police got there, the aliens were gone but the Suttons would
  not move back to the farm. They sold it and departed. This reported incident does bear out the contention though that
  humans are dangerous. At no time in the story did the supposed aliens shoot back, although one is left with the
  impression that the described creatures were having fun scaring humans. </p>
<h2>33.5 ATTEMPTS AT SCIENTIFIC APPROACHES</h2>
<p> In any scientific endeavor, the first step is to acquire data, the second step to classify the data, and the third
  step to form hypothesis. The hypothesis are tested by repeating the entire process, with each cycle resulting in an
  increase in understanding (we hope). The UFO phenomenon does not yield readily to this approach because the data taken
  so far exhibits both excessive variety and vagueness. The vagueness is caused in part by the lack of preparation of
  the observer...very few people leave their house knowing that they are going to see a UFO that evening. Photographs
  are overexposed or underexposed, and rarely in color. Hardly anyone carries around a radiation counter or
  magnetometer. And, in addition to this, there is a very high level of "noise" in the data. The noise consists of
  mistaken reports of known natural phenomena, hoaxes, reports by unstable individuals and mistaken removal of data
  regarding possible unnatural or unknown natural phenomena (by overzealous individuals who are trying to eliminate all
  data due to known natural phenomena). In addition, those data, which do appear to be valid, exhibit an excessive
  amount of variety relative to the statistical samples which are available. This has led to very clumsy classification
  systems, which in turn provide quite unfertile ground for formulation of hypothesis. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Figure 33-1 appears here in original text &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Figure 33-1. UFO: Distance of observer versus estimated diameter, for UFO's which are lower than tree height. </p>
<p>One hypothesis which looked promising for a time was that of ORTHOTENY (i.e., UFO sightings fall on "great circle"
  routes). At first, plots of sightings seemed to verify the concept of orthoteny but recent use of computers has
  revealed that even random numbers yield "great circle" plots as neatly as do UFO sightings. </p>
<p> There is one solid advance that has been made though. Jacques and Janine Vallee have taken a particular type of UFO
  - namely those that are lower than tree-top level when sighted - and plotted the UFO's estimated diameter versus the
  estimated distance from the observer. The result yields an average diameter of 5 meters with a very characteristic
  drop for short viewing distances, and rise for long viewing distances. This behavior at the extremes of the curve is
  well known to astronomers and psychologists as the "moon illusion." The illusion only occurs when the object being
  viewed is a real, physical object. Because this implies that the observers have viewed a real object, it permits us to
  accept also their statement that these particular UFO's had a rotational axis of symmetry. </p>
<p> Another, less solid, advance made by the Vallee's was their plotting of the total number of sightings per week
  versus the date. They did this for the time span from 1947 to 1962, and then attempted to match the peaks of the curve
  (every 2 years 2 months) to the times of Earth-Mars conjunction (every 2 years 1.4 months). The match was very good
  between 1950 and 1956 but was poor outside those limits. Also, the peaks were not only at the times of Earth-Mars
  conjunction but also roughly at the first harmonic (very loosely, every 13 months). This raises the question why
  should UFO's only visit Earth when Mars is in conjunction and when it is on the opposite side of the sun. Obviously,
  the conjunction periodicity of Mars is not the final answer. As it happens, there is an interesting possibility to
  consider. Suppose Jupiter's conjunctions were used; they are every 13.1 months. That would satisfy the observed
  periods nicely, except for every even data peak being of different magnitude from every odd data peak. Perhaps a
  combination of Martian, Jovian, and Saturnian (and even other planetary) conjunctions will be necessary to match the
  frequency plot... if it can be matched (Figure 33-2). </p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Figure 33-2 appears here in original text &gt;&gt; </p>
<p>Figure 33-2. Cycles of activity, mathematically corrected for long term "Strong Trends". which are lower than tree
  height. </p>
<p> Further data correlation is quite difficult. There are a large number of different saucer shapes but this may mean
  little. For example, look at the number of different types of aircraft which are in use in the U.S. Air Force
  alone. </p>
<p> It is obvious that intensive scientific study is needed in this area; no such study has yet been undertaken at the
  necessary levels of intensity and support. One thing that must be guarded against in any such study is the trap of
  implicitly assuming that our knowledge of Physics (or any other branch of science) is complete. An example of one such
  trap is selecting a group of physical laws which we now accept as valid, and assume that they will never be
  superseded. Five such laws might be: </p>
<ol>
  <li> Every action must have an opposite and equal reaction. </li>
  <li> Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force proportional to the product of the
    masses and inversely as the square of the distance. </li>
  <li> Energy, mass and momentum are conserved. </li>
  <li> No material body can have a speed as great as c, the speed of light in free space. </li>
  <li> The maximum energy, E, which can be obtained from a body at rest is E=mc2, where m is the rest mass of the
    body. </li>
</ol>
<p> Laws numbered 1 and 3 seem fairly safe, but let us hesitate and take another look. Actually, law number 3 is only
  valid (now) from a relativistic viewpoint; and for that matter so are laws 4 and 5. But relativity completely revised
  these physical concepts after 1915, before then Newtonian mechanics were supreme. We should also note that general
  relativity has not yet been verified. Thus we have the peculiar situation of five laws which appear to deny the
  possibility of intelligent alien control of UFO's, yet three of the laws are recent in concept and may not even be
  valid. Also, law number 2 has not yet been tested under conditions of large relative speeds or accelerations. We
  should not deny the possibility of alien control of UFO's on the basis of preconceived notions not established as
  related or relevant to the UFO's. </p>
<h2>33.6 CONCLUSION</h2>
<p> From available information, the UFO phenomenon appears to have been global in nature for almost 50,000 years. The
  majority of known witnesses have been reliable people who have seen easily-explained natural phenomena, and there
  appears to be no overall positive correlation with population density. The entire phenomenon could be psychological in
  nature but that is quite doubtful. However, psychological factors probably do enter the data picture as "noise." The
  phenomenon could also be entirely due to known and unknown phenomena (with some psychological "noise" added in) but
  that too is questionable in view of some of the available data. </p>
<p> This leaves us with the unpleasant possibility of alien visitors to our planet, or at least of alien controlled
  UFO's. However, the data are not well correlated, and what questionable data there are suggest the existence of at
  least three and maybe four different groups of aliens (possibly at different stages of development). This too is
  difficult to accept. It implies the existence of intelligent life on a majority of the planets in our solar system, or
  a surprisingly strong interest in Earth by members of other solar systems. </p>
<p> A solution to the UFO problem may be obtained by the long and diligent effort of a large group of well financed and
  competent scientists, unfortunately there is no evidence suggesting that such an effort is going to be made. However,
  even if such an effort were made, there is no guarantee of success because of the isolated and sporadic nature of the
  sightings. Also, there may be nothing to find, and that would mean a long search with no proof at the end. The best
  thing to do is to keep an open and skeptical mind, and not take an extreme position on any side of the question. </p>
