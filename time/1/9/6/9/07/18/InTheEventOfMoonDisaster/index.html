    <p>Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in
      peace.</p>
    <p>These brave men, <a href="/people/a/ArmstrongNeilA/index.html">Neil Armstrong</a> and <a
        href="/people/a/AldrinBuzz/index.html">Edwin Aldrin</a>, know that there is no hope for their recovery. But they
      also know that that there is hope for mankind in their sacrifice.</p>
    <p>These two men are laying down their lives in mankind's most noble goal: the search for truth and
      understanding.</p>
    <p>They will be mourned by their families and friends; they will be mourned by their nation; they will be mourned by
      the people of the world; they will be mourned by a Mother Earth that dared send two of her sons into the
      unknown.</p>
    <p>In their exploration, they stirred the people of the world to feel as one; in their sacrifice, they bind more
      tightly the brotherhood of man.</p>
    <p>In ancien days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do much the
      same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.</p>

        </tr></table><p>Others will follow, and surely find they way home. Man's search will not be denied. But these
        men were the first, and they will remain the foremost in our hearts.</p>
        <p>For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of
          another world that is forever mankind.</p>
        <h2>PRIOR TO THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT:</h2>
        <p>The President should telephone each of the windows-to-be.</p>
        <h2>AFTER THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT, AT THE POINT WHEN NASA ENDS COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE MEN:</h2>
        <p>A clergyman should adopt the same procedure as a burial at sea, commending their souls to "the deepest of the
          deep," concluding with the Lord's Prayer.</p>
