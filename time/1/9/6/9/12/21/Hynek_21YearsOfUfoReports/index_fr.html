<p>Mon rôle ici aujourd'hui est celui d'un journaliste ; vous rapporter sur la base de ma somme d'année d'expérience
  des signalements d'ovnis (notez que je ne dis pas d'ovnis, n'ayant moi-même jamais eu d'expérience ovni) et de ceux
  qui font de tels témoignages, dans ce pays et de nombreux autres. On m'a demandé <time>1948</time>, en tant qu'<a
    href="/people/astronomes.html">astronome</a> alors à l'Université de l'Etat d'Ohio, et ainsi géographiquement proche
  de la <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html">base aérienne de Wright- Patterson</a>, d'éxaminer les
  témoignages d'ovnis reçus par l'<a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a> et de déterminer combien d'entre eux provenaient de <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/index.html">méprises</a> avec des objets ou événements astronomiques. Ce
  rôle de conseil se poursuivi au fil des années et me donna la chance d'observer le flot des signalements d'ovnis
  soumis à l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a>, et d'observer la prise en charge du problème par l'<a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a> as first one, puis un autre officier reçu la charge du <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook/index.html">projet Bluebook</a>. </p>
<p>En tant que journaliste sur la scène ovni, je me souviens du vieux dicton du journaliste : trouver Qui, Quoi, Où,
  Quand et Pourquoi. Je n'aurai pas de difficulté à traiter le Qui, Quoi, Où et Quand, car cela signifie simplement de
  traiter avec les faits - en particulier avec le fait incontestable que les témoignages d'ovnis existent, et que le
  moment et la localisation de l'événement rapporté sont généralement connus, tout comme l'identité des témoins. </p>
<p>Je laisserai le "Pourquoi" à d'autres scientifiques, mais je défierai leurs explications s'ils ne sont pas conversant
  avec les Qui, Quoi, Où et Quand. Je suis particulièrement fatigué des pontifications de ceux qui n'ont pas fait de
  travail sur le terrain -- ou de "devoirs" à la maison, pour ainsi dire. </p>
<p>De fait, je voudrais dire un mot sur la méthodologie scientifique quand elle touche ce problème. J'ai discuté de ceci
  en longueur avec le réputé philosophe des sciences Thomas Goudge. </p>
<p><q>Une des facettes les plus intéressantes de la question des ovnis</q>, écrit Goudge, <q>touche au problème de la
  manière dont avance la science. En gros je dirai qu'une condition nécessaire de l'avancée scientifique est que l'on
  doit autoriser (a) des observations empiriques réellement nouvelles et (b) de nouveaux schémas d'explication, y
  compris de nouveaux concepts de base et de nouvelles lois</q>. Goudge note qu'à travers toute l'histoire tout schéma
  d'explication fructueux, y compris la physique du <a href="../../../../../index.html">20<sup>ème</sup> siècle</a>,
  agit d'une certaine manière comme un "établissement" et tend à résister à de observations empiriques réellement
  nouvelles, en particulièrement lorsqu'elles n'ont pas été générées au sein du cadre accepté de ce schéma - comme, par
  exemple, la réticence à accepter les <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/rentree/meteore/index.html">météorites</a>,
  les fossiles, la circulation du sang et, à notre époque, la <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/foudre/globulaire/index.html">foudre en boule</a>. L'histoire est remplie
  de tels exemples. Lorsque l'établissement accepte de telles nouvelles observations il tend souvent à les assimiler
  dans le cadre en vigueur - comme, par exemple, la tentative d'admettre l'existence des <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/rentree/meteore/index.html">météorites</a> comme des pierres ayant été
  frappées par la <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/foudre/index.html">foudre</a>. <q>Par conséquent</q>,
  conclut Goudge, <q>l'établissement actuel voit que les phénomènes d'ovnis comme, soit des données pas réellement
    scientifique (ou en tous cas, pas des données pour la physique), soit rien d'autre que des <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/index.html">méprises</a> d'objets, événements familiers, etc. Adopter
    cette approche est sans nul doute rejeter une condition nécessaire de la condition nécessaire d'avancée scientifique</q>

<p>Nous ne saurons jamais si les signalements d'ovnis représentent des observations empiriques réellement nouvelles si
  nous poursuivons le type d'erreur logique illustré par l'analyse de l'Air Force d'un cas de <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/classification/hynek/rv/index.html">signalement d'ovni radar-visuel</a> depuis
  la <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/KirtlandAFB.html">base aérienne de Kirtland</a>, à Albuquerque, au Nouveau Mexique, en
  <a href="../../../../../5/7/index.html">1957</a>. 2 témoins dans la tour de contrôle signalèrent à <time>23:00</time>
  qu'un objet, qui ressemblait (aux jumelles) à une automobile up-ended éclairée, arrivait à moins de 200 pieds du sol
  lorsqu'il disparut derrière un grillage dans une zone hautement restreinte, facilement visible depuis la tour de
  contrôle, puis s'éleva brusquement à une très grand vitesse angulaire et disparut. Il fut observé visuellement pendant
  6 mn environ, près de la moitié de ce tinle aux jumelles, et suivi en partie au <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/radar/index.html">radar</a>. Le rapport de l'officier de l'<a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a> qui enquêta sur ce cas, qui se trouve dans le dossier <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook/index.html">Bluebook</a>, indique : </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>Les 2 sources sont des Spécialistes des Opérations des Lignes Aériennes avec un total de 23 ans d'expérience.
    Tous 2 étaient en service dans la tour de contrôle de la <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/KirtlandAFB.html">base
      aérienne de Kirtland</a> lorsque l'observation fut faite - tous 2 ont semblé être des individus matures et bien
    poised, apparemment d'une intelligence bien au-dessus de la moyenne, et de tempérament bien qualifié pour les
    besoins exigeants des opérateurs de tour de contrôle. Bien que complètement coopératifs et souhaitant répondre à
    toute question, les 2 sources étaient apparemment un peu gênés de n'avoir pu identifier ou offrir une explication de
    l'objet qu'ils sont fermement convaincus d'avoir vu. De l'opinion de l'interrogateur, les 2 sources sont tout à fait
    compétentes et fiables. </q></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Le <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Projet Bluebook</a> a expliqué cette observation comme <a
  href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/aeronef/avion/index.html">celle d'un appareil</a> ; et a donné les raisons
  spécifiques suivantes : </p>
<ol>
  <li> Les observateurs sont considérés comme des sources compétentes et fiables et de l'opinion de l'interrogateur ont
    véritablement vu un objet qu'ils n'ont pu identifier </li>
  <li>L'objet a été suivi sur écran radar par un opérateur compétent </li>
  <li>L'objet ne correspond à aucun critère d'identification de tout autre phénomène.</li>
</ol>
<p>Donc, les témoins étaient solides, l'opérateur radar compétent, et l'objet non-assimilable à tout autre phénomène ;
  par conséquent l'objet devait être un avion. Clairement, si un tel raisonnement est appliqué à tous les signalements
  d'ovnis, nous pouvons difficilement nous attendre à trouver si des observations empiriques réellement nouvelles
  existent à expliquer. Schroedinger, le père de la mécanique quantique, a écrit : <q>La 1<sup>ère</sup> nécessité pour
    un scientifique est d'être curieux ; il doit être capable de s'étonner, et avide de trouver</q>. Peut-être aurait-il
  dû ajouter, <q>et être prêt à examiner des données même lorsqu'elles sont présentées sous une forme déconcertante et
    déroutante</q>.</p>
<p>There is much in the UFO problem to be astonished about - and much to be confused about, too. Such confusion is
  understandable. Over the past twenty years I have had so many experiences with crackpots, visionaries, and religious
  fanatics that I hardly need be reminded of people who espouse the idea of UFO's as visitors from outer space for their
  own peculiar purposes. You will note that I say "espouse the idea," not "make UFO reports." Very rarely do members of
  the lunatic fringe make UFO reports. There are many reasons for this; primarily it is simply that they are incapable
  of composing an articulate, factual, and objective report. </p>
<p>In addition to being fully aware of the cultists, and how they muddy the waters even though they don't generate UFO
  sightings, I am also well aware of the widespread ignorance, on the part of many, of astronomical objects,
  high-altitude balloons, special air missions, mirages, and special meteorological effects, and of people's willingness
  to ascribe their views of such things to the presence of something mysterious. These people, in contrast to the
  crackpots, are far more of a problem because they do generate UFO reports which represent a high noise level - so
  high, in fact, that many who have not looked carefully into the matter feel that all UFO reports stem from such
  misperceptions. In actual fact it is relatively simple for an experienced investigator to sort out and quickly
  eliminate virtually all of the misperception cases. </p>
<p>It is a pity that people so often are not well-informed, objective, and accurate reporters; since <a
  href="../../../../../4/8/index.html">1948</a> I have become only too familiar with UFO reports spawned by Venus,
  twinkling stars, aircraft, and the like. Some eighteen years before the Condon committee was formed I was already
  aware that the great majority of UFO reports are nothing more than misperceptions by the uninformed. Of course, these
  misperceptions must be deleted before any serious study of the UFO question can begin. From this point on, I am
  speaking only of UFO reports which _remain_ unexplained by trained investigators; only then are we truly dealing with
  something that is unidentified by people capable of making an identification. In short, an original UFO report must
  pass through a "narrow band-pass filter" before it qualifies as worthy material for scientific study, the objective of
  which is to determine whether any genuinely new empirical observations exist. Only those reports which survive the
  running of this gauntlet can qualify. An objection to this approach immediately arises: Aren't we just rejecting
  everything but the tail-end of the distribution curve of human reactions to visual stimuli? I firmly agreed with this
  view (during my first years of association with the UFO problem, but now I question it. We can take the position that
  we are dealing with the vagaries of human perception only if we are dealing with a homogeneous set of observations.
  For instance, the distribution curve of fruit size in an apple orchard would have a significant tail at the
  large-fruit end if measurements of watermelons on the ground were included without noting the structural differences
  between apples and watermelons. </p>
<p>Let me define the UFO phenomenon, the <i>existence</i> of which we wish to determine or deny, as that phenomenon
  described by reports of visual or instrumental observations of lights or objects in the sky (or near, or on the
  ground) whose presence, trajectories, and general character are not explainable in verifiable physical terms, even
  after intensive study. The Condon Report furnishes us with many examples <span class="source">Condon, E. U.:  <em>Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects, </em>New York: Bantam Books, 1969</span>.
</p>
<p>For years I could not accept the idea that a genuine UFO phenomenon might exist, preferring to hold that it was all a
  craze based on hoaxes and misperceptions. As my review of UFO reports continued, and as the reports grew in number to
  be of statistical significance, I became concerned that the whole subject didn't evaporate as one would expect a craze
  or fad to do. Also, the phenomenon of UFO reports not only persisted in this country but in many areas over the world;
  if there were some worldwide compulsion to report strange things, why are only these particular types of strange
  reports preferred from the infinite universe of all possible strange reports? The degree of "strangeness" is certainly
  one dimension of a filtered UFO report. The higher the strangeness index the more the information aspects of the
  report defy explanation in ordinary physical terms. An other singificant dimension is the probability that the report
  refers to a real event; in short, did the strange thing really happen? And what is the probability that the witnesses
  described an actual event? This credibility index represents a different evaluation, not of the report in this
  instance, but of the witnesses, and it involves different criteria. These two dimensions can be used as coordinates to
  plot a point for each UFO report on a useful diagram. The criteria I have used in estimating these coordinates are:
  For strangeness: How nlany individual items, or information bits, does the report contain which demand explanation,
  and how difficult is it to explain them, on the assumption that the event occurred? For credibility: If there are
  several witnesses, what is their collective objectivity? How well do they respond to tests of their ability to gauge
  angular sizes and angular rates of speed? How good is their eyesight? What are their medical histories? What technical
  training have they had? What is their general reputation in the community? What is their reputation for
  publicity-seeking, for veracity? What is their occupation and how much responsibility does it involve? No more than
  quarter-scale credibility is to be assigned to one-witness cases. If one now plots the strangeness (S) of a report
  against the credibility (P) of the witnesses - that is, the probability that the event happened more or less as stated
  - one obtains a diagram which may be called the strangeness-probability diagram. An example of such a diagram
  constructed for some cases I have personally investigated is shown in Figure 4-1. Plotted points represent only those
  UFO reports, of course, that have passed through the misperception and hoax filter. Clearly, the most provocative and
  potentially important UFO reports are those in the upper right-hand region of such a diagram, representing reports
  that contain many information elements and have a high probability rating. </p>
<p>In these high-P reports, the witnesses were of such a caliber and the circumstances surrounding the reported event
  were such that we cannot discount the reported event. Examples of such information bits are craft description, motions
  that seemingly defy inertial laws, effects on animals, interference with automobile ignition systems, and visible
  marks on land. The Condon Report includes several such cases. </p>

    encounters with no interaction with the environment; P = close encounters with physical effects (landing marks,

<p>My long experience in personal contacts with witnesses who generate high-S high-P reports shows that all were trying
  to describe an event for which they had an entirely inadequate vocabulary - much as an aborigine lacks the vocabulary
  to describe a supersonic jet or a nuclear submarine. Whatever else can be said of the UFO phenomenon, it represents
  for the witness an undoubted event, and an event for which he was totally unprepared. The majority of such witnesses,
  contrary to popular belief, were originally highly skeptical about UFO's. Suddenly they had an experience which
  affected them profoundly, sometimes traumatically. Faced with the experience of the UFO event, witnesses are generally
  perplexed and uncertain as to what to do about it. Invariably they attempt to explain it in ordinary terms and fail.
  Curiosity overwhelms them yet they know that they will be targets for ridicule if they report (they confess that they
  had often in the past ridiculed others). Generally they first confide only in their own family, and often prefer to
  remain silent. Only those who finally report their observations furnish us with data for study. </p>
<p>Any serious investigator is aware that many unreported experiences must exist. Not only has a Gallup poll so
  indicated, but I frequently try the experiment of asking for a show of hands of those who either have had a puzzling
  UFO experience thenlselves or have heard of one from close friends. I generally find that more than 10 per cent of the
  audience will raise a hand. But when I ask for hands of all those who reported the event in some official manner, I
  find virtually no hands raised. Judging from this and other personal observations, I would estimate that for every
  officially reported UFO sighting there may exist dozens that have gone unreported. As scientists we should be
  astonished that high-S high-P reports have been made in the past five or ten years. What does a serious person with a
  valued reputation stand to gain by making such a report? Why do people go to the trouble of filling out
  questionnaires, of subjecting themselves to sometimes hostile inquiry, and of being the target of unpleasant
  attention? </p>
<p>The reason appears to be twofold. Witnesses have told me that they had not intended to say anything about their
  experience but they felt that it might be of importance to the government, or to science, and felt it their duty to
  report. The second reason is curiosity. They want to know whether anyone else experienced the same event, and whether
  the event has a rational explanation. They are visibly reassured when I tell them, if it be the case, that their
  sighting fits a pattern and resembles other reported sightings from various parts of the world. </p>
<p>What are the patterns of UFO reports? How can we classify UFO reports (after screening) as an aid to their study?
  Clearly, if each UFO report represents a unique happening, the UFO is not amenable to scientific study. Such a
  classification, however, must be free of any preconceived ideas as to the nature and cause of UFO's. Thus the
  classification must be descriptive; it should be similar to the classification of stellar spectra in the days before
  we had a theory of stellar spectra, or somewhat like the classification of galaxies today. </p>
<p>I have adopted a very simple classification system based solely on the manner of observation. Such a system tells us
  nothing, of course, about the nature of the UFO, but it can suggest a means of gathering further data. There seem to
  be four basic ways in which the UFO presents itself, so to speak, for human observation: (1) as "nocturnal lights,"
  the objects to which the lights are presumably attached being generally barely, if at all, discernible, (2) as
  "daylight disks," when the UFO generally, though not necessarily, appears as a disk or long oval; (3) as "close
  encounters" during day or night: these are sightings made at ranges less than 1,000 feet and often accompanied by
  physical effects on the land, on plants and animals, and occasionally on humans; and (4) radar UFO's, a special subset
  of which is the radar-visual observation, in which the radar and visual observations are mutually supporting. These
  observational classifications are not meant to be mutually exclusive. Clearly a nocturnal light might be a daylight
  disk in the daytime, and both might become close-encounter or radar cases. </p>
<p>Let us examine each category. A nocturnal-light report offers the least potential for scientific study, as it has the
  fewest information elements and thus a low strangeness index. The nocturnal-light UFO can be defined as a light or
  combination of lights whose kinematic behavior passes through the "UFO report filter"; that is, it cannot be logically
  ascribed to balloons, aircraft, meteors, planets, satellites, satellite reentries, or missiles. The experienced
  investigator generally has no difficulty with the screening process here. Years of checking enable him to filter these
  out almost at first glance. Of course, should a UFO choose to masquerade as a hot-air balloon or a photographic
  night-air exercise, there is no easy way of differentiation, at least so long as we are limited to observing from the
  ground. If we had immediate reaction capabilities, and could dispatch an interceptor aircraft, then we could clear the
  matter up quickly, or perhaps we would experience what has often been reported in the past twenty years: as the
  intercepting plane approaches the light in question, the light either suddenly goes out or seems to take off and soon
  outdistances the investigator. In that event the report earns its place as a haute-E haute-P member of the
  nocturnal-light category. </p>
<p>An example of this category is a case I investigated personally, involving five witnesses, the senior witness being
  the long-time associate director of a prominent laboratory at <a
    href="/org/us/region/ma/middlesex/cambridge/MIT/index.html">MIT</a>. The nocturnal light was first sighted by his
  son, who had been out airing the dogs. He came bounding into the house crying, "<q>There's a flying saucer
    outside!</q>" The senior observer picked up a pair of binoculars on his way out. He told me that he didn't expect to
  see anything unusual but was going out to see what the commotion was all about. For the following ten minutes he was
  engrossed in what he saw - the nature of the light, its motions, its hovering, and its take-off. He described the
  light as having a high color-temperature although essentially a point source, subtending less than a minute of arc in
  the binoculars. The five observers were fortunately able to compare it to an airliner and a helicopter, both of which
  passed by during the observation interval, and neither the motions nor lights of these craft bore any resemblance to
  those of the UFO, sous-classe <a
    href="../../../../../../../../observation/classification/hynek/nl/">LN</a>. The trajectory of the object was plotted
  against the framework of the branches of a denuded tree. This observer was a good one, and his report included the
  condition of his eyes and those of the members of his family. The adult observers were both far-sighted and the senior
  observer wore glasses only for reading. </p>
<p>Incidentally, all my attempts as scientific consultant to the Air Force, to mount a serious investigation of this
  case came to naught. The Bluebook evaluation is "unidentified," but somehow this word is not a challenge to inquiry.
  It has been classified as "unidentified," and therefore the case is "solved": it has been identified as
  "unidentified"! So certain is the Air Force, at least publicly, that all UFO reports must represent normal things that
  they see no point to serious investigation. During most of the time I acted as their consultant I repeatedly urged
  immediate reaction capability and proper scientific investigation, but to no avail. </p>
<p>The second category, the "daylight disk," covers reported daylight sightings of objects seen at moderate distances.
  The prototype report runs something like this: I was driving along and there crossed over in front of me a shiny
  metallic disk. It seemed about 500-1,000 feet above the road. It came down fairly close to the ground, stopped and
  hovered with a wobbling motion and then took off with incredible speed, straight up, and was gone in a few seconds.
  There was no noise. This category understandably has more photographs to support it than all the others put together.
  An example is the McMinnville, Oregon, case which the Condon Report lists as unsolved (Case 46). </p>
<p>Un <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Alberta">cas</a> <a
  href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/photo">photographique</a> de <a
  href="../../../../../../../../observation/classification/hynek/dd/">disque diurne</a> fut rapporté par 3 prospecteurs
  dans bush country près de Calgary, Alberta. J'ai personnellement enquêté sur le terrain, les gens, les négatifs et
  l'appareil <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/photo">photo</a>. <a
    href="/people/b/BeckmanFred">Fred Beckman</a> de l'Université de Chicago et moi-même nous sommes convaincus que les
  images sur ces négatifs couleur sont des images réelles. Le terrain, les interrogations des témoins, et la déclaration
  sous serment du témoin principal m'amènent tous à attribuer un haute note d'EP à ce cas.</p>
<p>The published literature on UFO's has many photographs. Some are clearly hoaxes, but many have never been
  investigated sufficiently to rule out very sophisticated hoaxes. A hoax is all one has to rule out, however. For if
  the daytime photo shows any detail at all, aircraft, balloons, and so forth may be immediately eliminated. The picture
  itself is sufficient to establish the Strangeness index; it is the credibility index that is difficult to assess.
  Proper interrogation, tracing of the processing history of the negative, microscopic and microphotometric examination
  of the negative, plus proper psychological testing of the witnesses to the taking of the photograph should serve to
  rule out all but the most highly sophisticated, expensive, and laboriously contrived hoaxes. In any one case it is
  clearly impossible ever to state unequivocally that a photo of a daylight disk is genuine, but I would submit that
  twenty-five such separate photographic cases, each subjected to exhaustive tests, would allow us to say that the
  probability of a hoax in all twenty-five cases is vanishingly small. </p>
<p>Even this does not prove the existence of truly strange flying objects, but it should be sufficient to attract the
  proper attention of the scientific world. That, of course, has long been my position: that some UFO reports are worthy
  of serious scientific attention. Inherent in the sheaves of UFO reports may well be many doctoral dissertations for
  physicists, sociologists, and psychologists alike. </p>
<p>La 3ᵉ catégorie de rapports d'ovnis, la <q>rencontre rapprochée</q>, ouvre de loin le plus grand potentiel d'une
  étude scientifique. Since a close encounter obviously offers a greater chance for observation, we can expect, and we
  get, many more information elements, and hence a higher strangeness index. Here the theory of simple misperception
  fails utterly in explaining reports of craft landing 100 feet away, of visible marks left on the ground, of animals
  and people visibly affected, and of automobiles temporarily stopped on the road. Either we must say that the witnesses
  were mentally unbalanced or that something most interesting actually happened. However, I am not taking sides; I am
  merely reporting to you what is reported all around the world, and by seemingly competent witnesses.
</p>
<p>I divide the close encounter cases into 3 subdivisions: the close encounter, with little detail; the close encounter
  with physical effects; and the close encounter in which "humanoids" or occupants are reported. This latter subgroup,
  of course, has the highest strangeness index and frightens away all but the most hardy investigators. I would be
  neither a good reporter nor a good scientist were I deliberately to reject data. There are now on record some 1,500
  reports of close encounters, about half of which involve reported craft occupants. Reports of occupants have been with
  us for years but there are only a few in the Air Force files; generally Project Bluebook personnel summarily, and
  without investigation, consigned such reports to the "psychological" or crackpot category. </p>
<p>A prototype of the simple close encounter goes like this: Witnesses are driving along a lonely road when the driver
  spies a strange glare in his rear-view mirror. He becomes frightened and increases his speed, trying to outdistance
  the UFO, but he cannot. He stops the car and tries to take cover. Shortly the light rises and vanishes quickly in the
  distance. It is easy to say that such witnesses are mentally unbalanced, unless one must say it to their faces,
  especially knowing that they are respected members of their communities and hold responsible positions. </p>
<p>The close encounter with physical effects is the category that interests me most, since the reported effects on
  animal, vegetable, and mineral are potentially measurable. For instance, there are more than a hundred reports on
  record of UFO's that reportedly caused car ignition failures. In a typical case a bright light suddenly appears and
  seems to seek out the witnesses' car. As it stops to hover over the car, the car lights dim, or fail, and the engine
  dies. Often the occupants of the car report feeling hot and prickly. After a few minutes the apparition leaves, and
  the car returns to normal operation, but the witnesses often do not; their equanimity is temporarily destroyed. </p>
<p>Witnesses of such encounters do not readily submit themselves to interrogation. Often they tell no one for days, or
  they tell only very close associates. Eventually a serious UFO investigator conies to hear about it, and then the
  story unfolds. If they unwisely tell their story indiscriminately, their lives are made miserable by ridicule and
  taunts of unsympathetic friends. </p>
<p>Let us consider the probabilities in car-failure cases. On the road we occasionally pass a disabled car, its hood up,
  waiting for the repairman or the tow truck. We should regard it as odd, and of low probability, if the car were to
  heal itself after a few minutes and proceed as though nothing had happened. If we add that this event was accompaned
  by a very bright unexplained light hovering over the car, then I submit that the probabilities are extremely small.
  And when we deal with dozens of such cases, we are driven to the conclusion that something most extraordinary must
  have happened. If we have in these cases what Goudge calls "genuinely new empirical observations [requiring] new
  explanation schemes," then we can anticipate an exceptional scientific breakthrough, although it may not be just
  around the corner. </p>
<p>In this twentieth century we may be as far from a solution of the UFO problem as nineteenth century physicists were
  from an interpretation of the aurora borealis. Even so, it is incumbent upon us as scientists to document and study
  the phenomenon to the best of our ability. But the present lack of continued scientific study still leaves it unclear
  whether genuinely new empirical observations exist. Even the Condon Report left unexplained about one-quarter of the
  cases examined. </p>

    conventionnelles de ce rapport ne peuvent être entièrement exclues</q> <span class="source">[p. 164]</span>. In
  actuality, a careful reading of the body of the Condon Report reveals as good a case for the scientific study of UFO's
  as could have been assembled by a group not initially conversant with the subject and with limited time and funds.

<p>Some may be surprised that so considerable a body of UFO evidence exists. This is the crux of the problem: neither
  the active scientists nor the public have access to this information. Unfortunately, those who wish to learn about
  UFO's must get information from the "back fences" of literature - the pulp magazines, the sensational mystery or sex
  magazines. Until recently, there has not been in this country one scientific journal in which I could publish a
  well-documented UFO case, yet a recent bibliography of UFO literature ran to 400 pages. The UFO has become a problem
  for the librarian sooner than it has for the scientist. </p>
<p>Consider the plight of serious UFO witnesses. I know that such exist because I have interviewed several hundred.
  Where can they go to report? Only the most naive would report to the Air Force even if Project Bluebook had not been
  discontinued. To report to the local police is scarcely better. Many witnesses have told me of the ridicule they met
  when they took that path. Besides, I have seen many police blotters. UFO reports are entered as "complaints." </p>
<p>The witness, if he wishes to report, must seek out the relatively few persons or organizations which will lend a
  sympathetic ear. My own mail brings me very good UFO reports, generally with a request for anonymity, but I have
  neither the time nor the funds to make proper investigations. As I look back over my past twenty-one years'
  association with the UFO problem, I note that the intellectual climate today is enormously better for taking a good
  look at it than it was even a few years ago. This symposium is itself an example: it would have been impossible to
  have held it a year or two ago. And had I, earlier, attempted to call for a major investigation, I would have lost
  credibility and undoubtedly all possible future effectiveness. </p>
<p>In summary, then, my twenty-one years of monitoring of UFO reports has shown that reports of UFO observations remain
  after we delete the pronouncements of crackpots, visionaries, religious fanatics, and so forth. A large number of UFO
  reports are readily indentifiable by trained investigators as misperception of known objects and events. A small
  residue of UFO reports are not so identifiable. These come from such widely separated places as northern Canada,
  Australia, South America, and Antarctica. They are made by competent, responsible, psychologically normal people - in
  short, credible witnesses. These reports contain descriptive terms which collectively do not specify any known
  psychological event, object, or process, and which do not specify any known psychological event or process. And,
  furthermore, they resist translation into terms that do apply to known physical and/or psychological events, objects,
  and processes. That is, as Goudge points out, translation would alter the meaning of the original report and hence
  effectively violate the methodological criteria governing the advance of science: namely (a) that it must be possible
  for new observational data to occur; that is, the existing conceptual framework of science, or the attitudes of
  scientists, must not rule out such new data a priori; and (b) the existing conceptual framework must allow new
  concepts, principles, and laws to be formulated to interpret and explain the new observational data. </p>
<p>Although I know of no hypothesis that adequately covers the mountainous evidence, this should not and must not deter
  us from following the advice of Schroedinger: to be curious, capable of being astonished, and eager to find out. </p>
