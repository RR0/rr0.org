<p>With deep sadness we received the news that <span class="people" title="James E. McDonald">Jim McDonald</span>,
  author of the UFO case study on page 66, has taken his life. </p>
<p>The history of the UFO problem has been full of unusual and tragic events. Men of highest scientific achievements
  have seen themselves involved in strongly opposing views. Others have become victims of vitriolic attacks or, perhaps
  worse, of ridicule. McDonald was one of them. </p>
<p>As is well known, <span class="people">McDonald</span> believed UFO observations, especially those by professionals,
  cannot be ignored and that the <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses/intelligence/HET/index.html">extraterrestrial hypothesis</a> cannot
  be ruled out. The members of the <a href="/org/us/asso/AIAA.html">AIAA</a> UFO Subcommittee have concluded that the
  question is unsettled. </p>
<p>It is too early to know if <span class="people">McDonald</span> was right or wrong. It is our hope, however, that his
  article in this issue will be read by scientists and engineers with the attention and impartiality that <span
      class="people">McDonald</span>—and the observing aircraft crew—deserve.
