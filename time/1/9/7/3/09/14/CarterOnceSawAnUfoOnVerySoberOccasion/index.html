  <p>DUBLIN- Gov. Jimmy Carter doesn't scoff at people who report UFO sightings, because he saw one himself about three
    years ago. And, Carter quipped, "it was on a very sober occasion." </p>
  <p>Carter said he saw a blue, disc-shaped object during a campaign stop in Leary, a South Georgia town in the same
    general area where numerous UFOs have been reported recently. </p>
  <p>The object came into view as Carter and several members of the Leary Lions Club stood outside the hall where
    Carter was to speak. All the members of the group observed the object for about five to ten minutes, Carter said. He
    immediately went to a tape recorder and dictated a description of what he remembers as "a very remarkable
    sight." </p>
  <p>"It was about 30 degrees above the horizon and looked about as large as the moon. It got smaller and changed to a
    reddish color and then got larger again," Carter recalled. </p>
  <p>Carter speculated that the UFO "was probably an electronic occurrence of some sort," rather than a visitation from
    outer space. At any rate, the governor said, "it was obviously there, and obviously unidentified." </p>
  <p>Carter recounted the experience during a stop here on his statewide listening tour. </p>
