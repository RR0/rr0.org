      <li> On 18 October 1973 at 2305 hours in the vicinity of Mansfield, Ohio, Army Helicopter 68-15444 assigned to
        Cleveland USARFFAC encountered a near midair collision with a unidentified flying object. Four crewmembers
        assigned to the Cleveland USARFFAC for flying proficiency were on AFTP status when this incident occurred. The
        flight crew assigned was CPT Lawrence J. Coyne, Pilot in Command,1LT Arrigo Jozzi, Copilot, SSG Robert Yanacsek,
        Crew Chief, SSG John Healey, Flight Medic. All the above personnel are member of the 316th MED DET(HEL AMB). a
        tenant reserve unit of the Cleveland USARFFAC. </li>
      <li>The reported incident happened as follows: Army Helicopter 68-15444 was returning from Columbus, Ohio to
        Cleveland, Ohio and at 2305 hours east, south east of Mansfield Airport in the vicinity of Mansfield, Ohio while
        flying at an altitude of 2500 feet and on a heading of 030 degrees, SSG Yanacsek observed a red light on the
        east horizon,90 drgrees to the flight path of the helicopter. Approximately 30 seconds later, SSG Yanacsek
        indicated the object was converging on the helicopter at the same altitude at a airspeed in excess of 600 knots
        and on a midair collision heading. Cpt Coyne observed the converging object, took over the controls of the
        aircraft and initiated a power descent from 2500 feet to 1700 feet to avoid impact with the object. A radio call
        was initiated to Mansfield Tower who acknowledged the helicopter and was asked by CPT Coyne if there were any
        high performance aircraft flying in the vicinity of Mansfield Airport however there was no response received
        from the tower. The crew expected impact from the object instead, the object was observed to hesistate
        momontarily over the helicopter and then slowly continued on a westerly course accelerating at a high rate of
        speed, clear west of Mansfield Airport then turn 45 degree heading to the Northwest. Cpt Coyne indicated the
        altimeter read a 1000 fpm olimp and read 3500 feet with the collective in the full down position. The aircraft
        was returned to 2500 feet by CPT Coyne and flown back to Cleveland, Ohio. The flight plan was closed and the FAA
        Flight Service Station notified of the incident. The FSS told CPT Coyne to report the incident to the FAA GADO
        office a Cleveland Hopkins Airport Mr. Porter, 83d USARCOM was notified of the incident at 1530 hours on 19 Oct
        73.</li>
