<p>Le peuple des ovnis ayant déclaré mener une investigation scientifique sur Terre, on pourrait s'attendre à ce qu'ils
  aient été observés dans le processus. Une étude approfondie de la Terre nécessiterait une énorme variété d'activités.
  Concernant l'environnement naturel, il serait nécessaire de collecter et analyser toutes sortes d'échantillons, dont
  des plantes et des animaux, des roches et des sols, de l'eau, et l'atmosphère. Des mesures instrumentales, comme la
  gravité, le magnétisme, la substructure géologique et la radioactivité, seraient requises. Au final, des installations
  humaines d'un intérêt particulier seraient inspectées et des échantillons de produits industriels seraient
  recueillis.</p>
<h2>Recueillir des échantillons</h2>
<p>Un intérêt considerable pour les plantes, naturelles comme cultivées, a été affiché. En France, 2 nains ont examiné
  des plants de lavande cultivés commercialement pour leur fragrance <span class="source">Cae 650</span>. Des plants de
  tomates ont attiré l'attention de 2 autres au Brésil <span class="source">Cas 701.</span>, tandis que des associés en
  une autre occasion ont recueilli des plants de tabac <span class="source">Cas 353.</span>. Des efforts plus
  entreprenants et mieux organisés au Portugal ont impliqué la récolte de <q>fleurs, arbustes et brindilles dans une
    boîte brillante</q> <span class="source">Cas 154.</span>. <q>De la pelouse, des herbes, et des feuilles d'arbre</q>
  étaient l'objectif de 3 petits hommes au Brésil <span class="source">Cas 327.</span>. <q>Avec des sourires montrant de
    belles dents blanches</q>, 2 nains ont pris un pot de fleurs à une femme italienne <span
      class="source">Cas 324.</span>. D'autres cas sont moins explicites : <q>ils ont rassemblé des plantes</q>, <q>ramassé
    quelque chose</q>, etc.</p>
<p>Un prospecteur brésilien vit 2 nains <q>creusant un trou</q> <span class="source">Cas 541.</span>. 2 autres furent
  vus par un producteur de produits laitiers à New York, chacun portait un bac de <q>ce qui semblait être du sol extrait
    du champ</q> <span class="source">Cas 596, source d'origine.</span>. Au Venezuela, des pierres furent ramassées et
  examinées <span class="source">Cas 862.</span>, et dans un autre cas, 2 nains sautèrent dans un appareil sphérique <q>en
    portant des pierres et d'autres échantillons</q> <span class="source">Cas 344.</span>. </p>
<p>Parmi divers types d'animaux qui auraient été emportés à bord d'ovnis se trouvent une poule <span class="source">Cas 353.</span>,
  et, malgré l'objection du propriétaire, des lapins domestiques <span class="source">Cas 339.</span>. Des tentatives at
  acquiring dogs have met with some difficulty. Frisky, a dog owned by a 12-year-old boy, was seen in a field with other
  dogs near a UFO and four normal- looking people, two men and two women. Frisky growled and backed away when one of the
  men tried to grab him. The man then attempted to catch one of the other dogs, but let go when he was bitten. (13)
  Another dog owner was rather abusive when a dwarf asked him for his pet. The dwarf was sent fleeing back into his
  craft with "Get the hell out of here." (14)</p>
<p>In areas where UFOs have been active for several days, it is commonly reported that many farm animals, including
  cattle, are missing. The residents usually attribute their losses to the UFOs without any direct evidence of theft. A
  newspaper in Rio de Janeiro and local papers at Manaus, in the State of Amazonas, on September 18, 1962, carried
  reports that flying saucers had carried off seventeen chickens, six pigs, and two cows from the Barcelos district.
  Proof of this pudding, however, occurred near Twin Falls, Idaho, where the victims watched the culprits. People from a
  UFO were seen loading a steer into their machine, which was estimated to be 200 feet in diameter. The witnesses were a
  local attorney, the ranch owner, and two hired hands. (15)</p>
<p>Most, if not all, of these instances of collecting samples are at least compatible with the notion of an objective
  study. But some of the items taken by the dwarves may relate to their personal need; that is, fresh food. chicken
  gumbo, fried rabbit, or steak might be a delectable change to a diet of cookies "made of corn and wheat flour" plus
  other ingredients that were observed being cooked on a UFO. The witness obtained four of the cookies which were later
  tested, eaten, and analyzed. (16)</p>
<p>Collection of water has been reported frequently. It would be adequate to take small samples of water in a vial for
  determination of the dissolved minerals and the level of pollution, either chemical or bacterial. UFO people, however,
  sometimes take substantial amounts of water. A Canadian and his wife in 1950 saw a large UFO with portholes "come to
  rest on the surface of the lake." Ten small people on a deck busily "immersed a hose in the lake" as if pumping water
  into the craft. (17) An almost identical performance, also in Canada, had been observed 36 years earlier when eight
  witnesses saw dwarves plunging a hose into a lake from a spherical craft resting on the water. (18) While fishing in
  New York, an electronics engineer saw an object land. Two dwarves "came out with a hose and pumped water from the
  river." (19) Another fisherman in Italy saw a UFO hover for 10 minutes over a river with "a hose that plunged into the
  water." (20) These uses of hoses imply collection of a substantial volume of water, probably more than could be
  carried in buckets on several round trips. Any such amount would clearly exceed the immediate requirements of the
  collectors, and one suspects that it filled the need of a considerable number of their fellows somewhere else.</p>
<p>The intended purpose for water, on one occasion, was made entirely clear to a chicken farmer in Wisconsin. An object
  came down vertically near his house in which he saw three men through an open hatch. One of them handed him a "silvery
  jug with two handles" and "made a motion like drinking." The jug was filled with water and returned. (21) This case is
  reminiscent of a previously mentioned request for water by a strange woman in Brazil who used the word, "Rempaua."
  (22) In yet another instance, two fair-skinned men emerged from a UFO in Chile asking a miner for water in a "mixture
  of English and Spanish." With unusual resourcefulness under the circumstances, the miner took some water out of his
  car radiator and gave it to them. (23) Small quantities of water were also obtained by the UFO people without
  assistance from humans. Two miners saw a UFO land on a sandbar in a California river. One dwarf got out and "filled a
  shiny pail with water and handed it to someone inside the craft." (24)Another craft landed at night near a Brazilian
  fisherman who watched one of three little men fill a "shiny metal tube with water from the river." (25)</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the declared purpose of the UFO people, these instances of collecting water, with one possible
  exception, have a distinctively unscientific tone. It appears that water is required for drinking, or other purposes,
  either by the individuals involved or a number of their colleagues. In view of the normally furtive behavior of these
  people, a face-to-face confrontation to request water carries a hint of some desperation.</p>
<p>Their interest in manufactured products seems to be minimal. A railroad worker was surprised when a strange being
  entered the sleeping coach where he was reading. After "pouring the contents of an oil can into a small bottle," he
  left. (26) This visitor apparently needed some oil rather urgently. The only other instance concerning a manufactured
  product occurred when two small men associated with a UFO were discussing agriculture with a farmer in New York. At
  their request, the farmer went to get some fertilizer, but upon returning, found that they had gone. He left the
  fertilizer. It, too, was gone the next day. (27)</p>
<h2>Inspections</h2>
<p>Somewhat more attention has been paid to a variety of man-made structures. Very commonly UFOs and their occupants
  have been observed in the vicinity of highways and railroads. These may only be convenient places to land, but a
  specific curiosity has been exhibited. For example, three dwarves were seen looking at railroad tracks with a light in
  the early morning hours. (28) Abandoned oil derricks in Texas attracted the attention of a figure about 1 meter tall
  who emerged from a huge UFO. (29) An object fitting the description of a UFO was seen on the ground near the site of
  the first A-bomb explosion in New Mexico, although no occupants were discerned. (30)</p>
<p>Dispersal of an array of apparatus on the ground near a landed UFO and diligent work with some kind of equipment
  would suggest scientific data gathering. Only two instances might be understood in this context. Human figures came
  out of an egg-shaped object in Ohio and "placed small spheres around the craft." (31) Perhaps the same type of device
  was involved in the appearance of a man in Argentina who held a "pale blue sphere in his hand." (32)</p>
<p>In summary, the idea that the UFO people are conducting any kind of organized and thorough scientific study on earth
  is not sustained by the available information. Instead, their activities on the ground are strangely haphazard and
  disorganized. Aside from the collection of vegetables, small animals, and water, possibly for consumption, other
  samples seem to be selected at random. Also, inspection of man-made facilities seems to be more a matter of curiosity
  than an organized study. Instead of conducting a comprehensive survey of earth, the UFO people appear to be randomly
  snooping around or searching for some particular, natural commodity on earth, either vegetable or mineral.</p>
<h2>Emergencies</h2>
<p>Sometimes the observed activities are not related to investigation of the surroundings because the visitors'
  attention is focused upon the craft itself. In January 1967, a UFO about 80 ft in diameter settled on its tripod
  landing gear on a highway in Minnesota. From an elevator descended from the underside, a man wearing blue coveralls
  and a glass helmet stepped out. "He seemed to check something" before leaving. (33) Similar inspections were observed
  in France, (34) San Salvador, (35) Argentina (36) and Minnesota. (37) Taking advantage of a landing in Brazil to check
  their vehicle, the pilots also investigated the area and "gathered samples in a huge box." (38) Actual repairs were
  sometimes required. A French woman, approaching to within 30 meters of a landed disc, stated "that a man was repairing
  it." (39) External repairs were also made on vehicles that landed in Minnesota (40) and Denmark (41)</p>
<p>Maintenance or adjustment of equipment inside a craft may also require a landing. After touching a landed machine, a
  Libyan farmer was warned with gestures by one of its occupants to stay away. He watched for 20 minutes as six men
  inside were "apparently busy with instruments." (42) Of course, they may have been taking some kind of measurements,
  but such interpretation seems unlikely in view of the following incident. One of two UFOs flying at low altitude
  settled to the ground near an amateur prospector in a remote area of Canada. He sat quietly for 20 to 30 minutes
  sketching the object but seeing no activity. Then, as a door opened, he smelled an odor like "a burned-out electrical
  motor." (43) Because the odor clearly came from inside the craft, it appears that the landing was forced to correct a
  malfunction of electrical machinery or circuitry, or to put out a fire. In two instances, figures inside their vehicle
  were observed to be busy with electrical apparatus. A man outside a landed machine in Argentina was studying a piece
  of paper while a companion inside was "seated before an instrument panel." (44) Three figures stood on a platform
  under a landed UFO in Brazil, apparently guarding the vehicle as they were armed, while another was seen through a
  transparent top seemingly "using a keyboard." (45)</p>
<p>In other words, some landings occur in which the occupants display no interest in their surroundings. The purpose of
  the landing seems to be inspection of parts outside the vehicle and making necessary repairs. Alternately, complete
  attention is focused upon instrument panels and control boards within the vehicle. This group of cases appear to be
  emergency landings to fix something that either malfunctioned or threatened to fail. While UFOs clearly represent an
  advanced technology, they apparently are not foolproof. In a large number of missions, therefore, one would expect
  that occasionally the necessary repairs could not be accomplished and the UFO would have to be abandoned on the
  ground. Or, an equipment failure in flight would result in disintegration of the craft or a devastating crash on the
  ground. The record indicates that both types of mishaps have occurred.</p>
<p>A UFO in Brazil, flying at low altitude with serious difficulty, suddenly pulled up, whereupon it "disintegrated into
  thousands of fiery fragments, which fell sparkling with magnificent brightness.'' Some of the fragments, extinguished
  in shallow water, were later determined to be magnesium. (46) In 1952, wreckage of a UFO was found on Spitzbergen
  Island in the Arctic Ocean. Investigation was conducted by a Norwegian Board of Inquiry, which later announced: "It
  has - this we wish to state emphatically - not been built by any country on earth." (47) Both these incidents were
  studied by the Condon Committee and neatly, but dubiously, dispatched. Three more UFO crashes in the American deserts
  were described in 1950. One of these involved a saucer-shaped craft 100 ft in diameter in which 16 little people were
  killed. Their heights ranged from "about 36 to 42 inches." (48) These reports have never been adequately investigated
  and described publicly because the vehicles and the bodies were reportedly commandeered by the Air Force.</p>
<h2>Personnel Transfers</h2>
<p>An effective method of secretly investigating a limited area would be for a UFO to land at night, discharge a
  reconnaissance team, then fly away. Upon completing their mission, the team would signal for a pickup or meet the
  craft at some prearranged location and time. Something like this was apparently in process when a guard in New York
  saw a cigar-shaped machine land in a parking lot one evening at 10:15 p.m. While he was watching the object in the
  beam of his truck headlights, two dwarves dressed in "shiny black uniforms" ran out of the darkness and entered the
  craft, which took off immediately. Black uniforms seem to be singularly appropriate for a surreptitious outing at
  night. (49) Obviously two crafts would have to land together for an occupant of one of them to transfer to the other.
  Just such a situation was observed in Central Australia by a group of Unmatjera aborigines in 1951. They were looking
  at a UFO on the ground when another one like it landed nearby. A dwarf came from under the late arrival, ran over to
  the parked craft, and climbed aboard through the bottom. (50) Three years later in France, several witnesses even saw
  a double transfer. Two discs in the sky with a "sort of luminous bridge between them" were seen to land together. One
  dwarf came out of both vehicles, passing each other without hesitation, to enter the opposite craft. Then both flew
  away. (51) These little dramas unfortunately give no clues as to why the transfers were made, but they clearly
  identify another purpose for UFO landings.</p>
<h2>Summary on Landings</h2>
<p>As with many other inquiries, the eventual answer turns out to be more complex than was initially suspected. So it
  was with the reasons that UFOs abandon the safety of the skies to hover close to the ground or actually land. Reports
  by witnesses clearly indicate that landings are most frequently associated with investigation of the surroundings by
  the UFO people. They often collect samples of a wide variety, but in a seemingly unsystematic way. An undefined need
  for water in quantities ranging from approximately one quart to hundreds of gallons brought several UFOs to the
  ground, and under conditions of urgency, human assistance was solicited. Malfunction of propulsion or control systems
  has evidently forced landings for inspections and repairs. Discharging or picking up passengers and transferring
  individuals between UFOs is sometimes required. One further purpose for landing, related to investigation of humans,
  is treated in the next section.</p>
<h2>Infiltration</h2>
<p>From the foregoing discussion it is suspected that UFO people of average height would have little difficulty in
  infiltrating modern society. They are obviously capable of breathing the earth's atmosphere and they could not be
  distinguished in a crowd by their appearance. Of course, they would benefit by being fluent in an appropriate language
  and they would have to wear common styles of clothing. In a well-planned mission, one or several of them could be
  landed in the middle of the night, not too far from a populated area, walk into town, and blend completely with the
  population on the sidewalks. Provided with adequate funds, they could establish residences, take jobs, and become an
  undifferentiated element of the society. A handsome young man named Valiant Thor claims that he came to earth in a
  space ship and was "landed in a clearing just north of High Bridge, New Jersey." Thereafter he mingled in a small
  crowd at a convention. He said that his mission, lasting three years, was to educate government leaders. He's not
  around anymore. (52)</p>
<h2>Personal Locomotion</h2>
<p>Every species of animal has a distinctive carriage of its body and a typical way of moving its limbs when walking or
  running. While the difference between species may be very slight, they are easily discerned. Even individual members
  within a species have a style of movement that can be identified. One can usually recognize a friend at great distance
  by that characteristic alone. Thus a close examination of the movements of the UFO people should be sensitive to any
  such peculiarities mentioned by the witnesses.</p>
<h2>Weak Gravity</h2>
<p>Most accounts of the UFO people indicate that they were moving about in an ordinary way as they walked near their
  craft, picked up something, or ran back to the craft and climbed aboard. Somewhat unusual movements, however, were
  displayed in France in 1957 by four dwarves who had a waddling gait. (53) That same type of movement was undoubtedly
  observed by a farm woman in Peru, who described six dwarves that "walked like ducks." (54) Because of the multiplicity
  of dwarves in both of these cases, the observations must be taken as characteristic of the species rather than
  idiosyncratic. Other strange styles of walking included jerky motions, (55) stiff-legged, (56) and with feet together
  in a series of jumps. (57) One is struck by the similarity between these descriptions and the odd gaits adopted by the
  Apollo astronauts as they walked about on the lunar surface. Anyone who watched the television broadcasts will recall
  how they bounded forward in a series of galloping jumps, turned by twisting their torsos, and cavorted about with
  childlike movements. The implication is that UFO people are similarly experiencing a gravity on earth less than they
  are accustomed to; this point is emphatic in a few reports. A professor in Brazil noted that upon re-entering their
  craft, two men of average height jumped up the stairway lightly, holding only by one hand, whereas he had to use both
  hands when he followed them. (58) Two dwarves in Venezuela came out of the bushes with their arms full of what
  appeared to be earth or rocks, and they leaped with great ease into a luminous sphere hovering six feet above the
  ground. (59) A truly impressive and significant performance was seen by a Brazilian survey worker, who watched for
  half an hour as three 7-foot-tall beings, with extraordinary agility, leaped, gamboled, and tossed huge stones before
  boarding their craft. (60)</p>
<p>The argument that the UFO people have a home somewhere on earth has not been very convincing (61) and the only
  alternative, for physically real beings, is that their home is somewhere else. Exactly where is not known, but that
  issue is probed in another chapter. The point here is limited to considering gravity. Relative to the gravitational
  strength on earth, taken as 1.0g, the surface gravity of planets in our solar system varies rather widely from a
  minimum of 0.27g on Mercury to a maximum of 2.64g on Jupiter. Only three of the nine planets have gravity within 20%
  of that on earth. (62) The gravitational field in the astronomical homeland of the UFO people, whether in this solar
  system or some other is not likely to be the same as on earth, or even very close to it. Through the space program,
  the human body has been found to be surprisingly tolerant to extremes of gravity or the forces of acceleration that
  are equivalent. On lunar flights, the astronauts must sustain the short-term accelerations during rocket burns, the
  long-term weightlessness in earth or lunar orbit and enroute to the moon, the weak gravity of 1.6g while exploring the
  lunar surface or resting in the Lunar Excursion Module. If adequately supported in a semi-reclining position, the
  astronauts can even endure the forces of re-entering the earth's atmosphere, amounting to 8 to l0g, without
  unacceptable loss of mental, visual, or manual ability. But walking, struggling to stay upright, in a strong
  gravitational field is another matter. It should be possible for a man to walk in a field of 2g, where his weight
  would be twice normal. It would require great strength, and the extra exertion would tire him quickly. In 3g, it is
  doubtful that he could do any more than crawl around very laboriously, if at all. Consequently, man will not be
  exploring heavenly bodies where the gravity is much greater than on earth without some mechanical reinforcement of his
  limbs and an auxiliary power source, a concept that has been under active development for many years. Exploration of
  planets and satellites having lesser gravity, however, is relatively easy and apparently enjoyable. As these
  considerations should apply equally to residents of other worlds that wished to explore the cosmos, the odds are that
  their target planets would have relatively weaker gravity. In all probability, gravity in the homeland of the UFO
  people is substantially greater than here, as attested by their agility on earth and their lack of special equipment
  for walking.</p>
<p>Creatures of nature proliferate in nearly infinite forms, each finding a narrow ledge of existence that provides an
  adequate food supply and suitable living conditions. Despite the enormous variety, they are all governed by the
  environmental factors dictated by nature, such as temperature, pressure, light, and gravity, which is of special
  interest here. What kind of creatures and plants, would live on earth if its gravity were only one-fourth the present
  strength? Or four times the present strength? Some differences would certainly be noted. But judging from the happy
  existence on earth of creatures of all sizes from the ant to the elephant, the strength of gravity does not severely
  limit the size of living things. It governs their bodily proportions in relation to their total weight. This point can
  be understood most readily in the context of plants and trees. A tree trunk, for example, must be strong enough to
  support the total weight of the tree. It must also resist structural failure in buckling, that is, bending outward at
  the middle, then collapsing. This same concept applies to the limbs of animals, which must be even stronger and more
  rigid. Larger creatures are required by gravity to have relatively sturdier limbs. The cross-section must be greater
  in proportion to the length, as for elephants compared to ants. This relationship would be intensified for stronger
  gravity and mollified for weaker. Hence, the bodily forms of the UFO people should contain a clue to the gravity of
  their homeland if it were different than that on earth. These creatures, spanning the considerable range of heights
  from about 0.5 to 3.0 meters, are uniformly judged to be skinny by human standards. This observation implies that
  their native gravity is less than that on earth. As many other ramifications are involved, no definite conclusion is
  possible. Not only is the sturdiness of animal limbs controlled by gravity, but so is nearly every other aspect of
  their existence, such as metabolic rate, surface area, respiration frequency, and heart rate. These quantities,
  expressible in mathematical form, are related to the prevailing gravity. (63) A thin body form could also be an
  advantage in disposing of heat in a warm climate. Clearly, a great deal of effort is required to clarify this
  subject.</p>
<h2>Flying</h2>
<p>Upon first exposure to the UFO literature, the reader is prone to ignore any reference to the dwarves seen hovering
  or flying through the air, or to dismiss the story as totally beyond the UFO phenomenon. Maintaining a mental
  tranquility during extensive reading, however, is not so easy. In the sample cases under study, the UFO people were
  reportedly flying on numerous occasions, and these events must be objectively examined.</p>
<p>A man in Venezuela saw an object in flight that landed near a bridge. He first thought it was a heron, but then saw
  that it was a little man with all the characteristics of the UFO dwarves. (64) Upon being awakened by the shaking of
  his bed, another witness saw a small creature fly out an open window toward a dazzling light. (65) When a dwarf was
  disturbed by a racetrack employee while attacking a horse in a barn, he "zoomed" out the door. (66) These strange
  observations standing alone might be disregarded in the absence of the following ones, which specifically link the
  flying creatures to UFOs.</p>
<p>The normal way that UFO people enter their craft is through a hatch or doorway in the side, by stepping into an
  elevator that has been let down from a hovering craft, or by climbing up a stairway on the underside. If it is too
  high or they are in a great hurry, they simply fly to it. A small creature dressed in shiny clothes seemed to "fly" as
  he moved toward a craft hovering less than 2 meters above the ground. It "opened up" and the creature "popped inside."
  (67) Two creatures in white suits and helmets were seen in Canada to fly back into a large disc-shaped craft. (68) Two
  children in France saw "four little devils" that hovered, flew around a 2-meter sphere, then dived into it. (69) Only
  two days later in Venezuela with little chance of communication, a police officer saw a dwarf wearing a
  silver-colored, metallic-looking coverall. The dwarf lifted one foot, then the other, and flew up toward an object
  overhead and sailed into an open door. (70) The prominence of clothing in these cases should be noted.</p>
<p>While these observations are truly baffling, they are elementary compared to the next two that, oddly enough, furnish
  a clue to comprehension. A twenty-three-year-old woman and her parents saw a strange little man surrounded by a
  bluish-yellow glow as he soared over the neighbors rooftops. (71) Here is a direct association between flying and
  luminosity. The same relationship was reported for the taller UFO people when a strange being 2.l0-m tall was seen
  hovering in the air near a bright object; his body emitted a peculiar glow. (72) The bodies of two dwarves appeared to
  glow with lights of changing colors as they emerged from a landed vehicle in New York. (73) The idea that the bodies
  were emitting light has probably been confused by the witnesses with luminescence of the clothing and the atmosphere
  surrounding the creatures. Three giants, 3 meters tall, wore luminous clothing as they came out of a huge machine over
  10 stories high. (74) A minister in Ohio saw a silhouette wearing a luminous suit near his house. (75) A man 2.5 m
  tall wore luminous heelless boots as he inspected his craft in San Salvador. (76) The aerial activity of luminous
  bodies and changing colors sounds all too familiar; it closely parallels the emission of light from UFOs in flight.
  Apparently, the type of propulsion system used by these people for personal flying is the same as that employed to
  drive their vehicles. It would seem that the "shiny" quality of their clothing, the sheen or the radiance, is a
  necessary adjunct to the system, making the clothing most unusual and possibly explaining the lack of buttons,
  fasteners, and seams. With some kind of electromagnetic system involving the surface of the clothing, the
  discontinuities created by fasteners and seams would be undesirable. A gap between trouser cuffs and shoes seems to be
  avoided by making the shoes integral with the standard coveralls. Similar care to preserve extraordinary smoothness
  also applies to the surface of the vehicles.</p>
<p>Some other aspect of flying may have been involved in two isolated observations. Two boys in Brazil, ages 9 and 11,
  saw a luminous sphere at treetop level from which descended a tall being gliding down to the ground along two vertical
  beams of light. Since strong beams are frequently aimed downward from UFOs, they could have been extraneous to the
  descent for the being flew back up to the sphere without their benefit.(77) A more distinct indication that the light
  beams were important occurred in Venezuela about three years later. Two beings came out of an oval object through a
  system of light beams, and they returned to their craft "as if carried by the light." (78) Two men skiing through the
  woods near Helsinki furnished a very detailed description of this process. (79) Thus the aerial performance of at
  least three of the UFO people probably encompasses a use of light beams that is entirely unique.</p>
<p>In the previous section, it was observed that the UFO people did not wear special equipment to protect their bodies
  against strong gravity. This point was used to argue that they did not need it because they came from someplace where
  gravity was greater than on earth. It now becomes clear, however, that their remarkable clothing could well serve as a
  device to relieve the body of burdensome gravitational forces. If it is capable of offsetting the body weight entirely
  for the purpose of flying, it could also serve to offset any desired fraction of the body weight to facilitate walking
  in an abnormally high gravity. Numerous examples of the UFO people being seen as brightly luminous while walking on
  the ground, instead of flying, are ample indication of that usage. One very small creature was even seen quietly
  walking the streets of Chaclacay, Peru, leaving a luminous trail, a feature commonly associated with the vehicles and
  understandable in that context.(80) It appears that the clothing furnishes protection against gravity, and on that
  basis, the argument becomes admissible that the UFO people originate in gravity that is less than that on earth.</p>
<h2>Attitudes Toward Humanity</h2>
<p>With very minor exceptions, the UFO people clearly refrain from interfering in human affairs, even to the extent of
  evading detection. Avoidance of continental land masses and islands may be inferred from the frequency with which UFOs
  are seen to appear from the direction of the sea and to depart toward the sea. Considering the limited number of
  people traveling upon the oceans at any given instant, it is surprising that they have generated so many reports.
  Numerous observations of UFOs entering the oceans or erupting there from amidst great turbulence and then flying off
  have been collected and analyzed. In 1945, for example, crew members on the U.S. Army Transport Delarof were steaming
  toward Seattle in the northeastern Pacific. A large, round object, estimated to be 150 to 250ft in diameter, emerged
  from the sea, circled the ship two or three times, then flew off toward the south. (81) Similarly, an object off the
  coast of Italy caused an enormous bubble in the sea 1 kilometer from a boat carrying four people: it emerged, hovered
  briefly, and flew away at high speed. (82) Such events have also been observed in relation to numerous rivers and
  lakes. It is not known why UFOs frequent the waters of the earth, but while submerged in them they are certainly well
  hidden from mankind.</p>
<p>Most sightings merely involve metallic, disc-shaped craft traversing the sky with strange, jerky motions during the
  day, or the corresponding behavior of a bright light at night. To see a UFO at close range, hovering at low altitude,
  or resting on the ground is a rare event. Reliable statistics are not available, but the relative frequency of
  landings versus flybys can be crudely assessed. It has been estimated by a Gallup poll that five million Americans are
  convinced that they have seen UFOs. If only a modest fraction of this number were valid, the total number of sightings
  worldwide must still be quite large, say, on the order of 50,000,000! As for landings and near-landings, on the other
  hand, only about 1,000 have been documented, and it is not known how many observations may have gone unrecorded or how
  many landings went unobserved. The indication of rarity is clear, and based upon the very sketchy data at hand, one
  might place the landing-to-flyby ratio on the order of 1 in 10,000. No matter what the correct figures may be, the
  objectives of the UFO people seem to be largely achieved without landing.</p>
<p>And to make things worse, even these rare events take place almost exclusively at night. The frequency of short-range
  sightings rises quickly to a peak about one hour after sunset; sightings later in the evening and throughout the night
  decline as potential witnesses go to bed. (83) But this pattern of landings may be significant in another way. During
  the evening twilight, the brightness of direct sunlight is relieved, yet the level of general illumination is quite
  high enough for good visibility. It is possible that the UFO people dislike, or cannot tolerate, broad daylight, or
  any bright light for that matter. A few observations lend support to this idea. A policeman in Chalac, Argentina,
  along with about 50 Toba Indians, saw three little men getting out of a UFO. One of the witnesses started taking flash
  pictures of them and noticed that they were afraid of the bright light. (84) In California, a robot-like creature
  tried all night to dislodge a hunter from a tree in which he had taken refuge. The creature was kept at bay by the
  witness, who set fire to fragments of his clothing and threw them at his tormenter. (85) An attempted abduction in
  Brazil was frustrated because the witness noticed that the three 7-ft-tall people trying to catch him shunned bright
  sunlight. (86) From such flimsy data it is not possible to draw conclusions, but the suggestion is evident that the
  UFO people prefer to land after sunset because they are, like owls, bedazzled by ordinary daylight. Most animal eyes
  can accommodate to very low levels of light, but they are sharply limited in their capacity to block out excessive
  bright ness. The reluctance of the UFO people to expose themselves to bright light implies that they are accustomed to
  levels that may be very much weaker than daylight on earth. This prospect may explain why the dwarves have notably
  large, bulging eyes, and why some witnesses insist that they appear to have a reddish glow at night, like nocturnal
  animals. (87) Sunglasses, of course would be the simple answer to this problem, but they are not used. On the other
  hand, helmets made of tinted glass would serve very well. They would be highly reflective from the outside and would
  make it difficult for the witness to observe facial details of the wearer as is sometimes the case. It is not known
  whether the UFO people wear helmets more frequently when the illumination is high than in the dark of night.</p>
<p>It has also been shown that landings in France during a wave of activity in 1954 were correlated with areas of low
  population density. (88) In other words, the UFOs tended to avoid metropolitan areas in favor of farmlands or more
  isolated swamps and wood lands, a propensity that is also observed in other countries. It is remarkable under the
  circumstances that any detailed information is available concerning the behavior of UFO people on the ground, but
  there is enough data to verify their aloofness and to decipher something of their motives.</p>
<p>The typical, close-up sighting consists of the following stages:</p>
<p>1) The witness sees a UFO at considerable altitude and watches it approach, hover, and land nearby,<br> 2) One or
  more occupants emerges,<br> 3) They deliberately engage in some activity,<br> 4) They complete the work and reboard
  the craft, and<br> 5) The UFO takes off.</p>
<p>Roughly half of the sightings involving occupants followed this pattern to the letter. Such a consistent format
  implies that the UFO people selected a landing place where it was thought that they would not be observed. They
  proceeded to carry out their mission under the false impression and took no action to discover if they were being
  watched. These data might be understood to mean that the UFO people did not care whether they were being watched or
  not. This explanation, however, is untenable on the basis of the predominant isolation of landing sites. Nearly
  identical sequences occurred in many other cases, but with minor variations. The witness failed, for example, to see
  the actual landing, so the episode started at Stage 2; or the craft was hidden from view behind trees, thus preventing
  the observation of Stages 2 and 4. These variations strengthen rather than alter the conclusion that the UFO people
  deliberately sought to carry out a mission unobserved and thought that it had been so accomplished. Their presence and
  activities on earth were intended to be secret.</p>
<p>It is among the exceptions to the above, when an interaction takes place between the UFO people and the witnesses,
  that meaningful behavior patterns may be observed. Witnesses rarely say anything about facial expressions, which seem
  to be uniformly blank, although a few smiles have been evoked. (89) An English woman reported seeing two men looking
  out a hovering craft "sternly, not in an unkind fashion, but almost sadly, compassionately." (90) To a farm woman in
  Pennsylvania, the appearance of a man in a UFO seemed to be "quizzical." (91) Clearly, little regarding the attitude
  of the UFO people is to be gleaned from their facial expressions. With hardly any display of normal human warmth, the
  UFO people sometimes wave or make perplexing gestures (92) that are rarely interpreted as threatening, (93) or, in
  passing, they say something to the witness that is usually not understood. (94) The UFO people do not behave as though
  they feared humans. On the contrary, it is the witnesses that flee in panic. (95) An Italian saw a UFO from which
  emerged two men wearing yellow coveralls and wide belts. Upon noticing that the witness was afraid, one of them made a
  reassuring gesture before they departed. (96) Very generally, one might say that the UFO people are furtive, seldom
  display any emotion, and have a kindly but restrained disposition.</p>
<p>As occasional acts of aggression seem to be more in self-defense than from an innate hostility, any resulting
  injuries to the witnesses should probably be judged as accidental. An 18-year-old boy in Venezuela was paralyzed by a
  weapon when he discovered six dwarves loading stones into a UFO. (97) Such paralysis does not cause injury and it is
  usually quite temporary, lasting just long enough for the intruders to escape. But it may last for some time. When a
  French farmer surprised two dwarves who were examining a plant, he was immobilized when they aimed a small device at
  him. He was left alone in his field for 20 minutes, unable to move or call for help. And, as one would expect, he was
  thoroughly frightened. (98) The effect upon the nervous system of the weapons used in these attacks is unique: they
  usually inhibit voluntary control of the muscles without interfering with the involuntary body processes, or without
  rendering the victim unconscious.</p>
<p>Loss of consciousness, however, is sometimes induced by the weapon. A strange man in Illinois stunned witnesses by
  pointing a device at them that "made consciousness dissolve." (99) Upon approaching to within 2 meters of a large UFO
  in the Everglades, a hunter was knocked unconscious for 24 hours by a ray that struck him on the forehead. Upon
  awakening, he had lost sight in the right eye, saw poorly with the left, and had to be hospitalized for 5 days. (100)
  Other symptoms reported by victims of such attacks are electric shock, (101) burns, (102) physical displacement, (103)
  and headaches. (104)</p>
<p>Two or three types of weapons can be identified in 18 cases in which they were seen but not always used. Most
  prominent is a small metal tube that, from the brief descriptions, one judges to be slightly larger than a ballpoint
  pen. A larger device is similar to a 2-cell flashlight. Finally, a small flashing box also seems to be a weapon. In
  most instances, the UFO people were merely seen carrying this box (105) but one witness seems to have been injured by
  a figure armed with it. (106) A woman in luminous clothing standing beside a UFO in New York seemed to be well armed
  with a tube in one hand and a box in the other although she fired neither. (107)</p>
<p>A curious aspect of the weapons is that they eject a beam of light that is seen by the witnesses and reported to be a
  definite color, such as green, (108) blue, (109) violet, (110) and red, (111) or some times merely bright (112) or
  blinding. (113) The data are not sufficient to establish a correlation between the color of the light ray and its
  effect upon the witness, although the only two records of red rays and red balls of light both resulted in burning the
  witnesses. (114) And it is not possible to discover which effects upon the witnesses are produced by which weapons. A
  further implication that cannot be explored is that the intensity of the beam is variable at will and produces a
  greater or lesser effect upon the victim. All this discussion about ray guns "zapping" their targets into immobility
  sounds like science fiction. The witnesses, however, were serious and the last thing one does in a hoax is to injure
  himself. It would be most valuable to discover the exact nature of these weapons, for their use by law enforcement
  agencies would be extremely effective and humane. Actually, such a weapon may already have been developed. "Operation
  Zeke" was reportedly organized by the Federal Aviation Agency under the direction of Dr. H. L. Reighard to counter the
  epidemic of airplanes being hijacked to Cuba in the late sixties. A device based upon high-frequency radiation was
  developed that would instantly knock the victim unconscious; a hijacker between two ray boxes "would wake up wondering
  what happened to him." These devices were never used because of uncertainties and danger in the event of two hijackers
  on a plane. (115) This research should be brought into the open and completed so that society can benefit from the
  improved security that such weapons would provide.</p>
<p>In a famous case in New Jersey, a man and his wife were captured and taken aboard a UFO against their will for about
  two hours for the purpose of some biomedical experiments. (116) A young man in Brazil was also captured after a
  valiant struggle and taken aboard a UFO for a medical examination. In a period of two hours, he was also seduced by a
  strangely attractive woman, twice. (117) The implied meaning of this case is that the UFO people, being genetically
  compatible with humans, are themselves thoroughly human. It could be that they and humanity share a common ancestry,
  or that one group descended from the other. Which relationship is correct and how it occurred extends too far beyond
  the scope of this book for further comment here. Other attempts at capturing humans have failed (118) and actual
  abductions may have been witnessed by others. (119) The literature, of course, contains no reports from people that
  may have been spirited away permanently.</p>
<p>The UFO people are well aware of humanity, but with few exceptions, they do not wish to establish direct, friendly
  relationships. They prefer to conduct their activities on earth in secret, taking considerable care to avoid being
  seen. They will defend themselves if need be, but they intend no harm to mankind, even though for short-term
  experiments they will capture specimens.</p>
