<p>PASCAGOULA, Miss. (AP) - A weird thing happened to Charles Hickson and Calvin parker Jr. as they stood casting for
  croakers in the Pascagoula River. </p>
<p>They said a spaceship hovered nearby and three pale, wrinkled creatures seized them, took them inside for an
  examination, then let them go. </p>
<p>Mystified investigators found no logical way to debunk the story. </p>
<p>Authorities said whatever happened undoubtedly was a soul-searing experience for Hickson, a 45-year-old shipyard
  foreman, and his young visitor, the son of a family friend.</p>
<p>It took place last Oct. 11 near the beginning of a great flap over Unidentified Flying Objects - UFOs - along the
  Gulf Coast. </p>
<p>"I've done everything I can to prove I'm telling the truth," <a
    href="/people/h/HicksonCharlesE/index.html">Hickson</a> said recently.</p>
<p>He is a slightly stooped man of middle height with a monkish fringe of hair, a slow and serene Mississippi drawl. He
  has four children and lately has been working two jobs, which occupy him from 8 a.m. until 9:30 p.m.</p>
<p>"As long as I'm working, I don't have any problems, but when I don't have anything to do, I sit and think," he
  said.</p>
<p>"I don't reckon I'll ever get over trying to figure out where they came from and why they picked me." </p>
<p><a href="/people/h/HicksonCharlesE/index.html">Hickson</a>'s report, briefly stated, was:</p>
<p>He and Parker, 19, were fishing at an old shipyard site which has since been scraped clean for new construction. At
  the time, it bore the run of a barge drydock, two rusty iron piers, a jumble of auto hulks, empty bottles and beer
  cans. </p>
<p>Though it seemed an isolated spot, it was not. Pascagoula is directly across the 100-yard-wide river. Huge shipyard
  cranes loom a mile to the south; a busy highway is 150 yards to the north. </p>
<p>A soft darkness had fallen as the men cast their lures. An oblong luminous blue blob circled, descended, hovered
  nearby. </p>
<h2>BOTH MEN STUNNED</h2>
<p>Hickson said he and Parker were too stunned to run, and in any case there was no place to flee. </p>
<p>An opening - not a door, simply an indescribable opening - appeared in the side and three pale creatures came out,
  paralyzed him, floated him into the craft, rotated him before an instrument resembling a big eye, then put him back on
  the pier. </p>
<p>Parker, reported almost in shock when officers questioned him three hours after the alleged encounter, said he
  blacked out as the creatures approached and remembers no more of it. </p>
<p>"They weren't lying," said Howard Ellzy, chief investigator for the Jackson County sheriff's department. "Whatever it
  was, it was real to them." </p>
<p>Ellzy's evaluation was later backed up by a polygraph test given both men.</p>
<p>Since then, Parker, a shy, lanky, unsophisticated youth who came here to work at the shipyard with Hickson, has
  returned home to Laurel, Miss.</p>
<p>Joe Colingo, counsel for the shipyard, said Parker was first treated at a hospital for the stress of a "complete
  physical and emotional breakdown." </p>
<p>For Hickson, things have been a bit better than he expected when he decided that, "though I'll be the laughing stock
  of the country," he had to tell the story so government officials would know of it. </p>
<p>Government officials didn't show much interest. But Hickson, convinced his UFO came from another world, said he was
  surprised by the number of people who accepted that as logical.</p>
<p>He said he hadn't pondered the matter before Oct. 11 but "I don't see why God would put life on just this one small
  speck and no other place."</p>
