<p class="abstract">Are UFO sightings and mutilations related? </p>
<p>Mutilated livestock, unauthorized helicopters and unidentified flying objects have residents wondering and worrying
  in some areas of Nebraska.</p>
<p>"Doors are locked and guns are loaded" in rural Oakland, according to one resident.</p>
<p>A quarterhorse was found <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MutilationsBetail/index.html">mutilated</a>
  Sunday three miles southwest of Norfolk on the Warren Papstein farm.</p>

  <h2>Fifth Killed</h2>
  <p>This was the fifth animal killed and mutilated in Madison County under mysterious circumstances. Four head of
    cattle have been found with their sex organs cut out, in addition one steer and one eye, one ear, its nose, mouth
    and tongue chopped off.</p>
  <p>The killings have been reported all over the state. Similar cases have been reported in Texas, Iowa and other
    Midwestern states. Each case involves the removal of the animal's sex organs. </p>
  <p>In Antelope County, Omer Hoffman, four miles west of Clearwater, reported five head of cattle have been mutilated
    on his ranch.</p>
  <p>Law enforcement officials are puzzled by the killings. Madison County Sheriff Marvin Adams says that the ones he
    has investigated have been done by people, probably a cult of some kind.</p>
  <p>But Robert Mavis of Wakefield, an investigator for the criminal division of the State Patrol, said, "There are a
    lot of trains of thought. There have been numerous discoveries of dead animals in Madison and Kaox counties and
    there are indications that predators got several of them. We are not convinced it is a person who is doing this. We
    haven't even found tracks in most cases."</p>
  <p>In Caster County, where there have been four times as many killings as in Madison County, Sheriff Larry
    Higgenbothom says he frankly doesn't know what is doing the killings. At first in blamed it on predators. </p>
  <p>Antelope County Deputy Sheriff D. Karmen said there has been no definite proof that there were people involved in
    the killings he had investigated.</p>
  <p>He said, "In every case we've had, the cattle have been dead for a few days. Most of them are full of maggots and
    decay. It is hard to tell anything with maggots in the incidents."</p>
  <p>The sheriffs in Holt, Knox, Antelope and Madison counties are coupling their formation and sending it to an
    investigation to see what can be found from compilations.</p>
  <p>There have been at least two formal sightings between the county sheriff State Patrol, brand investigators and the
    Coarme and Parks Cadehdeham.</p>
  <p>The last big meeting was held Aug. 21 at Bloomfield, Knox County. About xx farmers and ranchers attended along with
    sheriffs from Holt, Thybe and Knox counties, members of the State Patrol, brand investigators, representatives from
    Game and Parks Commission, city police, mayors and township officials from all the towns in the county.</p>

  <h2>Other Happenings</h2>
  <p>Cattle killings aren't the only strange happenings in northeast Nebraska. There have been numerous reports of
    unidentified flying objects in both Antelope and Knox counties.</p>
  <p>Sheriff Herbert Thompson of Knox County said that it is possible the unidentified flying objects and lights are
    connected with the livestock killings, but there is nothing definite to connect them.</p>
  <p>The people were gathered on a farm near Clearwater Aug. 21. All of them said they saw a strange light in the
    sky.</p>
  <p>One of the men at the gathering described the incident. "Two of the boys were out in the field to move equipment.
    They didn't get it all moved. They spotted a light and it came right down at them. It scared the devil out of
    them... They came right up to the house."</p>
  <p>At the house they watched the light for about four hours.</p>
  <p>Later on several gathered in town to watch. Harold Kester said the object "looked as if it had a little
    bluish-green light on each side with a glow surrounding it. It was behind a tree and moved from one side of the tree
    to the other. We couldn't tell how close it was or how fast it was moving."</p></section>

  <h2>Another light</h2>
  <p>About midnight the same night, Mike Kruger reported seeing another light.</p>
  <p>He said, "I walked outside to put some calves in and saw a big ball of red fire. It raised off the ground and then
    went out. Since it was dark, I couldn't tell how far away it was or how high it raised."</p>
  <p>About a month ago there were reports of UFOs in Knox County. Last week the big stir in the county was unauthorized
    helicopters.</p>
  <p>Sheriff Thompson said, "We don't know if they are helicopters or strange lights for the most part. There were
    several reported over the weekend. The people who reported them called them strange lights. Previously we had two
    positive identifications of helicopters."</p>
  <p>Antelope County Sheriff Vernon Bexissx said that he doesn't think helicopters are tied in with the killings,
    although helicopters have been sighted. </p>
  <p>He said that Sunday night he was among the many persons in the area who saw an unidentified light. It had a lot of
    people spooked. He checked it out with the highway patrol and found out it was a xxxxxxx. </p></section>
