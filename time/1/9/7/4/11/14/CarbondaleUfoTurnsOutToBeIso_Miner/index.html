<p>... Saturday, November 9th! It was a cold night, but nothing could be colder than the wind blowing out of the east,
  the direction from which IT came over Salem Mountain.</p>
<p>Nobody believed the first witnesses. Calls to the police department initially fell on deaf ears: "It wouldn't be what
  they think. IT must be a shooting star or something."</p>
<p>Nobody would admit the terrible truth, that what they had always ...aded had again come to pass - a lantern had been
  spotted in the skies of Carbondale.</p>
<p>The truth would not, and could not, be accepted. Everybody remembered what had happened when the first lantern landed
  back in 1918. Oldtime Carbondale residents recall with terror the fate of Ike Balforio that ...ely night at the No. 4
  dam. The tragic memories of that incident ...e too tough to bear. People made ... uses: IT must be a flash light in a
  ...le, or something, but not a lantern!" "God help us if IT is!"</p>
<p>But the calls became too ...erous to ignore. It soon became too obvious that a Lantern had ...e again made its
  precarious appearance over the Pionner City. The only thing that could be hoped now was that a landing had not been
  accomplished.</p>
<p>That hope was dashed against the ...n-strewn shores of a silt pond behind Russel Park, as anxious ...s reported the
  sighting of a ...ing glow from beneath the ...es of the tiny body of water. The ... was said to dim, and then to
  ...hten, in regular and repeating intervals.</p>
<p>Curious citizens rushed to the site ... as terrified observers fled the ... after seeing the mysterious ... in the
  pond. Several witnesses ...ar that a police officier fired his ... at the bizarre source of illumination in a futile
  effort to estinguish IT, although acting chief police Francis Dottle contends to that day that no shots were ever
  fired.</p>
<p>An expert on UFOs who rushed to the scene from his office in ...udsburg expressed relief that ... of the bullets
  struck whatever is was in that was emanating the light. ... IT is a lantern, and we don't ... that for certain yet,
  you never ... what the reaction might be to a caliber slug," said the unidentified expert. The elderly but still
  energetic expert expresed doubt, ...ever, that the object was a lantern "It's not normal for Lantern to pulsate at the
  frequent intervals ...h this one is exhibiting, but we can't be certain until we recover it.</p>
<p>The glow lasted for a reported nine ...s, leading to speculation that if ...really was a Lantern then surely those
  instruments must have been improved since <time>1918</time>, when Ike Balforio watched a glow at No. 4 dam for three
  hours before reaching his untimely end.</p>
<p>Spectators from near and far began to arrive, including several UFO experts. These included Matthew J. Graeber of the
  UFO Research Information Center in Philadelphia, <span class="people" title="Robert Barry">Robert D. Barry</span> of
  the <a href="/org/us/asso/20thCenturyUfoBureau"><i>20th Century UFO Bureau</i></a>, and Doug Dains from Binghamton,
  who represented Dr. <span class="people"
      title="J. Allen Hynek">Allan Hyneck</span> of the <a href="/org/us/asso/20thCenturyUfoBureau">Center for UFO
    Studies</a> at Northwestern University in Chicago.
</p>
<p>These experts expressed excitement that at last they had gotten a chance to obtain what they had always been
  searching for - a concrete example of previously unexplained aerial phenomena. Little did they realize on Sunday that
  during the next day their wildest dreams would become reality with the extrication of the unknown object from the
  pond.</p>
<p>An attempt was made to retrieve the object with a net, but the thing was last in the grimy depths after momentarily
  being grasped. Geiger counters were used to try and establish the existence of any abnormal radioactivity. (A high
  reading might indicate the presence of a nuclear-powered lantern.) Nothing definitive could be determined from the
  tests, however, since none of the experts knew what level of radioactivity was normal for Carbondale. At any rate, the
  geiger counters showed nothing dramatic, confirming the fact that, if the object in question was in fact a Lantern,
  the IT must surely be conventionally powered.</p>
<p>Some anxious moments occurred on Sunday afternoon at the site when Carbondale Police and members of the Civil Air
  Patrol cleared the immediate area. Spectators did not want to leave the site, hoping against hope that they would
  witness the recovery of something shocking - perhaps even a Lantern. What was termed by some onlookers as a "near
  riot" broke out between some reluctant civilians and the C.A.P.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, down at City Hall, Sgt. Albert Mazza was manning the phones when a veritable deluge of calls came in from
  all over the country from interested persons who had heard on the national news of the possible existence in
  Carbondale of a Lantern.</p>
<p>At the site, local fire companies from up and down the valley began to arrive in preparation for the pumping of the
  pond, while a backhoe from a local construction company was utilized to clear a channel out of the basin.</p>
<p>T.V. film crews arrived from as far away as Philadelphia, and excitement mounted as two scuba divers from the
  Syracuse area stood by waiting for the order to dive.</p>
<p>Acting Chief Dottle gave the order at approximatively 3:00 p.m. on Monday after the water in the pond had dropped to
  an acceptable level.</p>

<p>Tension filled the air as the diver attached himself to a safety rope. Learning a lesson from the fate of Ike
  Balforio, he wishes to take no chances just in case a Lantern was actually was found. He boarded the rowboat and was
  taken to the site where the glow was last seen. As he disappeared into the acidic waters the whole crowd gasped in
  expectation. The experts awaited the find. The police and Civil Air Patrol stood by in case of any emergency.</p>

<p>The diver emerged in about five minutes holding an object. As hundreds looked on, it soon was apparent that the worst
  fears of the populace had come to pass. In the diver's hand was a Lantern.</p>
<p>Surprisingly little panic was exhibited by the throng. Some ran. Some broke down and cried. Most stayed calm but kept
  their distance behind the 7-foot chain link fence in the outfield of Russel Park.</p>
<p>The authorities declared the case closed, wrapping up the affair with a new conference that evening at City Hall. The
  UFO was declared officially an ISO (Identified Sunken Object), and a collective prayer was uttered that nothing had
  come of the incident. </p>
