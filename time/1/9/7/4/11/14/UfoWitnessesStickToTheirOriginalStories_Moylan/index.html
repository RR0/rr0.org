<p>While many people have dismissed <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Carbondale">the UFO incident at Russel
  Park</a> this week as a hoax, many others are still not satisfied with the conclusion.</p>
<p>At the top of the list of those who still believe that something other than a lantern was seen entering and glowing
  in mine water pond are the three boys who first saw and reported the incident: Bob Gillette, 15; Bill Lloyd, 15; and
  his brother John, 14.</p>
<p><strong>Two of these three young men visited the NEWS office Tuesday afternoon three days after they sighted
  something entering the pond and one day after it was dismissed as a hoax by authorities. They still stuck to their
  original story. As told to the NEWS, here is their story.</strong></p>
<p>Between 7 and 7:30 p.m. Saturday evening, the three youths were standing on the corner of Church Street and 12th
  Avenue when they observed a light come from behind Salem Mountain and fall in an arc toward the pond and cemetery
  area. The light given off was described as white and yellow. The boys heard no sound. </p>
<p>Walking back to the pond they observed waves in the water and a yellowish light with a spot of red coming from
  beneath the surface. The lighted area was approximately four feet in diameter.</p>
<p>They left the pond in summon their friends who were standing near Russel Park. When the six of them returned, they
  noticed that the underwater light was about 20 feet from shore, and that it had moved from its original position.</p>
<p>The Carbondale police were summoned twice before arriving at the scene. They estimated that it was an hour and a half
  since they first spotted the glow that the police cruiser arrived. The time was approximately 9:30 or 10 p.m.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, they said that officers admitted that "something was there" and that two officers fired their service
  revolvers into the water. They said the light was observed to move when the bullets were fired.</p>
<p>The boys said that the Mitchell Hose Co. emergency truck was called along with a boat. Portable lights were set up on
  the shore and retrieval operations begun. They also noted a photographer on the scene taking pictures of the
  operation.</p>
<p>Later the boys were told to wait in the police car, where they remained until 1 p.m. The boys heard, via police
  radio, orders to "hold off the news media." When the youths were finally released around 1 a.m., they were told by
  police to remain quiet. Bob Gillette reported that his grandfather was told by police that his grandson was working
  back at Russel Park. Both Gillette and Lloyd affirm that police officers told them the objet in the pond was a
  meteorite.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the boys said they returned, but were not allowed in the area. They reported that a crane was seen moving
  back into the pond area, but that it was not seen leaving. They speculated that it may have left from another road in
  the area.</p>
<p>One interesting sight they boys reported was a delivery truck from a department store going down the road to the pond
  at one point Sunday.</p>
<p>The boys also report that a scuba diver was in the pond Sunday afternoon and that he emerged white-faced and gestured
  a size with his arms. They report that law enforcement officers hushed the diver.</p>
<p>The boys returned to the site Monday afternoon when another scuba diver went under the surface. Two minutes later,
  according to the youths, he returned with the widely-publicized railroad lantern.</p>
<p>The boys told the NEWS that they still stick to their original stories and leveled a few verbal blasts at the
  Carbondale police. They speculated that someone placed the railroad lantern in the pond and that the "show" Monday
  afternoon was designed to "<q>make fools of them</q>."</p>
<p>They also pointed out that the UFO official from Philadelphia noted no discrepancies in their stories and that he
  believed what they told him.</p>
<p class="note">(Editor's note: The NEWS has received many different bits of information on the sighting. Perhaps the
  most interesting is a report that an orange-red glow near Russel Park was observed from upper Dundaff Street between 8
  and 9 p.m. Saturday night.) </p>
