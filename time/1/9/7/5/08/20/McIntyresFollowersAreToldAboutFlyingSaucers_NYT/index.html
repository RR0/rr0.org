<p>CAPE MAY, Aug. 19—Sightings of “flying saucers” tHat have stumped others posed no puzzle for the Rev. <span
    class="people">Carl McIntire</span>'s fourth annual U.F.O. conference here.</p>
<p>Many of the unidentified space vehicles are piloted by God's angels, <span class="people"
    title="Robert Barry">Robert D. Barry</span>, director of the 20th‐Century U.F.O. Bureau, has been telling morning
  and night meetings daily since the conference opened Saturday with an introduction by Mr. <span class="people">McIntire</span>.
</p>
<p>A minority, Mr. Barry says, are operated by Lucifer's fallen angels.</p>
<p>The U.F.O. bureau was founded two years ago by Mr. McIntire, the fundamentalist minister from Collingswood, N. J.,
  who is heard over radio stations throughout the country on his 20thCentury Reformation Hour program.</p>
<p>Although the bureau is only two years old, the week‐long conference is billed as the “fourth annual” because Mr.
  Barry has lectured on the subject for four consecutive years at meetings at Mr. McIntire's conference center in Cape
  Canaveral, Fla.</p>
<h2>175 On Hand</h2>
<p>Last night 175 persons from 13 states and Canada heard Mr. <span class="people">Barry</span>, former sales manager
  for radio station WGCB in Red Lion, Pa., relate flying saucers to scriptures at Mr. McIntire's Christian Admiral Hotel
  here.</p>
<p>And today, he cited a passage from Ezekiel:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about
    it ....</p>
  <p>As I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures... their appearandce and
    their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. When they went, they went upon their four sides: and
    they turned not when they went.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.F.O. bureau director, a one‐man staff who works out of his home in Pennsylvania, suggested today that his
  isteners order a $1 tract, the 20th Century Reformation Four, plus his cassette tapes on U.F.O. sightings for $5 each
  and Mr. McIntire's Christian Beacon weekly newspaper for $5 a year.</p>
<p>In addition, he offered to process all requests to be placed on the mailing list for all McIntire enterprises. Among
  other things that bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to the McIntire programs are contributions
  solicited from those on the mailing lists, attendance at Bibe conferences at McIntire hotels here and in Florida,
  sales of <span class="people">McIntire</span> condominiums at Cape Canaveral, and annual McIntire guided trips to the
  Middle East.</p>
<p>Many of those attending the U.F.O. conference are vacationing at McIntire hotels here. Others came just for the
  conference.</p>
<p>Mrs. Daniel McMurray of Wilmington, Del., wife of an engineer, said she and her husband reserved the rooms “far in
  advance” to make sure of accommodations. She called some of the scriptural associations “striking.”</p>
<p>But a minority was skeptical. Richard Woike, an insurance agent from St. Davids, Pa., and his wife, walked out last
  night. They were on vacation and had just dined at the Christian Admiral.</p>
<p><q>My son‐in‐law is a scientist and he says there is an explanation for each sighting, such as government testing</q>,
  said Mrs. Woike. <q>It is amazing that people come from any distance to hear this</q>, her husband added.</p>
