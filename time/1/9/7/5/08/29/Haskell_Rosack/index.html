<p>Theodore P. Rosack<br> Special Agent In Charge<br> Denver Federal Building<br> 1961 Stout Street<br> Denver, Colorado
  80202</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Rosack:</p>
<p>For several months my office has been receiving reports of cattle mutilations throughout Colorado and other western
  states. At least 130 cases in Colorado alone have been reported to local officials and the Colorado Bureau of
  Investigation (CBI); the CBI has verified that the incidents have occured for the last two years in nine states.</p>
<p>The ranchers and rural residents of Colorado are concerned and frightened by these incidents. The bizarre mutilations
  are frightening in themselves: in virtually all the cases, the left ear, left eye, rectum and sex organ of each animal
  has been cut away and the blood drained from the carcass, but with no traces of blood left on the ground and no
  foot-prints. </p>
<p>In Colorado's Morgan County area, there has also been reports that a helicopter was used by those who mutilated the
  carcasses of the cattle, and several persons have reported being chased by a similar helicopter.</p>
<p>Because I am gravely concerned by this situation, I am asking that the Federal Bureau of Investigation enter the
  case. Although the CBI has been investigating the incidents, and local officials also have been involved, the lack of
  a central unified direction has frustrated the investigation. It seems to have progressed little, except for the
  recognition at long last that the incidents must be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Now it appears that ranchers are arming themselves to protect their livestock, as well as their families and
  themselves, because they are frustrated by the unsuccessful investigation. Clearly something must be done before
  someone gets hurt.</p>
<p>The fact that allegations have been made of the loss of livestock in 21 states under similar circumstances strongly
  suggests the very real possibility that the crossing of state lines is involved and, this alone, I feel, should
  justify the participation of the FBI in this case.</p>
<p>I urge you to begin your investigation as soon as possible, and to contact my office to discuss in more detail the
  incidents I have described. We stand ready to give you all possible assistance.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Floyd K. Haskell<br> United States Senator</p>
