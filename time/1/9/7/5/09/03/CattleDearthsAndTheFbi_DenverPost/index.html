<p>If the <a href="/org/us/ic/fbi/index.html">FBI</a> will not enter the investigation of mysterious livestock deaths in
  Colorado and some adjacent states then Sen. Floyd Haskell, D.-Colo., should take the matter to Congress for
  resolution.</p>
<p>The incidents are too widespread—and potentially too dangerous to public order—to ignore. Narrow interpretations of
  what the <a href="/org/us/ic/fbi/index.html">FBI</a>'s role is vis-a-vis state authority are not adequate to the need.
</p>
<p>There is already federal involvement. Consider this: Because of the gun-happy frame of mind developing in eastern
  Colorado (where most of the incidents have been occuring), the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has had to cancel
  a helicopter inventory of its lands in six counties. BLM officials are simply afraid their helicopters might be shot
  down by ranchers and others frightened by cattle deaths.</p>
<p>If that isn't a reason for federal involvment, we don't know what is. And the question of which federal agency
  investigates isn't as important as the need to bring a focus on the incidents that is broader than the juridiction of
  one state. </p>
<p>Killings and mutilations of livestock have been occuring in Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas and elsewhere—not just in
  Colorado. If there is a pattern to the incidents it would seem that the broadest possible study of them is
  indicated. </p>
<p>In any case, Senator Haskell should keep the pressure on the <a href="/org/us/ic/fbi/index.html">FBI</a>. It has
  manpower and a wide range of investigatory tools. And if the <a href="/org/us/ic/fbi/index.html">FBI</a> resists
  sucessfully, the senator should go to Congress to get the sort of attention these alarming incidents deserve. </p>
