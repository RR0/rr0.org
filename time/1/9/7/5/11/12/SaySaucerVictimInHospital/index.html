<p>HOLBROOK, Ariz. (AP) - Travis Walton who is alleged to have disappeared after being struck by a ray of light from an
  unidentified flying object, was "on a craft of some sort" and made contact with strange creatures, his brother said
  Tuesday. </p>
<p>Duane Walton, 26, said he found Travis, 22, who now is in hospital. However, he refused to say where.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Navajo County sheriff Martin Gillespie said five men who claimed they had seen Travis Walton struck by a
  ray of light last week in northeast Arizona passed a lie-detector test Tuesday. But Gillespie said he still wants to
  speak with Walton himself. </p>
<p>The sheriff has described both brothers and their mother as long-time students of UFOs. He also said he still had
  "not overlooked the possibility" that the story is a hoax. </p>
<h2>LEFT TRUCK</h2>
<p>Travis Walton disappeared last Wednesday. His six companions said he left the truck they were riding in near Heber to
  pursue an unidentified flying object in the woods. </p>
<p>The men said they were still in the truck about 25 yards away when Walton was struck by "a ray of bluish light." </p>
<p>They said they drove off, frightened, but returned shortly afterward and found no trace of Walton. </p>
