<p>HEBER, Ariz. (Reuters) - Six forestry workers were to be given lie detector tests today to verify their story that a
  co-worker disappeared after being struck down by a blue ray from an object resembling a flying saucer.</p>
<p>After questioning the men about the incident, Navaho County sheriff Marvin Gillespie told reporters: "I am not a
  total disbeliever in the men's story." </p>
<p>The six men, working as a timber-thinning team in the Apache national forest, 120 miles north of Phoenix, said they
  were returning home at dusk Wednesday when they saw the object hovering over the road ahead.</p>
<p>Travis Walton, 22, a seventh worker with the group, jumped from the truck and ran forward to get a closer look. </p>
<p>Gillespie said the men reported that Walton was struck by a blue light from the hovering object and fell to the
  ground. </p>
<p>The men were so frightened they drove away, leaving Walton lying there, the sheriff said. When they returned about 15
  minutes later, both Walton and the flying object were gone.</p>
<p>Police searched for Walton on Thursday without success. A second search during the weekend also failed to locate
  him.</p>
