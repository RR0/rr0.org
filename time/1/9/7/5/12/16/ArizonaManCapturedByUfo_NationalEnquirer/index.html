<p class="abstract2">5 Witnesses Pass Lie Test While Claiming...</p>
<p class="abstract">Arizona Man Captured by UFO</p>
<p class="abstract2">In one of the most baffling cases ever recorded, a young laborer was taken aboard a UFO — in full
  view of six terrified co-workers — and held for five days.

<p>The stunned witnesses readily agreed to take lie-detector tests. Five passed, proving they were telling the truth.
  The sixth was so nervous that the results of his test were inconclusive.
</p>
<p>The abducted man, 22-year-old Travis Walton of Snowflake, Ariz., suddenly disappeared when struck by a dazzling ray
  from the strange hovering, saucer-shaped object, his fellow workers told police and The ENQUIRER.
</p>
<p>In gripping detail, the witnesses described the chilling incident:</p>
<p>Dwayne Smith, 21: <q>It was a spaceship, there's no doubt of that — and Travis went on it. He got out of our truck,
  walked toward it — and just vanished!</q></p>
<p>Kenneth Peterson, 25: <q>I saw a bluish light come from the machine and Travis went flying — like he'd touched a hot
  wire.</q></p>
<p>Alan Dalis, 21: <q>It sent out a blue ray, and the last we saw of Travis was his silhouette outlined, arms
  outstretched. We couldn't believe what was happening — the horror was unreal!</q></p>
<p>Mike Rogers, 28: <q>We were all scared! We couldn't think of any other explanation except that Travis had been taken
  off by the saucer.</q></p>
<p>John Goulette, 21: <q>I know what I saw... and it wasn't (...)</q></p>
<p>(...) tree trimmers were heading home at dusk along an isolated mountain road. Crew member Dwayne Smith said they
  were about 12 miles from Heber when they suddenly spotted the saucer hovering in a clearing beside the road.
</p>
<p><q>I was numb with disbelief — and terrified!</q> said Smith. <q>The UFO was smooth, and was giving off a
  yellowish-orange light.</q></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We watched it in shock a few seconds, the suddenly (...)</p>
  <p>(...) just vanished! Mike Rogers, who was driving the truck, screamed <q>Shut the door!</q> and gunned past the
    saucer.
  </p>
  <p>When we could see the saucer wasn't following us, Mike stopped the truck and we all got out, shouting and screaming
    at each other with fear in our faces and terror in our hearts. Then we saw a flash in the trees, and figured the
    saucer was leaving.
  </p>
  <p>We went back to the spot where the saucer had been... but Travis was gone. He went on the spaceship, there's no
    doubt of that.
  </p>
  <p>We went and reported what had happened. We didn't expect anyone to believe us, and nobody did — until we took lie
    detector tests.

<p>Because Walton wasn't able to recall all the details of his amazing experience, The ENQUIRER arranged for him to be
  interviewed under hypnosis by Dr. Harder, a member of The ENQUIRER's prestigious (...)
</p>
<p>(...) Dr. Harder that as he approached the craft for a closer look, he was hit by something and suddenly everything
  went black.
</p>
<p><q>When I woke up, there was a strong light in my eyes and I had problems focusing. I was panicked because there was
  a terrible pain in my head and chest,</q> he told Dr. Harder.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>My mind cleared a little and I thought I was in a hospital. I was lying on a table on my back, and these figures
    were standing over me.
  </p>
  <p>It was weird. They weren't human — they were creatures.</p>
  <p>They looked like well-developed fetuses to me — they were about 5 feet tall and wore tight-fitting tan-brown robes.
    Their skin was white like a mushroom and they had no clear features. They made no sound.
  </p>
  <p>Their faces had no texture or color, and there was no hair. Their foreheads were doomed and their eyes were very
    large. They had long fingers — but no fingernails.
  </p>
  <p>I panicked and jumped up, knocking a clear plastic tray (...)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There's been no publicity about this case because the man feels it would jeopardize his job to discuss it.</p>
