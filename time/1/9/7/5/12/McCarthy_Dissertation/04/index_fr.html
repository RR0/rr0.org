<h2><a id="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Durant approximativement 10 ans avant l'arrivée de <span class="people" title="James E. McDonald">McDonald</span> sur
  la scène ovni il y eut des tentatives d'obtenir des Auditions au Congrès sur le problème ovni dans l'espoir que le
  Congrès puisse contraindre l'Air Force à sortir de sa posture non concernée par rapport au phénomène. La force la plus
  persévérante derrière cet effort fut le <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap/index.html">NICAP</a> sous la direction de <span
    class="people">Donald E. Keyhoe</span>.</p>
<p>
  Le résultat en fut que le Sous-Comité de la Chambre sur les Phénomènes Atmosphériques du Speaker McCormack, faisant
  partie du Comité Sélectionné sur l'Astronautique et l'Exploration Spatiale de la Chambre, tint des auditions à
  huis-clos en <a href="../../../../../5/8/index.html">1958</a>. Il y eut également plusieurs efforts avortés au début
  des années 1960s, notamment de la part du Représentant Joseph Karth du Comité sur la Science et l'Astronautique de la
  Chambre. La seule audition publique eut lieu devant le Comité sur les Services Armés de la Chambre Mendel Rivers en
  <time>1966-04</time>. Cependant, du point de vue de ceux qui souhaitaient des auditions, cela se révéla improductif
  parce que seule la position de l'Air Force était entendue.
</p>
<p>
  Comme nous l'avons vu, au début de <a href="../../../../../6/7/index.html">1967</a>, <a
    href="/people/m/McDonaldJamesE/index.html">McDonald</a> n'était pas à l'aise avec la situation à Boulder. De plus,
  he favored a many pronged assault sur le problème ovni pour éviter de mettre tous ses oeufs dans le même panier. C'est
  à cette époque, par exemple, qu'il commença ses approches de la <a href="/org/us/NAS.html">NAS</a> et débuta une
  campagne visant à influencer le Représentant <a href="/people/RoushJEdward/index.html">J. Edward Roush</a> de
  l'Indiana qui siégeait au Comité sur la Science et l'Astronautique de la Chambre.</p>

<h3><a id="initial"></a>Premiers contacts</h3>
<p>
  For reasons which are not clear, but are probably related to some federally funded program at the UA, Congressman
  Roush went to Tucson in late February 1967. Somehow McDonald contacted him and they engaged in a lengthy session on
  UFOs. Apparently Roush already had an interest in the matter because McDonald commended him in a note for his <q>fresh
  examination of the problem of the UFOs.</q></p>
<p> McDonald went on to criticize the Air Force and forwarded a critical statement on Blue Book which he recently gave
  to the <i>Tucson Daily Citizen</i>. He further offered his assistance to Roush and his staff along with a list of UFO
  references. Since he would be in Washington to address the ONR and possibly NSF and the NAS on the UFO problem April
  17-19 he suggested to Roush that they get together. </p>
<p> Lastly, McDonald stated that his ten months of intensive investigation had convinced him that the UFO issue was a
  problem of highest scientific importance. He urged Roush to push for Congressional Hearings which would listen to more
  than just the official position. <a href="#fn1"><sup><b>[1]</b></sup></a><a id="f1"></a></p>
<p> While in Tucson, Roush also met with Gerard Kuiper, an internationally known member of the UA's Department of
  Astronomy, and asked him for his opinions on UFOs. Kuiper sent him a letter deprecating the subject and forwarded a
  carbon to McDonald. <a href="#fn2"><sup><b>[2]</b></sup></a><a id="f2"></a> To this McDonald replied with a note to
  Kuiper. He told Kuiper that his letter to Roush put him in the camp of those scientists who dismissed the problem
  without studying it. He suggested that if Kuiper were to apply himself to the matter he would change his mind. He
  further stated that Kuiper's aid in obtaining his NASA intramural grant and his call for study of the UFO issue were
  helpful, but did not balance out the kind of statement made to Roush which, backed by the full weight of Kuiper's
  prestige, <a href="#fn3"><sup><b>[3]</b></sup></a><a id="f3"></a> could prove damaging. </p>
<p> A few days later McDonald again wrote Roush reminding him of the upcoming Washington trip and reiterating the desire
  for hearings through the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. In this communication McDonald presented a
  schedule with which he no doubt intended to impress Roush. While in Washington he planned to speak at the ONR, the <a
      href="/org/us/dod/navy/onr/nrl">NRL</a>, and the American Society of Newspaper Editors convention. He had a
  tentative appointment with the president of the NAS and had not yet heard from the AFOSR and NSF where he also wanted
  to speak. In addition, he intended to go over to NASA on an informal basis, and on his way back to Tucson would talk
  at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory and see Lloyd Berkner, a member of the 1953 CIA-convened Robertson Panel on
  UFOs, at the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies in Dallas. In closing he included Roush in this impressive
  itinerary by asking if he might stop in and see him. <a href="#fn4"><sup><b>[4]</b></sup></a><a
      id="f4"></a></p>
<p> For the remainder of 1967 there is very little interaction, at least as reflected in McDonald's correspondence,
  between himself and Roush. In June Dr. Phyllis O'Callaghan, Roush's administrative assistant, told McDonald that Roush
  was out of the country, but interested in McDonald's work on UFOs and in particular the outcome of his UN talk. She
  closed by saying, "We remain very interested." <a href="#fn5"><sup><b>[5]</b></sup></a><a id="f5"></a></p>
<p> McDonald replied almost two months later because O'Callaghan's letter arrived while he was on his ONR sponsored
  Australia trip which will be discussed in the next chapter. He enclosed his statement to the UN Outer Space Affairs
  Group which he sent to all members of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and to sixty or seventy
  scientific attaches at embassies in Washington. Lastly, he outlined his efforts to convince various NASA bureaucrats
  of the seriousness of the UFO problem and again asked that Roush open hearings. <a
      href="#fn6"><sup><b>[6]</b></sup></a><a id="f6"></a></p>
<p> In October Representative Wyman submitted a resolution to the Committee on Science and Astronautics calling for
  hearings on the UFO question. <a href="#fn7"><sup><b>[7]</b></sup></a><a id="f7"></a> McDonald wrote Roush endorsing
  the resolution and urging Roush to bring it before the Committee. <a href="#fn8"><sup><b>[8]</b></sup></a><a
      id="f8"></a> Roush answered by saying that he too favored the hearings, but it seemed a poor time. He felt the
  best witnesses would be those scientists on the Colorado Project, yet he did not think it appropriate to call on them
  before their research reached completion. <a href="#fn9"><sup><b>[9]</b></sup></a><a id="f9"></a></p>
<p> Therefore, it appears that McDonald made contact in 1967, but was unable to do much more than get in the good graces
  of Roush. Nevertheless, this proved very important in 1968 as the situation in Boulder, in McDonald's opinion,
  worsened and the need, again in McDonald's opinion, for Congressional Hearings prior to the termination of the Project
  increased. </p>
<p> As previously indicated in the chapter on the Condon Study, the fur flew in early 1968. McDonald forced the
  confrontation at Boulder which resulted in the termination of Saunders and Levine, lawsuits, <i>Look</i> and <i>Science</i>
  articles, and the resignation of Mary Lou Armstrong. </p>
<p> By the end of April, however, it seemed to McDonald that it was time to concentrate his attention on Roush. He told
  Hall that he now agreed with him that the only real hope lay with Congress. He intended to send Roush a copy of the
  <i>Look</i> article and planned to see him in Washington the following week. <a
      href="#fn10"><sup><b>[10]</b></sup></a><a id="f10"></a> The same day he wrote Roush enclosing the <i>Look</i>
  expose and a copy of his 1/31/68 letter to Low which ignited the confrontation. He told <a
      href="/people/RoushJEdward/index.html">Roush</a> that it no longer seemed reasonable to "wait for Colorado," a
  by-word in Washington in 1966 and 1967 whenever the subject of UFOs arose. Congressional Hearings were necessary as
  soon as possible. He claimed that for "those of us who knew its shortcomings waiting for Colorado was never adequate
  for the <i>Look</i> article represented only a partial disclosure of the scientific shortcomings of the project. He
  concluded that a Congressional inquiry could serve to put the matter <q>in a context amenable to scientific
    progress</q>. <a href="#fn11"><sup><b>[11]</b></sup></a><a id="f11"></a></p>
<h3><a id="roush"></a>Roush Speaks Out</h3>
<p>
  Three days later Roush took to the floor of the House to ask for Hearings. He criticized the Air Force handling of the
  problem and also cited the <i>Look</i> article entitled the "Half Million Dollar Trick," which referred to the
  phrasing of the Low memo and the $500,000 budget of the Condon Study. Roush argued that the article raised questions
  of scientific profundity and objectivity. He said that as a result of his talks to, and correspondence with, most
  serious UFO researchers he proposed inviting them to Hearings conducted by the House Committee on Science and
  Astronautics.

  <a href="#fn12"><sup><b>[12]</b></sup></a><a id="f12"></a>

</p><p>
  The following day Roush took the floor again. He explained that if the <i>Look</i> article were incorrect it needed
  correcting and if it were correct it raised questions about the University of Colorado's approach to the federal
  contract process. To get some answers to these questions he said he wrote Secretary of the Air Force Seamans asking
  for comments and also the Comptroller General requesting an investigation of the use of public money at CU. Roush
  asserted that he was an agnostic with respect to UFOs, but wanted to get to the bottom of the riddle through the use
  of the scientific process.

  <a href="#fn13"><sup><b>[13]</b></sup></a><a id="f13"></a>

</p>
<p>
  This brought the pot to a boil again both for NICAP and McDonald. Don Berliner, an NICAP staffer, wrote Julian
  Hennessey, a subcommittee chairman in England, that McDonald's talks with several members of the Science and
  Astronautics Committee indicated they were very upset over CU. He said, "We are sending over (to the Hill) gobs of
  material."

  <a href="#fn14"><sup><b>[14]</b></sup></a><a id="f14"></a></p>
<p> McDonald confirmed this in a note to Malone in which he said he spent May 3 talking with Roush's staff, William Ryan
  of New York, and D'Addario's assistant Tom E. J. Keena. He said he pushed for an investigation going back to 1947 with
  Roush and asked Malone to write D'Addario urging the same approach. He mentioned that he spoke with the assistants to
  Congressman Brotzman from the Boulder area who will ask the president of CU for a full accounting. <a
      href="#fn15"><sup><b>[15]</b></sup></a><a id="f15"></a></p>
<p> Although he recognized it was a poor year (election year) for trying to get a Congressional inquiry off the ground
  McDonald felt that the attempt should be made. He asked Hall to put the full weight of NICAP's 10,500-person
  membership behind a letter-writing campaign directed at Congressmen Roush, Ryan, D'Addario and Karth urging hearings.
  <a href="#fn16"><sup><b>[16]</b></sup></a><a id="f16"></a></p>
<p> McDonald considered the remarks made by Roush on the House floor sufficiently important that he sent copies of them
  to "concerned people and scientific agencies inside and outside of the United States." He assured Roush that he would
  write to all of the members of Congress with whom he had spoken and had already asked Morris Udall of his own district
  to do whatever he could. He felt the best thing he could do was begin informal discussions with members of the
  Committee on Science and Astronautics and he wanted to know if the Subcommittee on Science, Research and Development
  would be the appropriate place to hold the hearings. If so, he would get colleagues from around the country to write
  the subcommittee letters of encouragement. <a href="#fn17"><sup><b>[17]</b></sup></a><a id="f17"></a></p>
<p> Dick Olsen, an aide to Udall suggested to McDonald that he prepare a letter which Udall might show other Congressmen
  when button-holing them on the UFO question. After writing it McDonald told Udall he purposely composed it in a
  low-key fashion because he knew from experience that this was the best way to present the subject. In closing he said
  that he doubted anything short of a Congressional Hearing could get the issue out into the open. He had given up on
  his colleagues in the scientific community. <a href="#fn18"><sup><b>[18]</b></sup></a><a id="f18"></a></p>
<h3><a id="preparing"></a>Préparation des auditions</h3>
<p> Several days later O'Callaghan began giving McDonald instructions. She told him to write Congressman George P.
  Miller, Chairman of the Science and Astronautics Committee with a carbon to D'Addario. She said that the other
  scientists who McDonald mentioned were to do the same. Apparently Roush recommended hearings to Miller before, but
  Miller proved uninterested. Now interest existed, but he feared jurisdictional problems with the House Armed Services
  Committee. O'Callaghan felt the letter-writing campaign might make the difference. <a
      href="#fn19"><sup><b>[19]</b></sup></a><a id="f19"></a></p>
<p> She wrote again to tell McDonald that D'Addario's Science and Astronautics Subcommittee would be the body to hold
  the hearing. Somehow McDonald had failed to write Miller and she told him to do so, with the objective of impressing
  Miller with the urgency of the matter and McDonald's own professional competence and seriousness. She emphasized that
  McDonald needed to persist without becoming a nuisance and in this regard recommended that he personally visit Miller
  and D'Addario when in Washington. McDonald could feel free to use Roush's office to make appointments and get
  organized. <a href="#fn20"><sup><b>[20]</b></sup></a><a id="f20"></a> In another note the same day O'Callaghan told
  McDonald that she assured two men from the Government Accounting Office that he could provide them with quotes from
  Condon's speeches illustrating his position in the early stages of the project. <a href="#fn21"><sup><b>[21]</b></sup></a><a
      id="f21"></a></p>
<p> When McDonald eventually got around to the letter to Miller, he wrote that as a scientist with two years of
  experience in the UFO field he wanted to support Roush's plea for hearings. The <i>Look</i> article suggested that it
  was no longer wise to "wait for Colorado" as the NAS, NASA, NSF, et al., argued. Furthermore, he told Miller that the
  UFO matter was essentially a scientific question and as such belonged under his committee and not the House Armed
  Services Committee. He said he intended to visit Miller while in Washington and enclosed several of his UFO talks. <a
      href="#fn22"><sup><b>[22]</b></sup></a><a id="f22"></a></p>
<p> In an effort to convince Miller that there existed a widespread interest within the scientific community in the UFO
  problem McDonald forwarded: </p>
<ol>
  <li> two articles from the May 1968 <i>American Engineer</i> which stressed the cross section of scientifically
    trained persons investigating UFOs,</li>
  <li> an abstract of an article from the <i>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</i> in which three General
    Electric scientists expressed their concern for the status of UFO studies and the public responsibility of the
    scientific community to establish the identity of the objects,</li>
  <li> a letter copied from the February 1968 <i>Astronautics and Aeronautics</i> written by Stanton Friedman
    representing a group of concerned Pittsburgh area scientists. </li>
</ol>
<p> In addition, he mentioned Robert Baker's UFO article in the <i>Journal of the Astronautical Sciences</i> and assured
  Miller that there would be no shortage of participants if hearings were held. <a
      href="#fn23"><sup><b>[23]</b></sup></a><a id="f23"></a> McDonald followed the letter with a very similar one to
  D'Addario who replied with a note saying that he would contact Tom Malone for advice as McDonald suggested. <a
      href="#fn24"><sup><b>[24]</b></sup></a><a id="f24"></a> This in turn was followed by a letter to Miller from
  Levine in which he claimed that some UFO reports were of great scientific but not military interest. He said the Air
  Force did a poor job analyzing sightings, the <i>Look</i> article raised doubts about the objectivity of the Condon
  Study and consequently he believed congressional hearings were in order. <a href="#fn25"><sup><b>[25]</b></sup></a><a
      id="f25"></a></p>
<p> From the last chapter we know that McDonald wanted ONR funding for those aspects of his UFO work which he believed
  related to his atmospheric physics research and, if possible, also for pure UFO studies. Roush, it would appear,
  attempted to do McDonald a favor by writing the ONR. He used Hynek for leverage in the discussion by prefacing his
  remarks with the statement that Hynek wrote to him to express concern over the significance of unexplained UFO
  reports. It would seem more than coincidence that Roush asked Admiral T. B. Owen, Chief of the ONR, what, in light of
  the lack of scientific concern for UFOs, ONR had done to research the problem? And, in anticipation of future hearings
  what research did ONR support on astronomical and meteorological hypotheses which might explain UFO observations? <a
      href="#fn26"><sup><b>[26]</b></sup></a><a id="f26"></a> The latter was, in fact, what McDonald often claimed he
  did. </p>
<p> Owen referred the inquiry to James Hughes, McDonald's contract monitor, who explained that the ONR did not sponsor a
  program to investigate UFOs, but did look at the problem in terms of how it might affect aerial or surface
  reconnaissance. He went on to say that the ONR asked McDonald to look at extreme refraction and electrical phenomena
  invoked to explain some sighting reports, but the research remained in progress. <a
      href="#fn27"><sup><b>[27]</b></sup></a><a id="f27"></a></p>
<p> Congressman Miller received a late letter of encouragement from Roger N. Shepherd, noted psychometrician from
  Stanford. Shepherd said that he wanted to add his voice to those of his colleagues calling for hearings. In the past
  he had awaited the CU report but the seemingly reliable reports of prejudice and gaps in the study had made him change
  his mind. <a href="#fn28"><sup><b>[28]</b></sup></a><a id="f28"></a></p>

  </li>
</ol>
<p> As it turned out Morris Udall eventually got McDonald an appointment to see Miller. On June 3 McDonald spoke to the
  Capitol Hill Burro Club made up of Democratic staff assistants. He so impressed Udall's staff that they convinced
  Udall to do a local Tucson TV spot on UFOs with McDonald. Then on June 19 Udall obtained an appointment for McDonald
  with Miller who gave tentative agreement for hearings. As McDonald put it to Saunders, "It went so easy a reversal
  would not surprise me." Remembering how Representative Karth withdrew his support for hearings in 1961 when Keyhoe
  made a premature announcement McDonald told Saunders to keep it quiet until Roush or Miller made a formal
  statement. </p>
<p> Through Roush, McDonald found that the <a href="/org/us/GAO.html">GAO</a> staff of lawyers and CPAs assessing the
  technical aspects of the CD study wanted to turn the problem over to the NAS. McDonald told Roush that he was of mixed
  emotions on the matter. The NAS was better equipped to do the scientific job but if it came to a fight in the Fall the
  financial data would be good to have. He suggested to Roush that GAO do the latter for purposes of Roush's own
  evaluation and leave the former for the NAS. <a href="#fn30"><sup><b>[30]</b></sup></a><a id="f30"></a></p>
<h3><a id="symposium"></a>The Symposium</h3>

<p> On June 28 O'Callaghan phoned McDonald to ask him for his thoughts on a UFO seminar. Apparently McDonald discussed
  this idea with Roush as a precursor to actual hearings thinking that the issue could be privately sanitized, while the
  event itself could serve to put the NAS on notice. McDonald provided O'Callaghan with the following list of possible
  participants. </p>
<ul>
  <li> Dr J. Allen Hynek, Northwestern, Astronomy (Alternate, Dr. T. Page, NASA Manned Spacecraft Center, Houston,
    Texas).
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> Dr Robert Hall, University of Illinois, Sociology (Alternate, Dr. Roger N. Shepherd, Stanford, Psychology, Dr. R.
    Leo Sprinkle, University of Wyoming, Psychology).
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> Dr. R.M.L. Baker, Jr., UCLA, Astronautical Engineering (Alternate, Dr. Frank Salisbury, Utah State University,
    Plant Physiology).
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> Dr. Carl Sagan, Cornell, Astronomy (Alternate, Dr. Robert Nathan, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute
    of Technology).
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li> Dr. Robert M. Wood, Deputy Director for R. and D., Douglas Missile and Space Systems Division, Douglas Aircraft
    Company, Santa Monica, California (Alternate, Dr. Gary Henderson, Senior Research Scientist, Space Sciences, General
    Dynamics, Fort Worth Division). </li>
</ul>
<p> He then discussed the pros and cons of each man and recommended that the publicity should be handled by Robert C.
  Cowen of the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> who would "push the whole problem along more constructively and more
  energetically than would Sullivan of the <i>New York Times</i>." <a href="#fn31"><sup><b>[31]</b></sup></a><a
      id="f31"></a></p>
<p> Two weeks later McDonald received an invitation from Roush's office to appear at a July 29 Symposium on UFOs to be
  held under the auspices of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. The participants were not to touch upon
  the past Air Force investigatory efforts or the situation at Boulder. "Our emphasis is to understand the technical and
  scientific facts surrounding these phenomena as the facts are understood by competent researchers in the field. Your
  presentation should reflect these views." <a href="#fn32"><sup><b>[32]</b></sup></a><a id="f32"></a></p>
<p> A week later Bob Wood of Douglas Aircraft canceled his appearance at the symposium. To illustrate the degree to
  which McDonald orchestrated the hearing he told O'Callaghan that Jim Harder of Berkeley's Engineering Department would
  be an effective substitute, wrote Harder telling him about it and prepared the wording of the invitation he wanted
  O'Callaghan to send. He noted that Congressman Miller represented the Berkeley area and hoped, therefore, that
  Harder's Berkeley affiliation might be able to sway him. <a href="#fn33"><sup><b>[33]</b></sup></a><a id="f33"></a>
  Further orchestration evidence is furnished in a note from McDonald to O'Callaghan in which he stated that he had
  completed the bulk of telephoning on Roush's credit card to Hall, Baker, Wood, Sagan, Hynek and Harder. Moreover,
  because the participants did not have much time to prepare their papers he feared they had possibly neglected
  recommendations for future Congressional action. Therefore, he felt that Roush should take it upon himself to prepare
  a summary of the talks and in so doing infer from them the kinds of actions the Committee might see fit to take in the
  future. <a href="#fn34"><sup><b>[34]</b></sup></a><a id="f34"></a></p>
<p> The Symposium (which it was called rather than a hearing) took place on July 29 as scheduled<b>*</b>. The speakers
  were McDonald, Hynek, Hall, Baker, Harder and Sagan. McDonald expressed satisfaction with the proceedings in general,
  although he found Hynek's remarks said very little and Sagan, by contributing his <i>Encyclopedia Americana</i>
  statement, provided a negative note. <a href="#fn35"><sup><b>[35]</b></sup></a><a id="f35"></a> Nevertheless, McDonald
  had managed to obtain a Congressional Hearing on UFOs which presented a pro-UFO bias, an unprecedented and
  unreplicated feat in the history of the UFO controversy. </p>

<p>
<h4 id="summary">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</h4>
<p></p>
<p> The strategy which McDonald adopted with respect to the Roush Hearings is now a familiar one. He intended the
  Hearings as a tactic to obtain legitimacy for the study of UFO data. He wanted hearings from as early as September
  1966, but he would not take action until the Colorado confrontation of February 1968, with the concomitant firings of
  Saunders and Levine, convinced him of the low probability of a positive Condon Report. Once he reached this conclusion
  he turned most of his energy toward the House Science and Astronautics Committee as a means of laying bare the
  substance of the phenomenon to Congressmen who could eventually conduct an investigation of their own which, he hoped,
  would catapult UFOs from obscurity to national prominence. </p>
<p> Throughout this episode in the politics of science McDonald depended on a number of different tactics. First he
  convinced Roush of the efficacy of the Hearing, then he presented his case to other influential Congressman, along the
  way he used various Congressmen for his own ends, and finally he orchestrated the symposium itself. </p>
<p> Between March 1967 and April 1968 McDonald made several attempts to convince Roush that UFO Hearings were in order.
  He used his usual discussion of past investigative experiences, the significance of the problem and his credentials in
  an initial letter to Roush. In a second letter he tried to counteract the negative influence of a communication from
  Gerard Kuiper to Roush. In a third note, while setting up a Washington meeting, he conveniently scheduled Roush
  amongst numerous scientific agencies and luminaries he intended to visit, to impress the Congressmen with the
  importance of the problem. In late 1967 McDonald endorsed Congressman Wyman's resolution for Hearings and when they
  did not materialize waited for the Boulder confrontation to develop before taking further action. When it did, in
  April 1968, he forwarded Roush the <i>Look</i> article and his 1/31/68 letter to Low which ignited the confrontation.
  Three days later Roush asked for UFO Hearings on the House floor.</p>
<p> This did not end the lobbying effort, however, for McDonald needed to convince other Congressmen of the efficacy of
  the Hearings. He spoke with Congressman William Ryan of New York and D'Addario's assistant in early May. To increase
  the pressure he asked Hall to get the NICAP membership to start writing to the House Science and Astronautics
  Committee, particularly Roush, Ryan, D'Addario and Karth. Then at the insistence of Roush's assistant O'Callaghan,
  McDonald wrote the committee chairman George Miller supporting Roush's plea for hearings and enlisted other scientists
  to do likewise. Moreover, he enclosed several articles intended to give Miller the impression that widespread interest
  in UFOs existed within the scientific community. Lastly, he spoke to the Burro Club, a group made up of assistants to
  Democratic Congressmen, in a further attempt to spread the UFO word in Congress. </p>
<p> He also urged other Congressmen to aid him. He encouraged Congressman Brotzman from the Boulder district, who
  already asked for an accounting from the CU president with respect to the UFO project, to continue his efforts. Morris
  Udall, McDonald's representative, also agreed to help. For this purpose McDonald wrote him a low-key letter on the UFO
  problem which Udall could show to any Congressman whom he could button-hole. Finally, Udall obtained McDonald an
  appointment to see Chairman Miller, who then agreed to hold the Hearing. </p>
<p> In several instances McDonald's guidance in the planning of the Hearing is evident. He provided O'Callaghan with the
  names of the speakers and alternates. He also proposed that Robert Cowen of the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> be
  used for publicity. When Robert Wood of Douglas Aircraft could not participate McDonald first recommended Jim Harder,
  and then invited him to take part, arguing that it could prove useful in swaying Miller to have the testimony of one
  of his constituents. And a week prior to the Hearing, when McDonald realized that no provisions existed for future
  more intensive investigations, he wrote O'Callaghan explaining how Roush could summarize the papers in his closing
  remarks which McDonald thought should point toward further Hearings. </p>
