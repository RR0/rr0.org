  L'objet principal de cette étude est the personal politics of science which tends in this instance to cast light upon
  the reception of potentially new observational data in science, Thomas Kuhn's notion of paradigm shift, and the
  history of the UFO controversy itself. Moreover, through a decidedly different look at the scientific process than
  that which is traditionally put forth, an effort is made to demonstrate that the scientific process can be profitably
  regarded as a political process.</p>
<p>
  Ideally, a more complete reconstruction of the scientific controversy surrounding the UFO problem is the proper
  foundation on which to build. Unfortunately, some participants in the affair refused to, or could not for various
  reasons, cooperate. Consequently, this study is based on a subset of information, the core of which I believe is
  virtually complete. By this I mean that the nucleus of this research consists of the complete work, and correspondence
  where relevant, of the late Dr. James E. McDonald who was the most outspoken academic in the UFO debate from 1966-71.
  Concentrating on McDonald, for my purposes, is the wisest strategy to pursue, for it will permit me to examine those
  issues referred to above, with the knowledge that only a limited amount of material pertinent to the McDonald
  experience has escaped my scrutiny. Yet, this should not be misconstrued to mean that McDonald alone will receive
  attention; for in his efforts to resolve the UFO riddle McDonald interacted with virtually all the prominent names in
  what has come to be referred to as the Field of Ufology. As these interactions arise I will chronicle them. As a
  result the reader will obtain an understanding of the personalities, issues, and strategies which compose the context
  of the UFO controversy. More importantly, however, this will convey the politics of being a scientific frontiersman.
  That is, attempting to make knowledge claims beyond those generally accepted by the scientific community.</p>
<p>
  The study is organized into seven chapters. In chapter one a framework for analysis is developed after reviewing some
  of the literature in the fields of Ufology, the politics of science, the sociology of science and the history of
  science. Within this framework the distinction is made between the scientific method and the scientific process; the
  former being a subset of the latter. Chapter two concentrates on McDonald's activities in 1966, the first year of his
  UFO involvement. He is followed intensively in order to capture the flavor of the highly political milieu in which he
  functioned and accordingly to make the case that the scientific process, at least in the potentially revolutionary
  instance, is a political process. Having demonstrated that, chapters three, four, five and six are less intensive, but
  are more substantively focused on single events as they highlight various aspects of the borderland science endeavor.
  In chapter three McDonald is observed meddling in the Air Force sponsored Condon Project at the University of
  Colorado, while in chapter four he engineers the 1968 UFO Symposium before the Science and Astronautics Committee of
  the U.S. House of Representatives. A few of the pitfalls of engaging a borderland subject are illustrated in chapter
  five by the battle which ensued over McDonald's spending of Office of Naval Research atmospheric physics research
  funds for UFO studies. This is followed by an examination of the 1969 American Association for the Advancement of
  Science (AAAS) UFO Symposium preparations in chapter six. Although McDonald did not play a role as a symposium
  organizer, the event itself -- getting established science to confront the UFO problem -- was the primary goal of his
  campaign. It is therefore instructive to view the confrontation. Lastly, chapter seven speaks to the concept of
  borderland science activity and an attempt is made to flesh out Kuhn's notion of a paradigm shift by discussing it in
  terms of a revolutionary political process.</p>
