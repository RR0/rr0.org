<p>The incident that ultimately brought the UFO-sleuth nexus into the mute picture occured in mid-December 1974, when a
  cow was found chopped up at the farm of Frank Schifelbien, near Kimball, Minnesota. At the same time, there were a
  number of UFO sightings in the state. After a rather cursory examination of the mutilation site, a Minnesota
  flying-saucer buff (and avowed Sasquatch contactee) named Terry Mitchell came to the conclusion that hovering aliens
  had beamed a high-energy ray at the cow. There were also suspiciously broken branches, undoubtedly caused, so
  Mitchell's theory went, by heedless saucerite aeronautics; and then there were strange indentations in the ice on the
  farmer's pond—obviously gouged by UFO landing gear—and peculiar circles in the snow, which appeared in an aerial
  photo.</p>
<p>Mitchell went on to postulate that UFOlk like steak as much as most Americans—although, again, the parts of the
  animal taken were those seldom found in any but a weirdo's casserole. Nevertheless, Mitchell's theory created a media
  flap that culminated in a telephone interview on Tom Snyder's NBC <em>Tomorrow</em> show in late 1974.</p>
<p>It was at this point that serious saucer students decided to get into the case. Le Dr. <a
    href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen/index.html">J. Allen Hynek</a>, director of the prestigious Center for UFO Studies
  and professor of astronomy at Northwestern University, had a friend in Minneapolis who had done some field
  investigation work for the center in his leisure time. This man was Donald E. Flickinger, a special agent for the
  Treasury, Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and in <time>1975-01</time>, Dr. <a
      href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen/index.html">Hynek</a> asked him to investigate the Minnesota mutilations.</p>
<p>Flickinger traveled to Kimball, interviewed Frank Shifelbien and rapidly demolished the UFO hypothesis. The
  saucer-landing divers in the pond turned out to be watering holes chopped in the ice; the tree branches had been
  broken by the wind and by Schifelbien himself; the saucer circles were actually snow-covered silage piles.</p>
<p>Word spread quickly among UFO researchers across the United States that the highly respected Dr. <a
    href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen/index.html">Hynek</a> had taken an interest in the mutilations. One of those who
  heard the news was <span class="people">Jerome Clark</span>, a UFO researcher of some reknown, who had been
  investigating the cattle mutilations since they first occurred in his home state of Minnesota in the spring of <time>1973</time>.
  <span class="people">Clark</span> wrote to agent Flickinger in January 1975 and related the allegations of a convict
  name A. Kenneth Bankston.</p>
