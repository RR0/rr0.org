<p>I did not want to become involved in the case. In New York, where I live, there had been several small items about
  the mutilations in the press in early 1975; I had added the clips to my file marked AN-SAC (animal sacrifices)—opened
  during my investigation of the Manson clan in 1970 and 1971—and forgotten about them. My mind had been bombarded for
  too many years with gore data, and I really wanted a respite from the images of violence and snuff-buffery, especially
  regarding the killing of cattle.</p>
<p>The one morning—it was June 18, 1975—I received a phone call from the office of my literary agent. The caller said
  that a package forwarded to me from the publisher of my Manson book was evincing ovoriferousness. Upon my urging, the
  wrappings were removed; inside was a box in which resided a large cow's tongue. I instantly recalled my file of
  mutilation clips and the fact that tongues were often missing from the animals.</p>
