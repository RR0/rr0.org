<p>It was almost dark as we ... sheriff's office and drove west ... xxxowa along .... .... ..... Springs. Naturally, I
  was scanning the skies for flying mute squads. Suddenly I saw a light appear under the clouds. I was excited! I could
  see the headlines: "BEATNIE INVESTIGATOR BREAKS INTERSTATE-TERROR CASE." I looked for an entrance to the grazing
  range, envisioning a cross-country chase after evil Satan scientists. I stopped the car and got out to listen for the
  whirring of capter blades; alas, the light had disappeared, and there was nothing to do but driver onward. I was
  feeling a mixture of disappointment and slation—I mean, who really wants to have a rumble with airborne surgical
  professionals? And the ugly headlines: "BEATNIK INVESTIGATOR MAILED TO FRIENDS.".</p>
<p>As we continued, however, we were passed by a shiny white van, which was pulling a large shiny white trailer and must
  have been traveling at 85 miles per hour. I tried to catch up, hoping to copy down the license number, but couldn't
  keep up. The trailer, I decided, was definitely large enough to carry a small helicopter, and I had just suggested to
  someone at the sheriff's office that maybe the mute mob was using trucks to transport copters into the vicinity of
  targeted cattle ranges.</p>
<p>Months later, I was speaking with the chief investigator at the district attorney's office in Trinidad, Colorado,
  Louis Corada, about the theory that the mutilations were part of a bacteriological warfare research project. I asked
  Girodo about the staging areas, or ground-support systems, that the mutilation mob would haxxhete have in order to
  operate, with safety and inpunity.</p>
<p>"Well, we know they are ground supported," he replied. "We know there are maintenance people on the ground with
  tracks." He mentioned a rancher in Kim, Colorado, who had shot at and hit one;</p>
<p>I then asked, "Do you have anything on big white vans pulling white trailers?"</p>
<p>And he replied: "Yeah, Texas plates; yeah sure do."</p>
<p>Girodo went on to describe an east Colorado ranch that he knew to be unset heavy security—with guards, guard dogs,
  chained access routes, and so forth. The ranch was owned by some sort of doctor. "And," he continued, "this was one
  place where they had taken photos of this particular type of trailer you're talking about." Officials had sown over
  the armed ranch to take photos of the vehicles and the doctor had called up the local Federal Aviation Administration
  office to complain; when officials then asked to be allowed onto the property, the doctor refused.</p>
<p>"We feel that he's using those damn trailers," Girodo said. "That setup in perfect: They've got a van; they've got
  all the ground support in that van pulling that trailer; and the chopper is in the trailer." The chopper, the
  investigator continued, could be put in the air in a matter of minutes.</p>
