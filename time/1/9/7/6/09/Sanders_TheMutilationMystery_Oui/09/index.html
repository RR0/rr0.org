<p>As far as I have been able to determine, it was investigators in Colorado who first suggested that bacteriological
  warfare research was behind the mutilations—that animals were being injected with bacteria or toxins and that glands
  and other parts were being removed to test the effects of the agents. The mutilators, the theory went, were
  deliberately trying to put the blame on UFOs or satanists or predators as a cover for what was really going on. The
  theory has some appeal, as it makes the whole phenomenon more cogent, and it makes many things about it very
  understandable.</p>
<p>Bacteriological and chemical warfare research, except for purely defensive purposes, has been banned in the United
  States since 1970. The ban grew out of an incident in Utah in March 1968, where thousands of sheep were accidentally
  kikked by deadly VX nerve gas that apparently floated away from the Dugway Proving Grounds, a bacteriological-warfare
  research center located southwest of Salt Lake City. The Army paid local ranchers something like $376,000 in damages
  for 6400 snuffed sheep.</p>

<p>After that little ovine indiscretion, there was tremendous pressure, particularly in Utah, to ban such research and
  development. President <a href="/people/n/NixonRichard/index.html">Richard Nixon</a> himself ordered a halt to the
  biological and chemical programs and the destruction of existing stock piles. The order was framed in November 1969
  and sent to Federal agencies in February 1970.</p>
<p>Not all Government agencies complied with the Presidential order, however. Senator Frank Church's Senate Select
  Committee on Ingelligence found earlier this year that the <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/index.html">CIA</a>, for instance,
  had stored a quantity of cobra venom and enough saxitoxin (shellfish toxin) to kill hundreds of thousands of humans.
  Senator Church's committee also found that the CIA had socked away many canisters of toxin and/or bacteria of the
  Clostridia genus. One of the theories in the multi-state mutilations case is that a rogue band of researchers is
  working with bacteria of the Clostridia genus.</p>
<p>There are some 93 species of Clostridia, among which are several diseases that afflict cattle; these include blackleg
  (<em>Clostridium chauveoi</em>) and malignant adema (<em>Clostridium septicum</em>). Clostridia attack humans also.
  Tetanus is caused by a Clostridia (<em>Clostridium tetani</em>) and one of the world's most potent toxins is produced
  by <em>Clostridium botulinum</em> (which causes botulism); according to Seymour Hersh's<em> Chemical and Biological
    Warfare—America's Hidden Arsenal</em>, a mere sight bearkoes of <em>Clostridium</em> scrin would theorically kill
  everybody in the world.</p>
<p>In virtually every state where mutilations have occured, clostridial infections were found to be the cause of death
  in some cases. Two well-informed Colorado investigators told me that they felt that the cause of death was being
  covered up by vaguely worded laboratory reports prepared by the state government investigators; it has even been
  charged that lab reports on the mutes have been suppressed. The well-informed investigator Girodo, for instance, told
  me of a female buffalo that was mutilated at a ranch in Colorado Springs on October 21, 1975. "An autopsy was
  performed," Girodo said, "and trace of chemical foreign to the animal were found in its blood stream Boy, after that
  they clamped slows on it. They didn't let another woed out." El Paso County, colorado, undersheriff Gary Gibbs who
  coordinated much of the early mutilations investigation in his state, believes that a cleanup was subsequently put on
  tests at the laboratories run by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation in Denver and at Colorado State University in
  Fort Collins.</p>
<p>But why would an agency of the Colorado state government purinigsns.</p>

<p>The Colorado Bureau of Investigation officially began its investigation of the mutilation in the summer of 1975 at
  the urging of Governor Richard D. Lamm; however, its report—which was released in November—showed that some
  investigation had been done as early as April 1975. The report was based on some 203 incidents of apparent mutilation;
  the conclusion was that 95 percent of the mutilations had been caused by predators.</p>
<p>This prompted a cross-state chorus of meers and jeers from local law-enforcement officials, who must have begun to
  feel that the C.B.I. was treating them like a bunch of dumdums. Moreover, of the small number of animals that the
  C.B.I. submitted to have been chopped up by human hand, all had first died, the report stated, from "natural causes."
  The implication, of course, was that ranchers had chopped the animals up in order to collect insurance money for
  malicious-mischief damages. Indignant ranchers noted, however, that the report was vague as to the meaning of "natural
  causes."</p>
<p>But it was nature that ultimately shot down the C.B.I's predator story, as reporter Dorothy Aldridge, of the <em>Colorado
  Springs Gazette Telegraph</em>, has acutely observed. A blizzard in November 1975 left thousands of cattle dead on the
  range and the coyotes of the West vent on instant cattle-gorge maneuvers. But, when Aldridge checked with the
  rendering plant at Tribune, Kansas, which processed 30,000 of the ravaged carcasses, she learned that the predators
  had eaten no eyeballs, ears, doogs, or other favorite treats of the mutilators. So much for the C.B.I. report.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1975, investigator Girodo arranged for Dr. Susan Colter, director of the Trinidad, Colorado, Animal
  Clinic, to conduct a field autopsy on a mutilated heifer whose carcass had been discovered less than 12 hours after
  death.</p>
<p>"Was it a healthy heifer?" I later asked Girodo.</p>
<p>"Definitely," he replied. "As a matter of fact, the rancher had her fattened up and ready to butcher."</p>
<p>Dr. Colter removed various parts of the animal, including the heart, lungs, kidneys and liver, and sent samples to a
  laboratory for analysis. I called up Dr. Colter to ask her if a Clostridia had been found, and she told me that, in
  fact, a culture of <em>Clostridium sordelii </em>had been removed from the dead animal. The inner organs of the
  freshly dead animal had already turned to amush—a characteristic of clostridial infection.</p>
<p>Girodo had also asked Fr. Colter to try to clear up one of the mutilations mysteries: that of seemingly impossible
  surgery whereby the animals hearts had been removed through thoracic incisions too small for the bovine heart. There
  had been two such heart extractions on mutes found near Walsenburg, Colorado. "When Susan Colter did the autopsy on
  that one heifer," Girodo said, "I told her, 'Let's try and get that heart out of there." I showed her the way it
  appeared to have been done on two other animals. And she said, 'There's no way you can do it."</p>
<p>Was it possible, I began to wonder, that the mutilators were using razor-sharp extracting devices—similar, say, to
  core samplers used in geologic drilling—in order to scalt out glands or hearts or whatever else they needed for their
  research? Thay way, assuming that it's some form of toxic research, they would have been able to stand at some
  distance from the animal so as also to avoid self-sap from germs and poisons.</p>
