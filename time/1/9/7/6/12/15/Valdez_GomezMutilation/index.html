<p>Cow Mutilation - Page 1</p>
<p>On 06-13-76 at approximately 8:00 p.m. Mr. Manuel Gomez, Dulce, N. M. contacted writer by public service stating that
  he had found a three year old cow at his ranch which appeared to have been mutilated and that he would like for writer
  to check into it. Writer advised Mr. Gomez that he was on day off and that he would proceed there at 5:00 a.m., on
  06-14-76.</p>
<p>Writer contacted Mr. Paul Riley of the New Mexico Cattle Sanitary Board and proceeded to the Gomez Ranch. Upon
  arrival at the ranch, it was observed that the only vehicle tracks were those of Mr. Gomez's pick up. Since his ranch
  is locked up and the only entrance is through the gate used by writer. At the scene, writer examined the carcass of a
  3 yr. old black White-Faced cow which was lying on its right side. The left ear, the tongue, the udder, and the rectum
  had been removed with what appeared to be a sharp precise instrument. No traces of blood were left on the skin of the
  cow. The hide of on underneath side of the cow was white so that spotting of blood would have been easily detected.
  Other evidence on the cow was a small puncture on the brisker. No other evidence was available as to cause of
  death.</p>
<p>Investigation continued around the area revealed that a suspected aircraft of some type had landed twice, leaving
  these pod marks positioned in a triangular shape. The diameter of each pod was 14". The perimeter around the three
  pods was 16&frac12;' (6'X5'X5&frac12;'). Eminating from the two landings were smaller triangular shaped tripods 28"
  apart and 4" in diameter. Investigation at the scene showed that these small tripods had followed the cow for
  approximately 600'. Tracks of the cow showed where shed had struggled and fallen. The small tripod tracks were all
  around the cow. Other evidence showed that grass around the tripods, as they followed the cow, had been scorched. Also
  a yellow oily substance was located in two places under the small tripods. This substance was submitted to the State
  Police Lab. The Lab was unable to detect the content of the substance.</p>
<p>A sample of the substance was submitted to a private lab and they were unable to analyze the substance due to the
  fact that it disappeared or dissentigrated. Skin samples were analyzed by the State Police Lab and the Medical
  Examiner's office. It was reported that the skin had been cut with a sharp instrument.</p>
<p>On 06-17-76 writer contacted a Mr. Howard Burgess from Albuquerque, N. M. to proceed to the scene and conduct a
  radiation test. This was 3 days after the incident had occured. His findings were that around the tripod marks and in
  the immediate tracks, the radiation level was twice the normal background reading. Mr. Burgess's qualifications may be
  checked as he is a retired scientist from Sandia Lab, Albuquerque, N. M. It is the opinion of this writer that
  radiation finding are deliberately being left at the scene to confuse investigators.</p>
<p>There was also evidence that the tripod marks had returned and removed the left ear. Tripod marks were found over Mr.
  Gomez's tire tracks of his original visit. The left ear was intact when Mr. Gomez first found the cow. </p>

<p>The cow had a 3 month old calf which has not been located since the incident. This appears strange since a small calf
  normally stays around the mother cow even though the cow is dead.</p>
<p>Writer has conducted an intensive investigation into approximately 23 cattle mutilations which have been reported in
  the state of New Mexico within the last 16 months. They all carry the same pattern. Also during this investigation
  writer has been able to determine that on one of the mutilated cows which occured in New Mexico, a high dosage of
  Atropine insecticide was analyzed in the blood system. This substance is a tranquilizing drug. The Los Alamos
  Scientific Research Laboratory has conducted a necropsy on several animals including a buffalo, which revealed that
  the animals had been highly infected with Black Leg.</p>
<p>Investigation has also revealed that on all cattle mutilations which have occured in New Mexico and surrounding
  states, that the object of the mutilations has been the lymph node system.</p>
<p>This writer has been assisting Sheriff Tex Graves, Logan County, Sterling, Colorado. Samples from Logan County
  mutilated cows were brought by this writer to be analyzed by three private chemists, as it appears that the Government
  associated laboratories are not reporting complete findings. The substance which was on the cow (mutilated in Logan
  County) was analyzed as containing an ion exchange resin and Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Writer is working with Sheriff
  Graves due to the fact that Sheriff Graves has been unable to get cooperation from Colorado State University in the
  analysis of samples. These trips have been made on writer's own time and at his own expense. Writer has contacted
  several states where these mutilations exist over the 1000 mark.</p>
<p>During this period of investigation several theories have been thorougly checked out such as a "Satan Worshipers"
  group and predators. Both have been ruled out due to expertise and preciseness and the cost involved to conduct such a
  sophisticated and secretive operation. It should also be noted that during the Spring of 1974 when a tremendous amount
  of cattle were lost due to heavy snowfalls, the carcasses had been eaten by predators. These carcasses did not
  resemble the carcasses of the mutilated cows.</p>
<p>Investigation has narrowed down to these theories which involve (1) Experimental use of Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and
  (2) The testing of the lymph node system. During this investigation an intensive study has been made of (3) What is
  involved in germ warfare testing, and the possible correlation of these 3 factors (germ warfare testing, use of
  Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, testing of the lymph Node System).</p>
<p>Investigation is continuing on this case.</p>
