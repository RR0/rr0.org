<p>To most people, Colorado means the high country, timberline, dozens of {{14000|number}} foot peaks, alpine lakes and
  meadows, the heartland of the Rockies with spectacular scenery wherever you look. That's not all of Colorado, however.
  The eastern third, from the Denver foothills to the Kansas-Nebraska border, covering almost <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">150</span> <span content="SMI" itemprop="unitCode">pieds</span>
    </span>, is a different country, the high arid plains, old buffalo territory.
</p>
<p>The high plains immediately east of the Rockies aren't perfectly flat. After rising slightly out of the Denver basin,
  they slope gradually eastward about ten feet per mile. Drainage northward into the Platte and south into the Arkansas
  creates a slight hump in the center of the state north and south as well as east and west. The flat, dry, treeless
  landscape has been described by many as extremely monotonous.
</p>
<p>what's most spectacular about that land is its immense sky, a deep blue high altitude transparency falling away to
  the distant horizons all around, like an ocean sky, but much bluer, drier and clearer, and bigger, too, since the land
  there is rounder than the ocean. It's not a good place for things to hide in. Eagles circling overhead can see and be
  seen for miles.
</p>
<p>Yet, something strange -- and in a way terrifying - has been happening recently in Colorado, throughout the west, and
  especially on the high plains immediately south and east of Denver. Animals have been found mutilated, mostly cattle,
  but also horses, sheep, goats and possibly dogs. The situation is completely baffling. Although at least 180 cases
  were reported in Colorado during <time>1975</time>, the first solid clue to the mutilators' identity has yet to be
  discovered. The following news items present most of what is publicly known.
</p>
<p>The Glenwood Post, Glenwood Springs, Colorado, <time>1975-09-22</time></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Garfield County Undersheriff told the Glenwood Post last week that Garfield County was the scene of a cattle
    mutilation as early as February of this year (<time>1975</time>). Hart also reported that on September 13, a
    Hereford cow was discovered mutilated just across the Garfield County line in Mesa County. Missing were the animal's
    sex organs, rectum and an ear.
  </p>
  <p>As usual, the animal was cut up, genitals excised and no sign left that would give law enforcement authorities any
    clues as to who or what committed the slaying. Hart said, <q>There was no blood leading away from the kill. There
      were no tracks. There wasn't even a cigarette butt.</q>
  </p>
  <p>The February slaying involved two Hereford calves. Both animals had been stripped of their hides along their front
    quarters. No meat had been taken. There are also indications that slayings have occurred which have never been
    reported to the police authorities.
  </p>
  <p>In the last several months, butchering cattle has been on the upswing. Hart attributes this primarily to the
    country's economic recession. Police authorities are aware that some mutilations take place only to obscure the
    primary motive - that of obtaining some very fresh beef free of cost. Hart said, <q>Whenever meat is gone, we don't
      classify it as a mutilation.</q>
  </p>
  <p>"Theories abound as to who is committing the slayings. They include contentions that they are being committed by a
    satanic cult and even creatures from outer space. Hart is not willing to discard any possibility - no matter how
    outlandish. Hart doesn't even dismiss the interplanetary theory. Although he thinks that would be the last of all
    explanations, he says, <q>In all my years of police work, I've had occasion to see things in the sky, along with
      other people, that none of us could explain.</q>
  </p>
  <p>When questioned about the possibility of a satanic cult being involved, Hart said, <q>It could be. However, we have
    no evidence whatever to prove that.</q> The only thing Hart is willing to definitely say is, <q>No doubt they are a
    bunch of nuts of some kind.</q>
  </p>
  <p>The most baffling aspect of the slayings to law enforcement authorities has been the neatness with which the
    killings have been done. In Colorado, slayings have occurred on open range land. Rarely are there footprints or tire
    tracks around the carcasses. This differs from killings reported in eastern states. In those eastern states, cattle
    were found in wooded areas where it is much easier to remain undetected. Ranchers and police are perplexed how the
    killers can continue to remain undetected on open range.
  </p>
  <p>This is particularly true in Colorado's eastern plains. Hart detailed one case in which a steer was found on open
    range, cut open at the ribs with the heart excised.

<p>The same news item from the Glenwood Post tells of a Carbondale backpacker who found two mutilated sheep while hiking
  in the high country. According to him, "It definitely was not any coyote. They don't neatly cut throats and leave with
  the genitals."
</p>
<p>The loss of two or three hundred cattle throughout the entire state of Colorado, which raises three million for
  slaughter, at least {{30000|number}} of which could be expected to die annually of natural causes, isn't economically
  significant. What arouses such intense interest is the uncanny nature of the thing. Everyone who hears of it is
  fascinated and/or repelled. This includes the governor of Colorado, as is shown by the following news item.<br>
</p>
<p>The Meeker Herald, Meeker, Colorado, <time>1975-09-04</time></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Gov. Richard D. Lamm flew to Pueblo Monday afternoon to confer with the executive board of the Colorado Cattlemen's
    Association concerning the widespread livestock mutilations that have occurred throughout the state. Calling the
    mutilations <q>one of the greatest outrages in the history of the Western cattle industry</q>, Lamm pledged the full
    resources of the state to help stop the mutilations and arrest the persons responsible.
  </p>
  <p><q>It is no longer possible to blame predators for the mutilations</q>, Lamm said. <q>It is clear from the evidence
    that only human predators can be responsible for these terrible offenses</q>. The Governor noted that the School of
    Veterinary Medicine at Colorado State University had concluded that mutilations were caused by humans using knives.
  </p>
  <p><q>It is important that we solve this mystery as soon as possible</q>, Lamm said. <q>The cattle industry already is
    hard hit from an economic point of view. From a humane point of view, and from an economic point of view, we cannot
    allow these mutilations to continue.</q>
  </p>
  <p>Lamm was accompanied to the meeting with the cattlemen by John MacIvor, Director of the Colorado Bureau of
    Investigation, which entered the case at the request of local law enforcement officials. The governor told the
    cattlemen he was asking all state agencies to cooperate fully with the <abbr
        title="Colorado Bureau of Investigation">CBI</abbr>, and local officials, and to provide any help needed to
    solve the case.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>If this mystery isn't solved, it won't be for a lack of trying. Some lawmen have said privately they would rather
  crack this than any case they've ever worked on. It would be interesting to calculate how much more the police work
  has cost than the comparatively paltry loss of 200 beef. What's involved here is the principle of the thing, rather
  than money, and the uncanniness of the phenomenon, the intense public interest, the sacred rights of property, the
  rule of law and the loss of face for the law enforcement officials.<br>
</p>
<p>The Gunnison County Times, Gunnison, Colorado, <time>1975-09-08</time></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>DENVER - The largest force of law enforcement manpower ever assembled in the history of Colorado has been unable to
    find any answers to the questions about 150 cattle mutilations. And, the reports of slain and mutilated cattle are
    still coming in daily. Reports early this week disclosed that other states experiencing the cattle mutilations in
    the past four years are now mobilizing a united effort to try to stop whoever is behind these slayings and apprehend
    those responsible.
  </p>
  <p>The use of radar aircraft installations over a wide area is now being employed to help local law officers track
    unidentified aircraft or reported sightings from area residents. A helicopter flying under <span itemscope
        itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">50</span> <span content="FOT" itemprop="unitCode">feet</span>
    </span>, however, may not show up on radar. If a helicopter were to dip behind a hill or land for a short period of
    time, the radar may lose the unidentified aircraft. Law enforcement officials are still facing many problems with
    how to track down reported sightings of helicopters flying without lights in the vicinity of mutilated cattle.
  </p>
  <p>A three state meeting of law enforcement officers has led to an agreement to share any and all information in the
    mutilation cases. Approximately 60 law officers from Nebraska, Wyoming and Colorado met in Fort Morgan to try to
    coordinate an effort to apprehend those responsible for the multitude of mutilations plaguing already hard hit
    ranchers and farmers in as many as 10 or more states.
  </p>
  <p>CHECK LIST</p>
  <p>The <abbr title="Colorado Cattlemen's Association">CCA</abbr> issued the following check list for ranchers:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Check pastures and cattle regularly - daily if at all possible.</li>
    <li>If livestock mutilations or deaths are found:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Do not go near or move the animal.</li>
        <li>Do not touch anything that would appear to be some physical evidence toward what may have caused the
          animal's death or mutilation.
        </li>
        <li>Immediately call the CCA Office, collect, at 623-4347.</li>
        <li>Immediately call the local sheriff's office.</li>
        <li>Do not discuss the death with neighbors, or others until it has been checked by officials.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Report any suspicious vehicle movements of any type.
      <ol type="a">
        <li>If an automobile, try to obtain a description to include color, year, make, model, tag number, time of day,
          date and direction traveling.
        </li>
        <li>If an aircraft, try to obtain description, color, numbers, helicopter or fixed wing, single or multi-engine,
          time of day, date and direction traveling.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Avoid publicity.</li>
    <li>Time is of the essence. During business hours 8:30 to 5 PM, call the CCA Office at 623-4347. After hours, call
      David G. Rice, Jr., 237-4274, Doug Huddleston, 238-9894, or Margaret Maul, 364-4133.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>This fact sheet is for Colorado residents only. Residents in other states should contact local law enforcement
    agencies immediately and local and state cattlemen's associations. The recent meeting held in Fort Morgan confirmed
    132 cattle mutilation deaths in Colorado with estimates now indicating the number may be as high as 150.
  </p>
  <p>Mutilated cattle delivered to the Colorado State University veterinary pathology lab have, for the most part, been
    too decomposed to be able to ascertain the cause of death. In one case, the cause of death was reported to have
    resulted from natural causes before the mutilation was performed.
  </p>
  <p>CBI special investigator, Carl Whiteside, said that the removal of sex organs and other body parts was definitely
    not made by predators. The only consistent item brought up was that a ranch or farm hit once was not hit again.
  </p>
  <p>Sheriff George Yarnell of Elbert County, Colorado, the hardest hit area with 55 cattle mutilations that began in
    April, believes that helicopters are being used to transport the animals. He described circular impressions found
    around one slain animal to support his theory. He also reported that about 85% of the cattle mutilated in his area
    were found in hilly terrain. <q>If helicopters are being used, this type of area would cut down on lighting and
      noise of aircraft</q>, Yarnell said.
  </p>
  <p>There has also been some consensus by various ranchers studying their mutilated animals that tranquilizer darts or
    injections are being used on the cattle. Colorado's U. S. Senator, Floyd Haskell, has called for the Federal Bureau
    of Investigation to enter the case, since the incidence of cattle mutilations has covered several western states.
  </p>
  <p>All kinds of classes of cattle have been effected with many of the most valuable animals in the herd being struck
    down. Miscellaneous cases have been reported in the Dakotas, Wyoming, Nebraska, New Mexico and Montana, but Colorado
    remains the hardest hit to date.
  </p>
  <p>The number of cattle mutilations and the frequency of the slayings has continued to baffle Colorado law enforcement
    officials since <time>1975-04</time>. The Colorado Cattlemen's Association has offered a {{5000|currency:"$":0}}
    reward for the apprehension of those responsible for the mutilations. Also, the Montana Stock growers Association
    has recently raised the reward in Montana from {{250|currency:"$":0}} to {{1000|currency:"$":0}} for any information
    leading to the arrest and conviction of mutilators.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>As this is being written, rewards offered for the arrest and conviction of cattle mutilators keep mounting and would
  make a nice bulge in the wallet to go with the feather in the cap of the lawman who solves the case. In order to check
  out the tranquilizer dart and injection theories, <abbr title="Colorado State University">CSU</abbr> animal
  pathologists have skinned out some carcasses very carefully examining the flesh and hides for tiny holes or other
  evidence of injections and have reported finding none. The helicopter theory is widespread because no tracks, blood,
  or evidence of struggle is apparent. Also, some carcasses appear to have been transported to unlikely locations
  apparently so they can be found more easily. Intense blinding lights from the sky are also reported to be a part of
  the phenomena.
