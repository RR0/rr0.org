<p class="exergue">REWARDS NOW TOTAL $23,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of stock mutilators in
  Colorado. The last $10,000 was posted by the Elbert and El Paso County Ranchers and Farmers Association for incidents
  in those two counties (where NORAD and the Air Force Academy are located). More mutilations have been reported in New
  Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Oregon, Wisconsin and Iowa. Shots have been fired at Army helicopters. Accusations have been
  hurled at everyone from Patty Hearst (Symbionese Army captive) to the (Charles) Manson family (mass murderer) and the
  U. S. government. There have also been reported mutilations of dogs, hogs, mules, donkeys, goats, sheep, horses and a
  buffalo at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs. But lawmen and ranchers are still looking for their first
  solid clue.<br> <span class="source">- The Farm Journal, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, December 1975</span></p>
<p>One especially infuriating aspect of it has been the waste of meat. To ranchers, this is absolutely unpardonable on a
  par with trophy hunters who take heads to hang in their dens while letting the edible part of the game rot. Actually,
  this is even worse. Cattlemen imagine prime steaks to be the very choicest food available anywhere. But these
  mutilators, whoever they are, display a fine contempt and haughty disdain for that economically sacred idea.</p>
<p>No one so far has suggested that they eat or sell the excised organs, which after all are only offal. But when
  excellent meat could be theirs for the mere taking, they NEVER touch it, leaving it to rot, spoiling it, apparently,
  not only for humans, but also for predators and even for worms.</p>
<p>Even worse is their deliberate flaunting of property rights and very legally constituted authority. What kind of
  people are they? It's obvious they aren't trying to hide their depredations, but to advertise them. There's no attempt
  to hide mutilated carcasses. Time after time they are positioned neatly in barnyards, across ditches, in ponds and in
  other very exposed places where they're sure to be found quickly. Unlike common criminals who calculate how to keep
  their work hidden, these uncommon ones ARE OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO MAKE THEIR PRESENCE KNOWN.</p>
<p>That these things can be done in areas where people are keyed up almost to the panic point and everyone is on the
  lookout day and night for anything the least suspicious or unusual, where every stranger is recognized immediately and
  sharp inquiry made into his business, is almost unbelievable. It must mean that the mutilators know exactly what's
  happening on the ground and in the airspace all around them. Who's asleep, taking a bath, or submerged in his idiot
  box? And who is out riding herd, checking his pasture, watching with binoculars from his pickup or out of the darkened
  windows?</p>
<p>The growing awareness that this may be, might be, and even must be true is uncanny enough to be completely unnerving.
  So far as is known, the mutilators haven't made one misstep. They leave their calling cards, but no one has ever
  surprised them at their work. They leave too much evidence for any rational person to deny they exist, but never
  enough to be identified. No one even claims to have taken a picture of them. Afterward, of course, thousands are
  taken. They're obviously playing with us like a cat plays with a mouse. And it's driving folks, including the
  authorities, right up the wall.</p>
<p>It's interesting, and may be enlightening, to make some comparisons. Critics of the AEC, now ERDA, maintain that no
  matter how clear or abundant the evidence, the nuclear establishment will never admit the deadlines of their
  activities until the actual corpses resulting from their work are publicly produced and perfectly identified. With
  cattle mutilators, on the other hand, the terms of the situation are completely reversed. Here an abundance of
  carcasses is being presented in such a way that they can't be hidden or denied. But there are no other clues at all,
  making this even more mysterious, enigmatic and esoteric than nuclear physics. In this and every other way that a
  comparison might be made, the cattle mutilators appear to be the direct mirror opposites to nuclear technicians, like
  Lucifer is the direct mirror opposite of Christ.</p>

    The yellow areas surrounding Colorado Springs and the U. S. government's global<br> monitoring center, NORAD, are
    towns and areas where animal mutilations have repeatedly<br> been reported since at least the 1960s. Even a
    1500-pound buffalo inside the Cheyenne Mountain<br> Zoo near NORAD was killed and mutilated, discovered October 21,
    1975.

<p>No one, publicly, has considered what may be the most important clue to the purpose and identity of the mutilators.
  That is: WHERE they've been operating. Keeping in mind the remarkable precision of their work, the LOCATION of it must
  be equally precise and significant. By using our heads here and putting two and two together, we could begin to
  unravel the mystery. They've operated all over the mountain west, and no doubt over an even larger area where public
  attention has not been drawn to the phenomenon. Public attention must surely be an important factor here. But by far
  the heaviest hit area has been Elbert County, immediately east of the Rockies. So we might consider the special
  significance of that location.</p>

<p>Animal Mutilations Even At America's Highly Secure NORAD in Cheyenne Mountain</p>
<p>Dr. Urich, the county coroner, said:<br> "The cutting was done neatly, cleanly, obviously<br> with a very sharp
  instrument. The dissection was<br> of the type that would eliminate any type of predator."<br> He said the hide was
  removed by someone who did<br> not puncture the tissue layer directly under the hide."<br> It was better than I could
  do if I were trying.<br> It was really an expert job."</p>
<p>- The Colorado Springs Sun, October 23, 1975</p>
<p>Elbert is a huge county, roughly fifty miles east to west and north to south. It's the highest of the high plains
  counties with the bluest, widest and most transparent skies and it would seem the hardest skies to hide in. Although
  it's a rurally oriented county, the northwest corner of it comes to within twenty miles of downtown Denver and the
  southwest corner of it comes to within about the same distance from Colorado Springs.</p>
<p>The area where by far the most mutilations have taken place is also ringed with the world's most sophisticated
  military installations. To the southwest is the U. S. Air Force Academy. Ent Air Force Base, the huge Army base Fort
  Carson, and Peterson Field, a busy municipal and military airport. Along the northern edge of Elbert County is the
  Lowry Air Force Bombing Range.</p>
<p>Right beyond that is the Buckley Air National Guard and Naval Air Station, Lowry Air Force Base, Stapleton
  International Airport, the Rocky Mountain Arsenal where nerve gas and other exotic poisons are created and stored, and
  the famous Rocky Flats, where H-bomb triggers are fabricated and refurbished and plutonium disbursed over Denver and
  Boulder. Although the area immediately surrounding the cattle mutilation hot spot may not surpass Mendel Rivers' home
  town in its sheer weight of military pork, nowhere on earth supports more sophisticated nuclear and military aerospace
  apparatus.</p>
<p>The capstone of all this, and ultimately of all U. S. military muscle, is Ent Air Force Base and Cheyenne Mountain,
  the headquarters for NORAD (North American Air Defense Command and the Canadian Air Defense Command.) Cheyenne
  Mountain, just outside Colorado Springs and at the foot of Pike's Peak, is the rightfully famous "brain" or "heart" of
  America's military readiness. If a president ever pushes the big button, Cheyenne Mountain will be the source of his
  intelligence.</p>
<p>The air defense of the North American continent is the responsibility of NORAD, an international command, which
  continually receives and analyzes information from the continental network of radars scanning the skies day and night.
  Carved into the solid heart of Cheyenne Mountain is NORAD's Combat Operations Center. 45,000 cubic yards of granite
  had to be blasted out to accommodate its solid steel buildings, some of them three stories high, all free-standing and
  mounted on the biggest coil springs ever made.</p>
<p>This most secure of all military installations can only be reached through long tunnels cut in solid rock and
  protected by a system of immense blast doors, all designed to withstand direct hits by hydrogen missiles, intense
  fallout, or a prolonged siege. NORAD's Cheyenne Mountain base was built at a fabulous cost to be the safest place on
  earth, able to weather any conceivable attack. When everything else goes under, this is designed to be the very last
  and ultimately secure bastion of freedom.</p>
<p>The purpose of this fortress inside a mountain is to detect and analyze everything entering or crossing United States
  air space. At one time, it was claimed that it was doubtful if even a needle could get through the total radar network
  without detection. The complex also keeps a close watch for missiles or hostile vehicles that might approach the U. S.
  from nearby space.</p>

<p>"Apart from NORAD's thorough coverage of aircraft and missiles, the Space Surveillance web of the U. S. Navy aids in
  keeping close tabs on all man-made objects orbiting beyond the earth. These include fragments of metal and plastic
  from rockets or satellites that have broken up in space. it has already detected an 8-foot length of thin wire
  orbiting a hundred odd miles above the earth. Reporting to the center are optical tracking stations equipped with
  Super-Schmidt-Baker-Nunn cameras that can clearly photograph objects up to a distance out in space of 100,000 miles.
  The cameras and radar trackers are spread around the world. All of them supply practically instantaneous data to the
  Center at Colorado Springs.<br> <br> "To the right of the big BMEWS screen (in Cheyenne Mountain), is an even larger
  screen that displays a map of the entire North American continent. The Battle Staff members sit behind a long console
  facing the screens in a darkened room. The scene resembles, but is much more dramatic than, a cinema screen during an
  exciting moment in a theatre.<br> <br> "One of these is a surveillance network that continuously and automatically
  surveys all of the cis-lunar space (the area of space that extends from the Earth to the moon). According to Dr.
  Eberhardt W. Wahl, acting chief scientist on the project, 'With the technical application of astronomy to the specific
  purpose of man-made satellite surveillance, all of the space between here and the moon will get a really thorough
  going over. If there is anything of any size between here and the moon, we will find it and track it. It would be
  relatively easy to determine whether the detected object were a natural moonlet or a man-made one. SPADATS could say
  with certainty, this is a natural moonlet, or, this is a foreign satellite.'"<br> <br> <br> 1500-Pound Buffalo
  Mutilated Inside Cheyenne Mountain Zoo Near NORAD</p>
<p>Of course, no livestock is kept inside Cheyenne Mountain, but there are a variety of exotic animals on display at the
  famous Cheyenne Mountain Zoo on the northeast flank of it. So on Tuesday, October 21, a 1500-pound buffalo was found
  mutilated there. The udder, an ear and a section of hide 24 x 24 inches had been taken and the vagina cut. Dr. Rodney
  C. Walker, zoo veterinarian, performed a "gross" autopsy. Dr. Raoul W. Urich, the El Paso County Coroner, examined the
  carcass and fluid samples were sent to the Colorado State University animal pathology lab at Ft. Collins.</p>
<p>The mutilated animal was in the North American Panorama section and within a stone's throw of a number of $100,000
  homes just beyond the luxurious Broadmoor Hotel and golf course that hosts world wide figure skating and golf
  competitions. The famous Will Rogers Memorial, a tall stone tower lighted at night and visible over the entire
  Colorado Springs area, stands immediately over the North American Panorama. From it, one can look right down on the
  buffalo hundreds of feet below.</p>
<p>Anyone could climb into the North American Panorama, but buffaloes can't be handled like Herefords. They are wild,
  tough, strong, unpredictable and dangerous. According to zoo director, Dan Davis, "It looked as though the animal was
  lying down sleeping in a dusty area where the animals sleep. There are about 50 bison and 10 American Elk in the pen
  and only their tracks were visible. There's no doubt the animal was mutilated with some sort of sharp instrument
  handled by man." (The Gazette Telegraph, Colorado Springs, Colorado, November 21, 1975.)</p>
<p>Dr. Urich, the county coroner, said: "The cutting was done neatly, cleanly, obviously with a very sharp instrument.
  The dissection was of the type that would eliminate any type of predator." He said the hide was removed by someone who
  did not puncture the tissue layer directly under the hide. "It was better than I could do if I were trying. It was
  really an expert job." (The Colorado Springs Sun, October 23, 1975.)</p>
<p>Very little blood was apparent externally, except for some in the mouth where the tongue had been bitten. There was,
  however, excessive bleeding into the internal organs indicating the presence of some kind of anticoagulant. The
  examination left "no questions" that a predator had not killed the animal. What less than a full grown grizzly or a
  large pack of hungry timber wolves could bring down a 1500-pound bison anyway? And predators, except for taking a few
  birds, have never been a problem in the zoo's entire history.</p>
<p>"It was a very, very strange," according to Dr. Walker, the zoo's veterinarian who performed the gross autopsy.
  "There was an excessive amount of sero-sanguineous (blood-tinged) fluid in the abdominal and thoracic cavities and the
  fluid had seeped into the body tissue and even into the eyeballs." Walker said he had spent hours trying to find a
  disease that might account for this condition, but to no avail. He said that because of the freshness of the carcass,
  authorities "might" have a better chance to determine a definite cause of death. (The Colorado Springs Sun, October
  23, 1975.)</p>
<p>The carcass was in the best possible condition. Dr. Urich estimated it had been dead "up to 24 hours, but no more."
  And the nights were very cold. How could such a thing have been done in that completely exposed public place so near
  to houses in the daytime? Or how could it have been done at night without a good light plus a certain amount of time,
  noise and equipment? An attendant at the zoo says UFOs were being seen in the area at that time. And a man working at
  the Will Rogers Memorial says it is locally believed the animal was killed by a laser beam.</p>
<p>Another Cow Mutilation Near NORAD Road</p>
<p>Nor were these the only unauthorized intruders on Cheyenne Mountain. On July 6, a mutilation had been performed even
  closer to NORAD's front doorstep; in fact, much closer to it than one might imagine any animal could be found to
  mutilate.</p>
<p>Highway 115 is a busy divided expressway serving Ft. Carson and NORAD just beyond the city limits. A huge area there,
  thousands of acres, is military reservation, artillery ranges and so on. Near NORAD's super secret Cheyenne Mountain
  bastion, of course, the area is under the strictest possible surveillance. Immediately opposite the main entrance to
  Ft. Carson is the unmarked NORAD Road, an excellent wide three mile long highway that twists up the steep mountainside
  to the heavily guarded installation. NORAD Road isn't even on ordinary road maps. A big sign warns away all
  unauthorized persons and the side fences are lined every few feet with signs that say:</p>
<p>NO HUNTING KEEP OUT,<br> NO TRESPASSING,<br> VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTED<br> TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE LAW</p>
<p>The steep hillside up to the electrically controlled high entrance gate to the huge tunnel into this worldwide
  intelligence nerve center is covered with rock and brush. Surprisingly, a few cattle are also grazed there, no doubt
  to lower any possible fire hazard. So, right there, immediately overlooking thousands of military buildings, the
  protective covering of hundreds of planes and helicopters and 20,000 soldiers, and immediately in front of the
  electronic brain and senses that survey the entire North American continent so that even a needle couldn't get in
  undetected, plus monitoring all of space from here to the moon so as to detect even an 8-foot length of fine wire
  orbiting the earth, someone thought this would be a neat place to have a cattle mutilation.</p>
<p>It was a standard mutilation of a cow due to calve in two months, and Deputy Sheriff Sgt. Robert Stone "ruled out the
  possibility that the animal's sex organs were removed by a coyote." Sgt. Stone said in his opinion, "the animal did
  not struggle when it went down, but was possibly induced with a tranquilizer." (The Gazette Telegraph, Colorado
  Springs, Colorado, July 6, 1975.)</p>
<p>All during this investigation, I continually asked if there was any sort of pattern to the phenomenon. The answer was
  always the same: no pattern, everything was completely illogical. The big stack of accumulated clippings and articles
  reflected the same altogether random quality, even when it seemed obvious to me that there was a pattern. Whoever
  could be doing all this so beautifully and subtly must also have a precise purpose for going to such pains.</p>
<p>The only published indication of a pattern was in a tiny Cripple Creek publication, and it was the same as mine. It
  was under the headlines:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Cripple Creek Gold Rush, Cripple Creek, Colorado, September 21, 1975</p>
<p>THREE MORE MUTILATIONS REPORTED</p>
<p>"The sheriff (Gary D. Shoemaker) also noted two more mutilations were reported southeast of the Teller County
  incidents "in the same path going toward Colorado Springs." The two additional reports occurred in El Paso
  County."</p>
<p>When people do outlandish things, or commit shocking and dramatic crimes, part of their reason for doing that is to
  deliver a message. They are trying to communicate with those who have closed off all other means of communication and
  absolutely refuse to listen. That's the situation here. Either we're too dumb to get their message, or we've
  absolutely determined not to, come hell and high water. What's the likely reward for solving this mystery that
  $23,000? Or public ridicule and the widespread assumption that you've completely lost your marbles?</p>
<p>Someone has been delivering a message to the American people, to the government, the intelligence community and to
  NORAD. They are saying something important in the most direct way possible. And they've aroused public curiosity,
  interest and attention. But why are they delivering it through ranchers and farmers? There's no logic to that. Yet,
  maybe there is. Keep in mind that this is a message that no one in a position of authority wants to hear, and will go
  to almost any length to shut out of his own and the public's attention. Rural folks, being not quite so far down the
  tube, may be more inclined to listen, or at least to hear.</p>
<p>Consider this little booklet, for example, published and distributed in the most amateurish fashion. The ideas in it
  aren't sophisticated, but they far outdistance the really pitiful conceptions of the slick journalists who enjoy the
  advantages of big name publishers. And there are reasons why things are as they are. Although I enjoy a few publishing
  connections, it was also obvious that to send something so vital to the big name publishers would be a mere waste of
  time and postage. My sure guide, who is the only one I want to please anyway, says better to get something done as
  quietly and obscurely as possible at a much greater effort, expense and sacrifice. Then there's a chance of getting it
  before the public without it being nipped in the bud. The fancier the organization, the more easily it is subverted.
  But a determined individual initiative makes even the devil shake with rage and frustration.</p>
<p>These strange things have been happening throughout the west and finally centering on Colorado Springs because in
  this case NORAD is in the middle of where it's at. We can be sure that other places in the world, Soviet intelligence,
  for example, are getting similar messages. Of course, they have a censorship that even more effectively blanks out the
  truth. And the farther a thing is from home, the easier it is to suppress.</p>
<p>It would be safe betting one's last dollar on the fact that super secret intelligence services the world over are
  getting bugged in ways that are at least as hard to explain as cattle mutilation has been to ranchers, farmers and
  sheriffs. But would outsiders ever get the least inkling of that? Of course they wouldn't! So we can expect more and
  more uncanny things to be happening at every level of society as the noose gradually tightens. People who have seen
  mutilated cattle at first hand tend to dismiss the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, the so-called authority in this
  matter, as being incredibly stupid and short-sighted.</p>
<p>That, however, could well be a first magnitude error. The worst possible mistake is to underestimate the enemy. They
  may know a great deal more, or at least be fronting for those who know a great deal more about this than the public
  ever suspects. How much do the people at the top who can subtly direct the flow of public information really know
  about the cattle mutilators? That's a very interesting question that will have to be fully explored come judgment
  day.</p>
