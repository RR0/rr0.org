<p class="exergue">...the cattle mutilators have managed to stir up and make enemies of EVERYBODY, almost. Witches and
  devil worshipers hate them as much as anybody and claim to be even more actively working to bring them to justice and
  destroy them. In fact, "there is a war going on in Colorado Springs. The weapons are not M-16 rifles or tanks, but
  tarot cards and magic circles. The battle is taking place between a group of magicians, a witch and their enemies -
  the cattle mutilators <span class="source">- The Gazette Telegraph, Colorado Springs, Colorado, October 8, 1975</span>
</p>
<h2>Satanic cults?</h2>
<p>There is a wide variety of theories on who the mutilators are and why they are doing it. And there is a bounty on
  devil worshipers. "I don't know what happens to cattle in Kansas and Nebraska, but ours in Colorado did not die of
  natural causes," said Glenwood District Attorney Tucker. "I say it could be a religious cult since there were so many
  similarities in the slayings. I'm told that some of the people who use them (organs and skins of animals) march to a
  different religious drum. I've been in the cattle business for a long time. this isn't the common variety of cattle
  rustler. It's of people, I'm sure, who believe they can cast spells on other people. They're your uncommon variety of
  crazy. It's a weirdo deal."</p>
<p>The Record Stockman reported, "An Episcopal priest doubts the surgical executions are being done by Satan worshipers.
  The cult has to be of a new origin, and operate under a new set of ritual values."</p>
<h2>Predators?</h2>
<p>But the predator theory is by far the more convenient explanation. That says no crime has been committed. The
  varmints, except for eagles, have no legal protection. The rancher can be allowed to take care of the problem and the
  public can be allowed to forget it. "A lot of people don't want to think that something like this is going on.
  Consequently, they want to blame animals," said Yellowstone County, Wyoming Deputy Sheriff William Caton. (The
  Billings Gazette, Billings, Montana, September 14, 1975.)</p>
<p>Lightning?</p>
<p>Another theory is that the animals have been struck by lightning. "Recently, one sheriff reported a bull had been hit
  by lightning. Lightning, mind you! And its left eye, left ear and sex organs were cut off!" (Los Angeles Times,
  September 11, 1975.) Or maybe these things have been done by "strong-stomached pranksters" who come upon a dead animal
  at night and cut parts off to keep publicity going. (The Denver Post, September 21, 1975.)</p>
<p>Secret military operations? CIA?</p>
<p>One fairly widespread idea is that it's being done secretly from Ft. Carson. A respondent to a Pueblo street poll on
  the subject said, "I don't know. I've heard that some people think Ft. Carson has a lot to do with it since they want
  some of the land for their projects." (The Star-Journal, Pueblo, Colorado, October 5, 1975.)</p>
<h2>Extraterrestrial Life Forms and Advanced Technologies?</h2>
<p>Another theory, perhaps the leading one among the people closest to where it's actually happening, is that UFOs are
  responsible. "It's being done by someone from outer space," was one sidewalk respondent's answer.</p>
<p>Actually, a lot more people probably accept the UFO theory than any of the others that have been put forward. "At
  least the UFO theory attempts to answer nearly every question that has arisen, while other theories - including that
  of a Satanic cult using helicopters - do not." (The Gazette Telegraph, Colorado Springs, Colorado, August 3, 1975.)
  But the UFO theory has lots of problems, too. The major one is that for a number of interesting reasons, the
  influential opinion makers who create the climate of acceptable ideas in the world today hate UFOs.</p>
<p>Terrance Mitchell, a former Minneapolis TV reporter who claims to have collected material on approximately 3000
  cattle mutilations in the U. S. since 1969, believes there are a number of odd links to UFO sightings. For one thing,
  he claims to have taken aerial pictures of circles melted in the snow around mutilated animals. "Somebody is doing
  these things, and doing them for a reason," Mitchell said. "I don't know who is doing it, but I get the feeling they
  are doing it to scare people. They're doing a good job, too. I just wish I knew why." (The Billings Gazette, Billings,
  Montana, October 1975.)</p>
<p>A Colorado Springs based group, the Esthetic Sciences Organization, that studies UFO phenomena with specially
  designed mobile electronic surveillance equipment, believes it knows why. "What we are experiencing in the current
  flap of animal mutilations is continued extraterrestrial investigation of this form of life," a spokesman recently
  told The Gazette Telegraph. "They are taking organs that have to do with sustenance and reproduction of animal life on
  earth as well as communication, and leaving what they don't need or desire. UFO research has shown that in many cases,
  a body - human or animal - has literally been raised into the UFO." (The Gazette Telegraph, Colorado Springs,
  Colorado, August 17, 1975.)</p>
<p>Law Enforcement Has No Answers</p>
<p>"An overflow crowd of people gathered at Kiowa, sparked by an earlier meeting held in a different location in which
  some ranchers demanded that rewards be posted on a dead or alive basis. The emotional strain on the residents was
  evident throughout the meeting. Many of them were bleary-eyed. Carl Whiteside, Director of the Colorado Bureau of
  Investigation and heading the animal mutilation investigation, told the crowd which overflowed the courtroom out into
  the hall and foyer and down a flight of stairs that the only thing positive in the investigation so far is that 'we
  have a large number of dead and mutilated cattle. This is a senseless crime. ...But we will find a solution. We will
  resolve this thing in the end.'"</p>
<p>Cattle mutilation is such an abrasive issue that anyone can come out and have his ax ground on it. From New York, we
  are told that all this is only preliminary leading up to a Satanic cult's real goal: the mutilation murders of human
  beings. (Saga Magazine, November 1975.) The leader of this cult, according to Saga magazine, is a confirmed racist
  convinced that the white plans are to liquidate "inferior" peoples. They especially hate liberals. So, their death
  wish list includes Hubert Humphry, Edward Kennedy, Edward Brooke, William Proxmire, Bella Abzug, Barbara Jordan and
  Ralph Abernathy. As an afterthought, George Wallace got thrown into the same death list.</p>
<h2>Puerto Rico Cattle Mutilations</h2>
<p>From Puerto Rico comes an opposite story in a letter to the American Humane Society in Denver, Colorado, from Mrs.
  Dolores J. Tudder, Amigos De Animals, Inc., De Fajardo, Puerto Rico:</p>
<p>"Although our cattle mutilations have diminished here in Puerto Rico..." There, too! But without doubt, the
  mutilations have been worldwide. "I would advise strong concentration on the investigation of ANY African influenced
  West Indian cultures, especially Trinidadian and Haitian aliens. and black supremacy groups and also East Indian
  groups practicing reincarnation ceremonies. Mohomet followers and Theosophists should also be investigated, as well as
  people of Cuban descent. Any of these, as well as young political groups, could well be resorting to the mutilation of
  animals to impress others of the power of their black magic spells."</p>
<p>The average American does not go much for those who worship the devil and practice witchcraft, which in a measure
  explains the blame currently placed on witch cults and devil worshipers. But the cattle mutilators have managed to
  stir up and make enemies of EVERYBODY, almost. Witches and devil worshipers hate them as much as anybody and claim to
  be even more actively working to bring them to justice and destroy them. In fact, "there is a war going on in Colorado
  Springs. The weapons are not M-16 rifles or tanks, but tarot cards and magic circles. The battle is taking place
  between a group of magicians, a witch and their enemies - the cattle mutilators."</p>
<p>Pendragon, a magician, claims his group has been working on that since August 1975 because the mutilators are giving
  cultists a bad name. "They are making it impossible for us to practice magic outwardly. We are using both material and
  occult methods to get any tangible lead to a breakthrough. We feel we are getting close." (The Gazette Telegraph,
  Colorado Springs, Colorado, October 8, 1975.)</p>
<h2>Satanic Cult Theory Really Government Misinformation Diversion from Real Truth?</h2>
<p>The prime source of the devil cult idea has all the earmarks of a very high level government propaganda plant. The
  pseudo official story has surfaced all year long from a number of diverse sources. APRO's expert investigators
  swallowed it. Saga magazine featured it. Various other news outlets have "stumbled" onto the story. All are
  essentially the same and go like this: "An intensive report completed by an agent with the Department of Treasury
  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for the U. S. Attorney at Minneapolis, has connected this year's rash of
  cattle mutilations with a nation-wide 'religious cult.'" A copy of that report has been obtained by the Journal
  Advocate in Sterling, Colorado. (Ranchland Farm News, Simla, Colorado, January 15, 1976, taken from an article by Bill
  Jackson of the Journal Advocate, Sterling, Colorado.)</p>
