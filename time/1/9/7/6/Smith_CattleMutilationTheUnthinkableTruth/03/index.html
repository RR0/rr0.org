<p class="exergue">A Benson, Minnesota farmer fed his cow and later returned to his barn to turn out the lights. He
  discovered the cow mutilated "inside the barn". A mutilation in South Dakota left a steer with the lower jaw removed
  and some tissue cuttings so delicate that veterinarians maintained it would have taken them two weeks to perform the
  same type of surgery. The animal was found 200 feet behind the owner's barn.<br> <span class="source">- Brush Banner, Brush, Colorado, September 10, 1975.</span>
