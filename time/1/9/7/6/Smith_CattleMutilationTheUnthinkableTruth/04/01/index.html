<p>On June 24, 1947, Kenneth Arnold, an experienced mountain pilot, left Chehalis, Washington for Yakima. The flight
  took him over a part of the Cascades he was as familiar with as his own living room. As he approached Mt. Ranier, he
  noticed a series of bright flashes off to one side and slightly below him. On closer inspection, they appeared to be
  nine very bright disc-shaped objects. The objects, whatever they were, moved rapidly from north to south in a reverse
  echelon formation, weaving in and out among the mountains with a strange oscillating and skipping type of flight.
  Since at one point, they passed behind a peak, Arnold was able to estimate their size and speed. They had to have been
  some twenty miles away, perhaps fifty feet in diameter, and moving at about 1700 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Since it is not unusual for people to see strange things in the sky, local newsmen saw this at first as just another
  interesting hoax. But the more they examined the story, the more convinced they became that Arnold had really seen
  what he had described to them. In any case, it struck the public fancy and was soon receiving national and
  international publicity. A number of similar UFO reports began flooding in from all over the United States and the
  "flying saucer" era was born.</p>
<p>The U. S. Air Force was quite aware of these reports, many of them coming from their own men. Within a month, the
  subject was under the very tightest security wraps. Air Force intelligence had to know what was happening in American
  air space. According to Edward J. Ruppelt, who was later put in charge of the Air Force investigation of UFOs,
  confusion surrounded the investigation; confusion almost to the point of panic. The brass wanted to know the answer
  quickly, and people were taking off in all directions. (Report On UFOs © 1956 by Edward J. Ruppelt.)</p>
<p>The Air Force, according to Ruppelt, had essentially two theories. The phenomena were either earthly or unearthly.
  They could be Russian, or German, or from some other nation. They could even be a super secret U. S. project. Or they
  could be interplanetary vehicles. Or even space animals of some kind. The miracle of the atomic bomb was still fresh
  enough in everyone's mind to make anything seem possible.</p>
<p>At first, there was no doubt in the military mind that an all out investigation would quickly get to the bottom of
  the mystery. Events have proved that not to be true. Twenty-nine years and untold thousands of sightings later, the
  subject is even more baffling than when it began, as far as the public is concerned. Still, decades of public
  experience with Air Force investigations, general stonewalling, media apathy, official secrecy, cover-up, ignorance
  and applied confusion couldn't help but generate a few sparks of enlightenment.</p>
<p>One of the most intriguing things about UFOs has been what seems an irrational compulsion to make them disappear. The
  official denials are far more interesting than convincing. Why go to such ridiculous lengths to cover-up what is
  already non-existent? Long before the author had any real idea what UFOs were or how they were propelled, he was
  completely fascinated by the cover-up. When there is such an elaborate smokescreen, there has to be a little fire
  somewhere. What is it about them that keeps making the authorities so nervous?</p>
<p>In spite of the intense ridicule, misrepresentation and official pooh-poohing of the phenomenon, people are far from
  being convinced. It has been estimated that at least fifteen million Americans have seen UFOs and an overwhelming
  majority believe they exist. (Aliens In Our Skies © 1969 by John A. Fuller) One common error is to imagine most
  reports come from UFO buffs. The fact is that most reports come from astonished skeptics - who become former skeptics.
  They represent every strata of society, especially upper, perhaps since those people tend to take government
  protection for granted. Another error is to suppose that only Americans see them. Actually, the U. S. produces no
  more, and maybe less, reports per capita than other areas such as South America, Europe and Australia, around the
  world.</p>
<p>Nor are UFOs really new. During World War II, it was not uncommon for Allied and Axis planes to be accompanied by
  unknowns that Americans dubbed "foo fighters." These were a small fireball type of apparition that flew in formation
  just beyond the planes' wingtips, apparently to observe and obviously under intelligent control. Unidentifiable flying
  objects have been seen throughout history. Charles Fort (1874-1932), a tireless American chronicler of unexplained
  events, had a special category for the strange airships seen by farmers, milkmaids, above county fairs, cities and
  villages, by soldiers, sailors, astronomers and judges. In fact, all kinds of people in the most diverse situations
  saw the airships. Many ancient and venerable documents and scriptures record similar aerial phenomena. (The Works of
  Charles Fort © 1941, The Fortean Society.)</p>
<p>This is not the place to list sightings since a number of books and magazines are available that devote themselves
  almost exclusively to that. Objects of various shapes, sizes and colors, alone and in formation, have been seen all
  over the globe. They've been seen by military and commercial pilots and by astronauts. In fact, pilots who have logged
  lots of hours are almost sure to have seen strange flying objects they could not identify. Military sightings are kept
  secret by a special regulation, while commercial pilots usually try to avoid the publicity and ridicule unless the
  sighting has been especially spectacular or hair raising, or passengers have been injured during violent evasive
  actions.</p>
<p>A few sightings are especially memorable. For example, during an air show at Longview, Washington on July 3, 1949, a
  UFO was observed near a plane that was skywriting overhead. The crowd's attention was drawn to it through the public
  address system. During a period of twenty minutes, three successive objects fluttered over from different directions
  and were seen by the crowd, many using binoculars. (The Congressional Record, July 29, 1968, reported by Dr. James A.
  Harder.)</p>
<p>An interesting sighting was reported by a chemist near Yuma, Arizona. While watching some aircraft in the sky, he
  also noticed a small moving cloud-like object. Through the polarized glasses he was wearing, he could see a series of
  dark rings surrounding it. The outermost ring was about six times the diameter of the silvery UFO, or about the
  diameter of the full moon. He could see through his glasses, but not without them. Dr. James Harder, testifying before
  a congressional committee looking into UFOs, calculated from the Faraday effect that in order to rotate the plane of
  polarization like that an electromagnetic field of at least a million gauss over a distance of 40 meters would be
  required. A field of that size and intensity is hard to even imagine. (The Congressional Record, July 29, 1968, Dr.
  James A. Harder.)</p>
<p>Another remarkable sighting comes from Russia. A joint civilian-military team headed by Major Anton Kopeikin and
  environmental scientist Fydor Denidov reported to their government that 25 witnesses had seen a bluish green,
  oval-shaped object the size of a jetliner head east at tremendous speed, and silently. Flying very low, the object
  struck a ridge, but continued on course without slackening its speed, leaving a trench ten feet deep and fifty feet
  long in the frozen ground, along with two smaller trenches. UFOs have also been seen plunging into the ocean at a
  terrific speed, only to re-emerge at the same speed.</p>
<p>Let me present a recent sighting not because it is unusual, but because it is so typical of thousands and perhaps
  hundreds of thousands of sightings the world over. Also, it is firsthand, happening in late December of 1975 while
  this book was being written. Three of our youngest children and I had gone skating on a nearby reservoir. The sky was
  perfectly clear and cloudless, the temperature about 20 degrees, the moon several days past full. About 11 p.m., we
  were getting ready to leave. I was already at the car, walking back and forth on the highway, skywatching and
  occasionally looking through binoculars.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I noticed a strange light in the east, slightly north of the ecliptic and three or four degrees above the
  horizon. What star could be there? I glanced up at Capella, which was still in its proper place. But this new object
  was nothing like Capella. It was ruddy red like Mars, but far brighter. I called the others' attention to it. My older
  boy, a college physics major and properly skeptical, thought it might be Mars. But Mars was still in its right place,
  too, almost directly overhead not far from the moon.</p>
<p>Then the red object began moving toward the northwest. We got in the car and drove up a nearby hill to watch. it kept
  accelerating, getting higher, dimmer and probably father away as we watched. All of us looked at it through our
  excellent 7 x 50 binoculars, but that did not make it any less hazy. I signaled with a flashlight, but it might have
  been twenty miles away and there was no response. It seemed to be traveling in a perfectly straight line, passing
  seven or eight degrees below Polaris, and then we finally lost sight of it somewhere along the curving back to the
  constellation Draco.</p>
<p>What was it? We did not know, although we watched it for maybe ten minutes. It appeared suddenly in the east and
  disappeared in the northwest, perfectly silent, climbing and becoming dimmer as it went. It might never have been
  closer than five or ten miles, but there was no way to accurately judge its distance. We all agreed it could not have
  been a meteor, satellite or plane.</p>
<p>Our youngest boy, 13, was enthusiastic about it being a UFO. What else could it have been? As for myself, I'm
  interested as an amateur astronomer and am fairly familiar with the sky, having observed it intently for years over
  hours at a time at night. So I know there are strange and interesting things overhead and what we saw was not easily
  identifiable as a natural phenomenon. It was not a secret with us, but like millions of people the world over, we knew
  reporting such a common experience would have been ridiculous.</p>
<p>It is sometimes thought that UFOs cannot be picked up on radar. Nothing could be farther from the truth. "Angels" and
  "bogies" are a constant problem to radar operators. If the "angel" does not fit into the pre-programmed patterns of
  aircraft, missile or satellite flight or trajectory calculations, it is automatically rejected and ignored. (The
  Congressional Record, July 29, 1968 by Dr. Robert L. Hall.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the best known combined radar and visual sighting happened during two long July 1952 nights over Washington,
  D. c. A number of fighter planes were scrambled and several hundred interceptor chases were admitted to by the
  Director of Air Force Intelligence, Major General John M. Sanford. It also became apparent at that time that UFOs were
  monitoring military communications. (Aliens from Space © 1973 by Major Donald E. Keyhoe.)</p>
<p>In 1953, the Air Force began experimenting with a new type of long range radar equipment that immediately picked up a
  gigantic object orbiting the equator about 600 miles out. Shortly thereafter, it moved in to 400 miles. (Aliens from
  Space © 1973 by Major Donald E. Keyhoe.) Even at that time, the Argentine Navy and the U. S. Air Force are alleged to
  have had motion pictures of giant space ships operating near the earth. The public has seen a number of UFO pictures.
  Some are fakes and most of them are indistinct. Many private investigators believe "the Air Force itself has thousands
  of photos of UFOs, but can't release them because of government restrictions." (St. Paul Pioneer Press, St. Paul,
  Minn., April 21, 1975)</p>
<p>Another common phenomenon that has been reported worldwide is a complete failure of automotive electrical systems in
  the presence of UFOs. Cars stall and their lights go out. Then everything returns to normal when the UFO leaves.
  Utility failures in private homes and in entire communities have also occurred while UFOs were in the neighborhood.
  Many believe the famous Northeast blackout of <time>1965</time> was UFO-caused, since UFOs and also strange
  "fireballs" were seen at the time near Syracuse, New York where the trouble seems to have originally developed.</p>
