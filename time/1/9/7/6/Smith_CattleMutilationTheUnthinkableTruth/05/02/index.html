<p>T he extraterrestrials commanding UFOs are technically superior to earthlings. They are also our superiors in many
  other ways. Yet claw-handed dwarfs, mothmen, and other horrible and monstrous apparitions have been encountered near
  or associated with UFOs. How can they be accounted for? They are what earthlings call tulpas. If we were spiritually
  prepared, we might meet their masters, even wearing their halos and faces like lightning in whose presence trained
  soldiers swoon away like dead men. (Isaiah 13:2-6)</p>
<p>Personal contact with extraterrestrial visitors, and also strange ships in the heavens, have been reported throughout
  history. The sightings have increased tremendously in modern times, and especially since World War II. If these
  visitors are from distant solar systems, as is now evident, why this multiplication of sightings? The answer is their
  interest in our modern age of technology, roughly 300 years old now, with its subsequent population and knowledge
  explosions. From their cosmic point of view, these developments have been extremely significant. (Revelation 6:2)</p>
<p>As we saw in Chapter 3, every perversion imaginable, or unimaginable, has been attributed to cattle mutilators. Every
  motive except the real one seems to have been considered. What they're really interested in is reproduction, not of
  cattle, but of humans. They (ETs) are looking intently to see how far down the tube we are. That will tell them how
  long they might have to be here. They don't really know that, but by this broad sampling of animal tissue, they'll be
  more able to make an educated guess.</p>
<p>What are the mutilators looking for and why do they select those particular tissues for analysis? What they're
  primarily interested in are genetic anomalies that relate to human reproduction, which they know is extremely
  precarious now and can be expected to fail completely within several decades. What happens in an explosion? An
  explosion can be described as an extremely rapid release and degradation of energy. It booms then busts, which is also
  the course of the modern wealth and population explosion. Every conceivable energy and quality, both human and
  natural, has been rapidly exploited, degraded and destroyed.</p>
<p>It would be hard to imagine anyone more obtuse about the long range significance of human reproduction than the
  so-called "population experts." Yet, in a vague way, even they can see there's something profoundly threatening in
  this modern situation. More than mere egotistical comfort is involved, what's being threatened is the viability of ALL
  life here on earth. The views of extraterrestrials can only be seen as through a glass darkly. But we can judge the
  profundity of their interest from what happened at Sodom, and by what's been happening here and now in this cattle
  mutilation phenomenon.</p>
<p>The various organs and tissues that are taken for analysis blood, skin, ears, rectums, the salivary glands beneath
  the tongue, and sometimes tails, hearts and intestines, have been selected so that a variety of significant tissues
  can be compared with each other chromosomally and also formally. By comparing all these to the norm, especially when
  done by those having the original design of such things, much can be learned.</p>
<p>The outward form of the genitals and any departure from the ideal would certainly be significant to them. Even more
  significant would be the internal structures of the sex cells and the effects that contaminants, feed additives,
  inbreeding and other genetic "improvements" have had on them. It is known now, for example, that plutonium among other
  deadly mutagenic agents gradually migrates to the gonads. (Colorado Governor Richard Lamm and Congressman Tim Worth
  Report on Rocky Flats.) The overall progress of such poisons are found much more easily in the tissues of large and
  relatively long-lived animals such as cattle. We can be sure they are able to recognize mutations, weakness, sterility
  and other genetic flaws and failures without having to wait for an overt manifestation of those anomalies, as earthly
  investigators must do.</p>
<p>The various tissues they (ETs) select should be scientifically instructive to us. The digestive tract is lined with
  the fastest growing cells designed to be sloughed after a few days of super activity. These would be most accessible
  and perhaps informative at the rectum. Traces of excrement and urine would no doubt tell them many things. Eye tissues
  are especially subject to mutation and radiation damage. Ears would supply both hair and tough cartilage. Blood, skin
  and mammary glands would all have their significant stories to tell. Tails provide the most accessible bone
  samples.</p>
<p>While the tongue is just about the least preferable and last eaten part of a carcass for predators, the salivary
  glands beneath it have a well known attraction for geneticists. It was the discovery that chromosomes in the salivary
  glands of drosophila flies are about a thousand times larger than other body cells that led to the modern
  understanding of the function of genes. No earthling seems to know exactly what that remarkable gigantism means, but
  it has greatly assisted the study of chromosomes and genes.</p>
<p>After knowing who the mutilators are and why they do this, there is still the question about how they can do it
  without leaving a single track or any other traces. How can a half ton animal be killed, cut up and left in plain
  sight beside a busy highway or a house with watchdogs and never be seen? Yet something like that has happened many
  times. We must recognize that along with selecting tissues for examination, the mutilators have a secondary purpose.
  They want to make their presence known. They don't go out of their way to be seen, nor do they go out of their way to
  avoid being seen. They just go about their business here more or less oblivious to us. And they want us to know they
  are able to do that.</p>
<p>It's interesting to notice that when fresh snow falls, the mutilations usually stop. If animals were found recently
  mutilated in freshly fallen snow, it would be pretty obvious how it happened. If it had been done from the air, or by
  helicopter, or if the carcass had been transported to the site, those things would be evident. So, they don't do it
  that way. The mutilators never make the facts too obvious. They follow a simple rule: There must never be
  incontrovertible evidence. Why?</p>
<p>Because everything they do tends toward judgment. They present people with plenty of evidence, for example, all these
  mutilated carcasses. But it must always be of a kind that people can either accept or reject. They avoid compelling
  anyone to either believe or disbelieve anything. They're here to bring out what's inside us, what really makes us
  tick. That's what must ultimately go on display. Are we for heaven or against it? Do we respect it or hate everything
  about it? Do we believe our senses or accept the pronouncements of our experts even when they're obviously lying?
  These are among the issues of judgment.</p>
<p>That's why they want to make their presence known here, but only in ways that can be refuted and rejected by anyone
  who prefers it that way. So we can be sure there will NEVER be what is called solid evidence of their activities or
  even of their existence. On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence for whoever wants to accept it. As for how
  they actually do these things without leaving a single clue, that's not so hard to understand either. Not that we know
  all about their surgical techniques, any more than we can know all the details of their propulsion systems. but in a
  general way, it's possible to see how these things are done.</p>
<p>First, there's the question of how the animals are killed. Pathologists are saying officially that the deaths are
  natural. What is a "natural" death? Maybe the animals die of asphyxiation or of fright. There are many reports of
  animals being terrified by UFOs or UFO occupants. This is probably the same mechanism, but intensified, whereby
  animals fear men, the innate recognition of a superior power. (Genesis 9:2) People have also been terrified by UFOs,
  as well as by ghosts and snakes, even though such things might not be harmful, and in fact, might be beneficial. Some
  deaths from snake bite might be attributed to fear, which in itself can be deadly. Ghosts might have killed people in
  the same way. In any case, extraterrestrials are known to sometimes be extremely terrifying to men and also to
  animals. So that can't be ruled out as a cause of death in mutilated cattle. More probably they are felled with an
  electromagnetic beam.</p>
<p>As for how large animals are taken up and then replaced on the ground, we don't know all the details of that. We do
  know, however, that extraterrestrials control immense as well as intense electromagnetic force fields. Numerous
  reports tell of planes being sucked or pushed rapidly and uncontrollably upward or downward by UFOs. There have also
  been reports of cars and trucks being suspended above the highways they have been traveling along.</p>
<p>There are so many cases the world over of people and animals disappearing without a trace that this is almost
  commonplace. People have been reported disappearing from large groups, right before their neighbors' eyes, sometimes
  apparently being carried upward. Throughout history people have seen things falling from the sky small and sometimes
  regular streams of water, also ice, fish, blood, flesh, manna, oil, metals, cannon balls, nails, dirt, oyster shells,
  money. (The Works of Charles Fort, The Fortean Society, New York, 1941.) You name it and people somewhere have
  probably reported seeing it fall out of the sky.</p>
<p>In this case, it's so obvious that large animals are being picked up, killed, organs and blood removed, and then put
  down again, that helicopters seem to provide the only rational answer except that isn't very rational either! There is
  no actual evidence of helicopters ever being used for this purpose, even though some claim to have seen unidentified
  choppers, and even to have been chased by them. Even when strange helicopters have been sighted, that in itself might
  be neither more nor less significant than the man who reported that to his amazement he saw a UFO in a field as six
  shiny new green Chevrolets drove out of it and disappeared down the highway. This does not mean that extraterrestrials
  have Chevrolet or helicopter production lines. Maybe those vehicles were like the donkey in the Bible that the Lord
  has need of. (Matthew 21:2)</p>
<p>It's a mistake to think a machine would actually have to land, or grapple an object with a cable, for example, in
  order to make off with it. The facts make it appear otherwise, and also from a theoretical point of view, a narrowly
  defined force field could do the same thing. In fact, this is what the mutilators are telling people they are able to
  do. that is, make off very easily with half or three-quarter ton animals. They can also replace the carcasses gently
  on the ground after the tissues they need have been excised.</p>
<p>The fact that extraterrestrials can take things up into the sky has been well known for thousands of years. Right
  now, they are trying to refresh our collective memories about things like that. We are told, for example, that Jesus
  was "taken up," and then disappeared into a cloud. (Acts 1:9) Whether he was taken off the ground in a vehicle, or the
  vehicle was inside the cloud, the account does not say. Saint Paul wrote that at the end of this world's history,
  believers will be "caught up in the clouds ... and so shall we ever be with the Lord." (I Thessalonians 4:7) Jesus
  said that two will be working or sleeping together and one will be taken and the other left. (Matthew 24:40-41 and
  Luke 17:34) The lifting in such cases would have to be perfectly localized and selective, and the impression is given
  that it isn't necessary for the vehicle to be in the immediate area, but the "taking up" can be controlled from some
  unknown distance overhead.</p>
<p>That's what happens to animals in this testing program, and explains the complete absence of evidence at the scene.
  The animal is taken up, worked on, and then put down again in some very obvious location. The actual cuts might be
  made immediately overhead or thousands of feet in the sky. Since the propulsion systems that support and propel UFOs
  impinge very gently on an immense volume of space, they can be completely silent even at very high speeds. They can
  also become invisible. Let's think for a moment about how that is done.</p>
<p>There have been many reports of UFOs becoming invisible. While apparently still at close range, they suddenly blank
  out, disappearing from radar screens and also from sight. It's easy to see how this can happen, since UFO propulsion
  systems keep the vehicles constantly surrounded with a broad field of ionized particles. Radar operates by beaming out
  an electromagnetic signal and then picking up whatever reflection comes back from planes, missiles, rain, clouds, or
  other objects.</p>
<p>It doesn't take much electronic sophistication to tell when one's inside the beam of a radar "spotlight." Nor would
  it take much sophistication if one were inside a large precisely controlled field of ionized particles to completely
  absorb that signal so that nothing would be left of it to reflect back. There are reports of this being done, on then
  off, on then off, in regular sequence, playing with the radar operator, letting him know the UFO can either be seen or
  not seen however they choose.</p>
<p>The same thing can be done with visible light, which is also an electromagnetic radiation. It can also be absorbed so
  completely that nothing appears. Or the signal, either visually or on radar, can be strengthened so as to appear
  larger and brighter than it actually is. The plasma field surrounding them seldom allows UFOs to be seen distinctly.
  Usually the image will be hazy and indeterminate. We might be sure that whenever extraterrestrials are seen, it's
  because they choose to be seen, or else don't care whether they're seen or not. It's also possible that objects being
  picked up or let down could also be made invisible. The force fields supporting such objects could also absorb rather
  than emit electromagnetic radiation thereby making whatever's inside it invisible.</p>
<p>With these factors taken into account, it's easy to see how even very large animals can be picked up and put down
  again in plain sight on the very doorsteps of NORAD and the world's most sophisticated surveillance systems. The
  tables could be removed from the officers' mess during a banquet if that were worth doing. Maybe some things like that
  have already happened. If so, they are deep, dark classified Top Secrets.</p>
<p>Cattle mutilation, on the other hand, happens on plain ordinary farms and ranches where it's practically impossible
  to make folks understand that things of that nature must be top defense secrets. The bizarre sex angle has stirred up
  so much public curiosity that it's a real ticklish operation to shush the whole thing up and make everyone believe it
  really did not happen at all. And if it did, it's a classified secret anyway. If anything, this is harder to keep the
  lid on than Watergate. How can it be effectively suppressed without giving away the whole game? The official anti-UFO
  apologists have a real hard in fact an impossible task cut out for them. In some ways, even their enemies should feel
  sorry for them.</p>
<p>The fact is, and UFOs want everyone to know it, that they can take anything from anywhere at any time. Nothing in the
  world can stop them from doing that. If they wanted, they could take the president out of his armored limousine while
  he's surrounded by dozens of armed guards, or from the podium at the inauguration in front of that huge crowd. They
  could do that and it would be a total mystery. NO ONE could prevent it or even know what had happened to him. Or they
  could just as easily make off with his whole helicopter, or Air Force One.</p>
<p>Cattle mutilation is only a beginning. It can be predicted that more and more inexplicable things will be happening:
  automotive and power failures over large areas, objects and animals moved from place to place, intense and paralyzing
  darkness at strange times and places. (Joel 3:15, Amos 5:18, Rev. 9:2) Things like this are to be expected, and even
  stranger things far beyond our present imagination. They'll be making their presence known to whomever it may concern
  and testing their control systems to make sure everything is in first class working order when the time comes to use
  them all at once on a worldwide scale.</p>
<p>If we are really being visited by the large numbers of extraterrestrials that UFOs suggest, many people will want to
  ask the simple question that has been excellently stated by Dr. Donald H. Menzel, a Harvard astronomer and arch critic
  of UFOs. While Dr. Menzel concedes "that the concept of manned spaceships is not an absolute impossibility," he goes
  on to ask: "is it not natural that beings from outer space should exhibit an interest in us? But, when we consider
  that these beings if indeed they are beings have been bugging us for centuries, why should one not have landed and
  shown himself to the President of the United States, to a member of the National Academy of Sciences, or at least to
  some member of Congress?" (Congressional Record, July 29, 1968, Donald E. Menzel, Ph.D.)</p>
<p>Whoever has had the patience to follow our discussion this far will have seen the answer to that. Extraterrestrials
  don't negotiate with national leaders, or the U. N., or with anyone in a position of authority here for exactly the
  same reason the U. S. has refused to negotiate with Cuba, or Israel with the P.L.O., or the Arabs with Israel.
  Contacts would be a defacto recognition of the legitimacy of those being dealt with. On the other hand, UFOs have
  shown no animosity toward private individuals as such.</p>
<p>Cattle mutilation should be a shocking eye opener in at least one respect. Extraterrestrials have sometimes been
  called "angels," thoroughly neutered characters, ineffectual nobodies with wings, long flowing robes, soft effeminate
  manners and no business here. Over the years, they've been degraded to chubby infants and finally to mere infant heads
  with ear wings to decorate sentimental Christmas cards. How that ever got distilled out of scripture where angels are
  dreadful and dreadfully destructive beings, is hard to imagine. Only the arch enemies of heaven could ever have
  devised such lying caricatures. (Judges 13:6, 2 Chronicles 21:12 and Genesis 26:31-34.)</p>
<p>Now we've the chance to return to the original and correct perceptions. We'd do well to forget those "kindly space
  brothers whose sole aim is a mission of salvation." Extraterrestrials now in our skies had better be thought of as
  soldiers, excellent soldiers, superb soldiers, ENEMY soldiers. What they've come here with is POWER. And what they
  don't have any at all of is soft spineless sentimentality. They'll do what they've been sent here to do, clean or
  dirty, and without the least inhibition or squeamishness, let there be no doubt about that.</p>
<p>... Deception and secrecy mislead many gullible followers, but they always carry within themselves the seeds of their
  own destruction. In any case, real knowledge can only be based on actual facts. Lies and fantasies, since they never
  rise even to the level of illusion, can never become the basis for knowledge. So although lies and fantasies seem to
  have a quasi-existence, time soon discards them, consigning everything of that nature to the universal trash heap,
  incinerator, or hell.</p>
<p>Then even when this planet and solar system are immersed in unquenchable fire, there will be nothing to fear from
  that. There will be delightful companions of a similar nature who know all about such things. They are coming here
  from very far away and will take infinite pains to make sure no good spirit gets lost in that holocaust.</p>
<p>The End</p>
<p>* USAF Academy Photo Information:</p>
<p>The U. S. Air Force Academy, a popular tourist attraction that overlooks the cattle mutilation hot spots such as
  Elizabeth, Colorado. Elizabeth, in one of the very hardest hit areas, lies to the northeast of the USAF Academy about
  25 miles as the crow flies (or the mutilators). Lowry Air Force Bombing Range and Base are a few miles north of
  Elizabeth. The heavily guarded gate to NORAD's (North American Air Defense Command) super secret brain center inside
  Cheyenne Mountain, where one mutilation occurred, is about 16 miles due south of the Academy. Ft. Carson is
  immediately east of that. End AFB and Peterson Field, with its very heavy military air traffic, are just north of Ft.
  Carson.</p>
<p>The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, where a buffalo was mutilated, is about 2 miles north of NORAD's gate and 14 miles south
  of the Academy. The Rocky Flats A-bomb plant, where two cows were mutilated, is about 55 miles away, just north of
  Denver. The Canon City and Cripple Creek mutilation areas lie beyond Pike's Peak, about 30 miles southwest of the
  Academy. Immediately west of the Academy are extremely rugged mountains. The summit of Pike's Peak is about 13 miles
  due southwest. Since suburban sprawl, largely military oriented, extends a long distance every way from Colorado
  Springs, Security and Fountain, someone must have had a very hard time finding close in cattle to mutilate, settling
  in one case for a buffalo.</p>
