<p class="exergue">The mutilators haven't made one misstep. They leave their calling cards, but no one has ever
  surprised them at their work. They leave too much evidence for any rational person to deny they exist, but never
  enough to be identified. No one even claims to have taken a picture of them. Afterward, of course, thousands are
  taken. They're obviously playing with us like a cat plays with a mouse. And it's driving folks, including the
  authorities, right up the wall.</p>
