  <li>Il est mentionné dans le <a href="/people/b/BolenderCarrollHerdus">mémo Bollender</a> (daté de <time>1969</time>)
    comme étant l'un des "canaux" par lesquels les rapports d'observation d'ovnis concernant la sécurité nationale sont

  <li> Cette copie est datée de 1977, et présente toujours les "Objets volants non identifiés" comme l'un des éléments
    devant être rapportés en dépit des protestations de pratiquement toutes les agences interrogées qui indiquent ne
    plus être intéressées par les ovnis depuis la fermeture du projet Blue Book de l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af">USAF</a>

                          <u>SECTION  I  - GENERAL</u>

201. <u>Information to be Reported and When to Report.</u>

      a. Sightings within the scope of this chapter, as outlined in
paragraphs 102b(1), (2), (6) and (7), are to be reported as follows:

           (1)  While airborne and from land based observers.

                (a) Hostile or unidentified single aircraft or formations
of aircraft which appear to be directed against the United States or
Canada or their forces.

                (b)  Missiles.

a threat to the United States, Canada or their forces.

                (g) Any unexplained or unusual activity which may indicate
a possible attack against or through Canada or the United States, includ-
ing the presence of any unidentified or other suspicious ground parties
in the Polar Region or other remote or sparsely populated areas.

                 (c) Any airborne, seaborne, ballistic or orbiting
{|  }object which, the observer feels, may constitute a military threat
{|  }against the US or Canada, or may be of interest to military and civilian
{|  }government officials.

                             <u>SECTION II - PROCEDURES
</u>
202.  <u>General.
</u>
      a. Communications procedures to be employed will be basically
those prescribed for the communications system or service used. Con-
tinuing efforts will be made by an aircraft originating a CIRVIS report
to insure that each CIRVIS message is received by an appropriate station.

      b. Every attempt will be made to verify the authenticity of
CIRVIS reports. Where possible, authentication will be required.

{|  }      c. The US Air Force, Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR), for
{|  }such matters is the Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence (AFIN),
{|  }Washington, DC 20330.

203. <u>Precedence (priority of transmission).</u>

      a.  To avoid delays by aircraft in rendering a CIRVIS report to a
ground facility, the word "CIRVIS" spoken or transmitted three (3) times
will be employed, preceding the call, to clear the frequency(ies) over
all other communications, except DISTRESS and URGENCY, to insure its
expeditious handling.

      b.  Should instances occur, when use of the above procedure fails
to clear the frequency(ies) over all other communications in progress
except as provided for in 203a, the International Urgency Signal "XXX"
transmitted three (3) times or "PAN" spoken three (3) times will be
employed to facilitate disposition of the message to the receiving faci-
lity.

      c.  When filing or refiling CIRVIS messages with commercial communi-
cations companies, US Government activities will use commercial class of
service designator XV GOVT/EMERGENCY, Canadian Government activities will
use commercial class of service designator RUSH.

     d. The following precedence will be employed in the transmission
of all CIRVIS reports, as appropriate, commensurate with the communica-
tions facilities used:

         Circuit clearance               CIRVIS CIRVIS CIRVIS

made to the nearest Canadian or United States military or diplomatic
representative in that area. The post-landing report will refer to the
airborne report(s) and, in addition, contain a brief resume of weather
conditions at the time of sighting(s), verification of the sighting(s)
by other personnel and any other information deemed appropriate. If the
sighting was identified as friendly and a report so stating was filed
while airborne, no post-landing report is required.

          (1) If no airborne report was made as a result of inability
to reach a Canadian or United States communications station, the post
landing report will contain all the information available concerning
the sighting.

206. <u>Addressing.</u>

      a. Aircraft. - It is imperative that all CIRVIS reports reach
the appropriate military commands as quickly as possible. The reports,
therefore, shall be transmitted as soon as possible after the sighting.
Ground procedures have been established to handle CIRVIS reports by
Canadian-United States military and civil communications facilities, so
the same procedures as those now established and in use by pilots for
air traffic control shall be followed. When contact by civil or military
pilots cannot be established with any ground communications station,
maximum effort shall be made to relay the CIRVIS reports via other air
craft with which communication is possible.

whichever is the more convenient if the sighting <u>occurred within the area</u>
<u>prescribed in paragraph 206b below.</u>  Whichever of these headquarters
receives the report will immediately notify the other and also all other
addressees of the original report(s). If the sighting(s) occurred in
other areas, the post-landing report should be made to the nearest US or
Canadian military or diplomatic representative in that area who will
forward the report as prescribed in subparagraph 206b(1).

      b. Communications Station. - Communications stations (to include
any Canadian or United States civil or military facility such as control
tower, naval shore radio station, approach control, ARTC center, or any
other communications facility) receiving CIRVIS reports will immediately

{|}          (1) CINCNORAD or 22ND NRHQ NORTH BAY will review all CIRVIS
{|}reports to ascertain that they have been addressed in accordance with
paragraph 206 and forward reports to any omitted addressees in the United
States and Canada respectively. These headquarters are the normal points
of contact between the two countries and are responsible for passing
CIRVIS reports of interest, including post-landing reports, to each other.

          (2) United States or Canadian military or diplomatic authori-
ties in receipt of CIRVIS reports that have not been previously forwarded
should take the action indicated in paragraph 206 without delay by the

appropriate agencies in the Washington D.C. area.

{|}           (4) ADGHQ NORTH BAY and the Canadian Maritime Commanders will
{|}be responsible for notifying National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa
{|}concerning CIRVIS reports.

           (5) Sea Frontier Commanders will be responsible for notifying
the Chief of Naval Operations and appropriate Fleet Commanders concerning
CIRVIS reports, and for timely notification of other sea Frontier
Commanders if the location of the reported contact warrants such notifi-
cation.

      b. Fixed and mobile military communications facilities and military
personnel having occasion to handle CIRVIS reports must lend assistance
in all cases required in expediting CIRVIS reports. All civilian faci-
lities and personnel are also urged to do so. Maximum effort must be
made by all persons handling CIRVIS reports to insure positive immediate
delivery.

208. <u>Military and Civilian.</u> Transmission of CIRVIS reports are subject
to the U.S. Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the Canadian
Radio Act of 1938, as amended. Any person who violates the provisions
of these acts may be liable to prosecution thereunder. These reports
contain information affecting the national defense of the United States
and Canada. Any person who makes an unauthorized transmission or dis-
closure of such a report may be liable to prosecution under Title 18 of    {|}
the US Code 793, Chapter 37, or the Canadian Official Secrets Act of 1939, {|}
as amended. This should not be construed as requiring classification of
CIRVIS messages. The purpose is to emphasize the necessity for the
handling of such information within official channels only.

                   <u>SECTION IV - EVALUATION REPORTS</u>

209. <u>Action by Activities.</u>

      a. All investigative measures and evaluation processes instituted
by addressees, will be handled in accordance with existing procedures
and reported in accordance with these instructions, insuring that appro-
priate commands as listed in paragraph 206 are kept fully informed of
investigative results and evaluations. These evaluations shall be ex-
pressed in terms indicating the reported sighting as being Positive,
Probable, Possible, or No Threat <u>insofar as being a threat to the security
of the United States of America and Canada or their forces,</u> or an
explanation of the subject reported when known.

      b. The first two words of the text of an evaluation report shall
be "CIRVIS EVALUATION" followed by the date and time of sighting and/or
other identification of the CIRVIS report(s) being evaluated.

       a. Amplifying Reports. -

          (1) When additional information becomes available to any
       observer and is of importance, it is to be
       transmitted as a "MERINT AMPLIFY" report.

          (2) Amplifying reports are to be handled in the
      same way as the original report except that the first
      two words of the text will be "MERINT AMPLIFY" followed
      by the date and time of filing of the MERINT report
      being amplified.

          (3) Amplifying reports on aerial objects normally
      consist of additional information pertaining to the
      sighted object's size; shape; description of jet or
      rocket streams; color; sound; if multiple objects, the
      number; type; method of propulsion; number of engines;
      insignia and estimated speed.

           (4)  Amplifying reports on submarines or surface
      sightings normally consist of additional information
      on the state of sea and weather, including visibility;
      actions of object (course, speed, evasive maneuvers,
      etc.); identification marks, (flags, signals, numbers,
      exchange of communication); closest range at which
      object observed; any further remarks, (dived, surfaced,
      commenced snorkeling, stopped snorkeling, etc.)

      b. <u>Cancellation Reports.</u>-

           (1)  Cancellation reports should be made in the
      event a previously reported sighting is positively
      identified as friendly, erroneous or false.

           (2)  MERINT cancellations are to be handled in the
      same manner as the original MERINT report except that
      the first two words shall be "MERINT CANCEL" followed
      by the date and time of filing of the MERINT report
      being cancelled and, in brief, the information on
      which the cancellation is based.

       c. <u>Delayed Reports.</u>- In the event a MERINT report
cannot be made by radio, the Master is requested to report
the details of the MERINT sightings to the appropriate
Canadian or United States military authorities. If the
port of arrival is outside of Canada or USA, the report is
to be made to the nearest Canadian or US military or dip-
lomatic representative in the area. This report should
be submitted immediately upon arrival in port by any
available means and should be in the format prescribed
in paragraph 304.  If photographs were taken and have not
already been forwarded, they should be forwarded as in-
dicated in paragraph 104 as soon as possible after reaching

any commercial, government or military facility such as coastal marine
radio station, telegraph office, naval or coast guard shore radio station
or any other communications facility) receiving MERINT reports will
immediately after receipting process the report as follows:

           (1) Canadian or US commercial or government communications
stations will handle MERINT reports received from either vessels or
other communications stations by immediately forwarding them to a Canadian
or US military fixed communication facility as prescribed by agreement
with the appropriate military commander.

           (2) US military fixed communications stations receiving
MERINT reports on sightings in overseas areas will forward the report
to the following addressees:
