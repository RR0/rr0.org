  </table><p>Two UFOs which "made a noise like a whirlwind" were reported over Humberside today.</p>
  <p>Mr. Roy Thompson, of Burringham, near Scunthorpe, said he saw the "flying saucers" for a few seconds before
    dawn.</p>
  <p>He told police he was looking out of his caravan, on the banks of the River Trent, when he saw "two objects oval
    shaped, each 20 feet long and three feet high", travelling north to south.</p>
  <p>He said: "They were spinning, making a noise like a whirlwind which built up to a tremendous volume."</p>
  <p>Police said the sightings came more than seven hours after schoolboys 15 miles away at Branshome, Hull reported a
    silent silver cone-shaped object in the sky. </p>
