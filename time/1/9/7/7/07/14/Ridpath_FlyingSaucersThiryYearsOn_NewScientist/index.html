<p class="abstract">This year sees the 30th anniversary of the original "flying saucer" sighting. Where does the UFO
  field stand after a generation of research?
</p>
<p>On <time>1947-06-24</time>, <span class="people" title="Kenneth E. Arnold">Kenneth Arnold</span>, a 32-year old
  businessman piloting a private aircraft, saw what he described as a chain of nine "saucer-like" objects flying from
  north to south near <span class="place">Mt Rainier in Washington State</span>. The press eagerly coined the name
  flying saucers for these objects; although no one realised it at the time, this emotive label was to kindle a new
  mythology. Arnold's report was followed by a flood of other flying saucer sightings that continues unabated to this
  day. Do these reports, in the words of astronomer <span class="people" title="Josef Allen Hynek">J. Allen Hynek</span>,
  point to <q>an aspect or domain of the natural world not yet explored by science</q>? Or are UFOs, as in the opinion
  of the late <span class="people" title="Donald Howard Menzel">Donald Menzel</span>, <q>the greatest nonsense of the
    20th century</q>?
</p>
<p>Under pressure to explain the apparent invasion of domestic airspace, the perplexed <a href="/org/us/dod/af">US Air
  Force</a> set up a series of investigations, the first of which, known as
  <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/sign">Project Sign</a>, was initiated in <time>1948</time>.
  <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge">Project Grudge</a> followed in <time>1949</time>, and in
  <time>1952</time> began the famous <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project Blue Book</a>, which was
  closed in <time>1969</time>. The <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> also contracted the private Rand Corporation
  for an independent study of the saucer phenomenon.
</p>
<p>All these investigations reached essentially the same conclusion: that the so-called saucers presented no threat to
  national security, that the reports were most probably misinterpretations or fabrications, and that there was no
  evidence that saucers were extraterrestrial vehicles.
</p>
<p>These conclusions did not satisfy committed saucer watchers such as UFO writer
  <span class="people" title="Donald Edward Keyhoe">Donald Keyhoe</span>, who claimed in the 1950s and 1960s that the
  Air Force was not telling all it knew. But the official documents, now declassified, reveal that the
  <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> knew no more than anyone else. A declassified <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a>
  document of the same period, the <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/projet/Robertson">Robertson Panel</a> report of
  <time>1953</time>, yields no further support for the once-popular "cover-up" theory.

  </figure>
  <p>The <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> explained the <span class="people" title="Kenneth E. Arnold">Kenneth Arnold</span>
    sighting as mirages due to a temperature inversion. Arnold reported that the air at his flying height
    of <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">9500</span> <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span>
    </span> was clear and still—characteristic of such an inversion. The <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> files
    also pointed out inconsistencies in <span class="people" title="Kenneth E. Arnold">Arnold</span>'s estimates of the
    probable sizes and distances of the objects, indicating that they were probably much closer to him and slower-moving
    than he proposed.
  </p>
  <figure class="right side">
    <figcaption>The object above was photographed by a hospital inmate at Muszyna, Poland. It bears many of the
      hallmarks of the archetypal "flying saucer" photographed by Adamski in 1952, an object of suspect

  </figure>
  <p>An altogether more spectacular case the year following <span class="people" title="Kenneth E. Arnold">Arnold</span>'s
    sighting sparked off a new sensationalist line: UFOs are hostile. On <time>1948-01-07</time>,
    <a href="/org/us/dod/af">Air Force</a> captain <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Mantell">Thomas Mantell
      was killed while climbing to intercept a hight flying UFO</a> reported by ground control at <span class="place">Godman Field, Kentucky</span>.
    The position of the reported UFO fits that of the planet Venus, but a Navy Skyhook balloon released that morning was
    also in the area. These balloons fly at altitudes of <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">60000 </span> <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span>
    </span> or more, well above the operating height of Mantell's plane, which had no oxygen equipment. The Air Force
    conclusion was that Mantell had blacked out from oxygen starvation during his climb, and the uncontrolled aircraft
    had spiralled into the ground.
  </p>
  <p>This was where the <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> entered the UFO field in earnest, because it was they who were
    developing the Skyhook programme for photoreconnaissance of the Soviet Union. They were both embarrassed that their
    secret should get out, and they were also worried that some UFO cases might actually be sightings of similar Soviet
    balloons sent to spy on the United States.

  <h2>The classic cases demolished</h2>

  <p>In the 1950s the flying saucer field's own excesses brought it into ridicule, notably with the tall tales of
    so-called contactees such as fraudster <span class="people">George Adamski</span>, who claimed he had ridden in
    extraterrestrial spacecraft. Adamski and his ilk gave scientists ammunition to deride the flying saucer freaks.
  </p>
  <p>The ailing field of saucerdom received a much-needed revival with the birth of the space age: first the launch of
    Sputnik 1 in <time>1957</time>, and then Yuri Gagarin's flight in <time>1961</time>. Here was stunning support for
    the idea that other beings might be travelling the Galaxy in spaceships.
  </p>
  <p>What's more, over the past decade the idea of extraterrestrial life has become scientifically respectable (see <em>New
    Scientist</em>, vol. 74, p. 326), so that it seems to be uninitiated that the final seal of approval has now been
    set on UFOlogy by those who once derided it.
  </p>
  <p>In reality, though, the tide has begun to turn. The movement of scientists into the field of extraterrestrial life
    has led to far more rigorous examination of UFO events—with the result that many of the most cherished cases are now
    crashing to the ground. A sign of the times is that leading saucer magazines such as the outstanding American <em>Official
      UFO</em> feel compelled to run exposé articles on famous cases such as the so-called Interrupted Journey, on which
    <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Hill">Betty and Barney Hill claimed to have been abducted by aliens</a>.
    The truth of the matter, revealed by investigator <span class="people">Robert Sheaffer</span>, is that much of the
    detail of the story was imaginative gloss added after the original UFO sighting which, from Betty Hill's
    description, was nothing more than a misidentification of the planet Jupiter near the Moon.
  </p>
  <p>Most of the classic cases of <a href="/science/crypto/ufo">UFOlogy</a> have been disposed of by technical
    journalist <span class="people" title="Philip Julian Klass">Philip Klass</span> of <em>Aviation Week and Space
      Technology</em> magazine, notably in his book <em>UFOs Explained</em> (Random House 1974 and Vintage Books 1976).
    Under Klass's painstaking investigation, events such as the famous
    <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Soccorro">Socorro, New Mexico, landing</a> of <time>1964</time> wither
    to nothing more than a publicity stunt by the local mayor who, by strange chance, owns the historic piece of land on
    which the reputed UFO impressed its footpads.
  </p>
  <p>No more reliable is the case of <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Pascagoula">two shipyard workers at
    Pascagoula, Mississipi</a>, who claimed in <time>1973</time> to have been
    <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/scenario/Abduction.html">abducted</a> by UFO occupants with lobsterlike
    claws while fishing only a few hundred yards from the busy US highway 90.
    <span class="people" title="Philip Julian Klass">Klass</span> found that a
    <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/temoignage/evaluation/Polygraphe.html">lie-detector test</a>, the only
    independent support for their fantastic story, was administered by an unqualified operator under uncontrolled
    conditions.
  </p>
  <figure class="left side">
    <figcaption>The archetypal "flying saucer" photographed by Adamski in 1952, an object of suspect
      origin.</figcaption> <img src="/time/1/9/5/2/12/13/Adamski_Saucer.jpg">
  </figure>
  <p>Similar large question marks can be raised against other "classic" cases of UFOlogy. So where does this leave us?
    That UFOs exist, in the sense that people see things in the sky which they cannot explain, is incontrovertible. UFO
    researchers are agreed that at least 90 per cent of these sightings are straightforward
    <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise">misidentifications</a> of natural or man-made objects. The most
    frequent offenders are <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/aeronef">aircraft</a>,
    <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/Satellites.html">satellites</a>,
    <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/rentree/meteore">meteors</a>, and even bright stars and planets.
  </p>
  <p>UFOlogists have always argued that there remains a fractional residue of apparently baffling cases that represents
    the true signal among the noise of erroneous sightings. But from the above examples it now seems that, with the
    dedicated investigation by modern researchers, even this previously baffling residue of cases is soluble. This
    should not be surprising since the scientific assessment of extraterrestrial life implies that not one of the
    hundreds of thousands of UFO reports on file throughout the world represents an extraterrestrial visitation.

  <h2>Too many UFOs</h2>

  <p>The crucial but overlooked point is that there are simply too many UFOs being seen to support the
    <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses/intelligence/HET">extraterrestrial hypothesis</a>. Imagine, for a
    moment, that there are one million other civilizations in the Galaxy, all sending out starships. Since there must be
    something like 10 billion interesting places to visit (one tenth of all stars in the Galaxy), then each civilization
    must launch 10000 spaceships annually for only one to reach here every year. If each civilization launches the more
    reasonable number of one starship annually, then we would expect to be visited once every 10000 years.
    Alternatively, the higher number of reported UFOs might be taken as indicating that we are something special. If so,
    then life cannot be a very common phenomenon in the Galaxy—and thus there would be fewer civilizations to send out
    starships, and we would expect a smaller number of UFOs.
  </p>
  <p>An increasingly popular theory is that UFOs are not spacecraft from other worlds but visitors from another
    dimension—perhaps time travellers. But changing the theory does not change the lack of factual evidence.
  </p>
  <p>Despite 30 years of study, the field of UFOlogy has failed to produce <em>one</em> concrete example of alien
    visitation, from any dimension. Most scientists would draw their own conclusion from such an abject lack of results,
    but they do not have the indefatigable optimism of committed UFOlogists for whom the Perfect Case, like the Second
    Coming, is an article of faith. This point was emphasised at the first International UFOlogy Congress in Acapulco
    during April, where researcher Salvador Freixedo said: <q>Religion and UFO phenomena have much in common.</q> The
    basic appeal of UFOlogy for the masses is that it is a belief system, rather than a field of scientific
    investigation.
  </p>
  <p>Should that first extraterrestrial visitation arrive in the near future, the True Believer will collect on some
    large bets. Among others, a lady named Ruth Norman from <span class="place">El Cajon, California</span>, who claims
    to have been in touch with extraterrestrials, has wagered a total of several thousand pounds with Ladbroke's
    bookmakers that a landing is imminent. The <em>National Enquirer</em> newspaper has upped its reward for proof that
    UFOs come from outer space and are not natural phenomena from $100000 to 1 million $. And UFO skeptic
    <span class="people" title="Philip Julian Klass">Philip Klass</span> stands to pay out on several $10000 dollar
    bets, as well as refund the purchase price of his UFO-debunking books to disgruntled readers.
  </p>
  <p>The fact that none of these bets has been collected tells its own story. The bets plae the onus where it belongs.
    After a generation of flying saucer stories with no conclusive result, the burden of proof remains squarely on the
    UFOlogists.
