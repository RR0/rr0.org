<p>CAPE MAY (AP) - <span class="people" title="Robert Barry">Robert D. Barry</span> believes Israel has had a secret
  weapon all along. He says UFOs, some of them flown by angels, have turned the tide for the Jewish state in four wars.
</p>
<p>"I believe that godly or angelie pilots of UFOs (unidentified flying objects) could be on the side of the Israelis,"
  says <span class="people">Barry</span>, 55, a radio advertising manager from Yoe, Bro. Budirector of the 20th Century
  U.F.O. Bureau.</p>
<p>Barry's group, sponsored by fundamentalist radio preacher Dr. <span class="people">Carl McIntire</span>, is holding
  its sixth annual conference this week in McIntire's Christian Admiral Hotel here. About 185 believers of Christianity
  and UFOs are attending.</p>
<p><span class="people">Barry</span>, who is giving a five-part lecture entitled "The invicibility of Israel and UFOs,"
  said Israel's four wars have coincided with the great flying saucer "flaps," or sightings, in <time>1947
    /1948</time>, <time>1956</time>, <time>1967</time> and <time>1973</time>.</p>
<p><q>Every time there has been a war between Israel and the Arabs, the have been worldwide sightings of UFOs</q>, he
  said.</p>
<p><span class="people">Barry</span> says many biblical passages link Christianity and UFOs. For example, Luke refers to
  <q>fearful sights and great signs from heaven</q> before God returns, he said. This could mean UFOs, he said.</p>
<p><span class="people">Barry</span> says a line from Exodus shows Israel is protected by UFOs: <q>As birds fly, so will
  the lord of hosts defend Jerusalem.</q></p>
<p><span class="people">Barry</span> maintains that secret Israeli and American reports show that Israeli troopers were
  saved during the <time>1967</time> war by "miracles" when UFOs were reported over the battlefield.</p>
<p>Once, a sudden whirlwind in the <span class="place">Sinai Desert</span> exposed Egyptian land mines to the Israelis,
  he said. In another case, thousands of Egyptian soldiers surrended to 100 Israelis after the Arabs had "visions" of
  thousands of Israelis and hundreds of enemy tanks, <span class="people">Barry</span> said.</p>
<p><q>God's nation is Israel and He's going to take care of them one way or another,</q> <span
  class="people">Barry</span> said.</p>
<p><span class="people">Barry</span> believes UFOs are piloted by beings of three origins: angelic, demonic and
  extraterrestrial. He said angels fly God's craft, Satan's agents the demonic craft, and God allows extraterrestrial
  beings to pilot their own UFOs.</p>
<p><span class="people">Barry</span> predicts President <span class="people" title="Jimmy Carter">Carter</span> will
  make a "pro-UFO" announcement in December in the first step of a government attempt to educate people about UFOs.</p>
<p><q>He's going to approach it 'pro' rather than 'anti' on the way to building people up for the real story,</q> he
  said.</p>
