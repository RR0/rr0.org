<p>Cape May, N.J. (AP)-<span class="people" title="Robert Barry">Robert D. Barry</span> says he's convinced Israel has a
  secret weapon. He says <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/UFO.html">unidentified flying objects</a>, some of them flown by
  angels, have turned the tide for the jewish state in four wars.</p>
<p><q>I believe that godly or angelic pilots of UFOs could be on the side of the Israelis,</q> says <span
    class="people">Barry</span>, 55, a radio advertising manager from Yoe, Pa., and director of the <a
    href="/org/us/asso/20thCenturyUfoBureau">20th Century UFO Bureau</a>.</p>
<p><span class="people">Barry</span>'s group, sponsored by fundamentalist radio preacher Dr. <span
    class="people">Carl McIntire</span>, is holding its sixth annual conference this week in McIntire's Christian
  Admiral Hotel here. About 185 believers - in Christianity and UFOs - are attending.</p>
<p><span class="people">Barry</span>, who is giving a five-part lecture entitled "The Invicibility of Israel and UFOs,"
  said Israel's four wars have coincided with the great <a href="/time/Vagues.html">flying saucers "flaps,"</a> or
  sightings in <time>1947/1948</time>, <time>1956</time>, <time>1967</time> and <time>1973</time>.</p>
<p><q>Every time there has been a war between Israel and the Arabs, there have been worldwide sightings of UFOs,</q> he
  said.</p>
