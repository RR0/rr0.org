<p>Dear Ted,</p>
<p>Here is a case, if you're interested - complete with everything. I would put it in the contactee-type but Gail had
  hypnosis with Jim Harder last year and as a result told of being taken from bedroom on board a ufo when she was about
  12 or 13 years old. She became a contactee. The interesting thing is recently her husband joined her and he believes
  he is one also.</p>
<p>Apparently they use self-hypnosis and believe that they are receiving earth-shattering information about ufos - their
  term, complete with descriptions of aliens, messages, and he is somewhat upset for she reads his mind, and always
  knows what he is doing, although innocent.</p>
<p>They had contacts with one investigator, who, after a while was walking around with a Bible under his arm, and
  muttering about the devil. However in the past, a high rate of ufo sightings occurred behind their home - and they
  have seen numerous ones, including landed ones.</p>
<p>I have never met them personally, but have talked for fairly long periods of time via phone. They are looking for
  reassurance that they are not crazy - of course, they are not. But they have done damage to themselves - how many I
  have worked with! A person has a fairly good sighting, and somehow he gets trapped into thinking he is a contactee -
  he is connected with ufos in some way, so his friends make all kinds of suggestions - meditation, self-hypnosis - and
  the person goes on to drag out of his own mind all kinds of weird, nonsensical thinkings which he begins to believe.
  It takes two to three years of actively working with this type of person to get them back on their feet - to trace
  back every thought and how it originated. At the moment I do not have the time; also distance involved to work with
  them by phone would be too expensive. Unfortunately, thousands are brain-washing themselves thru readings contacts and
  in some areas attendance at training sessions to put themselves in this unhappy situation. While others are making
  them, I am curing them. But I can not come out and tell them what is happening to them - they must learn to realize
  this themselves, and to pinpoint some basic need which is being satisfied by this, a real human need of being special
  in some way. The same kind of situation happened with Marianne, but fortunately she is cured now, and I was able to
  protect her from investigation until we had this success. We do not have this type of situation in NH. Maybe because
  people who have close contact, get in touch with me.</p>
<p>It would be appreciated if you could contact them -- is it ok for me to give them your address?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
