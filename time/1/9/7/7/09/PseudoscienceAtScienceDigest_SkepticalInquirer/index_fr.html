<p>Une publication populaire est récemment parue dans la presse indiquant à ses lecteurs que les astronautes de <a
    href="/org/us/nasa/projet/apollo/11">Apollo 11</a> avaient été suivis sur la <a
    href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/lune">Lune</a> par <q>une masse d'énergie intelligente</q>. Dans le même
  morceau est également prétendu qu'un <q>contact télépathique avec des ovnis eut lieu au <a
      href="/org/us/dod/Pentagone.html">Pentagone</a> dès <time>1959</time></q>. Le n° suivant arborait une photographie
  retouchée de la <a href="/org/us/nasa">NASA</a>, avec une flèche pointant vers <q>un objet non-identifié</q> qui
  n'apparait pas dans les clichés originaux de la <a href="/org/us/nasa">NASA</a>.</p>
<p>Cette publication est-elle le <i lang="en">National Enquirer</i>, ou un chatoyant tabloïd sensationnaliste ? Devinez
  ! Ce n'était rien d'autre que le <i lang="en">Science Digest</i>, qui était encore il y a peu l'une des sources les
  plus fiables d'information scientifique pour l'homme de la rue. Les club ufologiques les plus fous, les auteurs
  ufologues les moins scrupuleux, et de nombreuses publications de tabloïdes se reposent depuis longtemps sur ce genre
  de mythe. But it is totally unexpected to find a respected magazine such as Science Digest exploiting such
  sensationalist material.</p>
<p>James Mullaney, author of the UFO story in the July <i lang="en">Science Digest</i>, suggests that <q>UFOs are
  teaching devices leading mankind into the future</q>. His claim that UFOs were contacted "telepathically" at the
  Pentagon has been widely reported in UFO circles, despite the fact that no one has ever produced any documentation
  whatsoever to support this claim. UFO subcommittee investigations using the Freedom of Information Act and other
  sources suggest the <q>telepathic UFO contact</q> story to be utterly without foundation. However, neither Mullaney
  nor the editors of Science Digest seem to have made any attempt whatsoever to verify this startling assertion.</p>
<p>Mullaney repeats the <i lang="en">U.S. News & World Report</i> guffaw of <time>1977-04-18</time>, which promises that
  the government—or perhaps the President himself—will release <q>unsettling disclosures</q> from the <a
      href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> files about UFOs before the year is out. This piece is generally regarded as having
  been triggered by Jody Powell's uninformed pledge to declassify all of the Air Force's files on UFOs: an action that
  had already been taken by the Ford administration. U.S. News—and now Science Digest—have blown up the incident almost
  beyond recognition.</p>
<p>James Mullaney also uses the pages of Science Digest to regurgitate the squalid results of one of the most infamous
  space hoaxes of the decade. A Japanese UFO editor named Matsumura published a series of NASA photos in his magazine in
  1974, after which Robert Barry (a far-out buff whose "Twentieth Century UFO Bureau" is intimately associated with
  fundamentalist preacher Carl Mclntyre's organization) passed the photos to an editor of the tabloid weekly Modern
  People in 1975. They created such a sensation that they were reprinted in a special magazine People UFO, edited by
  Tony Richards, which is still being sold. (NASA is "hiding" UFO photos, claims the ad.) Some of these photos even have
  graduated to the hardcover UFO market. But the former NASA photos have suffered airbrushing, cropping, and "contrast
  enhancement" whose result is to produce counterfeit UFOs out of reflections, glares, and other ordinary spaceflight
  visual effects. It is to one of these Japanese forgeries that Mullaney is alluding when he claims that the Apollo 11
  crewmen were followed by "a mass of intelligent energy." The assertion that the astronauts remarked on such an
  apparition over the radio is an out-and-out fantasy.</p>
<p>The August <i lang="en">Science Digest</i> contains a piece by longtime UFO buff <span
    class="people">Don Berliner</span>, charging the Air Force with "censorship" and "coverup" of UFO data, even though
  all of the Air Force's UFO files have been declassified and made easily available to the public at the National
  Archives in Washington. How does this constitute a "coverup"? Most of the names of the UFO witnesses have been removed
  from the records, as required by federal law in the recently-passed Privacy Act. (Prior to the passage of this act,
  Berliner and many others were granted free access to the files and the names at the Air Force Archives at Maxwell Air
  Force Base, Alabama.) Yet Berliner—and Science Digest—sneer that this is only "the official explanation," and hint at
  motivations far more sinister. The August issue also contains a story on how satellites can be used to track ships
  which might otherwise vanish in the dreaded Bermuda Triangle, and it contains a notice of the publication of a new
  science book: What Your Aura Tells Me, by alleged psychic and UFO contactee <span class="people">Ray Stanford</span>.

<p>The single photo used with the Berliner article allegedly shows an "unidentified object," which supposedly was
  photographed by the Apollo 11 astronauts. The original photo, before the artist got to it, does indeed show an
  odd-shaped object which the astronauts photographed while they were taking tourist photos of the earth, soon after
  they had separated from their S4B rocket. The obvious fragment of torn insulation is one of hundreds which can be seen
  on a typical space mission.</p>

<p>But in the photo published in Science Digest, the insulation fragment was airbrushed out. Instead, a nondescript
  white blob appears near the center of the photo, labeled as an "unidentified object." <em>This object does not appear
    on the original NASA photograph</em> (see photos on page 43). Where could it have come from?</p>
<p>Science Digest's chief editor, Daniel Button, vehemently insists that he did not add the spurious "unidentified
  object" to the photograph, although he admits retouching out the insulation fragment, so as to not distract the reader
  from the supposedly "true" unidentified. The "mystery object" was on the photograph when he obtained it from NASA
  headquarters in Washington, Button says. Then why do all other copies of the NASA print, except the one at Science
  Digest, show nothing at all where Button's UFO is supposed to be? Mr. Button has an explanation: because Science
  Digest has requested the photograph, NASA has begun to "retouch" the photo so that the object no longer appears! "My
  suspicion is right now that NASA has changed its policy and changed its story and altered its negatives and prints,"
  he stated. If Mr. Button is correct, NASA's massive retouching effort must have been phenomenally effective, affecting
  even the first transparencies made from the flight films at the photo archives of the Johnson Space Center in Houston,
  which one of us (JEO) has examined and found not to contain Button's UFO. NASA's chief photo archivist in Houston,
  Richard Underwood, has stated to us in writing that he developed the original negative himself, and that it never has
  contained any such object. Indeed, NASA's censorship must even extend backwards in time, altering prints which had
  left their office long before they were panicked by the enquiries of Science Digest.</p>
<p>While the editors of Science Digest are trying to pooh-pooh the significance of this UFO misinformation, their
  blunders have been enshrined for all time in the <i lang="en">Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature</i>, to lay in
  wait as a snare for future researchers. Perhaps the circulation crunch, which has seen four editors in the past four
  years desperately trying new promotional gimmicks to keep this Hearst Corporation magazine in the black, has dulled
  the editors' sense of journalistic responsibility.</p>
