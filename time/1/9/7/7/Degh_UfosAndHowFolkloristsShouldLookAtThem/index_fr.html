<p> Depuis des temps immemorables les gens ont fréquemment regardé le ciel <span class="source">Ley, W.: Watchers of the Skies. New York 1963</span>.
  En de nombreuses occasions il y avait quelque chose pour attirer leur vision <span class="source">An early assessment of people on the moon is offered by Harley, T.: Moon Lore.
  London 1885. Reissued by Singing Tree Press, Detroit 1969, 1-76 in particular</span>. Ils virents des messages
  d'avertissement à travers des boules de feu meandrant, des lunes sanglantes et des soleils s'éclipsant comme autant de
  signes d'un danger approchant : peste, famine, guerre et la fin du monde. Les comètes appeared to clash with the earth
  and destroy it, angels flew with their flaming swords to communicate the wrath of God. People could see a rather
  crowded sky: men in the Moon were clearly visible. King David was seen playing his fiddle, accompanied by St. Cecilia
  on the piano, and sometimes, the shepherd could be seen, absorbed by the Moon one cold winter night when he balanced
  two pails of water on a rod across his shoulders. The firmament of Heaven opened sometimes for the Lord to send his
  commands, or to show Virgin Mary, sitting smilingly on the clouds. Christmas giftgivers, Kristkindl and Santa Claus
  arrived from Heaven, to distribute their donations, and the Star guided the shepherds to the city of Bethlehem to
  worship the Divine Child. Man saw the Wild Hunt, the Headless Horseman, dragons and evil spirits flying with sparking
  lights. At the time when God did not yet separate light from darkness and the Grimm brothers did not separate tales
  from legends, magic horses and carpets were also often visible in their flight.</p>
<p> In our civilized western world people do not see these things anymore. All they can see are flying saucers <span
    class="source">Golowin, S.: Gutter der Atom-Zeit. Moderne Sagenbildung urn Raumschiffe and Sternmenschen. Bern/Munchen 1967.</span>,
  at low altitude. Sometimes they hover over places and slowly descend, stop for a while, only to take off in a speed
  the human eye can hardly follow. An auto mechanic of Crawfordsville, Indiana saw a saucer taking off and getting
  caught on the twigs of a willow tree three years ago ? he still has a piece of wire from an unknown metal that came
  off the vehicle. In 1975 on a bright summer day UFO's landed in the outskirts of several small towns in the
  West-Canadian prairieland, crushing the crops and scorching stacks of wheat straw. A farmer saw the small beings
  hastily emplaned before the craft took off.</p>
<p> The first, and, indeed, for the general public the essential question is, whether the reports on UFO sightings are
  true or false <span class="source">Catoe, L. E.: UFO's and Related Subjects: An Annotated Bibliography. Washington,
D. C. 1969.</span>. Do UFO's really exist? If the answer is "yes", what are they? National or alien military equipments,
  vehicles from other planets that fly with fantastic speed, based on physical and mechanical principles, unknown to us,
  or are they heavenly envoys? The question was in the focus of popular interest since "flying saucers" were first
  sighted and coined by a pilot, in 1947, and since the phenomenon got a tremendous boost through mass media publicity.
  As investigations by government agencies deepened, the number of sightings also increased, and involved masses of
  people <span class="source">A fairly complete overview of the development of UFO belief and a bibliography
  is Keel, J. A.: The Flying Saucer Subculture. In: Journal of Popular Culture 8/4
  (1975) 871-896.</span>. A new cult began to formulate around UFO's within and outside of existing religious and
  pseudo-scientifical associations that continued the search for origins and meanings <span class="source">Buckner, H. T.: The Flying Saucerians: An Open Door Cult. In: Sociology and
  Every Life, ed. by Marcello Truzzi. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey 1968,
  223-230, discusses the relationships of Flying Saucer enthusiast groups to other
  associations concerned with the supernatural; on the other hand, Ellwood, R. S.,
  Jr.: Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America. Englewood Cliffs, New
  Jersey 1976, 131-156, connects the UFO cult to the different sects of spiritualism.</span>. The reported testimonies
  usually oscillate around some solid cores and reinforce a relatively small but extremely active and virulent body of
  personal narratives.</p>
<p> One of the several scientific debates over the existence of extraterrestrial messengers was published in 1972 by the
  Cornell University Press <span
      class="source">Sagan, C./Page, T. (edd.): UFO's ? A Scientific Debate. New York 1974.</span>. The participants
  were not UFO cultists but leading astronomers and physicists involved in space research. They conducted absorbing
  field and laboratory explorations concerning the UFO phenomenon, examined the reports of thousands of people over the
  world in more than twenty years. The scientists were joined by psychiatrists, psychologists and sociologists, familiar
  with the normal and abnormal functions of the human mind and the behavioral patterns of people in society. They
  examined a mass of eyewitness reports of different sorts, in order to determine, if sightings can be explained and
  identified as material, immaterial or astronomical objects, physiological afterimages, products of malfunctioning
  instruments, hallucinations or hoaxes, or, whether there still remain entities that do not fall into categories
  explainable by contemporary science, and therefore, can expect identification only through the study of
  extraterrestrial agents.</p>
<p> There was no folklorist among the scholars, and this we can only regret. The presence of a folklorist could have had
  a both sobering and stimulating effect on the rather frustrating debate. The folklorist could have pointed out that
  the UFO cases presented by the discussants fall into well known traditional folklore categories, based on systems of
  folk religion, and that the"eyewitnesses" were nothing but folklore informants whose testimonies can be classified
  according to standard folklore genres. The debate itself, resembled the dialectic controversy typical in my opinion of
  legend communications <span class="source">Degh, L./Vizsonyi, A.: The Dialectics of the Legend (Folklore Preprint Series 1,
num. 6). Bloomington, Indiana 1973.</span>.</p>
<p> In other words, the participants expressed their interpretations of eyewitness stories in terms of varying degrees
  of belief and disbelief, according to their personal systems of cognition, whereby, this group of scientists acted
  like any other folk group, engaged in the legend debate. The range of opinions was wide. If James McDonald, leading
  astrophysicist, on one end, could state, that "it is difficult for me to see any reasonable alternative to the
  hypothesis that something in the nature of extraterrestrial devices engaged in something in the nature of surveillance
  lie at the heart of the UFO problem" <span class="source">Sagan/Page (above, not. 7) XVII; it should be noted here that several scientists as
  well as John McDonald had been criticized as "believers" without one bit of
  physical evidence: Fair, C.: The New Nonsense. The End of the Rational Concensus.
  New York 1974, 46-49.</span>, Donald Menzel, on the other end, claimed that "the available evidences seem to establish
  that UFO phenomena are more closely related to seventeenth century witchcraft than to the modern world" <span
      class="source">Sagan/Page (above, not. 7) 126.</span>.</p>
<p> The folklorist, however, modestly staying within the limits of his trade, does not look searchingly at the skies. He
  is not eager to find out what kind of mechanical constructs operate UFO's, and does not even try to determine, whether
  they belong to the natural or the supernatural world. The question, whether UFO's ever penetrated the airspace of the
  earth leaves him absolutely cool. If it would not, and if he would spy the skies in his capacity of the folklorist, he
  would commit the fallacy of those who include the question of "objective truth" <span class="source"> Degh/Vizsonyi (above, not. 8) 16-20.</span>
  in their study of folklore, and who would try to determine genres according to the truth or untruth of their subject.
  The question of veracity, the facts behind the folkloric interpretation of UFO visions can certainly interest the
  meteorologist, the astronomer, the aviation specialist, the military, the social psychologist, the opthalmologist, the
  radarand computer-technician as well as any person, driven by curiosity, nevertheless, the only one whom it cannot
  interest is the folklorist, exercising his profession. His concern is not more than the fact, that in our days a
  specific kind of legend formation about UFO's is in progress <span
      class="source">Golowin (above, not. 3) 116-124.</span>. The task of the folklorist is to study the movement and
  behavior of this legend in society. This limitation has some advantages: he does not need to watch the skies and
  strain his neck, he can stay among fellow earthlings for scientific explorations.</p>
<p> In most cases, the essential UFO legend is fragmentary. In fact, it is mainly a more or less elaborate report about
  a spaceship that was sighted at a certain location. If we accept the assumption, that memorates are not necessarily
  told in first person singular, we might consider most versions of the UFO legend as memorates <span class="source">Degh, L./Vazsonyi, A.: The Memorate and the Proto Memorate. In: Journal of American Folklore 87 (1974) 225-239.</span>.
  The factual statement of the vision might then be expanded, but not very far. Stereotypical accounts speak about the
  landing of the saucer, others tell of little people, sitting around their craft, observing life on earth. Among
  stories about individuals, talking to the diminutive humanoids, one claims, they spoke low German. As accounts became
  increasingly personal, more and more tellers recounted their experience with spacemen with whom they talked, who
  touched them and even who kidnapped them <span class="source"> Among the many books "The Interrupted Journey" by James Fuller (1966) about
  a couple captured and subjected to medical tests by space manikins, and "Flying
Saucer Occupants" by Coral and Jim Lorenzen (1967) are good examples.</span>. There is also a disaster legend that
  relates the crash of a spaceship, the burning and the burial of the pilot and the harmful after-effects of the debris.
  This story, launched in California in 1897 reappeared in 1947 and developed new localized versions as it disseminated
  on the wings of mass media <span class="source"> Several newspaper accounts signaled the reactivation of this legend under the
  influence of scientific interest in the assumed burial site of the "space creature" and ongoing tradition in Aurora, Texas, a small rural community. Degh/Vazsonyi
(above, not. 8) 35.</span>.</p>
<p> Le theme ovni est si sketchy et schématique that it can be filled in with both traditional and topical legend
  motifs. Traditional belief concepts often serve as explanation for unexplainable mystic horrors publicized through the
  daily news. Earlier connections between the UFO and monsters were already made <span class="source"> <a
      href="/people/w/WestrumRonaldM/index.html">Westrum, R.</a>: "A Note on Monsters" In: <em>Journal of Popular Culture</em> 8/4 (1975) 263.</span>;
  now, two recent stories demonstrate other relationships quite dramatically.</p>
<p> In one, reports about the mysterious death of cattle, sheep, goats and other livestock, as well as man's best
  friend, the dog, in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Indiana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wyoming began to
  spread about two years ago <span class="source">In its purest and most obviously cultic form, ritual animal killing (reminding
  medieval sacrifices and black magic), was performed in the small Indiana town
  Corydon in August, 1975. The female goat's heart and sexual organs were removed
  and its blood was drained according to the report of "The Harrison County
  Press" and "The Corydon Democrat". "Evidence of devil worship was found
locally", commented the reporter, but he did not refer to any outer space interference.</span>. As early as February
  1975, UPI dispatched the explanation of a "UFO buff" who lectured at the University of Minnesota. Terry Mitchel "has
  advanced the theory that extraterrestrial beings are doing post mortems on the animals". The rancher, who saw the
  "silver colored craft" in the vicinity of San Antonio, Texas, did not disagree with this possibility. However, the
  UFO-explanation strengthened only after the broadcast by CBS evening news on October 3, referring to interviews with
  farmers who blamed their loss of 160 cows on devil cultists, military equipments or UFO's. This announcement gave a
  spectacular boost to the nationwide spread of the account.</p>
<p> A few days later, on October 7, a second seemingly unrelated incident hit the news media: Another CBS report cited
  UFO involvement in a mystery learned from local newspapers. Twenty people disappeared from their Oregon homes because
  of joining a cult that promised a spaceship ride to paradise through "extraterrestrial evangelists". "There are now
  people all over the United States preparing to leave on a UFO and physically rise to a higher level", wrote a follower
  to The San Jose Mercury News. These reach out far beyond the regular UFO stories that had been characterized first by
  C. G. Jung <span class="source">Jung, C. G.: Flying Saucers. A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies. Translated
  from the German by R. F. C. Hull. New York 1969, 27.</span>, later by others, as projections of our desire that
  inhabitants of other planets should want to fly to us when we attempt to invade the moon and other planets.</p>
<p> The legend of superior beings who watch over us and of whom redemption can eventually be expected, follows the
  archetypal Messiah-pattern and appears in this UFO related account in a revised form, fitting the frames of reference
  of modern man <span class="source">About "extraterrestrial surveillance", Fair (above, not. 9) 148, 157.</span>. The
  Oregon story as it swells through new disclosures by the local press, comes closer to the Saviour legend. By the time
  the account reached nationwide distribution, direct parallel is drawn between the ordeal of a new prophet and Christ.
  Time (Oct. 20) writes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>"The Two" (a male and a female evangelist, resembling dual deities), claim to have come from the same "kingdom"
    as <span class="people">Jesus</span> Christ. <span class="people">Jesus</span> [...] left earth "in a cloud of light
    (what humans refer to as UFO's) and moves and returns
    in the same manner [...]. There are two individuals here now who have also come from the next kingdom, incarnate as
    humans [...] and will soon demonstrate that same proof of overcoming death". The Two expect to be assassinated
    sometime soon, rise from the dead in 3 1/2 days and then leave for home on a UFO. The faithful can come along,
    provided they have completed an "overcoming process! ? a stripping away of all earthly possessions and desires".</q>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> One is tempted to remember Andre Jolles' definition of the Einfache Form `Heiligenlegende' <span class="source"> Jolles, A.: Einfache Formen. Tubingen 1965, 23-47.</span>
  as imitation of the Divine. "The Two", "Bo and Peep", "Pied Pipers of Space", "Winnie and Pooh", "Chip and Dale", "He
  and She", "Guinea and Pig", "B. P. Morgenstern and B. P. Shepard" are parallelling the journey of the Prophets, the
  Biblical leaders of Israel and Christ in the Middle East and this is not an accident. Bo, says one former disciple,
  thinks he is Elijah, Moses, Enoch, <span class="people">Jesus</span> and Abraham (Los Angeles Times, December 22,
  1975). However, during the
  voyage of the cultists to the place where the UFO trip to "the next Kingdom" was to take off, not only the leaders but
  the recruits changed their names continually and so did their doctrine change. By the end of 1975 the UFO-orientation
  was dropped entirely. Like in other instances, quoted by Buckner, the Flying Saucer proved to be only a temporary
  focus also in the religious cult of "The Two".</p>
<p> As I stated, considering the legend as a genre, it does not make any difference if UFO's visited the earth or not.
  But considering legend-tradition it might make some. It is certain that the second and all subsequent transmitters of
  a UFO vision receive an identical (memorate' from their predecessors, irrespectively whether the first teller really
  saw it, imagined it or lied about it <span class="source"> Degh/V62.sonyi (above, not. 13) 230.</span>, to mention
  just a few of many eventualities. It is also true, that the second transmitter will have some difficulty to find the
  true source of his information. Thus his acceptance and decision, to pass it on, will often depend, among others, on
  his gullibility, impressibility, or congeniality. From the standpoint of the psychology of the first teller, it is a
  crucial question, whether the UFO really existed. From the standpoint of folkloristics, and legend theory, however,
  this would be of importance only if the actual observers could have conceived of the phenomenon better than the one
  who hallucinated or who constructed an account of a vision from traditional elements, aided by his own fantasy. But
  this is not at all sure. It might happen that hallucination or fantasy creates a sharper image of a nonexisting thing
  than the vision of a real object behind the clouds through non-fitting glasses, or hastily adjusted binoculars. A
  moderate Baron Miinchhausen might be more convincing than a honest but shy and confused eyewitness.</p>
<p> Regarding the destination of the legend, it might not be too advantageous if the witness, the author of the
  memorate, would not be in fact an eyewitness. I said "might not", because for the time being, I am not so certain: the
  question deserves further exploration. Among the members of the legend-transmitting chain, described elsewhere <span
      class="source">Degh L./Vazsonyi, A.: Legend and Belief. In: Folklore Genres, ed. D. Ben Amos. Austin, Texas 1976, 117-118.</span>,
  there are also skeptics as well as deniers. Nevertheless, the sequence does not break up. The story is passed
  unwaveringly from believers to unbelievers and from unbelievers to believers. It might well be, that the power of
  persuasion ? stemming from the plasticity of hallucination, creative fantasy or truthfulness ? is so mutable in each
  case, that theoretically it need not, practically it might not be possible to deal with it.</p>
<p> Thus, the second and subsequent members of the transmission chain pass the memorate of obscure and undeterminable
  origin to each other. Provided persons within the legend ? or for that matter, the UFO-conduit ? will like it, the
  message will follow the hypothesized rules of tradition <span class="source">Degh LIVazsonyi, A.: The Hypothesis of Multi-Conduit Transmission in Folklore. In: Folklore. Performance and Communication, edd. D. Ben-Amos and K. S. Goldstein. The Hague 1975, esp. 211-213.</span>.
  If the story was not started on the right track, no matter how attractive its reality base, artistry or fancy, it will
  either die or be diverted into another direction. If it can stay on the right track, it will keep on going, as long as
  the members of the conduit do not lose interest, regardless of their degree of belief or disbelief.</p>
<p> One is tempted to believe that a legend, passing through society, loses its original vigor, slows down, stagnates
  and eventually stops. But in reality this is not always the case. It can happen that a legend that seems to be feeble
  at the start, gets an impetus later. Then, it might recede and stagnate, and meanwhile, it might gather new strength
  again. It seems to pass through different relay-stations where it would be forwarded with new energy.</p>
<p> If, for example, a legend is based on a real, or an illusory experience, like the UFO story, can we say, that some
  members of the legend-sequence are identical with the aforementioned relay-stations? Is it possible then, that members
  of the UFO conduit, who at an earlier date already experienced something similar, will now find verification of this
  previous experience in the new message, and therefore pass it on with more enthusiasm and plasticity than the simple
  senders and transmitters? The members of a transmission-chain might be identified from No. 1 to an indefinite number.
  Supposedly, the message of No. 1, sent to No. 2, about his sight of a UFO will seem to slow down after a while.
  However, it will reach, let's say, No. 30, who has once already seen a UFO, although his earlier experience was not
  received with the interest he expected. Now, No. 30 will feel encouragement of his earlier observation and infuse his
  own strengthened conviction and recharge the slackening power of the message that will thus be reinvigorated and
  continue its course in the conduit, repeatedly exhibiting the almost physical act of slackening and acceleration.</p>
<p> So far, so good. But remember, I have already stated that the true sighting of the first teller (No. 1 in this
  case), does not necessarily strengthen the viability of the memorate he launched. If this is true concerning No. 1,
  why would it not be true concerning No. 30, functioning in this example as relaystation? In other words, could the
  transmitter who added his belief, desire, or fantasy to the story, become an as effective helper of the
  legend-transmission as the eyewitness? In innumerable cases, legends find their way to, and are further communicated
  by, those who expect such things likely to happen, or are otherwise eager to get involved. Such persons exhibit a
  readiness to take UFO's for granted without scrupulously seeking their origin like scientists would. The twenty
  Oregonians who started out, responding to the call of some evangelists, in search for the UFO that will take them to
  another planet, never saw a UFO. However, if someone ? eyewitness, dreamer or liar ? would tell them to have seen a
  UFO circling above their campsite, the twenty people would receive this information with bustling zeal and would
  indeed spread the news, if they had the chance. If human relaystations would not exist, there would be no folklore.
  But they need not be necessarily eyewitnesses, or believers; it is enough for them to be real legend tellers.</p>
