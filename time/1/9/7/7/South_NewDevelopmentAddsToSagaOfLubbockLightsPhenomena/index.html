<p>The mystery of the '<a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Lubbock">Lubbock Lights</a>', a V-shaped
  string of illuminated objects which flew over the xxxx City 26 years ago, is now more baffling than ever.</p>
<p>In the latest development, computer-assisted scientists examining photographs of the 1951 celestial spectacle have
  shot holes in the federal government's "explanation" that the lights were a natural phenomena.</p>
<p>The independent researchers reported after extensive analysis of the pictures that the shiny objects photographed as
  they zommed over Lubbock represent <q>a formation of extraordinary flying objects</q>. </p>
<p><a href="/org/us/asso/GSW.html">Ground Saucer Watch</a>, a Phoenix-based civilian research group, said the Air Force
  was altogether wrong in writing off the "Lubbock Lights" as a natural occurence.</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/asso/GSW.html">GSW</a> investigators said their tests on the photographs prove that they could not
  have been caused by a flock of migratory birds reflecting the lights of the city.</p>
<p>And the research team also discounted the possibility the lights were caused by airplanes, stars or any atmospheric
  phenomenon.</p>
<p><q>Based on the photographic evidence and the analyzed data on the said Lubbock photographs, it is the consensus of
  the GSW photographic staff that the images depicted herein represent a formation of extraordinary flying objects</q>,
  the researchers said. </p>
<p>They called the photographs <q>one of the more vexing photographic sequences ever taken, since the conception of
  modern-day UFO sightings</q>. </p>
<p>The lights &#8212; resembling a <q>string of pearl-like objects</q> moving with <q>incredible</q> speed, according to
  witnesses &#8212; were viewed in late <time>1951-08</time> and early <time>1951-09</time>. In some
  cases, there were several flights of the objects reported each night.</p>
<p>Though seen by many citizens, only one person &#8212; Carl Halt Jr., a teenager at the time &#8212; photographed the
  display. His pictures supported other eye-witness accounts that the spectacle involved a V-or U-shaped set of
  illuminated objects.</p>
<p>Several investigations were conducted. The government's official account of the sighting, made public years later
  with the release of the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a>'s <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project Blue Book</a>, said : </p>
<p><q>The kind of birds responsible for this sighting is not known, but it is highly probable that they were ducks or
  plovers. Since plovers do not usually fly in formations of more that six or seven, ducks become more probable. The
  fact that this was late summer, and that the objects consistently flew to the south, tends to substantiate the
  conclusion that the objects of this sighting were migratory birds.</q></p>
<p>The <a href="/org/us/asso/GSW.html">GSW</a> team, however, dispelled the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air
  Force</a> conclusion. Using its computers, the civilian research organization recently reported that :</p>
<ul>
  <li>The "Lubbock Lights" photographs were not retouched or hoaxed.</li>
  <li>The lights in the pictures were not connected to each other, but were <q>independent of one another</q>. </li>
  <li><q>The images in each exposure are NOT airplanes, astronomical bodies, nor birds flying low to the ground and
    being illuminated from mercury-vapor street lights. The density is much too bring to be attributed to these
    sources.</q></li>
  <li><q> The individual light sources all had shape and substance. The spherical images were definitely NOT reflections
    or refracted upper atmosphere light (such as the change in the apparent position of a celestial body due to bending
    of the light rays emanating from it as they pass through the atmosphere).</q></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/org/us/asso/GSW.html">GSW</a> said that while some of the sightings of the lights reported in <a
    href="../../../5/1/index.html">1951</a> may have been birds, lights caught on film by Hart definitely were not. </p>
