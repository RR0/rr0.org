<p> Before proceeding further in describing social intelligence processes about UFOs, the reader may be concerned about
  whether the author feels these objects to be real or imaginary, and to what class of concepts, if not objects, the
  discussion will be limited. The label 'Unidentified Flying Objects' was originally substituted for 'flying saucers' as
  an attempt to be more agnostic about the phenomena in question <span class="source">See H. Strentz, A Survey of Press Coverage of Unidentified Flying
  Objects (unpublished doctoral dissertation, Department of Journalism,
Northwestern University, 1970), 3.</span>. Even the former term, however, poses difficulties. Menzel suggests that the
  term is a misnomer because it implies that the sightings 'are of material reality', a view to which Menzel does not
  adhere <span class="source">D. Menzel, 'Flying Saucers', McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science
and Technology (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1960), 363-64.</span>. Objection could also be made to the word 'flying', since
  this assumes something about the propulsion of the phenomenon: and in any case some of the most interesting
  manifestations are seen on the ground. How to delimit this seemingly amorphous class of objects or events?</p>
<p> Both the taxonomic and epistemological problems can be solved if we are willing to suspend judgment on the reality
  of UFOs and deal with the subject in terms of psychological and social events <span class="note">This method of treatment was suggested to me by my former mentor,
Duncan McRae.</span>. Rather than a 'person who has sighted a UFO', we have a 'person who has had a UFO experience'.
  This person may then make a 'report' of his experience, although we know that in some cases there have been reports
  which were not based on experiences (hoaxes). Similarly, there have been experiences which did not eventuate in public
  reports. Again, we are interested in how experiences are transformed into reports which are transformed in turn into
  the 'data' on which the scientist at least partly bases his decision about the reality of UFOs.</p>
<p> The reader may feel nonetheless that study of the social events associated with a supposed anomaly may generate
  indications as to whether the anomaly exists or not. In the next section we will see that there are indications that
  some witnesses have perceived genuinely anomalous objects, at least in terms of ordinary rules used in our culture for
  assessing the validity of experiences. However, we must recognize that the rules by which some objects are considered
  real or not is also a potential object of study <span class="source">For an interesting examination of reality negotiation in science, see
  H.M. Collins, 'The Seven Sexes: A Study in the Sociology of a Phenomenon,
  or the Replication of Experiments in Physics', Sociology, Vol. 9, No. 2 (May
1975), 205-24.</span>, and that other cultures might well recognize other rules. Rather than become entangled in the
  controversy over whether UFOs pass our cultural tests for reality or not <span class="note"> For opposing views on the existence of UFOs, see C. Sagan and T.
  Page (eds), UFOs: A Scientific Debate (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press,
1972).</span>, let us focus our attention instead on the processes by which we get the data which allow us to make such
  a decision.</p>
