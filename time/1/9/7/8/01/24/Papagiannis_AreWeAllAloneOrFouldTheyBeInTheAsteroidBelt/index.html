  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>The observations that life has a natural tendency to expand into all available space, that advanced technological
    civilizations should be able to engage with relative ease in interstellar travelling, and that once this threshold
    is crossed the complete colonization of the entire Galaxy will be accomplished in a very short interval relative to
    the age of the Galaxy, lead us to the following dilemma: either the entire Galaxy is teeming with intelligent life
    and hence our solar system must have been colonized hundreds of millions of years ago, or there are no other
    inhabitants in our solar system and hence most probably neither anywhere else in the Galaxy. Before accepting,
    however, the bleak verdict that we are all alone in the Galaxy, we must search carefully throughout the solar system
    for any signs of other technological civilizations. The most logical place to look for them seems to be the asteroid
    belt because of the many advantages it offers to a galactic society living in space colonies.</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>A Change Of Heart</h2>
  <p>The euphoric optimism of the sixties and the early seventies that communication with extraterrestrial civilizations
    seemed quite possible (Sagan 1973), is being slowly replaced in the last couple of years (Hart 1975; Jones 1976;
    Shklovskii 1977) by a pessimistic acceptance that we might be the only technological civilization in the entire
    Galaxy. This change of heart has been happening as a result of the following observations:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Life seems to possess a natural tendency to expand like a gas to occupy all available space. This is evident,
      e.g. when algae rapidly take over an unattended swimming pool, and certainly has been the characteristic of man
      who after conquering the entire planet is now ready for new ventures in outer space.</li>
    <li>Interstellar travelling seems easily attainable, especially in the 0.01-0.1 <i>c </i>range, by advanced
      technological societies. The building of permanent colonies in space, as envisioned by O'Neill <i>(1974), </i>will
      make it possible for people living all their lives in these colonies to disengage emotionally from the mother
      planet. Such colonies would have the emotional strength and coherence to undertake trips to the nearby stars that
      would last for several generations. Nuclear fusion, with a 0.007 <i>mc</i>2 yield, can become a most attractive
      energy source for such trips even at an efficiency <i>Eta </i>as low as 10-20 per cent. As seen from the
      relation<br> <br> 1/2<i>MV</i>2<i> = </i>0.007 Etamc2 <i>mc</i>2<i> </i>(1)<br> <br> a spaceship of mass <i>M </i>will
      be able to reach speeds <i>V </i>= 1&ndash;3 x 10-2c with a fuel load m not larger than <i>M.</i></li>
    <li>In the last 100 yr or so, the velocities of long, non-stop voyages (trains to spaceships) have increased from ~
      103 to 106 cm/s. It seems reasonable, therefore, to anticipate an additional increase by a factor of 300&ndash;1000
      in the next 100&ndash;200 yr, especially with the use of nuclear fusion. One can be optimistic also about
      self-sufficient space colonies, which according to the computations of O'Neill could be a reality even before the
      turn of the century. It appears, therefore, that with steady technological progress and without the need of any
      new major discoveries, we should be able to undertake stellar missions in a few centuries. This is an interval in
      cosmic terms as brief as a few minutes in the life of a man, which means that our civilization is extremely close
      to this critical moment.</li>
    <li>Once the threshold of interstellar travelling is crossed the entire Galaxy will be colonized in only a few
      million years, which is a very short period relative to the 10-15 billion year age of our Galaxy. Even by assuming
      an expansion rate of one light year per century (say 500 yr for a 10 lt yr trip to a suitable nearby star, and 500
      yr for the building of the new colony before it can undertake further stellar missions), we see that the entire
      Galaxy can be conquered in less than 10 M yr. It is also clear that as new colonies join the colonization wave,
      there will be so many interstellar travellers that there will be no reasonable place in the Galaxy that will
      remain unoccupied.</li>
    <li>The many attractive features of our solar system (a single, well-behaved, long-lasting, hot star surrounded by a
      multitude of diverse planets, moons and asteroids) could have not been missed by the colonizers, and therefore our
      solar system could have not been bypassed as the colonization wave swept through the Galaxy.</li>
    <li>The likelihood is that the extraterrestrial colonizers of our solar system, especially after their long
      interstellar voyages, will have become accustomed to space living. As a result, not only will they not need a
      habitable planet to settle on, but most probably they would prefer to continue living in space colonies. The
      orbits of their choice would obviously be these that provide the most efficient access to material and energy
      resources.<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>From the above it follows that if hundreds of millions of intelligent civilizations did evolve in our Galaxy over
    the past several billion years, as suggested by the integration of the Drake&ndash;Sagan probability formula over
    the entire history of the Galaxy (Freeman &amp; Lampton 1975), then it seems inevitable that some of these galactic
    civilizations would have achieved interstellar travelling and the whole Galaxy, including our solar system, would
    have been teeming with advanced technological societies. Conversely, if we are the only technological inhabitants of
    our solar system, then most likely we are also the only ones of the entire Galaxy. This deduction implies that the
    values commonly used for one or more of the probability factors of the Drake formula (Shklovskii &amp; Sagan 1966;
    Kreifeldt 1971; Sagan 1973; Oliver 1975) must have been grossly over-estimated (Papagiannis 1978).</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Could They Be Around?</h2>
  <p>We have reached, therefore, the stage where the acid test for our dilemma seems to be whether or not our solar
    system is inhabited by an advanced extraterrestrial society. Of course there are in the literature several reports
    of UFO sightings and even stories of dramatic encounters with extraterrestrials. There are also several popular
    books, such as those of von Da:niken (1969), in which the intervention of extraterrestrials in this planet is
    envisioned on countless occasions. Still, however, there is no convincing proof to any of these stories or
    suggestions; in accordance with the Shklovskii principle that &lsquo;all events should be considered natural unless
    proven otherwise' the scientific community remains unconvinced about visits to Earth by extra-terrestrials. As a
    result, and in accordance with the presently available evidence, we tend to believe that we arc the only advanced
    civilization inhabiting our solar system.</p>
  <p>Absence of evidence however, should not be taken as evidence of absence. Before we resign therefore, to a
    pessimistic acquiesence that we might be the only technological inhabitants of our Galaxy, we have the
    responsibility to search exhaustively in our solar system for other advanced societies. The supposition that we are
    alone in the solar system is based essentially on the assumption that if others were here they would have already
    made contact with us, or at least we would have become aware of their existence. Neither of these assumptions,
    however, is necessarily true, though it is possible that some of the thousands of UFO sightings might deserve some
    further consideration, as suggested by Hynek (1972).</p>
  <p>The most intriguing question in the whole problem is the following:</p>
  <p>if our solar system is indeed inhabited by extraterrestrials, where are they most likely to be found? In earlier
    days people had tried to identify one of the other planets of our solar system, most frequently Mars (Lowell 1908),
    as the abode of an extraterrestrial society. From the above discussion however, it follows that the colonizers of
    our solar system are likely to continue to live in space colonies, probably at reasonably close distance to the Sun
    so as to have a sufficient supply of solar energy for their needs, and most likely near celestial bodies of weak
    gravity from which they would obtain all the natural materials needed for the continuous prosperity of their
    civilization.</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>The Asteroid Belt Choice</h2>
  <p>Within this framework, it seems that the asteroid belt would be an ideal place for the extraterrestrials to set up
    their space colonies. Not only would they have an easy access to all natural resources by mining the asteroids, but
    they would also be close enough to the Sun to have ample solar energy for their needs. Some years ago this
    suggestion would have sounded unreasonable, mainly because we used to think that the asteroid belt must be full of
    debris which can be very hazardous for any spaceships permanently stationed in their vicinity. The <i>Pioneer 10</i>
    and <i>11</i> missions, however, (Kinard <i>et al</i>. 1974) have found that the density of meteriods in the
    asteroid belt hardly differs from any other place in the solar system, and therefore the colonization of the
    asteroid belt seems quite feasible. There are, of course, also the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt which are
    practically free of any asteroids. A spaceship could remain there almost indefinitely by simply compensating against
    the tidal effects of Jupiter with its own propulsion system.</p>
  <p>One can even consider the possibility that the large fragmentation of the components of the asteroid belt might be
    the result of mining projects by the extraterrestrial colonies. It is even conceivable that they have tried to keep
    the region clean of free floating debris for their safety. The identification of space colonies 1&ndash;10 km in
    size hidden in the asteroid belt would not be an easy task for a terrestrial observer because from a long distance
    these colonies would be practically indistinguishable from the thousands of natural asteroids. They would also
    follow the same orbits around the Sun as the asteroids, which would be much more numerous and therefore it would be
    almost like searching for a needle in a haystack. Still with careful observations in the radio domain we might be
    able to detect some leakage of radio noise, infrared observations might reveal a higher effective temperature than
    that which is justified by their distance from the Sun and finally, properly planned space missions to the asteroid
    belt might do some successful eavesdropping and might even return some direct photographic evidence. The search
    project, therefore, though admittedly quite difficult, is still within the capabilities of our present technology
    and in view of the far-reaching consequences of either positive or negative results, should be given a serious
    consideration.</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Why Are They Silent?</h2>
  <p>As to why they have not yet made contact with us, one can think of several answers, including the zoo hypothesis of
    Ball (1973). The simplest explanation, however, and hence, maybe the most probable one, might be that of confusion
    and indecision. Our hypothetical neighbours were probably acquainted for millions of years with a lethargic Earth
    inhabited by life forms not worth any effort of communication. Suddenly, in the last 50 yr or so, which probably is
    a very short interval for a well-settled galactic society, they have been confronted with an exponentially
    mushrooming technological society. (aeroplanes, radio-communications, nuclear bombs, spacecraft) which undoubtedly
    must be causing them some serious concern. It is possible, however, that faced with such a sudden technological
    explosion, a serene cosmic civilization would be perplexed and undecided as to how to handle the situation. They
    might be debating on whether to crush us or to help us, and therefore they might be simply postponing their
    decision, waiting to see what we are going to do with ourselves. Meanwhile, the asteroid belt provides a natural
    hide-out where they can remain inconspicuous for a long time until we decide to search for them.</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>In conclusion, though the idea that the asteroid belt might be harbouring a number of extraterrestrial colonies
    sounds like science fiction, the arguments presented above suggest that <i>if </i>there are any extraterrestrial
    colonies in our' solar system then the asteroid belt seems to be the most logical place to look for them. Before
    accepting, therefore, the bleak verdict that we are all alone in the Galaxy, we have an obligation carefully to
    investigate this possibility, remote as it might seem.</p></section>
