<p class="abstract">No one recalls 1970 UFO spotting </p>
<p class="abstract2"> Leary, Ga (NEA) - Jimmy Carter had a close encounter of a highly suspicious kind here in 1970. He
  was a political hopeful then, making a speech at the local Lions Club, and he says he spotted an unidentified flying
  object 30 degrees above the horizon. He also says 10 to 12 others saw it with him. </p>
<p> As it happens, however, there is no one in Leary who remembers sighting a UFO in company with the future president.
  Carter insists that the object's brightness attracted a crowd, but it appears it only attracted him. Not one resident
  recalls anything unusual about that particular January evening. </p>
<p> The townsfolk are mildly amused by the inconsistency of the matter. They have in fact been chuckling ever since last
  year when the media carried belated news of the Carter encounter. Some think that Carter actually viewed the town's
  silver water tower; from a distance it can look a bit odd. </p>
<p> But whatever Carter saw, he apparently saw it alone. Mayor Stanley Shepard says he has talked with everyone who
  might have attended the Lions Club meeting on the night in question, "and nobody remembers anything about flying
  saucers." People recall that Carter's speech was dull - but as for spaceships, no.... </p>
