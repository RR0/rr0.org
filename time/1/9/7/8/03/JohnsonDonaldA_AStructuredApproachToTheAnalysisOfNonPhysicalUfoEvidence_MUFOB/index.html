<p>Over the years, many students of the UFO phenomenon have come to realise that the solution to the UFO enigma is
  probably not going to fall into their laps in the form of that long awaited, indisputable piece of physical evidence.
  Any attempted explanation of the phenomenon based on the current supply of physical evidence would be deemed by most
  as wholly inadequate. In fact this lack of indisputable hard evidence has led many to speculate that the phenomenon
  may not have a physical dimension at all. Be that as it may, the stress put on the importance of physical evidence is
  undeniable. (1) Perhaps this emphasis may yet prove justifiable. However, it is also equally true that we have until
  very recently largely overlooked the possibility of gaining much insight into the problem through the systematic study
  of our most abundant form of data, the non-physical or ’soft’ evidence.</p>
<p>This article is an attempt to provide a realistic and orderly approach to the problem of the analysis of ’soft’ UFO
  evidence by inter-disciplinary study. Specifically, these recommendations are relevant to individuals involved in or
  interested in the study areas of psychology, history, statistics, sociology, anthropology and folklore. By ’soft’
  evidence we are referring to the psychological and sociological process involved in the experiencing of a UFO event,
  the generation of this experience into a report, the generalization and categorization or reports into a phenomenon,
  and the mythification of this phenomenon or a combination of phenomena into a folklore.If there are still any readers
  left at this point some clarification for their benefit will be attempted. We are defining the overall phenomenon as
  an ongoing process, and we are structuring it into four levels, of increasing abstraction, for the purposes of study.
  Basically the four levels of analysis visualised in this approach are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>the witness</li>
  <li>the report</li>
  <li>the phenomenon</li>
  <li>the myth</li>
</ol>
<p>In this model each level of the phenomenon poses separate and unique questions. By approaching the evidence through
  this structure the special talents of the scientific disciplines mentioned above (as well as others, the list is in no
  way meant to be exclusive) can be brought to bear in an effective manner.</p>
<p>The psychologist, for example, is interested primarily in the witness, his psychological profile, his perceptual
  abilities, his personality. His training allows him to judge properly the relationship between a hypnopompic
  hallucination and certain categories of close encounter UFO events. The sociologist on the other hand would more
  likely direct his energy to the report level of the evidence. He would be interested in the societal factors that
  motivate an individual to report his experience and in explaining the dynamics that permit bias to creep into an
  account. The statistician and historian are properly at home on the phenomenon level, both skilled in documenting
  factors responsible for such things as UFO waves. Finally, the social anthropologist and the folklorist are interested
  in the dynamics of myth building, the symbolism evoked, the techniques for the transmission of myth, and the cultural
  needs that are set or fulfilled by the UFO myth.</p>
<p>It should be noted that each discipline overlaps the structural levels to a greater or lesser degree, and none has
  exclusive domain over any one level. In any interdisciplinary study the objective is not to parcel out shares along
  lines of authority but rather to share knowledge and assist in the group’s understanding through the contribution of a
  different perspective.</p>
<h2>The Witness</h2>
<p>Let us examine the current state of the phenomenon using the outline of the analytical model. We first approach the
  entire process from the level of the witness. On this level we are no so much concerned with what is described as who
  is describing it. In those situations where there is no logical explanation for the sighting, where we do in fact have
  a UFO and there is no physical trace, the person making the report must become the object of the investigation. (2) As
  our only tangible form of evidence the witness is extremely important. Ideally, we would like the full gamut of
  information on each individual witness: his history of mental health, his status in the community, educational level,
  perceptual abilities, his psychological profile drawn from a series of interviews and a battery of psychological
  tests.</p>
<p>In very few cases has all this information been obtained. Usually as the level of strangeness of a report increases
  the importance of this information increases proportionately. Therefore, it is not unusual that in the instances where
  this information has been gathered, it is for the high level close encounters - cases such as Betty and Barney Hill,
  Stella Lansing, or Parker and Hickson. However, for the majority of cases this extensive information on the witnesses
  is absent. There are some very good reasons for this. Most of it is very difficult and time-consuming material to
  obtain. Furthermore, there are ethical questions involved in compiling and releasing this information, and serious
  legal questions raised with the advent of now privacy laws in the USA.</p>
<p>This information does have value beyond determining whether a witness is a liar or a fool and there are some very
  real issues that could be resolved with it. For instance, is there a ’selection effect’ for UFO witnesses? Why do some
  people go through their entire lives without seeing anything whilst others have several UFO experiences? Should the
  repeaters be disqualified or believed? Is there a correlation between demonstrated ‘psi’ ability and UFO experiences?
  Is there a correlation between mild cases of adaptive schizophrenia and UFO experiences? Are percipients of UFO events
  prone to hallucinations?</p>
<p>Many of these questions are speculated upon without any real evidence. The article Psychiatrv and UFO Reports by
  Grinspoon and Persky) is a good example of an attempt to relate psychological phenomena to UFOs without citing a
  single actual example from a UFO case!</p>
<p>As an example of research that would be useful in this area, Benton Jamison presented one research proposal at the
  1976 CUFOS conference (4) which would test whether or not there exists significant sociological and psychological
  differences between a sample of people who have had a UFO experience and a sample of those who have not. In his
  proposal he recommends including measures of hypnotic suggestibility and beliefs about psychic ability in the witness
  testing.</p>
<p>Research in this area should be supported and encouraged both because of the importance of the questions rained and
  because the research could begin today, which is not true of studies which need physical data, which must wait for the
  evidence to come to them.</p>
<h2>The Report</h2>
<p>The next level of the model is the report. Reports are what our perception of the enigma at the phenomenon level are
  exclusively based on. It is therefore very important that we understand the dynamics of reporting and the reliability
  of our evidence before we begin to make any conclusions on the nature of UFOs.</p>
<p>Basically the reporting process involves the following societal filtering effects: an individual or a group of
  individuals must conceptualise an event as unusual enough to make note of it, must be motivated enough to report it,
  and must have enough status and credibility to have the report accepted.Because we know there is a very definite
  selection effect involved in the reporting of a UFO event, a prime object of research in this area should be to obtain
  as close to a random sample of actual incidents as possible. Even obtaining the services of a professional opinion
  survey firm and going lack to the subject pool to collect a new independent sample of witnesses would not be carrying
  this effort too far. We could then compare the characteristics of such a sample to the population of reports we have
  on file to determine what some of the ‘laws’ of reporting this phenomenon are, and how badly biased our current sample
  of reports is.</p>
<p>For a further discussion on the nature of these societal filtering effects and how they affect the reporting of UFOs,
  I refer the reader to an excellent treatment of the subject by Dr <span class="people">Ron Westrum</span>, in his
  article Knowing about
  UFOs, carried in two parts in MUFOB new series 5 and 6. (5)</p>
<h2>The Phenomenon</h2>
<p>As used herein, the phrase ‘the UFO phenomenon’ is defined as the product of the categorization of reports of
  extraordinary events which share as their common attribute the observation of unusual aerial objects. The word
  ‘phenomenon’ is therefore not synonymous with ‘event’ or ‘occuronce’ as it would be in its strict dictionary
  definition. It implies rather a compilation of events, and is hence an abstraction and not an event.</p>
<p>The Battelle Memorial Institute study that became Project Bluebook Special Report 14 established statistically that
  the population of true ‘unknowns’, i.e. unidentified reports, is significantly different in attributes from reports
  that can be attributed to misidentifications. (6) This makes it very unlikely that the UFO phenomenon can be
  attributed to any currently known natural phenomenon ‘if we just try harder’. It also means that we do, in fact, have
  a real and not just an imaginary problem On our hands. We should examine this problem both in terms of what we
  currently know about it and where we can go with that knowledge.</p>
<p>Perhaps our most important asset in this study is our ability to discern patterns within the UFO phenomenon. This is
  true because the presence of patterns reaffirms our original hypothesis that a certain set of events should be classed
  together. When we look at the phenomenon, we find some very strong patterns which might be categorized in the
  following manner:</p>
<ol>
  <li> patterns in descriptions</li>
  <li>patterns in behaviour</li>
  <li>temporal patterns</li>
  <li>spatial patterns</li>
</ol>
<p>There exists, for instance, similarities in the descriptions of objects including size, shape colour, number of
  lights, etc., and in descriptions of humanoids associated with those objects. One very obvious area for further
  research would be to continue the work started by the Batelle study to determine how their patterns co-vary with one
  another and how they correlate with patterns observed in occupant or object behaviour. An example of such a study is
  that provided by Fred Merritt. (7) By studying similarities in descriptions of ‘landing’ marks, and reports of the
  objects and occupants associated with these events he was able to cluster landing reports into five groups or
  ‘catenas’, one group of which he was able to eliminate as indicative of a ball lightning or similar atmospheric
  effect.</p>
<p>We also know that UFO reports occur with marked variance in frequency over time and that reports are not evenly
  distributed geographically. Ballester Olmos has found from statistical data that close encounters tend to manifest
  themselves in sparsely populated areas, whereas lights-in-the-sky reports have a random spatial distribution that is
  directly correlated with population. (8)</p>
<p>David Saunders has determined that the five year cycle waves (1947, 1952, 1957, 1967 and 1972) are characterised by
  negatively skewed distributions. (9) That is, they are waves that build slowly to a crescendo and taper off quickly,
  rather than waves that seem to be sparked by a few well publicised cases which peak early and taper off as interest
  dies. Saunders (1O), and Anderson (11) have linked the temporal aspects of UFO events with their spatial occurence. By
  following development of the major five year waves they separately traced the movement of reports outward and
  predominantly eastward from theoretical longitudinal starting points. Further research in this area may result in
  almost total predictability of when and where a major UFO wave may occur.</p>
<p>Finally, Saunders has also advanced the scientific case for orthoteny, or the heavy frequency of occurence of UFOs
  reports along certain great circle lines around the globe. (12) While the meaning of these ‘orthotenic’ lines appears
  to be beyond our present comprehension, their existence has nonetheless been validated.</p>
<p>Historians can be a valuable asset to this level of research by documenting the historical events that correspond
  and contribute to the presence of UFO reports over time. The ’swamp gas’ fervour of 1966 is one obvious example. Time
  series analysis such as that done by Saunders could then be linked to an historical analysis of the cycles of public
  interest. The integration of these two forms of analysis could offer now insights.</p>
<h2>The Myth</h2>
<p>Finally we come to the analysis of the myth associated with UFOs. This subject is purposely treated last because the
  processes involved in the dynamics of myth development seem to draw upon all levels of the phenomenon for material.
  Just dealing with the term ‘myth’ is a problem in itself. On the one hand the word carries definite connotations of
  storybook images of things that ‘really can’t exist’; and it is often employed in the sense of ‘fiction’ or ‘untrue’.
  On the other hand, myth has also come to mean something quite different to anthropologists, folklorists and students
  of comparative religion. Myth in this sense is a dynamic processthat explains reality, or more exactly, how reality
  came to be. (13) It is this function of myth that sets apart from common folklore. As such it supplies models for
  human behaviour and gives meaning and value to life.</p>
<p>Translating this understanding of myth to the UFO enigma we find a mechanism to explain the phenomenological reality
  of UFOs. Throughout the world we can find many examples of ‘living’ myths. Myths are alive in the sense that they are
  believed and used as examples to explain our day-to-day world. In our own culture science and technology have largely
  supplanted myth as the mechanism for explaining reality. The case of UFOs is one notable exmption.</p>
<p>The need to know is a universal human trait. Some social scientists describe it as the need for ‘closure’, that is,
  a need for predictability in an uncertain universe. When a strong man suddenly sickens and dies for no apparent
  reason, some reason needs to be created. In a primitive culture his death could be attributed to witchcraft. In our
  own culture we would ascribe it to virus, or unseen micro-organisms, such as ‘Legionnaire’s Disease’. The UFO is
  indeed a living myth in our own myth-less culture because, in the absence of an adequate scientific explanation of
  UFOs, myth is called upon to supply the answer.</p>
<p>What exactly is the ‘UFO myth’, then? That’s not an easy question. We know that myth is a product of empirically
  observed facts, beliefs, and some very strong human emotions. As such it represents a fairly awsome subject:</p>
<p>It seems to be impossible to guage the power of what Jung called the ‘modern myth’ of UFOs, a myth generated by our
  post-WWII encounter with a real phenomenon (made no less real by its failure to be universally recognised as such),
  sustained not only by years of rumor, denial, newspaper, radio and TV accounts, but by an unending stream of mostly
  unpublished UFO incidents, and charged psychically by virtue of its connection with almost universally held
  aspirations and fears.If this myth does have the power to create thousands or even tens of thousands of spurious UFO
  sightings on the part of people who show no apparent signs of malfunction or derangement, then some way must be found
  to explore the mechanism by which these sightings are generated on the one hand, and on the other to separate them
  from sightings of physically real objects. (14)</p>
<p>Anthropologists and folklorists have long been aware that the deciphering of myths is always a sticky business Some
  of the dynamics of myth are thought to be fairly well understood, mostly dealing with the techniques of myth
  transmission (through psychological studies of telling and retelling stories, through anthropological studies of
  cultures with active oral traditions, and through sociological studies of modern media) The importance of symbolism in
  myth to account for human needs is also recognised (through psychoanalytic analysis of classical mythology).</p>
<p>I think it would be fair to say that most people ascribe some form of alien visitation to the UFO myth, be it
  extraterrestrial or otherwise. Visitation by spacecraft is not the only aspect or message of the myth, however.</p>
<p>John Rimmer was the first to recognise the importance of the UFO as an anti-scientific symbol. (15) As such the UFO
  represents the forces of magic in a technologically dominated (and one might add technologically despoiled) modern
  world. The attractiveness of this symbolism should not be underestimated. Several millenarian movements have already
  developed around UFOs as agents of salvation. (16) This subconscious symbolism may also explain why the leadership of
  the scientific establishment is so threatened by the UFO question and have, right to the present, refused to examine
  the issue rationally and dispassionately.</p>
<p>We know that the myth encompassing UFOs is persistent. It has endured in more or less the same form for over 30
  years. It may well have persisted in altered form for thousands of years before that. This raises the question as to
  whether the ‘real’ phenomenon behind the myth is the causal factor for that persistence, or whether the reality of the
  myth is so powerful and the symbolism evoked so very important that the success and permanence of the UFO story is
  guaranteed through time with little change.</p>
<p>In Passport to Magonia Jacques Vallée makes the connection between modern day UFOs and medieval myths. (17) He bases
  this connection on:</p>
<p>1 - similarities between the appearances of UFO occupants and the descriptions of elves and gnomes.<br> 2 -
  similarities in the absurd, ludicrous behaviour of UFOs and UFO occupants and the antics and pranks of fairies.<br> 3
  - the religious and mystical motivations behind apparitions and percipient experiences.4 - the evolutionary process of
  the observation of objects from airships to dirigibles to ghost rockets to flying saucers.</p>
<p>Many of the similarities he provides between the UFO phenomenon and the fairy phenomenon do appear to be more than
  coincidental. Vallée states that he was forced to make a parallel between UFO reports and the main theses of
  fairy-lore because some details in in UFO reports were simply unbelievable unless taken in context with accounts of
  encounters with fairies. (18) This raises a few more questions. What share of these similarities between UFOs and
  other myths should be attributed to human factors? And how strange and divergent can these accounts get before we are
  forced to discard the hypothesis that they are caused by a real external phenomenon?</p>
<p>One of the areas where the greatest contribution by folklorists can be made is in documenting and relating to the
  UFO problem the differences in the development of myth that is the product of fiction, and myth that evolves from real
  events<br> and becomes imbued with mystical symbols.</p>
<p>We might speculate that real events, translated into myth, would have a more limited range of strangeness than
  ‘true’ stories that are the products of hoaxes or actual works of fiction (although even these are limited to a
  cultural frame of reference) The 1896-97 data reveals that the most reliable reports were of objects similar to
  objects seen today. (19) Hoaxes are the most elaborate in their descriptions of the airships, putting all the ‘bells
  and whistles’ imaginable on the object.</p>
<p>We have one last important question to consider under this topic. Does the phenomenon itself draw upon the myth for
  material? There seems to be some evidence that some of the important patterns of UFO events have occurred consequent
  to their popularisation in fictional accounts. The first association of UFOs with power blackouts occurs in a novel
  entitled Twilight Bar written in 1933, and the first reference to UFO effects on a car’s ignition system was also made
  in a novel published in 1950, well before the first major wave of car stoppage reports in the French wave of 1954.
  (20)</p>
<p>Whether these fictional accounts are coincidental or whether they were even incorporated in the UFO myth before real
  events occured is a matter for debate. If the phenomenon does in fact draw upon the myth - our perceptions and
  cultural representation of that phenomenon - then it either raises strong doubts about the physical external nature of
  the phenomenon, or, it brings us into the unattractive research position that the subject of our study responds to or
  even anticipates our observations!</p>
<p>The crux of the problem is succinctly stated in a reference by Hynek from one of Peter Usinov’s plays: “You mean
  they know we know that they know we know?” (21)</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This article provides a conceptual framwork for the analysis of UFO evidence that hopefully will foster further
  inter-disciplinary interest in research on the UFO question. It is hoped that the few research proposals suggested as
  examples within will spark interest and generate other proposals from informed parties, so that when the eventual day
  comes that scientists are able to sit down and address the UFO problem with a respectable operating budget, a good
  outline exists for a plan of attack.</p>
