<p class="abstract"> Spins across galaxy recalled under hypnosis </p>
<p>TORONTO (CP) - <a href="../../../../../../../../people/s/SprinkleRonaldLeo/index.html">Leo Sprinkle</a>, un
  psychologue de l'Université du Wyoming, dit avoir hypnotisé des gens who have seen unidentified flying objects and now
  is convinced that "we are not alone - humans are only a small part of the whole system."</p>
<p><a href="../../../../../../../../people/s/SprinkleRonaldLeo/index.html">Sprinkle</a>, a guest speaker at the 86th
  annual convention of the American Psychological Association, says he thinks he can prove UFO watchers are not kooks.
</p>
<p>During the last five years he says he has hypnotized 50 persons who said they were given mystery tours aboard alien
  spaceships. Before hypnosis, the subjects had never been able to remember what happened to them when they went for a
  spin around the galaxy, <a href="../../../../../../../../people/s/SprinkleRonaldLeo/index.html">Sprinkle</a> said.
</p>
<p>He said the subjects told him everything went blank as soon as they made eye contact with the unearthly
  visitors. </p>
<p>After many hours of hypnosis, half the UFO watchers said they could recall precise details of their black-out period,
  <a href="../../../../../../../../people/s/SprinkleRonaldLeo/index.html">Sprinkle</a> said. </p>
<p>Carl Higdon, 42, a Wyoming oil-well driller, told Sprinkle he was on a hunting trip when he tried to shoot his rifle.
  The shot travelled only 15 metres, then bounced off an invisible wall. When Higdon turned around, he was facing a
  strange creature. </p>
<h2>Describes aliens</h2>
<p><a href="../../../../../../../../people/s/SprinkleRonaldLeo/index.html">Sprinkle</a> said Higdon later described the
  creature as a humanoid with frizzy hair and two small antennae, dressed in an astronaut's jump suit. Instead of hands,
  it had cones which could beam objects from one place to another.</p>
<p> Sprinkle said that under hypnosis, Higdon told of being taken into a cubicle and transported to a master ship, a
  huge illuminated structure shaped like a Christmas tree. </p>
<p>"Whenever Carl described this under hypnosis, his eyes actually watered because the ship's glare was so bright,"
  Sprinkle said. </p>
<p>But once inside the master ship, Higdon recalled he was told: "You're not what we want - you can go back."</p>
<p> Friends found him later that night wandering almost delirious in dense forest.</p>
<p> "Carl was a hard-working, strong, silent type of guy and not at all crazy," Sprinkle said. "I have concluded
  tentatively there is little evidence to support the psychosis hypothesis that only kooks see flying saucers."</p>
