<p> My point of departure will be two memoirs submitted to the French <em>Académie Royale des Sciences</em>, one in
  1771, the other in 1772. The first dealt with an observation of an impressive fireball meteor <span class="source"> J. B. LeRoy, 'Mémoire sur le Météore ou Globe de Feu, Observé au mois de
  Juillet dernier dans une grande partie de la France', Histoire et Mémoires de
  l'Académie Royale des Sciences de Paris, 1771 (Paris, 1774), partie 'Memoires',
668-92. (Hereafter H.MA)RSP</span>, the second with the chemical analysis of a stone alleged to have fallen from the sky
  <span class="source">16. A. D. Fougeroux, L.-C. Cadet and A. Lavoisier, 'Rapport... d'une observation
  communiquée par M. l'Abbé Bachelay, sur une pierre qu'on prétend &amp;ecirc;tre
  tombée du Ciel pendant un orage', Introduction aux Observations sur la Physique,
  sur l'Histoire Naturelle, et sur les Arts, Vol. 2 (1777), 251-55. This is apparently a
  reprint of an article which appeared in Observations sur la Physique (July 1772),
  which I have so far been unable to obtain.</span>. Both papers concerned things happening in the sky, and we know
  today that the two papers dealt with parts of the same phenomenon: the entry and fall of extraterrestrial bodies
  through the earth's atmosphere. Today such bodies are called 'meteors' while in transit through the earth's
  atmosphere, and 'meteorites' if they fall to the ground. At the time, however, no connection was made between these
  two phenomena, and in spite of the close proximity of the two papers in time, their subjects were not related to each
  other by the <em>Académiciens</em>. Nor were the two phenomena treated equally. While the report of the meteor treated
  it as a real event, that of the meteorite treated it as a fiction, or at least as some other kind of event which had
  been badly perceived: stones simply did not fall from the sky.</p>
<p> The failure to make a connection between these two phenomena was very serious, since the explanation of meteors was
  not possible without the evidence offered by the meteorite. LeRoy, the author of the paper on the meteor, felt that
  'Among the multitude of objects of all sorts which physics encompasses, there are none of them more important, or
  which merit our attention more, than meteors <span class="source">LeRoy, op. cit. note 15, 668.</span>. But he was no
  more able to offer a satisfactory explanation of them than had other savants. Edmund Halley, for instance, suggested
  in one article that they were solid bodies - and then, in another article five years later, that they were caused by
  the ignition of long trains of gas in the atmosphere <span class="source"> E. Halley, 'An Account of Several Extraordinary Meteors or Lights in the
  Sky', Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Vol. 29, No. 341
  (October-December 1714), 159-64; and 'An Account of the extraordinary METEOR
  seen all over England, on the 19th of March 1718/9. With a demonstration of the
  uncommon Height thereof', ibid., Vol. 30, No. 360 (April-May 1719), 978-90. (This
journal will be referred to below as Phil. Trans.)</span>. LeRoy himself considered several hypotheses, but was
  unwilling to accept any of them as convincing. He did not seem to be aware of any reports of falling stones, and did
  not agree with the suggestion that solid bodies might be the cause of these appearances <span class="source"> LeRoy, op. cit. note 15, 680.</span>.
  The clues which would have allowed the solution to the mystery were not seen as such.</p>
<p> And yet the clues existed. The stimulus for the 1772 chemical analysis had been three 'thunderstones' submitted to
  the <em>Académie</em> in 1769 from independent sources. The historian of the <em>Académie</em> even remarked upon the
  surprising resemblance of the stones to each other <span class="source">'Trois faits singuliers du meme genre', HMARSP, 1769 (Paris: 1772), partie  'Histoire', 20-21. For reasons that are not clear, the analysis in 1772 (see note 16)
  dealt with only two of the stones.</span>. But the report of the chemical analysis of one of the stones, submitted by
  Fougeroux,. Cadet, and the great Lavoisier, concluded that the stones had not fallen from the sky. They remarked that
  'true physicists' had always regarded the existence of such stones as very doubtful <span class="source"> Fougeroux et al., op. cit. note 16, 251.</span>,
  and they saw no reason in the chemical analysis of the stone at hand to change this opinion. This instance was merely
  one of many rejections which similar stones had to suffer at the hands of savants and learned academies. Because these
  crucial bits of evidence were rejected, understanding the nature of meteors would have to wait until after the
  appearance of Chladni's book in 1794.</p>
<p> It is interesting to note that the acceptance of one part of the phenomenon (meteors) and the rejection of the other
  (meteorites) rested upon unequal opportunities to observe the two. Whereas the meteor was often visible over several
  thousand square miles, the fall of the meteorite was visible only in a much more restricted area. This inequality
  meant that while commoners and savants alike might observe the meteor, and in great numbers, the number of witnesses
  to a meteorite fall was likely to be very small and was unlikely to include those with scientific training. In at
  least one case (Barbotan in 1790) the sighting of a meteor was readily accepted while savants rejected the fall of the
  meteoric stones which took place at the end of its path <span class="source">P. Bertholon, 'Observation d'un globe de feu', Journal des Sciences Utiles,
Vol. 4, No. 24 (1791), 224-28.</span>. During the eighteenth century, while articles on meteors either simply reported
  observations or dealt with possible explanations of their nature, the articles on meteorites were largely concerned
  with whether such things could actually fall from the sky.</p>
<p> Toward the end of the eighteenth century, this attitude began to change rapidly. In 1794 Chladni published his book,
  in which he used accounts of meteorite falls and finds to connect meteors with meteorites and suggested that the
  phenomena were of extraterrestrial origin. Shortly thereafter, as a sequel to several notable falls, the English
  chemist Howard and the emigre mineralogist de Bournon analyzed several meteoric stones and irons and found surprising
  similarities in their chemical composition. The iron meteorites contained nickel - a combination known to occur only
  in these 'rocks' fallen from the sky <span class="source">E. Howard and the Count de Bournon, 'Experiments and Observations on
  Certain Stoney and Metalline Substances, Which at Different Times are Said to
Have Fallen on the Earth; Also on Various Kinds of Native Iron', Phil. Trans., Vol.  92 (1802), 168-212.</span>. The
  chemical analyses went far toward convincing the savants of the reality of the phenomenon. In 1803, De Dree could
  remark that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> It was not so long ago that one risked a disdainful smile by seeming to believe that mineral masses could fall
    from the atmosphere on to our globe; but thanks to the researches made by several savants on these extraordinary
    minerals, along with circumstantial accounts of the fall of some of them ... the general attention is now fixed on
    these astonishing phenomena <span class="source"> E. de Drée, 'Sur les masses minérales dites tombées de l'atmosphère sur
  notre globe', Journal de Physique, de Chimie, et d'Histoire Naturelle, Vol. 56
(April-May 1803), 380-89, citation at 380. (Hereafter J.PC)HN</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> On the same day that these words were read before the Institut de France, it was announced that an enormous quantity
  of stones had fallen near the little town of l'Aigle, France, a mere 70 miles from Paris. Other reports followed; some
  of the actual stones arrived. The Institut sent Jean-Baptiste Biot to investigate. Biot, who had previously announced
  in favour of meteorites <span class="source">J.-B. Biot, 'Note sur des substances pierreuses d'une nature particulière, que
  l'on assure être tombées sur la terre', Bulletin des Sciences de la Société Philomatique,
  No. 66 (August-September 1802), 159-60; and 'Sur les substances minérales
  pretendues tombées du ciel, et nouvellement analysées par MM. Howard et Bournon',
ibid., No. 68 (October-November 1802), 153-56.</span>, did a thorough and elegant job of investigation. His report <span
      class="note"> J. -B. Biot, Relation d'un Voyage fait dans le département de l'Orne pour
  constater la réalité d'un météore observé &amp;agrave; l'Aigle le 26 Floréal an 11 (Paris:
  Baudouin, 1803). (Note: the date given in the title is in error. It should be 6 Floréal,
or 26 April 1803, as the text of the book shows),</span> put to rest virtually all the remaining doubts about the
  reality of meteorites.</p>
