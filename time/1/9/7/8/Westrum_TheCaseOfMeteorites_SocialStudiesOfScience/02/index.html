<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<p> To understand why the scientific community reacted as it did to meteorite reports, we have to examine the scientific
  context in which meteorites appeared. The position of science in Western Europe in 1794 was an ambiguous one <span
      class="note">For an overview, see J. Ben-David, The Scientist's Role in Society: A Comparative
Study (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1971), 75-87.</span>. On the one hand, science had been institutionalized in
  a number of learned societies, some of them enjoying royal support <span class="source">D. McKie, 'Scientific Societies to the End of the Eighteenth Century', in A.
  Ferguson (ed.), Natural Philosophy Through the Eighteenth Century and Allied
Topics (Totowa, NJ: Rowman and Littlefield, 1972), 133-43.</span>. A goodly number of books written by scientists were
  published annually, and were reinforced by more timely publication of results, theories, and criticisms in scientific
  journals <span class="source"> D. M. Knight, Natural Science Books in English 1600-1900 (New York:
  Praeger, 1972), especially 63-106; J. -L. and M. Flandrin, 'La Circulation du Livre
  dans la Société du 18e Siècle', in F. Furet (ed.), Livre et Société dans la France du
  XVIIIe Siècle, Vol. 2 (Paris: Mouton, 1970), 39-72; D. McKie, 'The Scientific
  Periodical from 1665 to 1798', in Ferguson (ed.), op. cit. note 28, 122-32; D. A.
  Kronick, A History of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, 2nd edn. (Metuchen,
NJ: Scarecrow Press, 1976).</span>. Within the scientific community itself, the norm of experimental verification was
  widely accepted, and disputes about reality were frequently resolved by recourse to observation and experiment. On the
  other hand, scientists were few, they were seldom supported directly for their work as researchers, and public
  acceptance was far from assured. It was hard to make a career in science and in fact the exact nature of the
  scientific role itself was unclear <span class="note">See for instance R. Hahn, 'Scientific Research as an Occupation in
  Eighteenth-Century Paris', Minerva, Vol. 13 (1975), 501-13; M. Crosland, 'Development of a Professional Career in Science in France', ibid., 38-57; and D.
Stimson, Scientists and Amateurs: A History of the Royal Society (New York:
Greenwood Press, 1968), 161-96.</span>. Recognition by other scientists was often more important to membership in the
  scientific community than formal training or the holding of an official position. There is no question that a
  scientific community existed in 1794, but it was one considerably looser and more fragmented than the scientific
  community of the twentieth century.</p>
<p> The intellectual and social boundaries of this community were accordingly more difficult to defend. Amateurs existed
  within scientific societies who did not possess any real scientific ability; experts frequently held no important
  positions; and many scientists were churchmen, who thus had double loyalties. In such a situation it is not surprising
  that there should be stiff resistance to any attempt to widen the arena of scientific discourse. Everything that went
  against current notions had to be carefully examined, and if it could not be made to fit, it was consigned to the
  intellectual rubbish-heap; otherwise the disorganization might become worse.</p>
<p> Particularly suspect were ideas from two sources: ancient authors and the common people. The fascination of the
  Renaissance with older authors and popular lore had been replaced in the course of scientific development with a deep
  suspicion of anything that could not be subjected to experiment or observation <span class="note"> The changing fashions in scientific interests are indicated in the course of the
  eight volumes of L. Thorndike's History of Magic and Experimental Science (New
  York: Columbia University Press, 1923-58); also R. F. Jones, Ancients and
  Moderns, A Study of the Rise of the Scientific Movement in Seventeenth Century
England (St. Louis, Mo.: Washington University Press, 1961), 119-47.</span>. This distrust served not only the practical
  purpose of protecting science from 'superstition' or unfounded accounts, but it provided a most important mechanism
  for science in protecting its vulnerable boundaries. The insistence that all data used by scientists originate with
  them or be checked by them not only provided a rudimentary quality control of data, but it kept the processes of
  science firmly in the hands of scientists. To admit data from outside was not only thought to be dangerous to the
  integrity of scientific ideas, but it meant a substantial loss of control. Necessarily this meant that any potential
  threat to the data control system had to be minimized.</p>
<p> It is thus no accident that when meteorites, supported by old accounts and the experiences of the common people,
  presented themselves at the door of science, they were for a considerable time rudely turned away; for scientists were
  only too aware of how many other 'superstitions' were also trying to gain admittance.</p>
