<p> In the eighteenth century there was still a belief among many peoples that stones fell down with the lightning.
  These stones, which earlier authors had called <em>ombriae</em>, <em>brontiae</em> and <em>cerauniae</em> <span
      class="source">F. D. Adams, The Birth and Development of the Geological Sciences (New
York: Dover, 1954), 118-24.</span>, were often regarded as having supernatural powers <span class="note"> There is a considerable number of cases in which meteorites have actually
  been the object of worship. See L. LaPaz, Hunting Meteorites: Their Recovery,
  Use, and Abuse from Paleolithic to Present, Topics in Meteoritics No. 6 (Albuquerdistribution. &copy; 1978 <a

Sky (Denver, Col.: University of Denver Press, 1952), 5-8.</span>. Bishop Pontoppidan observed that the Norwegian
  peasants believed that these stones were especially useful to women in labour, in that they would aid delivery of the
  child <span class="source"> E. Pontoppidan, The Natural History of Norway (London: A. Linde, 1755),
174-76.</span>. Belief regarding the supernatural powers of these stones was so strong in Prussia that Helwing, the
  minister of Angerbourg, finally had to resort to the use of the Secular Arm to root them out <span class="source"> A. de Jussieu, 'De l'Origine et des Usages de la Pierre de Foudre',
HMARSP, 1723 (Paris, 1753), partie 'Histoire', 6-9.</span>. Accordingly one savant after another took pains to describe
  how baseless was the idea that these stones had really fallen with the lightning <span class="source"> See G.-L. L. De Buffon, Histoire Naturelle, Vol. VI (Paris: Imprimerie
  Royale, 1779), 225; article on 'Pierre de Foudre', in Dictionnaire Raisonné
  Universel d'Histoire Naturelle (Lyon: Bruyset, 1791); article on 'Foudre, Pierres
  de', in J. L. R. d'Alembert and D. Diderot, Dictionnaire Raisonné des Sciences, des
Arts et des Metiers (Paris, 1757).</span>.</p>
<p> These figure stones' appeared to one eighteenth-century savant as belonging to three types <span class="source">Mahudel, 'Sur les Prétendues Pierres de Foudre', Histoire et Mémoires de
  l'Académie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres H][MAR,IBL Vol. 12 (Paris
1745), partie 'Histoire', 163-69.</span>. The first were evidently fossils, the hardened remains of creatures which had
  once been living. A second, more interesting, variety were obviously the tools of primitive man which, left behind
  wherever settlements had formerly been, gave rise to the idea that the lightning had sent down these strange wedges
  and axes. A third type of 'lightning-stone', which seemed to be a pyrite or marcasite with a black crust, was a little
  harder to explain. Whereas the first two types had been related to lightning because of their pointed shape (naturally
  thunderbolts had to be pointed), the reason for the connection of the third type with lightning was not clear. 'We
  will have to leave it to the chemists to demonstrate its origin against those who believe it to be celestial,' the
  savant said indifferently <span class="source">Ibid., 163.</span>. That all three types of stones should have been
  given the same name was unfortunate for the recognition of meteorites. For while the scientists of the twentieth
  century would agree with the savants of the eighteenth on the identity of the first two types, they would disagree on
  the third type, which definitely included some stones which really had fallen from the skies, although not with the
  lightning. But when real meteorites were brought to savants for consideration, the memory of the erroneous ones was
  still vivid. No savant wished to be considered foolish by accepting as authentic items analogous to ones already shown
  to be fraudulent. It took many years before prejudice could be overcome.</p>
<p> The savants of the eighteenth century were also well aware that the ancients had reported that stones had rained
  down from the sky on several occasions. Probably most savants saw this simply as an example of the credulity of
  ancient authors, but some were differently disposed. The French historian Fréret, for instance, suggested that his
  colleagues at the <em>Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres</em> take these ancient reports seriously. He argued
  that many of the 'prodigies' reported by the ancients were real enough: they were simply natural events, perhaps
  somewhat rare, which had been given a supernatural interpretation <span class="source">N. Fréret, 'Réflexions sur les Prodiges Rapportez dans les Anciens',
HMARIBL, Vol. 4 (Paris: 1746), partie 'Mémoires', 411-36.</span>. The geologist Guettard, in his notes on Pliny's <em>Natural
    History</em>, also felt that stones could rain from the sky, and cited modern as well as ancient reports of them
  doing so <span class="source"> Pliny the Elder, Histoire Naturelle de Pline, Vol. I (Paris: Desaint, 1771),
404-09.</span>. He felt that such rains might be caused by hurricanes and volcanic explosions.</p>
<p> But the question of stone-falls was of more than merely historical interest. The three stones which had been sent to
  the <em>Académie des Sciences</em> in 1769 were far from the only recently fallen ones which came into the hands of
  savants. Testimonial accounts of contemporary falls were even more numerous. Yet the analysis of one of the three
  stones in 1772 was the first time that a stone said to have fallen was analyzed by a scientific academy and described
  in a scientific journal. The negative assessment of the stone's origin by such a prestigious body was probably very
  influential in determining the reaction of other scientific bodies to the stones, and to testimonies about them. The
  reaction of the <em>Académie</em> created an environment in which information transfer about the phenomenon was slow
  and imperfect. For the verdict of the <em>Académie</em> was widely viewed as being the official viewpoint of science
  itself, not just that of a single academy. To explain why this verdict was changed three decades later, we must
  examine in detail how individual savants made decisions about the reality of meteorites and the social intelligence
  system which brought them the information which was the basis for these decisions.</p>
