<p> When the Prince of Tarsia first related to Tata how a stone had fallen from the air near the River Crati, Tata tells
  us</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>I had trouble containing the desire to laugh which came upon me at hearing the story related to me by this young
    cavalier with the most naive air of conviction. I only asked him if he could send me this stone from Calabria (where
    he had left it) and procure me a circumstantial report from the eye-witnesses to its fall</q> <span class="source"> Ibid., 16.</span>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> As we have seen, Tata was impressed by the receipt of the stone and the affidavit which accompanied it. Yet he did
  not publish his account until 1794 (39 years later), after another fall near Siena. His reasons are interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>Since that time, the Prince of San Severo and the Marquis Mauri often tried to persuade me to publish all the
    details; but other friends dissuaded me. They warned me that the savants and the half-savants (even more to be
    feared) would attack me on this subject or pretend to be gracious to me while treating me only with incredulity.
    These reasons decided me in favour of silence</q> <span class="source">Ibid., 23.</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Nor were these fears unjustified. The behaviour of Saint-Amand and Bertholon in regard to the Barbotan fall many
  decades later is only one of many similar reactions which took place during the controversy.</p>
<p> Part of the problem was the low status of many of the witnesses. The physicist Patrin, in evaluating the chemical
  analysis of Howard and de Bournon, noted that although many eminent persons had been involved in getting the stones to
  the chemists, the actual witnesses were not even named. He stated that '<q>it is easy to see that <em>this type of
    evidence</em> is not even a probability; because everybody knows that thousands of absurdities have been certified
    by thousands of witnesses of this nature</q>' <span class="source">E.-M.-L. Patrin, 'Considérations sur les Masses de Pierres et de Matières
  Métalliques qu'on Suppose Tombées de l'Atmosphère', JPCHN, Vol. 55 (1802),
376-93, at 379. (Emphasis in original.)</span>. The 'lightning-stones' previously brought forward had been one example
  of the credulity of the multitude. There was also the problem of optical illusions. The geologist DeLuc believed that
  the witness to the Wold Cottage fall had seen lightning striking a rock, giving rise to the belief that it descended
  with the lightning <span class="source">G. A. DeLuc, 'Sur la Masse de Fer de Sibérie, et sur les Pierres supposées
tombées de l'Atmosphère', Journal des Mines, Vol. 13 (1803), 92-107.</span>. He felt it was dangerous to treat such
  accounts seriously, because</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>It is thus that events badly seen and badly judged, of which volcanic phenomena above all demonstrate many
    examples, cause naturalists to err who, believing in the exactitude of the accounts, will form systems based on them
    which will be without foundation</q> <span class="source">Ibid., 106.</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Acceptance of this kind of data would short-circuit the quality control system which had taken so long to construct.
  The system could be protected only by rejecting data so difficult to check.</p>
<p> Another part of the problem was the intrinsic implausibility of what was alleged to happen. Where could the stones
  come from? Volcanoes and whirlwinds were suggested by some savants as possible agents, and others even went so far as
  to suggest that the stones might be formed in the air <span class="source">Izarn, op. cit. note 13; also Guettard in Pliny, op. cit. note 40; J. de La
  Lande, 'lettre de Jerome de la Lande au C. Delamétherie, sur les Pierres de Foudre',
JPCHN, Vol. 55 (1802), 451-53.</span>. Chladni suggested that their origin might be cosmic, but this was hardly any
  better, as far as the majority of the scientific community was concerned. One physicist suggested that even if one of
  the stones fell at his feet, he still would not believe it <span class="source">Chladni, op. cit. note 12, 9.</span>.
  Until Laplace and Biot suggested that they might have their origin in lunar volcanoes <span class="source">Biot, op. cit. note 25.</span>,
  none of the explanations seemed tenable. And probably what could not be explained, had never happened in the first
  place!</p>
<p> Freud makes a very apposite remark in his <em>New Introductory Lectures in Psychoanalysis</em>, where he contrasts
  two ways of treating an hypothesis. Suppose, he says, someone tells us that the centre of the earth is filled with
  carbonic acid. We might feel that this is improbable, but if they should show us a way of testing this hypothesis, we
  might indeed make the test. But now suppose they tell us that the centre of the earth is filled with jam. In this
  case, we would not even consider the idea. Instead, the focus of attention would be shifted, and '<q>we shall ask
    ourselves what sort of person this must be who can arrive at such a notion, or at most we shall ask him where he got
    it from</q>' <span class="source">S. Freud, trans. J. Strachey, The Complete Introductory Lectures in
Psychoanalysis (New York: Norton, 1966), 496.</span>. In many ways the meteorite witnesses and their champions were
  treated like persons who had put forward the jam theory. Instead of the meteorite hypothesis being seriously examined,
  attention was focussed on the way witnesses might have fallen into error, and great stress was laid on the 'true
  physicists' avoiding this error themselves <span class="source">See Fougeroux et al., op. cit. note 16, 251.</span>.
  More than once it was suggested that a 'love of the marvellous', very dangerous to science, lay behind the belief and
  interest in these accounts <span class="source"> Patrin, op. cit. note 60, 393; C. Barthold, 'Analyse de la Pierre de
Tonnerre', JPCHN, Vol. 50 (1800), 169-76, at 174.</span>. In this struggle against '<q>superstition</q>', ridicule was a
  very useful tool. Because of its employment, many persons (like Tata) hesitated to forward accounts ; others, like St&uuml;tz,
  put forward their hypotheses very reluctantly. Some waited until other reports were made before making their own <span
      class="note">'I never related this narrative and shewed the concreted substance to any persons
  (which I should not have done but that the subject was now agitating) ...' W.
Bingley, letter in Gentleman's Magazine, Vol. 60, Pt. 2 (1796), 727.</span>. Chladni, who daringly published his own
  conclusions in an unequivocal way, was attacked on many sides <span
      class="source">Chladni, op. cit. note 12, 8-9</span>. Ridicule was a most effective tool in the controversy;
  unfortunately, it was directed at the wrong object. There is no question in this case that it slowed the advance of
  science.</p>
