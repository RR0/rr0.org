<p>We might describe the routes by which information about alleged anomalies travels to savants as a 'social
  intelligence system'. Whereas some social scientists might view the meteorite controversy as a case of 'the resistance
  of scientists to scientific discovery' <span class="source">B. Barber, 'Resistance by Scientists to Scientific Discovery', in B. Barber
  and W. Hirsch (eds), The Sociology of Science (Glencoe, III.: Free Press, 1962),
539-56.</span>, I feel it would be more accurate to see it as an instance of the resistance of the scientific community
  to social intelligence about anomalies. Social intelligence about events which fall within accepted models of reality
  are not likely to encounter the same resistance that meteorites did. In regard to those which fall outside such
  accepted models, however, many scientists (both in the eighteenth century and today) would agree with Hume's feeling
  about miracles:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>The knavery and folly of men are such common phenomena, that I would rather believe the most extraordinary
    events to arise from their concurrence, than to admit of so signal a violation of the laws of nature</q> <span
      class="source">D. Hume, Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning
the Principles of Morals, 2nd edn. (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1962), 128.</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Polanyi has argued very cogently that it may be better to reject anomalous experimental data out of hand than
  carefully to refute them <span class="source">M. Polanyi, 'The Growth of Science in Society', Minerva, Vol. 5 (1967),
533-45.</span>. Often such data may be due to errors which are difficult to detect, and it may be better to ignore them,
  rather than to waste valuable scientific effort trying to prove them wrong. If such a course of action can be
  recommended with experiments by scientists, is not an equally strong course of action implied in confronting the
  uncontrolled experiences of non-scientists? Why should time be wasted in pursuing events that in all probability have
  not occurred, when tangible problems await solution?</p>
<p>But scientists' distrust of the social intelligence system is selective. While many scientists are willing to
  believe that non-scientists' reports of anomalous events are generally to be disregarded, they also believe that
  somehow the 'genuine' anomalous events <em>will</em> be successfully transmitted by the system. It follows from this
  principle that a lack of reports constitutes evidence that the anomaly does not exist. For instance, John Pringle, a
  Fellow of the Royal Society of London and later its President, stated in 1759 that it was his belief that meteors
  never fell to the ground:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>And here I would venture to affirm, that, after perusing all the accounts I could find of these phenomena, I
    have met with no well-vouched instance of such an event; nor is it to be imagined, but that, if these meteors had
    really fallen, there must have been long ago so strong evidence of the fact, as to leave no room to doubt of it at
    present</q> <span class="source">J. Pringle, 'Some Remarks upon the Several Accounts of the Fiery Meteor
  (Which Appeared on Sunday the 26th of November, 1758) and upon Other Such
  Bodies', Phil. Trans. Vol. 51, Pt. 1 (1760), 259-74, at 272.</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do not know what information Pringle used in coming to this decision, but one wonders if he knew of the
  observation by Henry Barham of a meteor striking into the earth in Jamaica about 1700 <span class="source">H. Barham, 'A letter of the curious Naturalist Mr Henry Barham, RSS to
  the publisher, giving a Relation of a Fiery Meteor seen by him in Jamaica, to strike
into the Earth', Phil. Trans., Vol. 30, No. 356 (May-June 1718), 837-38.</span>. This observation is all the more
  significant in that it had appeared in the <em>Philosophical Transactions</em> of the same Royal Society of which
  Pringle was a Fellow.</p>
<p>It must be recognized that the argument against the existence of many controversial anomalies is at least partly
  sociological. When it is argued that, 'if there really were such a thing as X, I would have heard about it by now',
  the person speaking is making assumptions not only about the physical properties of the anomaly, but also about the
  workings of this social intelligence system in regard to anomalous events. Scientists tend to assume that reporting is
  more complete than it often is. There are a number of reasons why this <em>fallacy of complete reporting</em> is in
  error. As an example we could consider the reporting of meteorite falls in the twentieth century. H. H. Nininger, who
  devoted most of his life to the search for meteorites, indicated that all three of the following estimates were often
  in error due to incomplete reporting and inadequate search:</p>
<ol>
  <li> the amount of material involved in a given fall;</li>
  <li> the number of falls in a given area;</li>
  <li> the overall weight of meteoritic matter falling upon the earth <span class="source">H. H. Nininger, Find a Falling Star (New York: Paul S. Eriksson, 1972),
  237-40.</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In one case the amount of matter involved in a Texas fall was revised upward from 68.2 pounds to 1500 pounds, a
  twenty-two fold increase <span class="source">Ibid., 237.</span>. Nininger also found that some finds were not
  reported to avoid ridicule and embarrassment <span class="source">Ibid., 30, 55-56.</span>. We have already seen that
  ridicule was effective in preventing the publication of some meteorite reports. What would have happened to Pringle's
  opinion if Tata's report had been printed in 1756 and Pringle had seen it?</p>
<p>A related problem is the fallacy of centrality. Many scientists seem to believe that if reports have been made, they
  personally would know of them. DeLuc's belief that alleged meteorite falls were actually optical illusions led him to
  suggest that where there are few stones, these optical illusions do not occur. In the Amazon region, where one can go
  for miles without having seen a stone, there are no meteorite reports: 'having no object which could give rise to such
  illusions, they are not produced' <span class="source">DeLuc, op. cit. note 61, 100.</span>. One wonders what he would
  have said if he had been aware of the discovery in 1784 of an enormous mass of 'native iron' standing isolated in a
  Brazilian coastal region <span class="source">Chladni, op. cit. note 12, 343.</span>. As with the Siberian mass found
  by Pallas, it was hard to see where this mass had come from, if not from the sky. And in fact this mass is a
  meteorite. But DeLuc did not know of this find, and it seems not to have been published until 1816.</p>
<p>Similarly, Charles Blagden in 1784 speculated on whether meteors might be some sort of terrestrial comets. He
  rejects this hypothesis, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>But such a crowd of revolving bodies could scarcely fail to announce their existence by some other means than
    merely a luminous train in the night; as, for instance, by meeting or justling sometimes near the earth, or by
    falling to the earth in consequence of various accidents ...</q> <span class="source">C. Blagden, 'An Account of some late fiery Meteors: with Observations',
Phil. Trans., Vol. 74 (1784), 201--32, at 223-24.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is apparently unaware of any accounts of stone-falls connected with meteors. Surely, he thinks, if such
  stone-falls had occurred, he would know of them. But they had occurred, and very recently, and he did not know of
  them.</p>
<p>Considering these mistaken assumptions, one might be tempted to see them as the result of arrogance and dogmatism.
  But this would be a mistake. For the presumption was, in fact, a very reasonable one. If events less anomalous had
  been involved, the savants probably would have heard about them; it was precisely the anomalous character of the
  events which made reporting about them so unsatisfactory. If witnesses and savants who wished to report falls had not
  been subject to incredulity and ridicule, knowledge about these falls would have been much more widely distributed. In
  this case, the presumption of non-existence served to prevent the transmission of information which would have
  indicated that meteorites did exist.</p>
