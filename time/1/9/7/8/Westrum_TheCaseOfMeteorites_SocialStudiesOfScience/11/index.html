<p> If the sociology of knowledge is of any use at all, it must demonstrate the social influences on beliefs. The
  meteorite controversy shows one case at least in which the social environment of the scientific community was very
  important in influencing scientific discovery. But it also puts social influences in proper perspective. The public
  knew of meteorite falls, but it did not understand them. Scientists had to be persuaded that meteorites fell; but only
  scientists could provide the necessary insight for their understanding. The meteorite case demonstrates the importance
  of social intelligence ; but the existence of large numbers of non-meteoric'thunderstones' should also indicate its
  potential dangers.</p>
<p> How much the meteorite case can be generalized to explain other cases of scientists' rejections of anomaly reports
  is an open question. Certainly the analogy of the meteorite case to UFOs and seaserpents is evident. But there are
  many other types of accepted former anomalies (like the mountain gorilla) or current hypothetical anomalies (like the
  Bigfoot or Sasquatch) which remain to be studied <span class="source">On the mountain gorilla, see B. Heuvelmans, On the Track of Unknown
  Animals (New York: Hill and Wang, 1959), 54-56; on the Bigfoot, see J. Napier,
  Bigfoot: The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality (London: Jonathan Cape,
1972).</span>. It is obvious that the acceptance of parapsychological events by the scientific community, for instance,
  presents some different problems (as well as some similar ones) to the anomalies studied so far <span class="source">See Collins (1976), op. cit. note 1; and also M. McVaugh and S. H.
  Mauskopf, 'J. B. Rhine's Extrasensory Perception and Its Background in Psychical
Research', Isis, Vol. 67 (June 1976), 161-89.</span>. Until more cases have been studied, our conclusions can be only
  tentative.</p>
<p> The meteorite controversy does indicate the need for a comprehension of the workings of social intelligence. As we
  have seen, the assumptions made by scientists about the process by which reports of anomalies reach them are often
  erroneous. Further details of this incomprehension are available from the two studies of my own already cited. Only
  with a realistic appreciation of how social intelligence about anomalies works can one expect to evaluate the kind of
  information one might be getting if an anomaly of such-and-such a kind exists. In particular, the problem posed by the
  suppression of reports and research on anomalies through ridicule needs to be considered before one decides that
  absence of information indicates lack of phenomena. On the other hand, the scientist can also make use of
  organizations dedicated to researching anomalies and the sometimes formidable amount of literature these societies
  make available <span class="note"> Two such societies are: The International Fortean Organization, 7317
  Baltimore Ave., College Park, Md. 20740, USA; and The Society for the Investigation
of the Unexplained, Columbia, NJ 07832, USA. Both publish periodicals.</span>. There is also the series of <em>Sourcebooks</em>
  edited by <a href="/people/c/CorlissWilliamR/index.html">William Corliss</a>, which has largely used scientific
  sources themselves for records of anomalous events <span class="source">W. Corliss, Strange Phenomena (2 Vols., 1974); Strange Artifacts, Vol. 1
  (1974), Strange Planet (1975); Strange Universe (1975); Strange Artifacts, Vol. 2
  (1976); Strange Minds (1976); Strange Life (1976). All privately published by Corliss
at Sourcebook Project, Glen Arm, Md. 21057, USA.</span>. The existence of these organizations and compilations of
  anomalous events represents a change in the parameters of the social intelligence process, since they both tend to
  increase the efficiency of transmission of information about anomalous events.</p>
<p> I would like to conclude by summarizing my basic argument. Individuals in any society are likely to experience
  events which current scientific doctrine holds to be impossible or implausible. Some of these experiences may
  represent encounters with phenomena that scientists would wish to study, if they could get information about them. But
  information about such events is transmitted to scientists in very unreliable and imperfect ways. Therefore it cannot
  be assumed that absence of reports implies an absence of experiences. For the 'stones falling from the sky' the
  opportunity to study a large number of reports proved to be very effective. Perhaps it would prove valuable in other
  cases as well.</p>
