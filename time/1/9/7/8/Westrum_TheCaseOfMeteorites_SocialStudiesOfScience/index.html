<p class="abstract">In making decisions about the reality of alleged anomalous events, scientists are likely to weigh
  both the a priori plausibility of what is alleged and the credibility of the reports which reach them. The present
  paper is an attempt to examine the anomaly reporting processes which led to the scientific recognition of the reality
  of meteorites in the eighteenth century. It is shown that scientists fail to make realistic assumptions about anomaly
  reporting, and that this failure affects the accuracy of the decisions made about anomalies. The treatment of reports
  about alleged anomalous events is further shown to be related to the scientific community's concerns about protecting
  its internal processes from external Interference. The recognition of meteorites took place only when the savants of
  the eighteenth century 1) found a way of evaluating the reports, 2) devised a theory to explain them, and 3) received
  unimpeachable eyewitness testimony of their occurrence.
</p>
<p> An under-explored area in the sociology of science is the process by which data from scientific observations or
  experiments come to be accepted as genuine. While historical material on controversies over data is abundant, there
  are relatively few studies which attempt to consider these cases in the light of a theoretical
  framework <span class="note">1. Discussions with my father, Professor Edgar F. Westrum, Jr, a physical
  chemist, have convinced me of the importance of data quality control for the practising
  scientist. The work of Harry Collins in this regard is very suggestive. See his 'The Seven Sexes: A Study in the Sociology of a Phenomenon, or the Replication of
  Experiments in Physics', Sociology, Vol. 9, No. 2 (May 1975), 205-24, and also his 'Upon the Replication of Scientific Findings: A Discussion Illuminated by the Experiences
of Researchers into Parapsychology', mimeo, in Proceedings of the First
International Conference of the Society for Social Studies of Science, Cornell
University (4-6 November 1976). See also G. N. Gilbert, 'The Transformation of
Research Findings into Scientific Knowledge', Social Studies of Science, Vol. 6,
Nos. 3 and 4 (September 1976), 281-306.</span>. Even less studied, however, are those cases in which data originating
  outside the scientific community have become accepted within it. The control of the boundary between the institution
  of science and other parts of society by the acceptance or rejection of observations from outside the scientific
  community is nonetheless critical for the autonomy of science, and for social control within it. What I intend to do
  here is to examine this problem posed in its most extreme form: the response of the scientific community to reports
  from non-scientists of hypothetical anomalies <span class="note"> The type of anomalous events I am interested in here are not the same as the 'anomalies' which operate in Kuhn's theory of scientific revolutions. (See T. Kuhn,
The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 2nd edn. [Chicago: The University of
Chicago Press, 1970].) They do not necessarily pose problems for scientific theory,
and unlike the anomalies with which Kuhn is concerned, it is the existence of these
anomalies which is controversial, not their interpretation. I have considered several
alternative designations for these events, but none, including 'occult', 'controversial',
and 'hypothetical', is really satisfactory. Nonetheless, it is evident that UFOs,
sea-serpents, ghosts, psychic events, and abominable snowmen all share a common
intellectual situation in that 'witnesses' allege to have seen them, while scientists
firmly deny that they exist. Charles Fort referred to them as 'damned' data because
of their scientifically unacceptable character in terms of current 'dominants'
(paradigms). See The Book of the Damned, in T. Thayer (ed.), The Books of
Charles Fort (New York: Henry Holt, 1941). Again, however, it is often scientific
intuitions which are offended by these events, rather than scientific theory.</span>. In two previous papers on
  Unidentified Flying Objects and seaserpents <span class="note">R. Westrum, 'Social Intelligence About Anomalies: The Case of Unidentified
  Flying Objects', Social Studies of Science, Vol. 7, No. 3 (August 1977), 271-302, and 'Knowledge about Sea-Serpents', in R. Wallis (ed.), Sociological Review
Monographs, special number of 'Rejected Knowledge' (forthcoming, 1979).</span> I explored the way in which accounts of
  these hypothetical events reach the scientific community, and how these reports are considered within it. But both of
  these studies dealt with objects at best hypothetical, and possibly imaginary <span class="note">G. Maxwell argues very cogently that 'theoretical entity' is not a useful concept
  in his 'The Ontological Status of Theoretical Entities', in H. Feigl and G. Maxwell
  (eds), Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Vol. III (Minneapolis:
  University of Minnesota Press, 1962), 3-27. Discussion of this point is outside the
scope of this article.</span>. How would the scientific community respond in the case of a 'real' anomaly? Would
  information be treated in the same way? To find a partial answer to this question I will examine a case which has
  become a classic one in the history of science: the meteorite controversy of the eighteenth century.
</p>
<p> The choice of the meteorite controversy might be criticized on a number of grounds, the most obvious of which is
  that the term, 'the scientific community', refers to different entities in the eighteenth and twentieth centuries.
  This criticism has considerable face validity. After much study of the meteorite case, however, I am even more
  convinced of its relevance to other anomalies than I was when I began. Study of the meteorite case, in conjunction
  with those of UFOs and sea-serpents, shows suggestive, although far from exact, parallels between the three
  controversies.
</p>
<p> There is, however, a closely related reason why the meteorite controversy ought to be examined from the point of
  view of the sociology of knowledge. Savants' <span class="note">I have used 'savant' in preference to other terms as the one in most common
  use at the time in France to designate the people we now refer to as 'scientists'; the
  most common British term at the time seems to have been 'philosopher'. Both of
  these terms, however, were also used to designate non-scientists. It is ironic that
words for the individual specialties were in common use while there was no term to
describe scientists in general. See S. Ross, 'Scientist: The Story of a Word', Annals
of Science, Vol. 18, No. 2 (June 1962), 65-85.</span> rejection of meteorites has now become part of the rhetoric used
  by anomaly advocates to argue that the resistance of scientists to accepting UFO or sea-serpent reports is not based
  on adequate reasons, but is simply characteristic of scientific resistance to new ideas <span class="note"> The classical expression of this view is that of Charles Fort. See Fort, op. cit.
  note 2, 19-21. See also A. C. Oudemans, The Great Sea Serpent (Leiden: E. J. Brill,
1892), ix-x.</span>. Anomaly critics have used the controversy in turn to argue that the evidence for meteorites and
  UFOs is very different, and that in fact the cases are very far apart <span class="note">P. Morrison, 'The Nature of Scientific Evidence: A Summary', in C. Sagan
  and T. Page (eds), UFOs ― A Scientific Debate (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University
Press, 1972), 276-90.</span>. Secondary sources on the controversy are often inaccurate, leading some individuals into
  making erroneous statements about it <span class="note">For instance, the information on meteorites in D. H. Menzel, 'Case Against
UFOs', Physics Today (June 1976), 13-15, is inaccurate.</span>. It is important to get the facts in the meteorite case
  right, if only for purposes of comparison.
</p>
<p> The controversy took place during the last years of the eighteenth century and the first years of the nineteenth
  century. In one sense the controversy began with a formal rejection of three meteoritic stones by the French Academy
  of Sciences in 1772. But the true debate did not begin until 1794, when the German physicist Chladni published a small
  book advocating the reality of meteorites <span class="note"> E. F. F. Chladni, Uber den Ursprung der von Pallas gefundenen und anderer
  ihr ahnlicher Eisenmassen, und uber einige damit in Verbindung stehende
Naturscheinungen (Riga: J. F. Hartknoch, 1794).</span>. In the same year a widely-publicized fall took place in Siena,
  Italy <span class="note">D. Tata, Memoria sulla Pioggia di Pietre (Naples: Nobile and Co., 1794).</span>. The response
  to both these events was generally negative <span class="note">See Leman, article on 'Pierres meteoriques', in the Dictionnaire d'Histoire
Naturelle (Pans, 1818), 237-83, at 248.</span>. Chladni and other advocates of the reality of meteorites were under
  constant attack on the grounds that their ideas offended either theology or the ideas of the
  Enlightenment <span class="note">E. F. F. Chladni, über Feuermeteore und uber die mit denselben
  herabgefallenen Massen (Vienna: J. B. Huebner, 1819), 9-10. Chladni would not
  even publish the names of other physicists who agreed with him, for fear their
reputation might be harmed.</span>. At the turn of the century, however, with more falls having been reported, the
  general attitude changed from outright denial to uncertainty. After 1803 the reality of meteorites became generally
  accepted.
</p>
<p> The last comprehensive histories of the meteorite controversy were written in the early nineteenth
  century <span class="note">13. The best general overview of the meteorite controversy is still M.P.M.S.
  Bigot de Morogues, Mémoire Historique et Physique sur la Chute des Pierres
  Tombées sur la Surface de la Terre à Divers époques (Orléans: Jacob Ainé, 1812).
  Many of the relevant documents are given in J. Izarn, Pierres Tombées du Ciel ou
Lithologie Atmosphèrique (Paris: Delalain Fils, 1803).</span>. Although there have been some recent short
  treatments <span class="source">D. W. Sears, 'Sketches in the History of Meteoritics, 1: The Birth of the
  Science', Meteoritics, Vol. 10, No. 3 (1975), 215-26; P. M. Sears, 'Notes on the
  Beginnings of Modern Meteoritics', ibid., Vol. 2, No. 4 (1965), 293-99; G. R. Levi-Donati 'La Polemica sulla "piogetta di sassi" del 1794', Physis, Vol. 17 (1975),
94-111.</span> which give the outline and important details of some aspects of the controversy, these articles have not
  dealt with the broader issues in the sociology of knowledge to which the meteorite controversy is relevant. These
  issues will be the focus of this study.
</p>
<p> It is often suggested that the reason that scientists reject reports of anomalies is that they consider these things
  to be implausible for a priori theoretical reasons. Perhaps this is a complete explanation in some cases (ghosts, for
  example). I would like to argue in what follows, however, that a major factor in the rejection of the existence of
  such anomalies is the quantity and quality of reports about them which reach scientists. If reports (or their relative
  absence) are indeed important in scientists' rejection of anomalies, then we ought to investigate the way in which
  reports from alleged anomaly percipients reach (or don't reach) scientists. I would like to suggest that only by
  understanding the social intelligence system which transmits these reports - and, in particular, <em>how scientists
    regard its processes</em> - can we truly comprehend scientists' opinions about anomalies like UFOs, sea serpents,
  and (in the eighteenth century) meteorites. As we will see, the rejection of these anomalies takes place on
  sociological as well as scientific grounds. Hence our concern here will be to examine the validity of the sociological
  premises on which this rejection is based.
