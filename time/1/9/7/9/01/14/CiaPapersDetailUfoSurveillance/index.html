    Real'</p>
    <p class="Mini">Special to the New York Times </p>
    <p>PHOENIX, Jan. 13- Documents obtained in a lawsuit against the Central Intelligence Agency show that the agency is
      secretly involved in the surveillance of unidentified flying objects and has been since 1949, an Arizona based
      U.F.O. group said yesterday.</p>
    <p>The C.I.A. has repeatedly said that it investigated and closed its books on U.F.O.'s during 1952, according to
      Ground Saucer Watch, a nation-wide research organization of about 500 scientists, engineers and others who seek to
      scientifically prove or disprove the existence of U.F.O.'s, but 1,000 pages of documents obtained under a freedom
      of information suit, show "the Government has been lying to us all these years," it said.</p>
    <p>"After reviewing the documents, Ground Saucer Watch believes that U.F.O.'s do exist, they are real, the U.S.
      Government has been totally untruthful and the cover-up is massive," William Spaulding, head of the group,
      said. </p>
    <h2>Embassies Gather Information
    </h2>
    <p>Mr. Spaulding, an aerospace engineer with AiResearch, one of the largest producers of aerospace components, said
      the documents show the United States embassies are used to help gather information on U.F.O. sightings and that
      the information "seems to be directed to the C.I.A., the White House and the National Security Agency."</p>
    <p>A C.I.A. memo of Aug. 1, 1952, recommends continued agency surveillance of "flying saucers," saying, "it is
      strongly urged, however, that no indication of C.I.A. interest or concern reach the press or public, in view of
      their probably alarmist tendencies to accept such interest as 'confirmatory' of the soundness of 'unpublished
      facts' in the hands of the U.S. government," the document said.</p>
    <p>Among the documents are several detailed reports of Air Force attempts to either intercept or destroy
      U.F.O.'s.</p>
    <p>In a 1976 incident in Iran, one report says, two F-4 Phantom jet fighters pursued a large U.F.O. that seemed to
      send out smaller craft. One of their smaller craft "headed straight toward the F-4 at a very fast rate of speed,"
      the report said. "The pilot attempted to fire an Aim-9 missile at the object but at that instant his weapons
      control panel went off and he lost all communications." The pilot eluded the craft, then watched as it "returned
      to the primary object for a perfect rejoin," the report continued.</p>
    <h2>Concern About Russian Aims</h2>
    <p>A major point of concern, a C.I.A. document of Oct. 2, 1952, shows, is that U.F.O. sightings could mask Russian
      air attacks, or "psychological warfare." The report to the director of Central Intelligence from the assistant
      director for the Office of Scientific Intelligence recommends the the National Security Council be advised of the
      "implications of the flying saucer problem"; that the matter be discussed with the Psychological Strategy Board,
      and that the C.I.A. help "develop a policy of public information which will minimize concern and possible panic
      resulting from the numerous sightings of unidentified objects."</p>
    <p>A document dated November 1975, directs against acknowledging any pattern in sightings. "Unless there is evidence
      which links sightings, or unless media queries link sightings, queries can best be handled individually at the
      source and as questions arise," it said. "Response should be direct, forthright and emphasize that the action
      taken was in response to an isolated or specific incident." Mr. Spaulding says the documents show that there are
      links and patterns in the sightings. From that evidence, he says, he believes U.F.O.'s are here on surveillance
      missions.</p>
    <p>"We find a concentration of sightings around our military installations, research development areas," he said. "
      The U.F.O. phenomenon is following what our own astronauts are doing on other planets- we send a scoutship, we
      take soil samples and then we land."
    </p>
    <h2>Another Suit Pending</h2>
    <p>Mr. Spaulding said he has sworn statements from retired Air Force colonels that at least two U.F.O.'s have
      crashed landed and have been recovered by the Air Force.</p>
    <p>One crash, he said, was in Mexico in 1948 and the other was near Kingman, Ariz., in 1953. He said the retired
      officers claimed they got a glimpse of dead aliens who were in both cases about four feet tall with silverish
      complexions and wearing silver outfits that "seemed fused to the body from the heat."</p>
    <p>Mr. Spaulding said his group is waiting for a Federal Judge to rule on the last phase of its C.I.A. suit, which
      seeks access to 57 items that would provide "hard evidence" of U.F.O.'s or "retrievals of the third kind." That
      evidence includes motion pictures, gun camera film and residue from landings, he said.</p>
    <p>Among the films they want is 40 to 48 frames taken in 1952 by Ralph Mayher, then a cameraman for KYW-TV in
      Cleveland and now a member of Ground Saucer Watch. The Air Force borrowed the film in 1957 and has never returned
      it. The official finding was that the object was a meteor, Mr. Spaulding said.</p>
    <p>"We're past the story-telling stage," Mr. Spaulding said. "We have to have it in black and white to satisfy the
      scientific community. We have to establish the existence of the object to all the people in Missouri and then
      figure out who's driving it."</p>
