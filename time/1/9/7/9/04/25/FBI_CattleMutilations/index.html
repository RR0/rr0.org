<p>On April 20, 1979, a conference was held at the Albuquerque Public Library at Albuquerque, New Mexico. This
  conference was chaired by Senator Harrison Schmitt, Republican, New Mexico, and United States Attorney R. E. Thompson
  of Albuquerque. The conference convened at 9:00 a.m. The morning session was attended by representatives from various
  law enforcement agencies, news media representatives, and the general public. Approximately 180 persons attended the
  conference during the morning session. This session lasted until approximately 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>Senator Schmitt opened the conference by explaining its purpose. He said, "This hearing is to define the scope of the
  problem and the basis for federal assistance and to examine how the <a href="/org/us/ic/fbi/index.html">FBI</a> might
  be involved." U.S. Attorney R. E. Thompson explained to those attending the conference that federal jurisdiction for
  investigations conducted by the <a href="/org/us/ic/fbi/index.html">FBI</a> is limited to those areas approved by
  Congress. U.S. Attorney Thompson said there is a possible violation of a federal statute requiring that aircraft be
  appropriately marked and identified. He explained that this statute might possibly have been violated because of
  reports that the unidentified aircraft have been observed in the area of cattle mutilations.</p>
<p>Senator Schmitt explained that his staff and others have searched the federal statutes and have concluded there is
  possible federal jurisdiction under Title 18, U.S. Code, Sections 7 and 13, having to do with violations of state law
  of Indian or federal lands. Senator Schmitt expressed his hope that the FBI could conduct investigation into the
  cattle mutilations under these statutes. Senator Schmitt stated to the conference that the FBI would coordinate the
  investigation of cattle mutilations. </p>

<p>Forest S. Putman, Special Agent in Charge (SAC), Albuquerque Office of the FBI, explained to the conference that the
  Justice Department had given the FBI authority to investigate those cattle mutilations which have occured or might
  occur on Indian lands. He further explained that the Albuquerque FBI would look at such mutilations in connection with
  mutilations occuring off Indian lands for the purpose of comparison and control, especially where the same methods of
  operation are noted. SAC Putman said that in order for this matter to be resolved, the facts surrounding such
  mutilations should be gathered and computerized. </p>
<p>District Attorney Eloy Martinez, Santa Fe, New Mexico, told the conference that his judicial district had made
  application for a $50,000 Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) Grant for the purpose of investigating the
  cattle mutilations. He explained that there is hope that with the funds from this grant, an investigative unit can be
  established for the sole purpose of resolving the mutilation problem. He said it is his view that such an
  investigative unit could serve as a headquarters for all law enforcement officials investigating the mutilations and,
  in particular, would serve as a repository for information developed in order that this information could coordinate
  properly. He said such a unit would not only coordinate this information, but also handle submissions to a qualified
  lab for both evidence and photographs. Mr. Martinez said a hearing will be held on April 24, 1979, for the purpose of
  determining whether this grant will be approved.</p>
<p>Gabe Valdez, New Mexico State Police, Dulce, New Mexico, reported he has investigated the death of 90 cattle during
  the past three years, as well as six horses. Officer Valdez said he is convinced that the mutilations of the animals
  have not been the work of predators because of the precise manner of the cuts.</p>
<p>Officer Valdez said he had investigated mutilations of several animals which had occured on the ranch of Manuel Gomez
  of Dulce, New Mexico.</p>
<p>Manuel Gomez addressed the conference and explained he had lost six animals to unexplained deaths which were found in
  a mutilated condition within the last two years. Further, Gomez said that he and his family are experiencing fear and
  mental anguish because of the mutilations. </p>

<p>David Perkins, Director of the Department of Research at Libre School in Farasita, Colorado, exhibited a map of the
  United States which contained hundreds of colored pins identifying mutilation sites. He commented that he had been
  making a systematic collection of data since 1975, and had never met a greater challenge. He said, "The only thing
  that makes sense about the mutilations is that they make non sense at all."</p>
<p>Tom Adams of Paris Texas, who has been independently examining mutilations for six years, said his investigation has
  shown that helicopters are almost always observed in the area of the mutilations. He said that the helicopters do not
  have identifying markings and they fly at abnormal, unsafe, or illegal altitudes.</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Van Arsdale, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Department of Anthropology, University of Denver, suggested that
  those investigating the cattle mutilations take a systematic approach and look at all types of evidence is discounting
  any of the propounded theories such as responsibility by extraterrestrial visitors or Satanic cults.</p>
<p>Richard Sigismund, Social Scientist, Boulder, Colorado, presented an argument which advanced the theory that the
  cattle mutilations are possibly related to activity of UFOs. Numerous other persons made similar type presentations
  expounding on their theories regarding the possibility that the mutilations are the responsibility of extraterrestrial
  visitors, members of Satanic Cults, or some unknown government agency.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Prine, Forensic Veterinarian, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL), Los Alamos, New Mexico, discounted
  the possibility that the mutilations have been done by anything but predators. He said he had examined six carcasses
  and in his opinion predators were responsible for the mutilation of all six.</p>
<p>Dr. Claire Hibbs, a representative of the State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, New Mexico State University, Las
  Cruces, New Mexico, said he recently came to New Mexico, but that prior to that he examined some mutilation findings
  in Kansas and Nebraska. Dr. Hibbs said the mutilations fell into three categories: animals killed and mutilated by
  predators and scavengers, animals mutilated after death by "sharp instruments" and animals mutilated by
  pranksters. </p>

<p>Tommy Bland, Lewisville, Texas, told the conference he has been studying UFO activities for twenty-two years and
  mutilations for twelve years. He explained that animal mutilations date back to the early 1800's in England and
  Scotland. He also pointed out that animal mutilations are not confined to cattle, but cited incidents of mutilation of
  horses, dogs, sheep, and rabbits. He also said that the mutilations are not only nationwide, but international in
  scope. </p>
<p>Other speakers at the conference suggested ways of approaching an investigation into the mutilations, urging access
  to technological equipment and technologically trained individuals.</p>
<p>Chief Raleigh Tafoya, Jicarilla Apache Tribe, and Walter Dasheno, Governor, Santa Clara Pueblo, each spoke briefly to
  the conference. Both spoke of the cattle which has been found mutilated on their respective Indian lands. Governor
  Dasheno said he is concerned as to the extent of the jurisdiction by investigating agencies into the matter and Chief
  Tafoya said some of his people who have lost livestock have been threatened. He did not elaborate on these
  threats.</p>
<p>Carl W. Whiteside, Investigator, Colorado Bureau of Investigation, told the conference that between April and
  December, 1975, his Bureau investigated 203 reports of cattle mutilations. He said in addition his Bureau conducted an
  undercover investigation in an attempt to resolve the mutilation problem. He said during the investigation by his
  Bureau, numerous pieces of evidence were submitted to the Colorado State University Large Animal Hospital and all
  civilian and military helicopter flights were monitored during this probe. Whiteside said, "Sadly, most of these
  efforts produced no results." He said they were unable to place any unidentified vehicle in the air or on the ground
  near the carcasses that were found. He said his group submitted 35 carcasses to the laboratory for examination. Only
  19 of those submitted were deemed to be of recent enough vintage to make an examination and of those 19, nine were
  determined to be willful mutilations. He said of those nine, it was concluded that two were done by pranksters.
  Whiteside said that his organization even set up a secret witness program with the cooperation of the "Denver Post",
  but this resulted in no information to assist in a solution to the matter. </p>

<p>During the afternoon of April 20, 1979, law enforcement officers met with U.S. Attorney R. E. Thompson for a special
  meeting. At this conference were representatives from the FBI and numerous state law enforcement officers from New
  Mexico. Also in attendance were investigators from Nebraska, Colorado, Montana and Arkansas. During the conference
  emphasis was placed on an attempt to determine the most appropriate way of approaching the solution of the cattle
  mutilations. The officials decided that direction for the investigation should be the responsibility of one of three
  agencies — the FBI, the District Attorney's Office in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which has applied for the LEAA Grant, or
  the New Mexico State Police. U.S. Attorney Thompson concluded the within the next two weeks a determination would be
  made which of the three agencies would be the primary investigative group and the agency's responsibility for the
  collection of data regarding the mutilations. U.S. Attorney Thomson pointed out that the FBI would have to receive
  approval from Washington, District Attorney Martinez' group would have to receive the LEAA Grant and the New Mexico
  State Police would have to obtain clearance from its headquarters.</p>
<p>During this session of the conference, investigators from Arkansas pointed out that they have examined 28 cases of
  cattle mutilations and it is their conclusion that all cases were the work of intentional mutilators and not of
  predators. The examination of carcasses submitted by their investigators have been done by the Oklahoma State
  University Forensic Lab.</p>
<p>The investigator present at the conference from Montana expressed his opinion that carcasses found in Montana were
  also mutilated by deliberate efforts and not by predators.</p>
<p>All investigators present during this session recommended that there be a central collection unit which could
  coordinate information from all areas. Also, all investigators recommended that a standard procedure and from be
  adopted for the investigation of future mutilations. They recommended that evidence be examined by a qualified
  veterinary pathologist. </p>
