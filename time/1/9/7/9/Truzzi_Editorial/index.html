<p>Statistics has long recognized that there are two types of error. Type I error consists of mistakenly thinking
  that something special is happening when it is not. But Type II error consists of thinking nothing special is
  happening when something actually is. Most scientists are concerned with avoiding Type I rather than Type II errors.
  Important exceptions exist when the search is made for something especially important, e.g., a cure for a disease.
  Then concern shifts to the fear of missing something that may prove quite significant. Similar reasoning exists
  throughout science but is of particular importance for any discussion of the paranormal. The critics, in general, do
  not want to make a Type I error and recognize a false anomaly. But most proponents think the anomalies are of such
  importance and theoretical consequence that they fear missing an important extraordinary event. ZETETIC SCHOLAR,
  unlike most critical journals dealing with the paranormal, will try to be equally concerned about avoiding both Type I
  and Type II errors. Science needs to be concerned with both. In fact, the difficulty of being concerned about both is
  probably at the heart of what Thomas S. Kuhn has called the "essential tension" present in science's need to be both
  conservative and open to change.</p>
<p>ZETETIC SCHOLAR continues to grow but very much needs your support. For most of you, this issue ends your
  subscription. Your renewal is urgently needed.</p>
<p>Because of increased printing and postal costs, ZS will now publish only two issues per year. However, these will be
  larger than those planned when I hoped to issue three times per year. So, subscribers should get as much as they
  expected. Since ZS remains essentially a one-man operation, less frequent mailings should also give me more time to
  put together symposia and initiate the dialogues that I hope will become the central feature of this journal.</p>
<p>This issue includes two substantial dialogues on the theories of Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky and on the scientific state
  of evidence for astrology. As with all materials in ZS, readers are invited to send in their views and reactions.</p>
<p>ZS remains a labor of love, and readers should realize that its attraction will only be for a relatively small group
  of those interested in responsible, nonsensationalistic, concern for serious scientific evaluation of claims of the
  paranormal. ZS does not represent either a crusade or an inquisition. Our subscribers will probably never number over
  a few hundred. So if you believe in what ZS represents, your support is badly needed. Since ZS loses money, its future
  must remain uncertain. We need about 500 subscribers to break even, so your renewals and your proselytizing on our
  behalf would be appreciated.</p>
