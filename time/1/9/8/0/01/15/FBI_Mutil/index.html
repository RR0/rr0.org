<p>United States Department of Justice</p>
<p>Federal Bureau of Investigation<br> Albuquerque, New Mexico <br> January 15, 1980</p>
<p>By communication from FBIHQ dated <time>1979-03-05</time>, the FBI Albuquerque Office, was instructed to conduct
  investigation into the mutilation of animals occuring on Indian Lands in New Mexico. This instruction was based on a
  memorandum dated <time>1979-03-02</time>, from the Department of Justice to FBIHQ, which authorized such investigation
  .</p>
<p>On <time>1979-04-20</time>, a conference on livestock mutilations was convened in Albuquerque by Senator Harisson
  Schmitt of New Mexico, and the U.S. Attorney for New Mexico, R. E. Thompson. This conference was attended by law
  enforcement investigators from several states, FBI representatives, other interested parties, and the press.
  Approximately 180 persons were in attendance. Near the conclusion of the conference, it was reported by the District
  Attorney in Santa Fe, New Mexico, that a Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) grant had been applied for
  to provide funds for a special investigative unit to investigate cattle mutilations. Subsequently, it was announced
  that the LEAA grant had been made, and that a special investigative unit for this purpose had been set up under the
  auspices of the New Mexico State District Attorney in Santa Fe. Former FBI Agent Kenneth M. Rommel was appointed to
  head up the unit.</p>

<p>Investigation by the Albuquerque FBI Office determined that there had been reports of dead animals from both the
  Santa Clara Reservation and the Jicarilla Apache Reservation in New Mexico. Discussions with Gerald Hill, Bureau of
  Indian Affairs Criminal Investigator, Pojoaque, New Mexico, regarding the dead cattle which had been reported on the
  Santa Clara Reservation by members of the Santa Clara Tribe disclosed that these reports were in 1978. There was no
  evidence to cause it to be determined that the animals had been mutilated, and Investigator Hill did not make a
  complete investigation of the matter, nor collect any evidence for examination. Subsequent discussions with Raleigh
  Tafoya, Chief of Police, Jicarilla Apache Tribe, disclosed similar information, i.e. the reports of unexplained dead
  animals were in 1978, and although they were surrounded by suspicious circumstances, there was no evidence to
  positively determine that the animals had been mutilated. In neither case had evidence been preserved for examination,
  nor were there any complete reports of investigation done regarding the deaths.</p>
<p>The Albuquerque FBI Office discussed the possibility of <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MutilationsBetail">animal mutilations</a> with law enforcement officers in
  New Mexico, including Mel Sedillo, Jr., Investigator, New Mexico Livestock Board, Albuquerque, New Mexico, who has
  examined numerous animals said which had been reported as being mutilated. Investigator Sedillo said that in each
  instance his examination showed that the animals had been attacked by predators.</p>
<p>Since the conference of <time>1979-04-20</time>, the Albuquerque FBI Office has received a voluminous amount of
  correspondence from interested parties who have expounded their theories regarding this subject. Copies of this
  information have been furnished to Kenneth M. Rommel for his assistance.</p>
<p>On <time>1980-01-15</time>, Kenneth M. Rommel advised his office has pursued numerous investigative leads regarding
  the possible mutilation of animals in New Mexico. He said that to date, his investigative unit has determined that
  none of the reported cases has involved what appear to be mutilations by other than common predators. Rommel said he
  has travelled to other states and conferred with investigators in those areas regarding mutilations, and to date has
  received no information which would justify the belief that any animals have been intentionally mutilated by human
  beings. Rommel added that regarding all the dead animals he has examined, the damage to the carcasses has always been
  consistent with predator action.</p>

<p>The Albuquerque FBI Office has alerted law enforcement officials who have juridiction over Indian lands in New Mexico
  concerning the March 6, 1979 authorization for the Albuquerque FBI Office to investigate the mutilation of animals on
  Indian lands in New Mexico. There law enforcement officials have advised that they would immediately notify the
  Albuquerque FBI Office in the event there are any new occurences of suspected animal mutilations on Indian lands.</p>
<p>On <time>1980-01-15</time>, this matter was discussed with Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard J. Smith, U.S. Attorney's
  Office, Albuquerque. Assistant U.S. Attorney Smith said that in his opinion there is no Federal interest in continuing
  an investigation in this matter in the absence of further reports of acts of suspected mutilation of animals on Indian
  lands in New Mexico. </p>
