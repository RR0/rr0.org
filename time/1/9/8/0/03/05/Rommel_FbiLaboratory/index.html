<p>Office of the District Attorney <br> First Judical District</p>
<p>Animal Mutilation Project</p>
<p>Directeur<br> Federal Bureau of Investigation<br> J. Edgar Hoover Building<br> Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Attention: FBI Laboratory </p>
<p>Gentlemen:</p>
<p>For background information, I refer to your Albuquerque origin matter entitled as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="../../../01/15/FBI_Mutil/index.html">Mutilations of Animals on Indian Lands in New Mexico — Crime on
    Indian Reservation. </a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enclosed for examination is one viel containing several flakes of an unknown material which this office would like to
  have identified in connection with an official investigation. </p>
<p>For your information, since approximately 1975, New Mexico and other states, primarily those located in close
  proximity to New Mexico, have had incidents referred to by many as "the cattle mutilation phenomena". Stock animals,
  primarily cattle, have been found dead with various parts of the carcass missing such as one eye, one ear, the udder,
  and normally a cored anus. Most credible sources have attributed this damage to normal predator and scavenger
  activity. However, certain segments of the population have attributed the damage to many other causes ranging from
  UFOs to a giant governmental conspiracy, the exact nature of which is never fully explained. No factual data has been
  supplied supporting these theories. </p>
<p>In May, 1979, responding to pressure from his constituents, the District Attorney, First Judicial District of New
  Mexico, applied for and was awarded a one year L.E.A.A. grant to investigate these mutilations. </p>
<p>I retired after twenty-eight years as a special agent of the FBI to direct this investigation. </p>
<p>As previously stated, there are those that have attempted to make a connection between cattle mutilations and UFO
  sightings. </p>
<p>In July, 1978, a UFO was reportedly observed by a resident of Taos New Mexico, reportedly hovering over a pickup
  truck. The next morning, the enclosed powder flakes were reportedly recovered from the roof of the aforementioned
  pickup. </p>
<p>Some of the individuals that are most vocal to the media have inferred that these flakes are identical with a
  substance that was taken from cowhides in a controlled test conducted in the Dulce, New Mexico area. </p>
<p>Dulce, New Mexico, which has been the site of several reported mutilations, is located approximately seventy miles
  from Taos, New Mexico. I have not been able to locate a sample of the substance reportedly collected in the Dulce
  test, but it has been described as a florescent material. </p>
<p>I have, to-date, [not ?] been able to confirm any connection between these two substances, and have been told by
  those that have seen both that they are not identical. </p>
<p>However, I would appreciate it if through the use of a G. G. Mass spectroscopy test or any other logical test, that
  these flakes can be identified. This in itself would go a long way of assisting me to discredit the UFO - Cow
  Mutilation association theory.</p>
<p>If need be, the flakes can be destroyed during your examination.</p>
<p>Your coopération in this investigation is appreciated. </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
