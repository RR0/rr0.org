<p>Maccabee [1] has claimed that conventional sources were ruled out as possible explanations for the observations and
  filming of a very intense (10^5-10^6-cd) light source from an airplane that was flying east of the South Island of New
  Zealand on 31 Dec. 1978 between 2:19 a.m. and 2:33 a.m. local time. Ireland and Andrews [2] have suggested that the
  light actually came from a squid fishing boat that would have been fishing ~60 km north-northeast of Christchurch. In
  support of this explanation they have pointed out that a large squid fleet was in New Zealand waters at the time and
  that one of these boats "could have passed the site in question." Their information on the known locations of squid
  boats (several hundred kilometers east of and several kilometers north and west of the South Island) came from the New
  Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries; these boats also showed up on satellite imagery [3]. Squid boats
  maintain fixed locations while fishing. According to a more recent paper by Ireland [4], these locations are reported
  to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. However, ministry records failed to show any boats in the vicinity of
  the sighting area [4]. Furthermore, according to freighter aircraft pilots who have flown over the area in question
  for many years, squid boats have not been seen fishing in the Pegasus Bay, which is the body of water northeast of
  Christchurch where the hypothetical boat would have been. Since there is a lack of independent evidence for the
  existence of a squid boat at the location in question, the proof - or disproof - of the squid boat hypothesis must be
  based on information collected by the witnesses during the sighting. </p>
<p>When the plane was ~70 km from Christchurch, the pilot turned to the right. According to the witnesses (other than
  the pilot, who could not see the light from his left-hand seat because the depression angle of the line of sight was
  too great), the line of sight immediately after the turn was within 20 degrees of straight ahead. Ireland and Andrews
  claim that the turn angle was ~120 degrees to the right, which would be reasonably consistent with what would be
  expected if the plane turned toward a stationary light (e.g., squid boat). However, this amount of turning is
  contradicted by the explicit statement of the captain [3] that he turned from 033 magnetic to 125 magnetic [5] or 92
  degrees. The more correct path of the aircraft is illustrated in Fig. 1. The figure illustrates two other modifcations
  [6] in the information of Refs. 1, 2, and 3: (a) the radar detections began within 20 sec of the initial visual
  sighting, rather than 3 min later as previously reported, and (b) the target went off the aircraft radarscope at ~60
  degrees to the right rather than 50 degrees (the 63 degree angle on Fig. 1 is drawn to the center of the radar blip,
  estimated to be 6 degrees wide) [7]. Figure 1 also illustrates the estimated visual sighting directions after the
  target went off radar. These directions are estimated from witness statements made during the fiight (tape recordings
  and handwritten notes) and during extensive interviews after the flight. </p>
<p><img alt="Approximate flight path of aircraft" src="../../../../../../../Documents/Articles/optics3.gif"><b>Fig. 1.
  Approximate flight path of aircraft. Sector A indicates uncertainties in the remembered radar distance and
  radar/visual azimuth angte when the object was first seen. The vertical arrows through sector H indicate an added
  uncertainty in the time at which the radar target went off the scope, here estimated to be 5 min after the first
  sighting. Line C indicates the position of the plane and azimuth of the object as recorded by the Weltington Air
  Traftic Control Center at 2:27 a.m. Sighting lines D to E are estimates based on witness statements. Associated with
  these azimuths are depression angles in the range 20-40 degrees, with the depression angle at E being ~45 degrees. The
  square area at E represents the estimated location of the object when last seen.</b></p>
<p>Contrary to the stationary squid boat hypothesis, the available data suggest that the light moved a considerable
  distance during the 13 min or so that it was seen. According to the captain, the radar target moved in toward the
  center of the radarscope from 33-37 km to 15-22 km at approximately constant azimuth for several minutes, and then the
  target moved around to the right, disappearing at the limit of the sweep. As nearly as could be determined by the
  witnesses, the azimuth of the radar target was always the same as that of the light. As the flight continued, the
  witnesses had the impression that the object paced the aircraft at an apparently constant distance. Immediately after
  the turn the plane seemed to approach the light, but then it appeared to recede from or avoid the plane and move away
  and around to the right. There was a very noticeable depression angle in the line of sight after the turn, and there
  was no radar target, suggesting that the object was below the radar beam [1]. During the subsequent left turn the
  captain could not see the light directly because it was too far to the right and below his field of view, but he could
  see the glow in the right-hand windows. He was surprised to see the glow increase in intensity rather than decrease,
  as he expected would happen if he moved away from the light. A witness also recorded a statement mentioning an
  apparent increase in brightness during the turn. The light was last seen at the right at a depression angle of ~45
  degrees as it appeared to move behind and below the plane. Since the plane was at an altitude of ~3960 m, the light
  came within ~6000 m of the aircraft. </p>
<p>Because Ireland [4] failed to find a squid boat in the vicinity of the sighting area and because the available
  evidence indicates that the light source was capable of rather rapid motion (e.g., at least 42 m/sec, 82 knots), it
  appears that the light did not come from a squid boat. More detailed information on this and other sightings that
  occurred the same night is available from this author [8]. </p>

    after it was turned on because it was already in a warmed-up standby condition, a fact of which I was unaware until
    after publication of Refs. 1 and 3. The second change results from actual measurements of the radar sweep range.

    aircraft radar indicate that it can just barely detect individual fishing boats beyond 20 km or so. The associated
    blips look like small dots on the screen. </li>
