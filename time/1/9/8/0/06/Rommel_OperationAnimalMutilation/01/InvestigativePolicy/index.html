<p> I retired from the FBI in May 1979 and shortly afterwards assumed the role of director of investigations for
  Operation Animal Mutilation. At that time I had little knowledge about livestock mutilations, although I had read
  accounts of the phenomenon in the newspapers. However, right at the outset I decided to be very guarded in my comments
  to the media, a policy I had adopted during my years as an FBI agent. I do not believe that a professional
  investigation should be subject to possible influence by the media. Since Operation Animal Mutilation was a law
  enforcement investigation, I believed it wise to adopt a similar policy.</p>
<p> Also, I did not want to inadvertently furnish incomplete, erroneous, misleading or irresponsible information to the
  public through the media. After reviewing a collection of newspaper clippings, I felt that too many irresponsible
  statements had already been made about livestock mutilations. I also learned that in other states, the media had
  played a major role in alarming ranchers and farmers to the point where some of them had formed vigilante committees.
  I did not want this to happen in New Mexico as the result of any remarks made by me.</p>
<p> Because of the beliefs associated with the phenomenon, I also felt that if it were reported I was investigating a
  "mutilation" -- and not knowing how each individual perceived the word "mutilation" -- the public might interpret that
  statement in terms of their own preconceived notions. Moreover, I wanted to see how the media would cover incidents
  without the benefit of my comments. In other words, I wanted to see if the media, itself, was a part of the problem.
  Most reporters, I believe, are sincerely concerned with accurately conveying the facts to the public; but in the case
  of livestock mutilations, who knew what the facts were? This is what I wanted to determine before any information was
  released to the media. Now that the investigation has been completed, I believe the public has the right to know my
  conclusions as well as the evidence on which they are based. This, then, is the major objective of this report.</p>
<p class="source">1 For the sake of brevity, the term "human-induced" mutilation will be used to designate those
  mutilations performed with the aid of knives or other sharp instruments.</p>
