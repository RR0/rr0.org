<p>In my evaluation of the 90 previous New Mexico cases, I found nothing in the official reports to indicate that the
  animal was mutilated by any agents other than predators and scavengers. Available evidence strongly suggests that
  those animals died from natural causes or common injuries and were subsequently ravished by scavengers.</p>
<p>As I have shown, there is simply no concrete evidence to support the theory that mutilations are being conducted as
  experiments by highly skilled individuals using precision instruments. The facts cited to support this belief are at
  best questionable, and in many cases involve incredible flights of fantasy, as in the three tests whose findings
  supposedly established a link between mutilations, UFOs and high levels of radiation.</p>
<p>In the following chapter, I present the results of the investigations conducted in New Mexico during the course of
  Operation Animal Mutilation. The evidence presented in each case provides further support for the conclusion that the
  vast majority of livestock mutilations are caused by nothing more mysterious than nature's own ecologists hard at
  work.</p>
