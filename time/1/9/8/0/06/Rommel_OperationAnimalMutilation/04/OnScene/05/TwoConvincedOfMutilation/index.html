    </table><p>Two serious investigators of cattle mutilations have verified that a cow found in Truchas recently is a
    victim of the mysterious phenomena.</p>
    <p><a href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/v/ValdezGabrielL/index.html">Gabe Valdez</a>, the State
      Policeman with the most experience in investigating cattle mutilations, and <a
          href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/b/BurgessHowardF/index.html">Howard Burgess</a>, the retired
      Sandia Labs scientist who has been assisting <a
          href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/v/ValdezGabrielL/index.html">Valdez</a> with his investigation
      into mutilations, both said the Truchas cow appeared to be a mutilation after viewing pictures of the animal's
      carcass. </p>
    <p>"It is hard to tell from pictures, but his break in the leg convinces me," <a
        href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/v/ValdezGabrielL/index.html">Valdez</a> said. </p>
    <p>A number of mutilations have had leg breaks like the one <a
        href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/v/ValdezGabrielL/index.html">Valdez</a> noted in the pictures of
      the Truchas cow. The clue indicates to many investigators, including <a
          href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/v/ValdezGabrielL/index.html">Valdez</a> and <a
          href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/b/BurgessHowardF/index.html">Burgess</a>, that the cows are
      clamped by the leg and sophisticated aircraft from the site of their deaths to the site where they are found. </p>
    <p>The photographs were taken by Neil Bockman the day after the cow was discovered by Truchas residents. Bockman is
      an independent investigator into mutilations who also verified the carcass as a mutilation victim. His photographs
      were clear and explicit.</p>
    <p>The report that the cow's tongue was missing, as well as its udder, and that scrapings were noted on its eye that
      looked as though a tissue sample had been taken indicated to <a
          href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/v/ValdezGabrielL/index.html">Valdez</a>, <a
          href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/b/BurgessHowardF/index.html">Burgess</a>, and other
      investigators that the cow indeed was mutilated.</p>
    <p><a href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/v/ValdezGabrielL/index.html">Valdez</a> expressed concern that
      non official investigator appeared at the scene of the mutilation within 24 hours of the kill. Serious
      investigators believe that a fresh find is valuable and can yield important information which is lost as the
      carcass deteriorates.</p>
    <p>The state policeman said that he would have come to the mutilation if he could, but as it happened during rodeo
      weekend in Dulce, his services were needed at his home base. He said he regretted that he could not investigate
      this mutilation.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, there are mixed reports as to whether or not the special investigator hired by the District Attorney
      to study in depth the mutilation problem in the First Judicial District and the State got to the scene. </p>
    <p>Tom Florina, a spokesman for <a href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/r/RommelKennethMJr/index.html">Rommel</a>,
      said, "It is my understanding that he did appear at the scene," but he could not specify when, though he believes
      the carcass was viewed by <a
          href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/r/RommelKennethMJr/index.html">Rommel</a> on Monday or Tuesday.
      Rommel again was unavailable for comment. </p>
    <p>Others, too, have stated that <a href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/r/RommelKennethMJr/index.html">Rommel</a>
      looked into the mutilation, but if he travelled to Truchas, he was not noticed by primary witnesses of the event.
    </p>
    <p>Dennis Martinez, who lives 300 yards from where the cow was found, said "I don't know that the guy was even
      there."</p>
    <p>Martinez reported the mutilation to state police shortly after it was found. The kill was estimated to be five
      hours old at that time, 7 a.m., Saturday, July 21, but no law enforcement investigators appeared on the scene at
      that time.</p>
    <p>"As far as I know he was not up in Truchas," Martinez told the Sun Tuesday, though he said he spoke to "someone
      from the District Attorney's office" on the telephone about the mutilation.</p>
    <p>"If he did come up he did not show up when he was supposed to," Martinez said of <a
        href="../../../../../../../../../../../people/r/RommelKennethMJr/index.html">Rommel</a>.</p>
    <p>"The people of Truchas and myself like the way the news media handled the story," Martinez said further.</p>
    <p>Martinez said Tuesday that although dogs had been seen around the carcass, canine predators had not attacked it
      seriously, a factor many investigators have commented on concerning mutilations. </p>
