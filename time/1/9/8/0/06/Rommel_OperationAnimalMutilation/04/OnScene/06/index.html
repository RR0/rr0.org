<p>This investigation was originally initiated by Captain Robert Carroll of the New Mexico State Police (Criminal
  Investigation Division) after receiving the following information. On August 16 at approximately 2:30 p.m., several
  young men were riding motorcycles near Pueblito Cemetery, northeast of Questa, when they discovered the carcass of a
  steer which they believed had been mutilated. The animal was later described as a whitefaced Hereford, approximately
  six months old and weighing between 350-400 pounds.</p>
<p>The initial on-the-scene investigation was conducted by Captain Carroll, who was accompanied by Arthur Craig of the
  New Mexico State Police Crime Laboratory. Don Gibbs, a New Mexico Livestock Board inspector, was also on the scene.
  The hide and hair under both the neck and lower jaw were reported missing as was a patch of hide, approximately 14
  inches long, between the rear legs. The udder area had also been damaged. There was bird defecation on the carcass and
  canine tracks were seen in the immediate vicinity. Further inspection revealed teeth marks inside the muscle tissue as
  well as on the hide. The police took photographs, two of which are reproduced here.</p>
<p>Tire tracks were also observed at the scene. Based on a reconstruction of events, Captain Carroll and Inspector Gibbs
  concluded that a vehicle had driven into this isolated place and deposited the animal there. With this possibility in
  mind, the carcass was thoroughly examined again and what appeared to be green paint was found on the hide. Acting on
  this information, Inspector Gibbs instituted a search for the owner of the animal, who was located on August 28.</p>
<p>Inspector Gibbs interviewed the owner, who stated that around August 14, he was up on his forest allotment. While
  there he found his calf, which appeared to be very ill. The animal was running a high fever and its tongue was badly
  swollen. The owner said he then brought the calf down to his ranch in Questa, where it died the following day.
  Thinking the calf might have contracted a contagious disease that could infect the rest of the herd, the owner hauled
  the carcass to an isolated area and deposited it there.</p>
<p>Following the initial investigation by the police and livestock inspector, I conducted my own investigation, The next
  day I arrived on the scene but was hampered by rain. Two weeks later I returned and took some photographs, two of
  which are reproduced here.</p>
<p>Figure No. 22 shows the very jagged edges of the damaged udder area.</p>
<p>Figure No. 23 reveals the damage to the jaw bone area.</p>
<p>Figures No. 24 and No. 25 were taken approximately two weeks later, disclosing all that remains of the carcass -- the
  head and a piece of hide.</p>
<p>In conclusion, based on an interview with the owner, it is quite obvious that the calf had died of natural causes.
  The evidence at the scene clearly indicates that the mutilation was caused by canines, either dogs or coyotes, who
  were further assisted by birds. It should be noted that the damage done to this carcass, particularly in the udder
  area and jaw bone, is very similar to what is so often reported in the so-called classic mutilation." Also, as in many
  "classic mutilations," pieces of hide were missing from the animal.</p>
<p>During the course of the investigation, a deputy sheriff arrived at the scene and immediately declared to all present
  that this was a "classic mutilation." He then said he had viewed other "classic mutilations" in Colorado and thus knew
  this was definitely one of them. Naturally this raises some doubts as to the soundness of previous observations he has
  made in that state. In fact, how many other similar and questionable verdicts have been made throughout the cattle
  raising states by those who believe they are witnessing, or are experts concerning "classic mutilations?"</p>
