<p>On September 15, the state police in Socorro advised me t hat a cattle mutilation had just been reported in the Tome
  area. I conducted an on-the-scene investigation that day. Tom Brinkley, an inspector for the New Mexico Livestock
  Board, was also present. The victim -- a Holstein heifer, 15-16 months old -- was lying on its left side in a pasture
  approximately 200 yards east of Highway 47. It was facing south. The heifer was last seen alive September 14 at 10
  a.m.</p>
<p>The damage to the carcass consisted of a very jagged hole,. approximately eight inches in diameter, in the anus area.
  on the right side of the udder was a small puncture hole, and the right eye was missing. The end of the tongue had
  been removed,, leaving very rough, jagged edges.</p>
<p>The pasture was extremely muddy and contained numerous cow tracks, which was understandable since there were
  approximately 25 head of cattle in the pasture where the carcass lay. In addition, there was defecation on the
  carcass. Inspector Brinkley concluded that the carcass had been damaged by scavengers -- an opinion with which I
  concurred after examining the animal.</p>
<p>The owner advised us that he had been trying to contact his veterinarian so that the cause of the animal's death
  could be determined. The owner later advised that the carcass was examined by Dr. Cole of the Rio Bravo Animal Clinic
  on September 15, 1979. Tissue samples were taken by Dr. Cole, who forwarded them to the Animal Diagnostic Laboratory
  in Albuquerque for examination.</p>
<p>On October 2, Dr. Clair Hibbs, director of the New Mexico Animal Diagnostic Laboratory, submitted the following
  report based on an examination on tissue samples: Clostridium was found in the tissue samples, but no positive cause
  of death could be determined. The lesions described by Dr. Cole were in all probability caused by magpies.</p>
<p>Figure No. 32 shows the damage to the rear portion of the carcass. Note how jagged the opening is.</p>
<p>Figure No. 33 shows that one of the nipples has been removed from the udder, similar to the previous Truchas
  incident, in preparation, in my opinion for the removal of the entire udder.</p>
<p>In conclusion, once again, the evidence discovered in this Particular case tips the scale in favor of the verdict,
  scavenger-induced damage -- a verdict shared by Inspector Brinkley and Dr. Hibbs.</p>
