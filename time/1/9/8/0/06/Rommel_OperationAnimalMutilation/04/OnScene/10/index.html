<p>I initiated this investigation after receiving a telephone call on September 27 from the state police in Espanola,
  who said that a possible mutilation had been reported to them at 8:15 p.m. by an individual residing in the medanales
  area.</p>
<p>On September 28 I conducted an on-the-scene investigation. Accompanying me were district attorney investigator,
  Cipriano Padilla, and the owner of the dead animal. The alleged victim was a three to four-year-old female bovine,
  weighing approximately 600 pounds, who had calved within the last month -- as previously noted, a very critical time
  for a cow. The owner said the animal was last seen alive approximately ten days before it was found. The animal had
  been dead for at least two days at the time it was discovered.</p>
<p>The carcass was found lying on its left side. The right eye, the end of the tongue, the udder and all but one teat
  were missing. The anus area had also been damaged. When the carcass was rolled over, the left eye was still intact, as
  was one teat, which had been under the carcass. The underside of the carcass at the mouth area was stained with blood.
  In addition, a considerable amount of blood had drained onto the ground. There was bird defecation on the animal, and
  the owner said he had seen magpies on the carcass when he found it. During our investigation we also observed crows
  and vultures in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Figure No. 34 shows the carcass from the rear position. The photograph was taken approximately eight feet away,
  giving the impression that the damage in the anus area was fairly smooth. Bird defecation can also be seen on the
  carcass.</p>
<p>Figure No. 35 is a close-up of the anus area. Here the roughness and jaggedness of the damage is much more
  discernible.</p>
<p>Figure No. 36 discloses the damage to the udder area.</p>
<p>Figure No. 37 shows the teat and nipple, which were still intact when the carcass was rolled over. I suggested this
  is a strong indication of scavenger damage since that teat and nipple were not accessible to scavengers because of the
  position in which the animal died.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the investigative team decided that all the damage was consistent with what one would normally expect
  from scavengers. Also, there was bird defecation on the carcass, and magpies had been observed on the body the day it
  was found. The photograph sequence reveals once more why distant photographs are not reliable when trying to make a
  case for "surgical precision." It is only when an area is examined close-up that the jaggedness of the cuts becomes
  apparent. Although the cause of death was not determined, the owner said none of his 30 head of cattle had been
  vaccinated.</p>
