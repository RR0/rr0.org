<p>On November 5, the New Mexico State Police informed my office of a possible mutilation that had been reported that
  day by a Bernalillo rancher. The resident claimed she had found her two-year-old, home-bred heifer dead and mutilated
  the previous day. Prior to that time, she said her animal had been fat and in good health.</p>
<p>I conducted an on-the-scene investigation November 5, accompanied by the owner and her son. The carcass was lying on
  the left side with its head facing east. It had been dead approximately three days. The udder, anus area, and the
  right foreleg were badly damaged. The eyes and ears, however, were intact. I observed that the blood was pooled in the
  carcass.</p>
<p>No animal or bird tracks were visible. However, the ground was such that tracks would not have been readily
  observable. Also, the carcass was lying in a heavily shaded area. There was no evidence of visitation by birds, which
  perhaps explains why the eyes were still intact.</p>
<p>The owner's son said he had contacted an inspector from the New Mexico Livestock Board, who advised him that the
  animal had probably died of blackleg. The son also stated they had lost a two-year-old heifer approximately two weeks
  ago. He reported that at that time, he had seen adults carrying rifles in the area. He also said he had observed dogs
  and coyotes work on the heifer, which had been found with 150 yards of the animal now being investigated.</p>
<p>The owner added that the herd had not been vaccinated against blackleg since her husband's death several years ago.
  The owner's son, however, said he was rounding up the herd and transporting them to another area to initiate a
  vaccination program.</p>
<p>Figure No. 42 illustrates the damage done to both the right foreleg and the udder area.</p>
<p>Figure No. 43 is a close-up of the foreleg area, revealing the jaggedness of the damage, particularly in the 12
  o'clock position. It also shows the exposed bone.</p>
<p>Figure No. 44 is a close-up shot of the udder area. The jaggedness of the damage is clearly shown.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this case can best be described as another "classic" scavenger-induced mutilation. The animal probably
  died of blackleg, the carcass subsequently being damaged by animals. The jaggedness of the cuts certainly supports
  such a conclusion as does the fact that two weeks earlier canines were seen in the vicinity feeding on another
  carcass.</p>
