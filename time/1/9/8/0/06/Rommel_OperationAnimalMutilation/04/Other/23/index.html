<p>This investigation was initiated following a report to the New Mexico State Police of a possible mutilation in the
  Jordan area. On-the-scene examination was conducted by Captain Carroll of the New Mexico State Police. Accompanying
  him were Officer Leonard Elis of the New Mexico State Police in Melrose, Inspector Ray Hester of the New Mexico
  Livestock Board, and Joel Garrett of the Quay County Sheriff's office in Tucumcari.</p>
<p>The animal in question was a 16-month-old heifer calf, which weighed approximately 700 pounds. The carcass was found
  lying on its left side about 50 yards north of a roadway. The animal was last seen alive on October 11. It had been
  found dead on October 15, but was not reported to authorities until October 18. The carcass was in an advanced stage
  of bloating. The anus and udder areas were damaged as well as the mouth, nose, and left ear.</p>
<p>The investigators concluded that the damage, which indicated irregular tearing, was totally consistent with normal
  predator and scavenger activity. Bird and canine defecation as well as canine tracks were observed near the carcass.
  Domestic dogs, who lived at a farm one-half mile east of the carcass, had been seen by their owner going to and from
  the dead animal.</p>
<p>Upon examining the carcass the investigators found a round hole, approximately three-eights inch in diameter, in the
  neck. When a wire was placed in this hole, an entrance and exit wound were discovered. These wounds, together with the
  projectile pattern, indicated the animal had probably been shot. it should be noted that during this period of time
  there had been antelope hunting in the area. Subsequent interviews revealed that hunters had indeed been operating in
  the vicinity. The investigators thus concluded that the animal had been shot, the carcass subsequently being damaged
  by scavengers.</p>
