<p>On October 27 at 9:30 p.m., I was advised by Deputy William Hasenbuhler of the Lincoln County Sheriff's office, that
  he had investigated a cattle mutilation in Socorro County that day. Although the carcass had reportedly been found
  before 10 that morning, the sheriff's office had not been notified until approximately 5:15 p.m.</p>
<p>According to Hasenbuhler the animal was a 10 to 14-year-old cow and weighed between 900 and 1000 pounds. The animal
  had been, dead for about two days and had a decided odor. The carcass was lying on its right side, and the left eye,
  according to Hasenbuhler, looked like it had been pecked out by birds. A piece of hide, 2-1/2 square feet in size was
  missing, as was the udder. The anus also "appeared to have been eaten by predators." In addition, the rear portion of
  the carcass "had been eaten to such an extent that the hip was out of the socket." The tongue, however, was
  intact.</p>
<p>Deputy Hasenbuhler said that when he arrived on the scene, he had observed an eagle on the carcass. He also reported
  finding canine tracks in the immediate vicinity and bird defecation on the body. The deputy pointed out that the area
  where the carcass was lying has a heavy population of black ravens. According to him, the vultures had apparently
  departed for the season, and the area is not frequented by magpies.</p>
