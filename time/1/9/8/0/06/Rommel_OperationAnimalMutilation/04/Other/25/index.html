<p>On November 9, the superintendent of Carson National Forest informed me that a soil scientist assigned to that forest
  had, discovered a dead bovine heifer near Ojo Caliente. The animal, which weighed approximately 600 pounds, was lying
  on its right side. Its head was missing and there was a five-inch hole in the anus area. The soil scientist estimated
  that the heifer had been dead for approximately two days.</p>
<p>I immediately contacted Ray Brown, the district ranger for this area, who told me he was familiar with the carcass
  and had first seen it on November 3 and again on November 6. Brown said when he first saw the animal its head and
  udder were still intact, but the eyes and anus were being pecked out by birds, whom he personally observed working on
  the carcass.</p>
<p>In conclusion, most of the damage to the carcass was undoubtedly inflicted by birds, who were actually seen on the
  animal. One can only speculate as to what happened to the head, especially since it was still intact when the carcass
  was first observed. However, it should be noted that the skulls of bovine animals are commonly used as yard
  decorations by people wishing to create a Southwestern decor. In fact, the current prices for such skulls range from
  $50 to $75, depending on where they are purchased.</p>
