<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<p>During the course of my year-long investigation, 27 mutilations were reported in different parts of the state. Almost
  all of these incidents were investigated within the framework of Operation Animal Mutilation. Twelve cases were
  handled primarily by officials from the New Mexico State Police, the New Mexico Livestock Board, the New Mexico Game
  and Fish Department, the United States Forest Service, and county sheriff's departments, who communicated their
  findings to me.</p>
<p>I personally conducted on-the-scene investigations of the remaining 15 incidents. For each of these incidents, my
  first objective was to determine the probable cause of the mutilation. Since the major difference between animal and
  human-induced mutilations is that the latter entails the surgical removal of bodily parts, it was necessary that this
  criterion be met before a verdict of human-causation could be established. If such a verdict was reached, my next
  objective would have been to determine the cause of the animal's death.</p>
<p>However, if close examination of the lesions revealed jagged edges, torn tissues, or tooth marks, I would be forced
  to conclude that the damage had undoubtedly been inflicted by animals and birds. If such a conclusion was reached, as
  was the case in all 15 of my investigations, then I saw no reason to determine the cause of death.</p>
<p>Perhaps an analogy will help clarify my reasoning on this matter. During my career as an FBI agent, I investigated
  many major crimes, including bank robberies. On such occasions, good investigative procedures normally entailed a
  complete processing of the bank for evidence, including the dusting and lifting of finger and palm prints. However, if
  upon arrival at the bank, I discovered that no robbery had occurred but that the bank alarm had been activated by
  mistake, further investigation would have been unnecessary and wasteful. A similar case can be made for suspected
  mutilations. If it can be shown that no "mutilation" (human-induced) has occurred, then it would be unnecessary as
  well as wasteful to try to determine the cause of death.</p>
<p>At the outset of this investigation, I had no preconceived opinions on how it was going to turn out, and anticipating
  some very challenging crime problems, I sought assistance from the experts in specific fields. I immediately received
  the assurance of full cooperation from Don Hannah, director of the New Mexico State Police Crime Laboratory. I knew
  from past experience that he had a group of highly qualified experts in many fields, along with the mobility necessary
  for this investigation.</p>
<p>I also was assured complete support from Dr. James Weston, chief medical investigator for the state, who agreed, if
  requested, to fly an investigative team of medical investigators to any scene and conduct a regular homicide-type
  investigation for this project. Dr. Clair Hibbs, director of the newly formed State Veterinary Diagnostic Service,
  also stated that when available, he would be willing to join this team of medical investigators and lend his expertise
  in the field. I likewise received offers of support from many experts connected with the University of New Mexico, who
  were willing to travel to the scene to contribute their services if needed.</p>
<p>However, I assured all these professionals that since I fully recognized the value of their time, and was well aware
  of their demanding schedules, I would at no time waste their talents or their time to merely put on a facade. On the
  contrary, I advised them I would first make every effort to visit a scene, and then call upon their expertise only
  when needed. I explained that this had been my working relationship with the experts associated with the FBI
  Laboratory for the past 28 years, and could see no reason to alter the policy.</p>
<p>As will be revealed by my comments and photographs concerning the following incidents that I investigated, at no time
  did I feel the need to request on-the-scene participation from these experts. I did, however, consult with many of
  them and sought their advice and guidance during the course of this project. I hereby acknowledge a full measure of
  gratitude for their splendid cooperation.</p>
<p>In the pages that follow, the 15 incidents I personally investigated are described first. During these
  investigations, I took over 250 sharply-defined slides, using an Olympus OM-10 camera. These slides are now maintained
  in my files. Some of the more pertinent ones have been reproduced into black and white photographs, and are included
  in this report to provide visual evidence of particular points. The chapter concludes with a description of the 13
  incidents investigated for this project by other agencies.</p>
<h2>On-The-Scene Investigations</h2>
<h3>Incident No. 1 -- June 21, 1979 -- Coyote</h3>
<p>As a result of information furnished by the New Mexico State Police, I investigated a reported mutilation in the
  Carson National Forest near the Coyote Ranger Station. I was accompanied by Bruce Higgins, a forester with the
  National Forest Service.</p>
<p>The animal -- a mature, white-faced heifer -- was found lying on its right side. I observed that the entire rear end
  as well as the underside of the body was missing. The left ear and left top portion of the lip had likewise vanished.
  However, the right ear, which was on the protected or underside of the animal, was still intact and bore a Forest
  Service Tag No. 605.</p>
<p>A normal distinctive dead odor prevailed and numerous flies were noted. No signs of a struggle were indicated, and
  the legs of the animal appeared to be intact. Other cow and deer tracks were noted in the immediate vicinity of the
  carcass.</p>

  </table><p>Figures No. 1 and No. 2 show the animal when it was first found and reported as a mutilation. That the
  damage revealed in these photographs could be described as "surgical precision" is the epitome of suggestive thinking.
  However, last year I attended a conference in which a slide depicting similar damage was shown by an official as
  evidence of the unparalleled surgical skill with which these mutilations are performed.</p>

      </tr>
      </table><p>Figure No. 3 shows that it is the exposed parts of the animal -- in this case the left ear, left eye,
      and upper lip that are missing. Forest Service tag no. 605 can readily be seen affixed to the right or protected
      ear, which remains intact.</p>
      <p>In conclusion it is quite obvious that the carcass had been damaged by scavengers, which had attacked the most
        accessible parts of the animal. As the photographs indicate, the cuts were quite jagged. This verdict is further
        supported by the discovery of bird defecation on both the carcass and on a nearby log. When we arrived at the
        scene, a buzzard was spotted on the branch of a tree immediately above the dead animal, and buzzard feathers
        were found in the area. In addition, small pieces of white hair, which appeared identical to the hair on the
        carcass, were plainly visible in the buzzard defecation on the nearby log.</p>
      <h3>Incident No. 2 -- June 29, 1.979 -- T-Bone Ranch, Hopewell Lake</h3>
      <p>On June 29 I was horseback riding in the T-Bone Ranch area of the Carson National Forest. Accompanying me were
        Forest Supervisor Jack Crellin, Dr. Howard Smith of Roswell, and several other people, including some forest
        employees.</p>
      <p>During the ride we discovered six dead cows, all of which had recently died from larkspur poisoning. We noted
        that larkspur was abundant in the area. In fact, it had plagued a good portion of northern New Mexico that
        spring because of an unusually heavy rainfall. We observed that the carcasses were covered with bird defecation.
        In addition, coyotes were seen in the area as we rode through.</p>
      <p>Photographs of one carcass were taken at this time by Dr. Smith. Then at my request, Forester Bill Wright
        returned to this same isolated spot three days later (July 2) and rephotographed the same carcass. Some very
        interesting observations can be made from the following four photographs:</p>
      <figure class="right side">

          </tr>
          </table><p>Figure No. 4 is a photograph taken June 29. It clearly shows that the animal died with its tongue
          protruding and ears intact. The protruding tongue is important, for during this investigation I have
          encountered statements, attributed to certain unidentified veterinarians, that no animal could open the mouth
          of a carcass to remove the tongue. But as this photograph shows, the explanation is really quite simple, since
          it is not unusual for an animal to die with its tongue protruding, especially if it has been poisoned. This
          photograph also shows a circular spot to the left of the mouth, which appeared to be blood and other body
          fluids that had drained from the mouth.</p>

              </table><p>Figure No. 5 taken July 2 shows the same animal, but as you can see, both the tongue and right
              ear are missing. Also note that the spot is no longer visible a fact that could give rise to the statement
              that no blood is found at the scene of a mutilation. It is my observation that the amount of visible
              evidence present and the amount of damage done greatly depend upon how much time has elapsed before the
              carcass is discovered, and which animals have had access to it.</p>

                  the result of the formation of gasses inside the carcass and the relaxation of muscles as a result of
                  death. This area as you can see, is now a readily accessible target for scavengers.</p>

                      anus area. This portion of the animal is now being decimated by nothing more than the common
                      blowfly. However, this effect is readily shaping up to what could have later been described as a
                      "cored rectum."</p>
                      <p>In conclusion, this case was especially interesting and important since it resulted in a series
                        of photographs that provide a "before and after" comparison -- a visual proof of
                        scavenger-induced damage. This is another example, not of some bizarre intrigue, but of nature's
                        ecologists performing their daily tasks on animals who had obviously died from larkspur
                        poisoning. As the supervisor of the Carson National Forest points out, anytime northern New
                        Mexico has a spring characterized by an unusual large amount of rain, there will be a potential
                        larkspur problem in that part of the state.</p>
                      <p>Larkspur, however, is just one of more than one hundred plant species in New Mexico that are
                        poisonous to livestock. Information on these potentially dangerous plants is provided in a
                        pamphlet published by the Cooperative Extension Service of New Mexico State University, from
                        which the following excerpt is taken.</p>
                      <blockquote>
                        <p> "Most poisonous plants on New Mexico ranges are native. Usually, livestock graze them only
                          when more desirable species are scarce or when watering facilities are not adequate. A lack of
                          minerals such as salt or phosphorus may cause animals to graze plants they would not usually
                          eat. Some poisonous plants such as lupines, locos, and larkspur 'green up' early, and animals
                          craving green feed may graze these poisonous plants to satisfy their need. A few poisonous
                          species, like these, are relatively palatable" (Gay and Dwyer 1967: 1).</p>
                      </blockquote>
                      <h3>Incident No. 3 -- July 3, 1979 -- Lindrith</h3>
                      <p>The New Mexico State Police informed me that they had received a report of a livestock
                        mutilation on July 3 in the Lindrith area. I learned that at approximately 10:45 a.m. on that
                        date, a seven-year-old heifer weighing approximately 850 pounds, had been found dead by its
                        owner.</p>
                      <p>The owner subsequently contacted the local livestock inspector and reported the incident as a
                        mutilation. The owner stated he was not certain when the heifer died. However, he noted that
                        about two days before the carcass was discovered, he had been through that area and had not seen
                        the animal.</p>
                      <p>I conducted an on-the-scene investigation of this incident. The carcass was lying on its back
                        with its head facing north -- the same position in which the animal had been discovered. Damage
                        had been done to both the udder area and the anus region, which contained a hole approximately
                        four inches in diameter. The eyes, lips, and tongue, however, were intact.</p>
                      <p>There was abundant evidence of scavenger activity. Not only was bird defecation evident on the
                        carcass, but also the owner told me that when he first found the animal, he noticed ravens
                        nearby. He immediately left the area to inform his wife of the animal's death. When he returned
                        to the carcass, he saw a coyote, which he shot and killed.</p>
                      <p>A livestock inspector also arrived at the scene and concluded that the damage to the carcass
                        was totally consistent with scavenger activity. However, he did comment that he had never seen a
                        cow die lying flat on its back. Although that position may not be common, it should be noted
                        that there are no set rules or findings concerning the position in which an animal must die.
                        Moreover, veterinarians have advised me that when an animal begins to bloat after its death, the
                        carcass has a tendency to turn toward the back. Cattle dying from anthrax also have a tendency
                        to die with their feet straight in the air, according to Dr. Robert Pyles, veterinarian for the
                        New Mexico Livestock Board. Dr. Pyles did point out, though, that anthrax had not recently been
                        observed in New Mexico. A few weeks later, however -- on July 27 to be exact -- an anthrax
                        epidemic was reported in Union and Colfax Counties.</p>

                              in the anus region. Again, the body fluids from the carcass are very noticeable. lead this
                              carcass been discovered several days later, the stained area would either have evaporated
                              or been licked clean by scavengers, as was the case in the Coyote incident. It is easy to
                              understand why carcasses found in such a condition are often reported as being "devoid of
                              blood."</p>
                              <p>In conclusion, the facts presented in the preceding discussion all lead to one verdict
                                -- that the carcass was mutilated by scavengers. Not only were birds and coyotes at the
                                scene, but the damage done to the carcass was obviously rough. As in keeping with the
                                objectives set out earlier, I have not tried to determine the cause of the animals
                                death. However, I think the possibility of a lightning kill, which is quite prevalent
                                among livestock, should be considered in this incident.</p>

                              <p>On July 9, a rancher appeared at the district attorney's office in Espanola and
                                reported that on July 8 he had found one of his cows dead and mutilated in the Tierra
                                Amarilla area. The owner claimed that the animal's uterus, bladder, tongue, and eyes had
                                been "surgically removed," and that he wanted the incident investigated.</p>
                              <p>I then went to Tierra Amarilla with the owner, who informed me that he had been in the
                                ranching business his entire life. He also told me that this was the second animal he
                                had lost to a mutilation.</p>
                              <p>When we arrived at the scene, the cow was lying on its left side approximately 2/10 of
                                a mile from Highway 64 and 30 yards from a stream. Its head was facing in a northwest
                                direction. The tongue and right eye were missing, and considerable damage had been done
                                to the udder and anus areas. The extreme end of the animal's tail was missing. However,
                                approximately 15 yards from the carcass, I discovered some hair which appeared to be
                                identical to the remaining hair on the animal's tail.</p>
                              <p>There were numerous flies and maggots on the body, which also had the normal odor of
                                decay. When the carcass was rolled over, the right eye was still intact, but was in the
                                process of being eaten by maggots. I also observed several different birds of prey in
                                the area.</p>
                              <p>After examining the carcass and noting the jagged and torn appearance of the injuries,
                                I asked the owner whether he really thought the damaged areas could be described by the
                                term "surgical precision." He replied that the damage did appear "a bit rough." I then
                                asked where he obtained the term "surgical precision," and he said it was commonly used
                                in the newspapers.</p>
                              <p>It is of interest that during our discussion, the owner immediately eliminated the
                                possibility that the carcass had been damaged by coyotes. He based this belief on the
                                fact that in his experience as a rancher he had observed that coyotes go to the throat
                                to make a kill. As a result of extensive reading about sheep kills in Montana, I knew
                                that he was right regarding coyote predation on sheep.</p>

                                  five years." He said that prior to this, his entire experience had been in the sheep
                                  raising business. We then discussed the possibility of a coyote acting in a dual role
                                  -- as a predator when killing smaller animals such as sheep, and as a scavenger when
                                  feeding upon the carcasses of larger animals such as cattle.</p>

                                          unusual in this particular case to set it apart from the previous
                                          investigations. The rough damage to the carcass, including the typically
                                          missing eye and tongue,, again point to coyotes, birds, and maggots as the
                                          "mutilators." However, it is readily understood why the owner's initial
                                          reaction involved those words "surgical precision.'' The power of the printed
                                          word -- especially when repeated over and over -- cannot help but influence
                                          one's thoughts. Although the cause of death was not determined, the owner
                                          informed me that the cow was due to have its first calf in August -- a very
                                          critical time for any bovine.</p>

                                          <h3>Incident No. 6 -- August 16, 1979 -- Questa</h3>
                                          <p>This investigation was originally initiated by Captain Robert Carroll of
                                            the New Mexico State Police (Criminal Investigation Division) after
                                            receiving the following information. On August 16 at approximately 2:30
                                            p.m., several young men were riding motorcycles near Pueblito Cemetery,
                                            northeast of Questa, when they discovered the carcass of a steer which they
                                            believed had been mutilated. The animal was later described as a whitefaced
                                            Hereford, approximately six months old and weighing between 350-400
                                            pounds.</p>
                                          <p>The initial on-the-scene investigation was conducted by Captain Carroll,
                                            who was accompanied by Arthur Craig of the New Mexico State Police Crime
                                            Laboratory. Don Gibbs, a New Mexico Livestock Board inspector, was also on
                                            the scene. The hide and hair under both the neck and lower jaw were reported
                                            missing as was a patch of hide, approximately 14 inches long, between the
                                            rear legs. The udder area had also been damaged. There was bird defecation
                                            on the carcass and canine tracks were seen in the immediate vicinity.
                                            Further inspection revealed teeth marks inside the muscle tissue as well as
                                            on the hide. The police took photographs, two of which are reproduced
                                            here.</p>
                                          <p>Tire tracks were also observed at the scene. Based on a reconstruction of
                                            events, Captain Carroll and Inspector Gibbs concluded that a vehicle had
                                            driven into this isolated place and deposited the animal there. With this
                                            possibility in mind, the carcass was thoroughly examined again and what
                                            appeared to be green paint was found on the hide. Acting on this
                                            information, Inspector Gibbs instituted a search for the owner of the
                                            animal, who was located on August 28.</p>
                                          <p>Inspector Gibbs interviewed the owner, who stated that around August 14, he
                                            was up on his forest allotment. While there he found his calf, which
                                            appeared to be very ill. The animal was running a high fever and its tongue
                                            was badly swollen. The owner said he then brought the calf down to his ranch
                                            in Questa, where it died the following day. Thinking the calf might have
                                            contracted a contagious disease that could infect the rest of the herd, the
                                            owner hauled the carcass to an isolated area and deposited it there.</p>
                                          <p>Following the initial investigation by the police and livestock inspector,
                                            I conducted my own investigation, The next day I arrived on the scene but
                                            was hampered by rain. Two weeks later I returned and took some photographs,
                                            two of which are reproduced here.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 22 shows the very jagged edges of the damaged udder area.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 23 reveals the damage to the jaw bone area.</p>
                                          <p>Figures No. 24 and No. 25 were taken approximately two weeks later,
                                            disclosing all that remains of the carcass -- the head and a piece of
                                            hide.</p>
                                          <p>In conclusion, based on an interview with the owner, it is quite obvious
                                            that the calf had died of natural causes. The evidence at the scene clearly
                                            indicates that the mutilation was caused by canines, either dogs or coyotes,
                                            who were further assisted by birds. It should be noted that the damage done
                                            to this carcass, particularly in the udder area and jaw bone, is very
                                            similar to what is so often reported in the so-called classic mutilation."
                                            Also, as in many "classic mutilations," pieces of hide were missing from the
                                            animal.</p>
                                          <p>During the course of the investigation, a deputy sheriff arrived at the
                                            scene and immediately declared to all present that this was a "classic
                                            mutilation." He then said he had viewed other "classic mutilations" in
                                            Colorado and thus knew this was definitely one of them. Naturally this
                                            raises some doubts as to the soundness of previous observations he has made
                                            in that state. In fact, how many other similar and questionable verdicts
                                            have been made throughout the cattle raising states by those who believe
                                            they are witnessing, or are experts concerning "classic mutilations?"</p>
                                          <h3>Incident No. 7 --.September 13, 1979 -- Truchas</h3>
                                          <p>On September 13 at 12:30 a.m. the state police informed me that a cattle
                                            mutilation had been reported in the Truchas area. I telephoned the owner,
                                            who told me the animal had been found dead and mutilated at 9:30 p.m. the
                                            previous evening.</p>
                                          <p>I immediately traveled to the scene and discovered a female bovine, between
                                            three and four years old, lying on its right side. The anus area was missing
                                            and there was a hole in the udder where a nipple had been removed. In
                                            addition, part of the tongue was gone, both eyes had been partially removed,
                                            and a three-inch patch of skin was missing from the belly area. A large
                                            quantity of blood had settled in the carcass. I also found bird defecation
                                            on the body.</p>
                                          <p>Because it was still dark, I decided to resume the investigation later that
                                            morning. This time I was accompanied by Henry Guillen, New Mexico Livestock
                                            Board inspector; Cipriano Padilla, district attorney investigator; the owner
                                            of the animal and his son. Upon arrival at the scene, we observed six turkey
                                            vultures on the carcass. They immediately took flight. In addition to this
                                            dramatic evidence of scavenger activity, canine defecation was also found
                                            near the body.</p>
                                          <p>Since the carcass obviously contained a considerable amount of gas,
                                            Inspector Guillen asked the owner if the cow had been vaccinated against
                                            blackleg -- a type of clostridial infection that produces an acute, febrile
                                            disease in cattle. The owner replied that none of his cows had been
                                            vaccinated against blackleg, and that this was the second cow he had lost
                                            this summer. Inspector Guillen then advised the owner to have his stock
                                            vaccinated since other cows in the area had recently died from the
                                            disease.</p>
                                          <p>Several days after my investigation, the owner contacted me and reported
                                            that on September 14 he had found another cow dead. He said he immediately
                                            took the carcass to a veterinarian in Espanola, who diagnosed the cause of
                                            death as blackleg. The owner also informed me he had immediately instituted
                                            a vaccination program for the rest of his herd.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 26 shows bird defecation near the left eye, which is
                                            missing.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 27 shows the damage inflicted on the rear end of the carcass as
                                            viewed from a distance of approximately six feet.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 28 shows a close-up of the same damage.</p>
                                          <p>Note the extreme jaggedness of the cut in the 12 o'clock position. This
                                            picture illustrates how difficult it is to accurately assess the nature of a
                                            mutilation on the basis of a distant photograph.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 29 shows the udder area, from which a nipple has obviously been
                                            removed.</p>
                                          <p>In conclusion, the damage inflicted on this carcass is similar to that
                                            found on other carcasses-- with one exception. We arrived on the scene
                                            before the entire udder was taken. As noted previously, the entire
                                            investigative team observed six vultures working on the carcass, and the
                                            resulting damage has been graphically revealed in the photographs. I have
                                            additional slides on file which show the carcass with its ear and tongue
                                            partially removed. Once again I wish to stress the point that the amount of
                                            damage done to a carcass depends on what time the investigator arrives at
                                            the scene and which scavengers are in the area.</p>
                                          <h3>Incident No. 8 -- September 14, 1979 -- El Cerrito</h3>
                                          <p>This investigation was initiated following a telephone conversation
                                            September 17 with a rancher whose bull had been found dead three days
                                            earlier on his property at El Cerrito. The owner said he thought the animal
                                            had been mutilated.</p>
                                          <p>He said he found the animal lying on its right side, approximately 25 yards
                                            from the road and 150 yards from his house. According to the owner, the
                                            animal was last seen alive on September 12. He then described the damage to
                                            the carcass, which consisted of a hole in the anus, approximately three
                                            inches in diameter; a partial loss of the tongue; and the removal of the
                                            penis and testicles.</p>
                                          <p>I conducted an on-the-scene investigation September 17, accompanied by the
                                            owner. When I approached the area, crows were visiting the carcass. There
                                            was bird defecation on the animal as well as numerous flies, and the carcass
                                            had an extremely foul odor.</p>
                                          <p>I observed blood stains on the mouth of the animal and on the ground below.
                                            The damage to the carcass was exactly as the owner had described it.
                                            However, as in past examinations, the damage was noticeably jagged to the
                                            naked eye and even more so when viewed through a magnifying glass.</p>
                                          <p>Other than bird defecation, there was no obvious evidence to indicate the
                                            presence of other scavengers. But the owner said there had been a lot of
                                            rain when the carcass was found, which he felt would have obliterated any
                                            animal tracks.</p>
                                          <p>He further stated that when he first found the body it had possessed a very
                                            strong sulphur smell similar to the odor of a rotten egg or the smell
                                            produced immediately after a match is struck. However, when I examined the
                                            carcass, this odor was no longer present.</p>
                                          <p>The owner also told me that the day following his discovery of the carcass,
                                            it was examined by Frank Gallegos, a New Mexico Livestock Board inspector
                                            assigned to the Las Vegas area. On September 19, I interviewed Gallegos, who
                                            told me that he had examined the bull on September 15. He said by this time
                                            the bull had already been dead for several days, He examined the animal for
                                            gunshot wounds but could not find evidence to suggest it had been shot.
                                            However, the tongue was partially gone and flies were working on the anus,
                                            In addition, the penis and scrotum were already missing. He also pointed out
                                            that the carcass had a decisive rotten odor which he said was the normal
                                            odor for dead cattle.</p>
                                          <p>Curious about the origin of the sulphur smell, I contacted several of the
                                            veterinarians who have been serving as consultants on this project. They
                                            were unable to come up with a logical solution. On May 6, 1980, I contacted
                                            Dr. J. Sherrod, D.V.M., Valverde Animal Clinic, Cortales. He explained that
                                            this odor is very common when a bovine dies lying on its right side. The
                                            rumen then has a tendency to vent to the outside and -- depending on what
                                            the animal has been eating -- a definite sulphur odor may be noticeable. Dr.
                                            Sherrod noted that some of the grazing plants in New Mexico typically
                                            produce such a reaction. He also pointed out that this condition is unlikely
                                            to occur if the animal dies lying on its left side.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 30 shows the area of the penis, and again the jaggedness is very
                                            noticeable.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 31 shows the anus area and likewise reveals the jaggedness of
                                            the damage.</p>
                                          <p>In conclusion, there is no evidence here, whatever, to link this mutilation
                                            to "strange and mysterious circumstances." The damage to the carcass was
                                            probably inflicted by the crows which were prevalent at the scene. Birds
                                            appear to be among the first arrivals to feast upon a dead animal, and seem
                                            possessed with ravenous appetite that can soon wreak a surprising amount of
                                            damage to a carcass.</p>
                                          <p>This particular case also shows that there is usually a logical, common
                                            sense solution to even the most puzzling aspects of a mutilation case. While
                                            a more imaginative, headline-seeking investigator might have sought to link
                                            that strong sulphur odor to some mysterious or occult happening, the answer
                                            turned out to be a very natural and logical one.</p>
                                          <h3>Incident No. 9 -- September 15, 1979 -- Tome</h3>
                                          <p>On September 15, the state police in Socorro advised me t hat a cattle
                                            mutilation had just been reported in the Tome area. I conducted an
                                            on-the-scene investigation that day. Tom Brinkley, an inspector for the New
                                            Mexico Livestock Board, was also present. The victim -- a Holstein heifer,
                                            15-16 months old -- was lying on its left side in a pasture approximately
                                            200 yards east of Highway 47. It was facing south. The heifer was last seen
                                            alive September 14 at 10 a.m.</p>
                                          <p>The damage to the carcass consisted of a very jagged hole,. approximately
                                            eight inches in diameter, in the anus area. on the right side of the udder
                                            was a small puncture hole, and the right eye was missing. The end of the
                                            tongue had been removed,, leaving very rough, jagged edges.</p>
                                          <p>The pasture was extremely muddy and contained numerous cow tracks, which
                                            was understandable since there were approximately 25 head of cattle in the
                                            pasture where the carcass lay. In addition, there was defecation on the
                                            carcass. Inspector Brinkley concluded that the carcass had been damaged by
                                            scavengers -- an opinion with which I concurred after examining the
                                            animal.</p>
                                          <p>The owner advised us that he had been trying to contact his veterinarian so
                                            that the cause of the animal's death could be determined. The owner later
                                            advised that the carcass was examined by Dr. Cole of the Rio Bravo Animal
                                            Clinic on September 15, 1979. Tissue samples were taken by Dr. Cole, who
                                            forwarded them to the Animal Diagnostic Laboratory in Albuquerque for
                                            examination.</p>
                                          <p>On October 2, Dr. Clair Hibbs, director of the New Mexico Animal Diagnostic
                                            Laboratory, submitted the following report based on an examination on tissue
                                            samples: Clostridium was found in the tissue samples, but no positive cause
                                            of death could be determined. The lesions described by Dr. Cole were in all
                                            probability caused by magpies.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 32 shows the damage to the rear portion of the carcass. Note how
                                            jagged the opening is.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 33 shows that one of the nipples has been removed from the
                                            udder, similar to the previous Truchas incident, in preparation, in my
                                            opinion for the removal of the entire udder.</p>
                                          <p>In conclusion, once again, the evidence discovered in this Particular case
                                            tips the scale in favor of the verdict, scavenger-induced damage -- a
                                            verdict shared by Inspector Brinkley and Dr. Hibbs.</p>
                                          <h3>Incident No. 10 -- September 27, 1979 -- Medanales</h3>
                                          <p>I initiated this investigation after receiving a telephone call on
                                            September 27 from the state police in Espanola, who said that a possible
                                            mutilation had been reported to them at 8:15 p.m. by an individual residing
                                            in the medanales area.</p>
                                          <p>On September 28 I conducted an on-the-scene investigation. Accompanying me
                                            were district attorney investigator, Cipriano Padilla, and the owner of the
                                            dead animal. The alleged victim was a three to four-year-old female bovine,
                                            weighing approximately 600 pounds, who had calved within the last month --
                                            as previously noted, a very critical time for a cow. The owner said. the
                                            animal was last seen alive approximately ten days before it was found. The
                                            animal had been dead for at least two days at the time it was
                                            discovered.</p>
                                          <p>The carcass was found lying on its left side. The right eye, the end of the
                                            tongue, the udder and all but one teat were missing. The anus area had also
                                            been damaged. When the carcass was rolled over, the left eye was still
                                            intact, as was one teat, which had been under the carcass. The underside of
                                            the carcass at the mouth area was stained with blood. In addition, a
                                            considerable amount of blood had drained onto the ground. There was bird
                                            defecation on the animal, and the owner said he had seen magpies on the
                                            carcass when he found it. During our investigation we also observed crows
                                            and vultures in the vicinity.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 34 shows the carcass from the rear position. The photograph was
                                            taken approximately eight feet away, giving the impression that the damage
                                            in the anus area was fairly smooth. Bird defecation can also be seen on the
                                            carcass.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 35 is a close-up of the anus area. Here the roughness and
                                            jaggedness of the damage is much more discernible.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 36 discloses the damage to the udder area.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 37 shows the teat and nipple, which were still intact when the
                                            carcass was rolled over. I suggested this is a strong indication of
                                            scavenger damage since that teat and nipple were not accessible to
                                            scavengers because of the position in which the animal died.</p>
                                          <p>In conclusion, the investigative team decided that all the damage was
                                            consistent with what one would normally expect from scavengers. Also, there
                                            was bird defecation on the carcass, and magpies had been observed on the
                                            body the day it was found. The photograph sequence reveals once more why
                                            distant photographs are not reliable when trying to make a case for
                                            "surgical precision." It is only when an area is examined close-up that the
                                            jaggedness of the cuts becomes apparent. Although the cause of death was not
                                            determined, the owner said none of his 30 head of cattle had been
                                            vaccinated.</p>
                                          <h3>Incident No. 11 -- October 8, 1979 -- San Lorenzo</h3>
                                          <p>Mel Sedillo of the New Mexico Livestock Board contacted me on October 9 and
                                            stated that a cattle mutilation had been reported in the San Lorenzo area.
                                            An on-the-scene investigation was conducted that day by myself; Henry
                                            Torres, inspector for the New Mexico Livestock Board; and Richard Montoya,
                                            deputy for the Grants County Sheriff's office. The owners of the animal were
                                            also present.</p>
                                          <p>The dead animal was a four-year-old female bovine, which had been found
                                            lying on its left side. The animal was last seen alive several days before.
                                            As in other cases, it had recently calved. Its right eye and udder were
                                            missing, and there was a hole, approximately six inches in diameter, in the
                                            anus area. The carcass appeared to be in a very advanced stage of bloat.
                                            Bird defecation was also observed on the animal, and canine tracks were
                                            discovered in the immediate vicinity.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 38 shows the tongue intact but protruding, making it a very
                                            accessible target. As stated previously, it is not unusual for an animal to
                                            die with the tongue in this position.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 39 shows the damage in the udder area and clearly reveals the
                                            jaggedness of the destruction, particularly in the 5 o'clock and 11 o'clock
                                            areas. The carcass also bears evidence of a skin disorder known as scabies,
                                            which could be misinterpreted as burn marks.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 40 is a close-up of the badly damaged anus area. The dark
                                            portions are dry blood, which also could be misinterpreted as burn marks.
                                            The jaggedness of the cut is very noticeable.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 41 is also of the anus area, but after the animal has been
                                            rolled over. This shows the same damage as revealed in Figure No. 40, but
                                            now the jaggedness is much more noticeable. Once again, this demonstrates
                                            that care must be taken when making conclusions based on photographs.</p>
                                          <p>During the course of the investigation, the owner told me she had reported
                                            the incident as a mutilation because of what she had read in the newspapers
                                            -- particularly the coverage afforded the cattle mutilation conference that
                                            took place April 20 (1979) in Albuquerque. However, in the opinion of both
                                            Inspector Torres and Deputy Montoya, the damage to the carcass was totally
                                            consistent with what one would expect to find from normal predator and
                                            scavenger activity. The writer, after viewing the damage and weighing the
                                            evidence provided by the bird defecation and canine tracks, agreed with
                                            their opinion.</p>
                                          <p>This particular case might prompt the question -- "Why is it that while
                                            considerable damage was inflicted elsewhere, the tongue, an extremely
                                            accessible target, remained intact?" Once again, the amount and type of
                                            damage depends on when a person arrives on the scene, and which scavengers
                                            are in the vicinity. Much also depends on the behavior of these
                                            scavengers.</p>
                                          <p>For example, birds would not be feeding on the carcass at the same time
                                            that canine scavengers are eating their fill.</p>
                                          <h3>Incident No. 12 -- November 5, 1979 -- Bernalillo</h3>
                                          <p>On November 5, the New Mexico State Police informed my office of a possible
                                            mutilation that had been reported that day by a Bernalillo rancher. The
                                            resident claimed she had found her two-year-old, home-bred heifer dead and
                                            mutilated the previous day. Prior to that time, she said her animal had been
                                            fat and in good health.</p>
                                          <p>I conducted an on-the-scene investigation November 5, accompanied by the
                                            owner and her son. The carcass was lying on the left side with its head
                                            facing east. It had been dead approximately three days. The udder, anus
                                            area, and the right foreleg were badly damaged. The eyes and ears, however,
                                            were intact. I observed that the blood was pooled in the carcass.</p>
                                          <p>No animal or bird tracks were visible. However, the ground was such that
                                            tracks would not have been readily observable. Also, the carcass was lying
                                            in a heavily shaded area. There was no evidence of visitation by birds,
                                            which perhaps explains why the eyes were still intact.</p>
                                          <p>The owner's son said he had contacted an inspector from the New Mexico
                                            Livestock Board, who advised him that the animal had probably died of
                                            blackleg. The son also stated they had lost a two-year-old heifer
                                            approximately two weeks ago. He reported that at that time, he had seen
                                            adults carrying rifles in the area. He also said he had observed dogs and
                                            coyotes work on the heifer, which had been found with 150 yards of the
                                            animal now being investigated.</p>
                                          <p>The owner added that the herd had not been vaccinated against blackleg
                                            since her husband's death several years ago. The owner's son, however, said
                                            he was rounding up the herd and transporting them to another area to
                                            initiate a vaccination program.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 42 illustrates the damage done to both the right foreleg and the
                                            udder area.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 43 is a close-up of the foreleg area, revealing the jaggedness
                                            of the damage, particularly in the 12 o'clock position. It also shows the
                                            exposed bone.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 44 is a close-up shot of the udder area. The jaggedness of the
                                            damage is clearly shown.</p>
                                          <p>In conclusion, this case can best be described as another "classic"
                                            scavenger-induced mutilation. The animal probably died of blackleg, the
                                            carcass subsequently being damaged by animals. The jaggedness of the cuts
                                            certainly supports such a conclusion as does the fact that two weeks earlier
                                            canines were seen in the vicinity feeding on another carcass.</p>
                                          <h3>Incident No. 13. -- November 17, 1979 -- El Rito</h3>
                                          <p>On November 17 at 9:30 a.m. Henry Guillen, New Mexico livestock inspector,
                                            advised me that a cattle mutilation had been reported to him that morning at
                                            El Rito.</p>
                                          <p>I conducted an on-the-scene investigation that day. The animal was a
                                            three-year-old female bovine, which weighed approximately 1,000 pounds. It
                                            had been found dead the previous afternoon at 4:30 p.m. The animal was lying
                                            on its left side. The only damage I observed was a hole, approximately five
                                            inches in diameter, in the anus area. The rest of the animal was intact,
                                            including the udder. Blood had drained from both the anus area and the mouth
                                            to the lower part of the carcass.</p>
                                          <p>Inspector Henry Guillen examined the animal and said it showed signs of
                                            blackleg. He then cut its leg to show the owner the bubbles characteristic
                                            of blackleg. The owner said he had not vaccinated his cattle against that
                                            disease this year.</p>
                                          <p>There was bird defecation on the carcass. Also, on the ground nearby was a
                                            ham bone, which the animal's owner identified as one he had recently given
                                            his German Shepherd dog. The owner also said there are numerous coyotes in
                                            the area, which can be heard every night. Of interest is the fact that the
                                            udder had not been touched. The animal was not lactating and according to
                                            New Mexico Game Department records, the vultures had recently departed the
                                            area for the winter. Whether or not this is significant is not known.</p>
                                          <p>The carcass was revisited on two more occasions, and severe additional
                                            damage was noted to the carcass each time.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 45 which was taken at a distance of six to eight feet, shows the
                                            damage to the anus area. Noticeable blood stains near the anus area are
                                            visible where body fluids have drained.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 46 is a close-up of the same area and clearly depicts the
                                            jaggedness of the wound, particularly at the 12 o'clock position and along
                                            the entire lower left side.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 47 which is especially revealing, shows the same damage after
                                            the animal was rolled over. Canine mouth marks are clearly visible along the
                                            entire upper right edge of the cavity.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 48 is very pertinent to this entire project. It illustrates a
                                            surgically precise cut, which was made with a surgeon's scalpel by Cattle
                                            Inspector Guillen when he was revealing the symptoms of blackleg to the
                                            owner. One should keep in mind the appearance of this incision when viewing
                                            photographs of damage reportedly done "with surgical precision."</p>
                                          <p>In conclusion, the evidence uncovered in this incident is very revealing.
                                            The animal had obviously died of blackleg. The bird defecation on the
                                            carcass, the canine mouth marks along the upper right edge of the cavity,
                                            and the dog's ham bone laying nearby provide a clear indication of how and
                                            by whom the carcass was damaged.</p>
                                          <p>The photographs are also of interest. When viewed from a distance of six to
                                            eight feet (Figure No. 45), the damage to the anus area could almost be
                                            described as a perfect circle. However, when this same area is photographed,
                                            with magnification, at a closer proximity (Figure No. 46), jagged and torn
                                            edges can readily be observed. When the carcass is rolled over and the same
                                            area photographed again (Figure No. 47), mouth prints are visible, which
                                            indicate that the family dog was doing more at the carcass than merely
                                            dropping its ham bone. The dissimilarity between these cuts and the one made
                                            by Inspector Guillen with a scalpel are clearly evident in Figure No. 48. A
                                            close-up examination reveals a world of difference between this smooth,
                                            precise, uninterrupted incision and the type of "cut" revealed in the
                                            close-up photographs of the damaged anus.</p>
                                          <h3>Incident No. 14 -- December 4, 1979 -- Cordova</h3>
                                          <p>Although this incident was not reported as a mutilation, it is of special
                                            interest to the project because of the damage to the carcass. The animal was
                                            owned by a rancher from Cordova, who had noticed that his cow had not been
                                            coming to feed for several days. Instead, the animal remained in a shaded
                                            area, which was readily visible to the owner. On December 4 at 8 a.m. the
                                            owner discovered the animal had died and that the anus area had been removed
                                            in a nearly-perfect circle. Having heard about my project from his son, who
                                            is an Indian tribal police officer, the owner contacted me to see if I would
                                            be interested in observing the animal.</p>
                                          <p>Shortly afterwards I went to Cordova accompanied by Dr. Philip Shultz, a
                                            retired Santa Fe surgeon; Cipriano Padilla, district attorney investigator;
                                            and Henry Guillen, livestock inspector. In the presence of the owner and his
                                            son, we examined the animal, which was a female bovine approximately five
                                            years old. It was lying on its left side about 75 yards from the ranch
                                            house.</p>
                                          <p>There was a five to six-inch circular hole in the anus area. One common
                                            characteristic of the so-called "classic mutilation" is the perfectly cored
                                            anus. This anus certainly appeared to fit that description. However, the
                                            evidence points to scavengers rather than skilled surgeons as the parties
                                            responsible for the damage, for although the incision seems to be very
                                            smooth when viewed from a distance of six feet, closer inspection reveals
                                            that the edges of the out are actually quite jagged, particularly in the 7
                                            o'clock position. Moreover, coyote droppings were found near the carcass.
                                            According to the owner, coyotes are quite prevalent in the area as are wild
                                            dog packs.</p>
                                          <p>Evidence found at the scene indicated the animal had suffered from
                                            diarrhea. Judging from the dark color of the stool, it also had been
                                            hemorrhaging internally. A blood sample .was taken from the exterior jugular
                                            vein by Dr. Shultz. In an effort to help the owner, this specimen and a skin
                                            sample, together with other evidence collected at the scene, (i.e. blood
                                            stained leaves) were taken to Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) for
                                            analysis.</p>
                                          <p>Although unable to determine the exact cause of death, LASL in a letter
                                            dated December 7, reported that the leaves and droppings contained blood,
                                            indicating the animal had suffered from a severe bloody diarrhea. Inspector
                                            Guillen had previously suggested that red water -- a type of clostridial
                                            infection known as bacillary hemoglobiuria -- could have been the cause of
                                            death, since other cases had recently been reported in the area.
                                            Unfortunately, LASL was unable to test for clostridium perfingens, as the
                                            facilities were temporarily unavailable. However, a chemical analysis of the
                                            blood sample was conducted in their conventional proximity screen for 52
                                            agents. The results were negative. In short, there was no evidence the
                                            animal had been drugged.</p>
                                          <p>As a result of these tests, LASL concluded that the animal, which had
                                            obviously been ill for some time, had probably died from a massive
                                            infection. They also maintained that the carcass had probably been damaged
                                            by ravens, magpies, and other scavengers, for the skin sample had obviously
                                            been torn. However, there were no teeth marks found in the specimens
                                            submitted.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 49 was taken at approximately six feet from the carcass and
                                            shows a hole that could easily be described at this distance as a perfect
                                            circle. It should be noted that a collection of blood has drained into the
                                            lower portion of the cavity.</p>
                                          <p>Figure No. 50 is a close-up shot of the same area taken with a macro lens.
                                            As is evident in this picture, the edges of the circle are actually quite
                                            jagged. In addition, one can see a small portion of its innards hanging over
                                            the edge of the circle,, which is certainly a far cry from the surgical
                                            precision so often attributed to such cuts.</p>
                                          <p>In conclusion, this case again emphasizes the fact that a carcass viewed at
                                            a distance appears quite different from one viewed at closer range. As
                                            Figure No. 49 so graphically illustrates, it can easily be understood why a
                                            person viewing the carcass from a distance of several feet might describe
                                            the damaged anus as a feat of "surgical precision." Closer inspection,
                                            however, would certainly negate this conclusion. In short, both the evidence
                                            at the scene and the tests performed by LASL clearly indicate that the
                                            animal had died from natural causes and was subsequently damaged by
                                            scavengers.</p>
                                          <h3>Incident No. 15 -- January 25, 1980 -- Tijeras Canyon</h3>
                                          <p>On January 30, 1980, Dr. Clair Hibbs, director of the Animal Diagnostic
                                            Laboratory, informed me that a mutilation had been reported in Tijeras
                                            Canyon.</p>
                                          <p>I immediately contacted the owner of the animal, who stated that at 2 p.m.
                                            on January 25, he had found his two-year-old Holstein heifer dead in a
                                            pasture, located approximately 200 yards from his house. He said there was a
                                            hole, 8 inches in diameter, in the rear end of the animal, which was lying
                                            on its left side. The animal was last seen alive the night of January 24,
                                            when she was fed. According to the owner, the cow was healthy, but had not
                                            been vaccinated against blackleg.</p>
                                          <p>The owner also told me that an inspector from the New Mexico Livestock
                                            Board had examined the animal on January 26 and had indicated to the owner
                                            that it had probably died of blackleg, the carcass subsequently being
                                            damaged by animals. The owner noted there are coyotes in the area. He also
                                            pointed out that his neighbor has three dogs -- two German Shepherds and one
                                            St. Bernard. However, he said that in his opinion, these dogs would not have
                                            hurt the cow, since they were accustomed to playing together. The owner
                                            further stated that there appeared to be no bird defecation on the carcass
                                            nor any tracks nearby. However, he pointed out that the ground was frozen
                                            and therefore tracks would not likely be left.</p>
                                          <p>The owner further stated that he had been told that blackleg was not
                                            prevalent in the winter, and therefore he discounted the livestock
                                            inspector's observations. Consequently, he immediately butchered the animal,
                                            kept the choice cuts for himself, and distributed the balance of the meat to
                                            his neighbor to be used as dog food.</p>
                                          <p>As soon as I learned of this development, I contacted Dr. Hibbs and told
                                            him the owner had butchered the animal. Dr. Hibbs advised that the owner had
                                            been misinformed about blackleg, which can occur any time. Dr. Hibbs then
                                            contacted the owner and advised him about the danger of blackleg. He warned
                                            the owner that since the animal's death had not been diagnosed, the meat
                                            should be destroyed.</p>
                                          <p>On February 41 Dr. Hibbs told me he had discussed the entire situation with
                                            the owner, and had learned that the animal in question had been consuming a
                                            lot of leafy green alfalfa. Dr. Hibbs said he now believed the cow may have
                                            died of bloat. This observation is particularly interesting in view of the
                                            fact that both the owner and his neighbor, on witnessing the butchering of
                                            the animal, observed that its stomach was full of alfalfa.</p>
                                          <h2>Other Investigations</h2>
                                          <p>The following incidents were investigated primarily by officials of the New
                                            Mexico State Police, the New Mexico Livestock Board, and county sheriff
                                            departments, who communicated their findings to me as part of their
                                            participation in Operation Animal Mutilation.</p>
                                          <p>Of these 12 incidents, 5 were immediately resolved by the investigating
                                            officer upon arrival at the scene. The first incident was reported on August
                                            13 to the state police in Socorro. It was investigated by Officer Mike
                                            Martinez of the New Mexico State Police, who attributed the mutilation to
                                            obvious scavenger damage.</p>
                                          <p>The next two incidents occurred in Truchas and were reported to the state
                                            police in Espanola on September 28, 1979.</p>
                                          <p>These cases were investigated by Inspector Henry Guillen of the ,New Mexico
                                            Livestock Board. He diagnosed the cause of death as red water and claimed
                                            that no mutilation had occurred. The information on each of these three
                                            incidents was transmitted to me via state police radio. I received no
                                            additional reports.</p>
                                          <p>The last two cases were also immediately resolved at the scene. The fourth
                                            incident occurred in the Belen area and .was reported to the New Mexico
                                            Livestock Board on May 8, 1980. Livestock Inspector Joe Jackson investigated
                                            the suspected mutilation. He concluded that the animal had obviously been
                                            butchered at the scene for particular cuts of meat.</p>
                                          <p>The last incident involved the suspected mutilation of two elk in the
                                            vicinity of the Pecos Ranger Station. This incident was reported on May 13,
                                            1980, to the New Mexico Game and Fish Department. Upon investigating the
                                            alleged mutilation, Game Officer John Miles determined that the two animals
                                            had been killed by lightning, their carcasses subsequently being damaged by
                                            scavengers.</p>
                                          <p>The remaining incidents will be discussed in the pages that follow. In
                                            virtually every instance, the investigating officers reached the same
                                            verdict that my own on-the-scene investigation produced -- damage by
                                            predators and scavengers.</p>
                                          <h3>Incident No. 21 -- June 18, 1979 -- Malaga</h3>
                                          <p>On June 18 at 7:30 a.m., nine animals were reported dead in the Malaga
                                            area. The owner also told officials at the Eddy County Sheriff's office that
                                            some of the animals had been mutilated.</p>
                                          <p>On-the-scene investigation was conducted by Deputy Tommy Box, who reported
                                            finding two dead pregnant nanny goats, one dead kid goat, and six dead
                                            chickens. All of the animals were discovered in the pen in which they lived.
                                            One of the goats was missing a teat. It had puncture wounds on its throat,
                                            and a 17-inch circle of hide was missing.</p>
                                          <p>Deputy Box said the scene had been completely disturbed, since the
                                            carcasses had already been taken to the dump. However, he observed there
                                            were tracks in the pen, which he believed were made by a mountain lion. The
                                            deputy concluded that the damage had probably been done by a mountain lion,
                                            since these predators are not uncommon in the area. The number of animals
                                            killed, all of which were in a penned area, and the type of damage done is
                                            totally consistent with the normal behavior pattern for mountain lions.</p>
                                          <h3>Incident No. 22 -- October 11, 1979 Dulce</h3>
                                          <p>On October 11 at 8:45 a.m., Officer Gabe Valdez of the New Mexico State
                                            Police contacted the district attorney's office in Espanola and told the
                                            assistant district attorney, Sam Quintana, that a "classic" mutilation had
                                            occurred in Dulce the night before. (Don Hannah of the New Mexico State
                                            Police Crime Laboratory later reported that Officer Valdez had told him the
                                            .incident had occurred the previous weekend.)</p>
                                          <p>Quintana informed Valdez that I was in Silver City investigating another
                                            cattle mutilation, but that he would furnish the information to coordinating
                                            secretary, Diana Moyle. Moyle then contacted me and I instructed her to
                                            immediately call the state police crime laboratory and request that
                                            personnel be sent immediately to Dulce to assist in the investigation. I
                                            felt such an action was warranted since Officer Valdez had determined the
                                            mutilation was a "classic." I then proceeded to the scene at Dulce,
                                            accompanied by district attorney investigator, Cipriano Padilla.</p>
                                          <p>While I was enroute, Officer Valdez contacted the coordinating secretary
                                            and told her he had learned that I and personnel from the state police crime
                                            laboratory were on our way to Dulce. Valdez said that the owner of the
                                            mutilated animal did not want the crime laboratory nor any investigative
                                            team headed by me to enter her property to conduct an investigation for fear
                                            of publicity. The officer said he had just contacted the state police crime
                                            laboratory and had cancelled their trip. He advised Moyle to radio this
                                            information to me. After learning about the change in plans, I decided it
                                            best to cancel the proposed investigation.</p>
                                          <p>Four months later, during a conversation with Officer Valdez on February
                                            26, 1980, he referred to this incident and again stated that the owner had
                                            not wanted the mutilation investigated. I consider it unfortunate that the
                                            owner's fear about publicity led her to reject our offer to investigate the
                                            incident. I thought it was generally known that I was not releasing any
                                            information to the media concerning any investigation I was conducting.</p>
                                          <p>Interestingly, in regards to the media, Officer Valdez has been one of the
                                            more outspoken individuals on cattle mutilations. He has taken a special
                                            interest in this mutilation phenomenon, and is probably one of New Mexico's
                                            foremost proponents of the theory that many of these cattle deaths and
                                            subsequent mutilations are engineered by humans. His articulate reports have
                                            frequently captured the favor of the press, which places a premium on
                                            attention-getting news.</p>
                                          <p>During our conversation, Officer Valdez stated that since my project began,
                                            he has investigated several other reported mutilations. However, since none
                                            were "classic mutilations," he decided not to report them to me. However, he
                                            assured me that if he learned of any other mutilations that appeared to be
                                            "classic" cases, he would immediately protect the crime scene and contact,
                                            me so that I could conduct an investigation.</p>
                                          <p>It should also be noted that during this interview, Valdez admitted to me
                                            that he realized that a tremendous amount of misinformation has been
                                            circulated regarding cattle mutilations. Nevertheless, he stated he was
                                            certain that the ones that had occurred in Dulce were all "classics." This
                                            is a strange comment coming from an individual who, at Senator Schmitt's
                                            hearing, had testified that there had been 90 cattle mutilations in New
                                            Mexico. Officer Valdez then said he would furnish me with all the
                                            information he had collected on cattle mutilations in order to assist with
                                            this project. To date, not one piece of material has been received.</p>
                                          <h3>Incident No. 23 -- October 15, 1979 -- Jordan</h3>
                                          <p>This investigation was initiated following a report to the New Mexico State
                                            Police of a possible mutilation in the Jordan area. On-the-scene examination
                                            was conducted by Captain Carroll of the New Mexico State Police.
                                            Accompanying him were Officer Leonard Elis of the New Mexico State Police in
                                            Melrose, Inspector Ray Hester of the New Mexico Livestock Board, and Joel
                                            Garrett of the Quay County Sheriff's office in Tucumcari.</p>
                                          <p>The animal in question was a 16-month-old heifer calf, which weighed
                                            approximately 700 pounds. The carcass was found lying on its left side about
                                            50 yards north of a roadway. The animal was last seen alive on October 11.
                                            It had been found dead on October 15, but was not reported to authorities
                                            until October 18. The carcass was in an advanced stage of bloating. The anus
                                            and udder areas were damaged as well as the mouth, nose, and left ear.</p>
                                          <p>The investigators concluded that the damage, which indicated irregular
                                            tearing, was totally consistent with normal predator and scavenger activity.
                                            Bird and canine defecation as well as canine tracks were observed near the
                                            carcass. Domestic dogs, who lived at a farm one-half mile east of the
                                            carcass, had been seen by their owner going to and from the dead animal.</p>
                                          <p>Upon examining the carcass the investigators found a round hole,
                                            approximately three-eights inch in diameter, in the neck. When a wire was
                                            placed in this hole, an entrance and exit wound were discovered. These
                                            wounds, together with the projectile pattern, indicated the animal had
                                            probably been shot. it should be noted that during this period of time there
                                            had been antelope hunting in the area. Subsequent interviews revealed that
                                            hunters had indeed been operating in the vicinity. The investigators thus
                                            concluded that the animal had been shot, the carcass subsequently being
                                            damaged by scavengers.</p>
                                          <h3>Incident No. 24 -- October 27, 1979 -- Carrizozo</h3>
                                          <p>On October 27 at 9:30 p.m., I was advised by Deputy William Hasenbuhler of
                                            the Lincoln County Sheriff's office, that he had investigated a cattle
                                            mutilation in Socorro County that day. Although the carcass had reportedly
                                            been found before 10 that morning, the sheriff's office had not been
                                            notified until approximately 5:15 p.m.</p>
                                          <p>According to Hasenbuhler the animal was a 10 to 14-year-old cow and weighed
                                            between 900 and 1000 pounds. The animal had been, dead for about two days
                                            and had a decided odor. The carcass was lying on its right side, and the
                                            left eye, according to Hasenbuhler, looked like it had been pecked out by
                                            birds. A piece of hide, 2-1/2 square feet in size was missing, as was the
                                            udder. The anus also "appeared to have been eaten by predators." In
                                            addition, the rear portion of the carcass "had been eaten to such an extent
                                            that the hip was out of the socket." The tongue, however, was intact.</p>
                                          <p>Deputy Hasenbuhler said that when he arrived on the scene, he had observed
                                            an eagle on the carcass. He also reported finding canine tracks in the
                                            immediate vicinity and bird defecation on the body. The deputy pointed out
                                            that the area where the carcass was lying has a heavy population of black
                                            ravens. According to him, the vultures had apparently departed for the
                                            season, and the area is not frequented by magpies.</p>
                                          <h3>Incident No. 25 -- November 7, 1979 -- Ojo Caliente</h3>
                                          <p>On November 9, the superintendent of Carson National Forest informed me
                                            that a soil scientist assigned to that forest had, discovered a dead bovine
                                            heifer near Ojo Caliente. The animal, which weighed approximately 600
                                            pounds, was lying on its right side. Its head was missing and there was a
                                            five-inch hole in the anus area. The soil scientist estimated that the
                                            heifer had been dead for approximately two days.</p>
                                          <p>I immediately contacted Ray Brown, the district ranger for this area, who
                                            told me he was familiar with the carcass and had first seen it on November 3
                                            and again on November 6.. Brown said when he first saw the animal its head
                                            and udder were still intact, but the eyes and anus were being pecked out by
                                            birds, whom he personally observed working on the carcass.</p>
                                          <p>In conclusion, most of the damage to the carcass was undoubtedly inflicted
                                            by birds, who were actually seen on the animal. One can only speculate as to
                                            what happened to the head, especially since it was still intact when the
                                            carcass was first observed. However, it should be noted that the skulls of
                                            bovine animals are commonly used as yard decorations by people wishing to
                                            create a Southwestern decor. In fact, the current prices for such skulls
                                            range from $50 to $75, depending on where they are purchased.</p>
                                          <h3>Incident No. 26 December 24, 1979 -- Malaga</h3>
                                          <p>On December 24, Deputy Tommy Box of the Eddie County Sheriff's office
                                            conducted an on-the-scene investigation of a 400-pound yearling steer, which
                                            had been reported dead and mutilated. On December 27, Deputy Box returned to
                                            the scene accompanied by Sgt. Bob Dodgin of the New Mexico State Police and
                                            Morgan Bates of the New Mexico Livestock Board.</p>
                                          <p>The animal was lying on its right side. Its anus area was damaged and there
                                            was a large opening in its left side.</p>
                                          <p>Although the investigating officers believed this area had been cut, the
                                            edges were very jagged. The animal's stomach was laying on the ground a few
                                            feet in front of this opening. When the carcass was first examined by Deputy
                                            Box, a three-inch piece of meat was also found on the ground a few feet
                                            behind the animal.</p>
                                          <p>Although both the owner and Deputy Box believed the calf had previously
                                            been healthy, a necropsy performed at the scene by Dr. Dean Reynolds
                                            revealed lesions on its lungs, which were diagnosed as two-week-old
                                            pneumonia. Dr. Reynolds concluded the animal had died from pneumonia.
                                            However, he said he could not explain the missing rectum or the cavity in
                                            the side of the animal. In his report he states that "it looks like someone
                                            is playing games after the calf died."</p>
                                          <p>This animal, like the one described next in the Loving incident, had
                                            recently been brought from Texas. I have been told that it is not uncommon
                                            to find pneumonia in animals that have been recently transported from Texas
                                            into New Mexico, particularly during the winter months.</p>
                                          <p>Photographs of this incident were obtained and have been made part of the
                                            project file.</p>
                                          <h3>Incident No. 27 -- December 27, 1979 -- Loving</h3>
                                          <p>This investigation was initiated by the New Mexico State Police as the
                                            result of a report made by Deputy Tommy Box of the Eddy County Sheriff's
                                            office. On December 27, Sgt. Bob Dodgin of the New Mexico State Police
                                            arrived at the scene. Accompanying him were Deputy Box and Morgan Bates of
                                            the New Mexico Livestock Board.</p>
                                          <p>The animal, a 300-pound heifer, was found lying on its right side. It had
                                            been dead between eight and twelve hours. The soft tissues both above and
                                            surrounding the nostril were missing, as was the nostril itself. No other
                                            damage was noted. The feces oozing from the rectum contained blood and
                                            mucus, which is obviously one reason why this area is such a likely target
                                            for predators.</p>
                                          <p>The calf appeared to have been sick. In fact, the officers on the scene
                                            decided it had probably died of pneumonia. This diagnosis was later
                                            confirmed by Dr. Dean Reynolds, a Carlsbad veterinarian. The calf had just
                                            been shipped to this area from south Texas. In fact, all the calves in this
                                            particular pasture were sick and being treated for "shipping fever" or
                                            pneumonia by Dr. Reynolds.</p>
                                          <p>No tracks were observed at the scene, but as the official report points
                                            out, this was probably due to the hardness of the ground and the fact that
                                            many cattle had been milling around. However, the report also notes there
                                            were several wild dogs in the area. The officers suspected that the skin an
                                            meaty area of the nose had been eaten by scavengers. They further theorized
                                            that something had started eating on the carcass but was scared away at
                                            daylight perhaps by traffic from the road, which tan only a few yards from
                                            the carcass.</p>
                                          <p>It should be kept in mind that all of the cases investigated under this
                                            project -- with the exception of the T-Bone and Cordova incidents -- were
                                            reported as mutilations. Furthermore, in the majority of these cases, the
                                            term "surgical precision" was used to describe the damage.</p>
