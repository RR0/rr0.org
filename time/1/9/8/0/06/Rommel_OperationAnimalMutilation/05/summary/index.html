<p> In summary, it is evident from the data presented in this chapter that the vast majority of the incidents
  investigated in other states have been resolved by authorities as "predator/ scavenger damage." This is particularly
  true in states such as Oklahoma where the problem has been more thoroughly studied. The role played by the media in
  fostering the mutilation phenomenon is also apparent in this chapter, particularly in the discussion of the Colorado
  and Arkansas incidents.</p>
<p> As noted in my introductory remarks, the information obtained from other states closely parallels that which I
  collected in New Mexico. As in New Mexico, the media accounts from other states tend to promote the bizarre nature of
  livestock mutilations, whereas the data received from qualified investigators and experienced veterinarians basically
  confirm the conclusions I have reached in my New Mexico investigation -- that the vast majority of reported
  mutilations are induced by scavengers.</p>
<p> In the few cases where human involvement was determined, the culprits were not highly sophisticated "surgeons" but
  pranksters, publicity seekers, and other ordinary individuals. In short, the "classic mutilation" as a widespread
  phenomenon endangering the livestock industry does not stand up to close scrutiny of the facts.</p>
<p> In regard to drugs, see Appendix IV. </p>
