<p> One major objective of this project was to make recommendations to the law enforcement community. Since my
  investigation revealed that the vast majority of reported mutilations are not a law enforcement problem, my first
  recommendation is that no additional money be spent to fund law enforcement investigations of this phenomenon. It
  should be noted, however, that this conclusion does not apply to other types of investigations, for I believe that
  useful and revealing studies can be done by anthropologists, psychologists, sociologists, and other behavioral
  scientists.</p>
<p> Although I believe that most reported mutilations are caused by predators and scavengers, this does not mean that
  you, as a law enforcement officer, might not be summoned to investigate a suspected mutilation. In the event that this
  occurs, you should conduct an investigation that is sufficient to determine if the facts, as alleged, are in violation
  of a particular state statute, such as unlawful killing, unlawful butchering, or stealing of animals.</p>
<p> If so, you should conduct a logical investigation to collect evidence and testimony to support a successful
  prosecution of the individuals involved.</p>
<p> If not, you should investigate the incident no further. For example, you would not conduct a homicide investigation
  after it had been established that the individual had died a natural death or had committed suicide. The same
  reasoning should be used in investigating livestock mutilations.</p>
<p> Don't use terms such as "surgical precision," which are conclusions. Stay with the facts, let the laboratory experts
  make conclusions. Also, don't be mislead by statements made by non-authoritative sources, for as Adolf Hitler once
  said: "Tell a lie enough times and it will be believed" (KAFE, April 23, 1980).</p>
<p> While I would hesitate to classify these colorful reports as deliberate lies, nevertheless the principle remains the
  same. Constant repetition of even some of the most sensational conjectures may eventually be accepted as truth.
  Perhaps Dr. Samuel Johnson expressed it best when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is more from carelessness about truth than from intentional lying, that there is so much falsehood in the
    world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is my sincere hope that the conclusions reached in this report will help those engaged in the cattle industry and
  others to put behind them the rumors, theories and fears that some highly organized criminal activity or
  extraterrestrial conspiracy is responsible for these mutilations. If this year-long investigation has achieved this
  one result, then all of the time, effort, and research will have proved most worthwhile.</p>
<p> However, I tend to agree with the following observation made by Dr. Stewart in a letter which he sent to me dated
  May 13, 1980:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The efforts of knowledgeable experts hopefully will provide a rational explanation for this bizarre episode.
    Unfortunately, the histories of similar events show that reasonable, scientific explanations may deflect or deter,
    but never completely eliminate the fantastic explanations that gullible, naive persons adopt.</p>
