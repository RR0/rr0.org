<p>The police officer who recently claimed that 96 animals had been mutilated in New Mexico was remarkably accurate in
  terms of the number of incidents that had been reported when this project began. However, after carefully examining
  the evidence cited in available reports, I have discovered that none of these cases could be confirmed as classic
  mutilations.</p>
<p>In fact, of the incidents investigated between 1975 and May 1979, I have found only two cases in which the animal in
  question was actually mutilated with a knife. Both incidents were investigated by the New Mexico Livestock Board. The
  first one, however, is not included in my list of 90 cases, since no official report was filed. Instead, information
  about this case was obtained in an interview with Pat Archuleta, supervisor of the livestock board, who told me that
  about four years ago he was summoned to a reported mutilation near Galisteo.</p>
<p>On-the-scene investigation revealed that a burro had been mutilated by a sharp instrument. Recognizing the animal as
  one he had seen several days before at a ranch south of Santa Fe, he questioned the owner about the incident. The
  owner told Archuleta that the animal had died and that he had taken the, body and dumped it off the highway near
  Galisteo. When asked about the knife cuts, the rancher admitted that he had made them himself so that it would be
  easier for scavengers to "finish off" the animal.</p>
<p>The second case involved a report of a mutilated cow in the Anton Chico area. Further investigation by the livestock
  inspector revealed that the cow had been killed by lightning and had subsequently been cut with a knife by a person
  who had been feuding with the owner.</p>
<p>These two mutilations, though obviously done with sharp instruments, are a far cry from the "classic mutilation"
  described in the literature. The other cases fit this description even less. In fact, in three incidents, the
  investigator determined that no mutilation had occurred. In the two cases which were documented, the animal was found
  dead, but none of its organs were missing.</p>
<p>In addition to the cases cited above 66 other incidents can be resolved, at least, tentatively, on the basis of the
  evidence provided in the reports (see Table 2). The 21 remaining cases, however, do not contain the details needed to
  determine either the cause of death or the mutilation.</p>
<p>In most of the "resolvable" cases, the evidence suggests death by natural causes and/or damage by scavengers. In
  fact, 14 alleged mutilations were immediately resolved by the investigating officers as scavenger-induced.
  Twenty-three cases (an additional nineteen incidents) cited evidence of bird tracks, animal tracks, or animal hair at
  the scene. In a "classic mutilation," as you may recall, animals and birds are supposed to avoid the carcass.</p>
<p>Although less conclusive, the following characteristics are much more reminiscent of the less precise, piecemeal
  activities of scavengers than the meticulous skill and organization attributed to the "phantom surgeons of the
  plains;"</p>
<ol>
  <li>The partial removal of an organ such as the tongue or penis;</li>
  <li> The removal of only the exposed eye and/or ear;</li>
  <li> The subsequent removal of the tongue, ear, or other organ after the carcass has been initially examined. A total
    of 20 cases (an additional 10) share at least one of these traits.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cause of death was determined in 26 cases, 15 of which also bore evidence of scavenger activity. Contrary to the lore
  surrounding the classic mutilation, there was nothing mysterious about these deaths -- nothing to suggest a high dose
  of radiation or exsanguination by highly trained surgeons. Most of these animals died from diseases such as blackleg.
  In a letter dated April 22, 1977, Dr. Donald F. Petersen points out that LASL has examined approximately 15 suspected
  mutilations with the following results:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "We have made the observation that in most instances, gas-forming bacilli have been culture from tissues, and both
    the autopsy findings and the bacteriology are consistent with the conclusion that the animals died from
    blackleg."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to death from disease, several cattle were fatally injured and at least two cows died while giving
  birth.</p>
<p>In 11 suspected mutilations, the animal had been reported dead for more than two days. In eight of these cases, the
  reports contain no evidence as to cause of death or scavenger activity. Rather, the nature of the mutilation is
  usually described, followed by the observation that the carcass was badly decomposed. Such a description, though not
  constituting evidence of scavenger activity, does argue strongly against labeling the mutilation a "classic."</p>
<p>In the first place, classic mutilations are generally supposed to decay very slowly. Secondly, the process of decay,
  especially if advanced, will distort any cuts originally made in the animal. To use the expression "surgical
  precision" when describing missing organs on a badly decomposed animal is a distinct contradiction in terms. Many
  veterinarians question the validity of results obtained from necropsies performed 24 hours after an animal's death.
  One wonders how much more questionable the opinions of a layman would be, especially if the animal in question has
  been dead for five days as in the case just cited.</p>
<p>In summary, of the 90 mutilations reported in New Mexico between February 1975 and May 1979, 69 (77%) can be
  explained, at least partly, on the basis of available evidence. Eighteen cases were resolved immediately by the
  investigators. An additional 28 "mutilations" were associated with scavenger activity. In 19 cases, the evidence cited
  was not detailed enough to infer scavenger damage. However, the information provided was sufficient to definitely rule
  out the verdict, . classic mutilation," for either the cause of death was known and attributed to natural causes or
  routine injury, or the carcass was too decomposed for tests. In short, the term classic mutilation" and all that it
  infers cannot be applied, with any justification, to the 69 cases just discussed. To do so would require a wild
  imagination coupled with an ability to totally disregard the facts. In the remaining 21 cases, the evidence presented
  was not sufficient to determine the cause of death or to assess the nature of the mutilation.</p>
