<p>On December 24, Deputy Tommy Box of the Eddie County Sheriff's office conducted an on-the-scene investigation of a
  400-pound yearling steer, which had been reported dead and mutilated. On December 27, Deputy Box returned to the scene
  accompanied by Sgt. Bob Dodgin of the New Mexico State Police and Morgan Bates of the New Mexico Livestock Board.</p>
<p>The animal was lying on its right side. Its anus area was damaged and there was a large opening in its left side.</p>
<p>Although the investigating officers believed this area had been cut, the edges were very jagged. The animal's stomach
  was laying on the ground a few feet in front of this opening. When the carcass was first examined by Deputy Box, a
  three-inch piece of meat was also found on the ground a few feet behind the animal.</p>
<p>Although both the owner and Deputy Box believed the calf had previously been healthy, a necropsy performed at the
  scene by Dr. Dean Reynolds revealed lesions on its lungs, which were diagnosed as two-week-old pneumonia. Dr. Reynolds
  concluded the animal had died from pneumonia. However, he said he could not explain the missing rectum or the cavity
  in the side of the animal. In his report he states that "it looks like someone is playing games after the calf
  died."</p>
<p>This animal, like the one described next in the Loving incident, had recently been brought from Texas. I have been
  told that it is not uncommon to find pneumonia in animals that have been recently transported from Texas into New
  Mexico, particularly during the winter months.</p>
<p>Photographs of this incident were obtained and have been made part of the project file.</p>
