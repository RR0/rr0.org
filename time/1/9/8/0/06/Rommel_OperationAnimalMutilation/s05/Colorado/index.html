<p> One of the first reported mutilations in the country to receive widespread publicity was the now-<a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MutilationsBetail/Lady">famous case of "Snippy" the horse</a>. On <time>1967-09-09</time>,
  at Alamosa, Colorado, an appaloosa horse named "Snippy" was found dead and mysteriously "mutilated." Numerous UFO
  sightings were reported in the area, which, according to the owner, were somehow involved with the animal's untimely
  demise.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some residents of this area, including the three-year-old appaloosa's owner, claimed Snippy was a victim of a
    flying saucer after his carcass was found with flesh stripped from the head and back (New Mexican, Oct. 14,
    1967).</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The incident assumed even more bizarre proportions after a necropsy was performed on the animal. As a UPI (1967)
  story states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The mystery surrounding the death of the appaloosa from Alamosa deepened Monday with the disclosure that a Denver
    pathologist took a belated autopsy on the horse and found the brain and stomach cavities to be empty. Ms. Lewis said
    the doctor sawed into the brain cavity and found 'absolutely nothing' and opened the stomach expecting to find
    remains of digestive organs, but found only a 'little powdery residue.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interest in and speculation about the Snippy case has continued up to the present. In the January 1980 issue of OMNI
  Magazine, this incident is rehashed again in an article entitled "Death on the Range -- UFO Update". </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Subsequent examination by a Denver pathologist revealed that the flesh had been cut with such precision as to
    preclude the use of a knife. The examination also excluded the possibility that predators had been responsible for
    the animal's death (Lebelson 1980: 28).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My interest in this incident became aroused when, after reading numerous articles stressing the bizarre nature of
  Snippy's death, I came across an article by Pearl M. Nicholas (1972), which appeared in the Valley Courier. The
  article stated that two .22 caliber bullets had been found in Snippy's body by Dr. Wallace Leary. Realizing that if
  this were true it would cast a different light on Snippy's death, I tried to locate Dr. Leary. After considerable
  effort, I finally discovered that he was now employed as a staff officer with the United States Department of
  Agriculture in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p> Dr. Leary told me that although he was contacted by the owner the day Snippy died, he did not examine the horse
  until more than A month later when he was given the carcass for use as a teaching specimen. Upon cleaning the
  skeleton, he said he, discovered what appeared to be two bullet holes. When I asked how he made this determination, he
  said he recognized what was clearly an entry and exit-type wound in the pelvic bone.</p>
<p> Although he found no bullets in the animal, Dr. Leary said he believed Snippy had been shot, -- perhaps by youths
  driving along a nearby highway. He said he thought it possible that Snippy, after being shot, "ran himself to death"
  through one of the many broken-down barbed wire fences that dotted his pasture. According to Dr. Leary, such an event
  would explain the wounds that were described to him the morning Snippy was found.</p>
<p> I asked him if any veterinarian had performed a necropsy on Snippy. He told me that about a month after Snippy died,
  a necropsy was performed by Dr. Robert O. Adams, now deceased, of the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical
  Science at Colorado State University. Dr. Leary stated that as far as he can recall, the necropsy revealed nothing
  unusual.</p>
<p> A more detailed account of the results of this necropsy was reported in the October 14, 1967 issue of the New
  Mexican (1967). The article also states that Dr. Adams' investigation of the carcass revealed nothing that could not
  be explained in natural terms., The following observations made by Dr. Adams are interesting, especially in view of
  the fact that Snippy's owner reportedly "declined to release the name of the pathologist because he requested secrecy"
  (UPI 1967). </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Bacteria, birds and coyotes were responsible for the absence of organs in the abdominal cavity, Dr. Adams said.
    Predators had eaten away part of the horse's rump, exposing the cavity, he added. It was normal under the
    circumstances that the brain cavity was devoid of fluid, he said. Because all tissue was gone from the skull, the
    opening in the back was exposed to the air. Since the brain, after death, liquefied in hours, the fluid evaporated
    quickly in the warm prairie air he said. It was at least 30 days after Snippy's death before anyone examined the
    carcass, and the longest the fluid could have remained would have been two weeks, Dr. Adams said.</p>
  <p> 'I know it's going to pop the bubble.' Dr. Adams said, 'but the horse was not killed by a flying saucer. Dr. Adams
    said his findings at this point are speculative, but 'there was some evidence that severe infection had been present
    in the right flank area. That can kill a horse in a short time.' Dr. Adams also said there was evidence that the
    skin in front of the shoulder had been incised. This could mean, he said, that someone found Snippy down and
    suffering and cut his throat to end the pain. Dr. Adams said the incision could have attracted birds and other
    predators which stripped away the flesh from the neck and head" (New Mexican 1967).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, the information provided by these two veterinarians completely discredits the bizarre stories that have
  been circulating for the past 13 years about Snippy. Nevertheless, such rumors continue to persist. In fact, Snippy's
  skeleton -- originally prepared for a teaching specimen is apparently now on display in Alamosa as "the horse that got
  zapped by a UFO."</p>
<p> The case of "Snippy the horse" was merely a prelude of what was later to become a major phenomenon in the state of
  Colorado. During the decade that followed, hundreds of live-stock mutilations were reported by area ranchers. The
  problem was considered so serious that a reward of $25,000 was offered by several Colorado agencies for information
  leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for mutilating livestock.</p>
<p> The phenomenon seemed to peak in 1975, for between the months of April and December of that year, 203 reports were
  investigated by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Thirty-five suspected mutilations were examined by
  Colorado State University, 19 of which were found suitable for tests.</p>
<p> Of these 19 animals, the university determined that 11 died of natural causes. In the remaining eight cases, the
  cause of death could not be determined. Five cases were confirmed as predator attacks and nine as willful mutilations.
  Three incidents were thought to involve a possible combination of the two. The university also determined that in all
  mutilations involving the use of sharp instruments, the cuts were made following the animal's death.</p>
<p> In a letter to the New Mexico State Police dated July 10, 1978, the CBI describes their investigations more
  explicitly: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "During our investigation of the cattle mutilation problem in Colorado, the CBI laboratory examined approximately
    40 hide samples. of these, two were found to have been cut with a sharp instrument. In a six-month period, our
    agents spent 1,557 man-hours on this investigation, which included undercover operations. We were never able to
    identify any person or persons as being responsible for these, so-called, mutilations. The scientifically based
    evidence obtained points to cattle which died of natural causes being attacked by predators."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reporters had a field day with livestock mutilations. in fact, in 1975, this topic was voted the top news story in
  the state by the Colorado Associated Press. The 1975 cases also provided the basis for one of the first books on
  livestock mutilations -- a small volume by Frederick W. Smith (1976) entitled "Cattle Mutilation: The Unthinkable
  Truth".<br> <br> One of the many writers and reporters to develop a special interest in this phenomenon was a man by
  the name of Dane Edwards. Edwards was the editor of a small weekly newspaper in Brush until he "mysteriously"
  disappeared. According to Thompson (1979), Edwards had developed an uncanny familiarity with livestock mutilations.
  Then one day, he mysteriously disappeared. His wife filed a missing person's report. Eventually Edwards was traced to
  a motel in Denver, where he apparently left unpaid bills, but there the trail ended. Thompson (1979c) notes that
  before his disappearance, the newsman had hinted that his life was being threatened.</p>
<p> What ever happened to Dane Edwards? Was he "silenced" because he was getting too close to the truth, or was his
  disappearance deliberately engineered by the government for whom he allegedly worked as a secret agent? Speculation
  ran wild. But regardless of which theory one advocated, most people concerned about Edwards agreed on one thing --
  that his disappearance had something to do with livestock mutilations (Smith 1976: 40-42).</p>
<p> Since the Edwards story was frequently being cited as evidence by those who claimed that there was something
  sinister behind the livestock mutilation phenomenon, I decided it worthwhile to investigate this incident further. On
  August 31, 1979, a reliable source informed me that Edwards had actually been fired by his newspaper and had
  reportedly moved to Texas to write a book on cattle mutilations. I later contacted Drusylla Georgeson, current
  publisher and owner of The Banner newspaper in Brush., In a letter dated December 31, 1979, she informed me that
  Edwards had been employed by The Banner from May through October 1975, when he was terminated because of poor business
  practices. She said that this was one of the reasons why Edwards left the area. In fact, she stated that she
  personally saw him leave a few days later with his children.</p>
<p> George C. Erianne, a friend of Edwards, informed me that Edwards had left Brush "owing money to everyone." In
  addition, I learned from the assistant district attorney in Denver that there is an outstanding warrant, -- filed
  March 1916 -- against Dane Edwards for defrauding the Denver Travel Lodge in November 1975.</p>
<p> Despite these rather revealing facts, stories began to circulate about Edwards' mysterious disappearance. According
  to an article which was published in the Brush Banner on December 10, 1975, Mrs. Edwards claimed that her husband was
  still missing and that she had filed a missing persons report in Colorado Springs and in Euless, Texas. The article
  goes on to make the following observation, which casts serious doubts on her statements: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The Banner telephoned the Euless and Arlington, Texas Police Departments on Monday to verify the missing person
    report, and were told that no reports were on file. The Colorado Springs, Colorado Police Department stated that a
    report had been filed, and was canceled on Saturday afternoon, December 8th" (Brush Banner 1975).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, on the basis of the evidence just cited, there is good reason to believe that Edwards rather than being
  spirited away because of involvement with the mutilation phenomena probably left Colorado because of unpaid debts and
  an outstanding arrest warrant.</p>
<p> Another piece of evidence which has frequently been cited as proof that the Colorado mutilations are conducted by
  some highly sophisticated group is the necropsy report submitted by a Colorado veterinarian, September 1, 1978,
  following an examination of a six-month-old Hereford steer that was reported mutilated. This necropsy, which was
  performed at the request of the sheriff's department was subsequently written up in two reports,-- a necropsy record
  and a necropsy report, in which the veterinarian offers his opinions of the incident based on data furnished in the
  necropsy record.</p>
<p> This veterinarian's report, which is taken as the gospel truth by a number of independent investigators, has many of
  the earmarks of the "classic mutilation" -- the animal drained of blood by some mysterious force prior to death, the
  removal of certain organs with a "sharp cutting instrument," and the lack of blood at the scene. To better understand
  the role which this veterinarian has played in promoting the mutilation phenomenon, his necropsy report is reproduced
  below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Necropsy Report</strong><br> <br> (1) The entire animal was clean; appearing as though recently washed and
    brushed. No dirt or mud was present on, or between the claws of the hooves, and no blood was present at puncture or
    excision sites. No marks of physical restraint were evident.<br> <br> (2) No evidence of terminal struggle was
    present, the animal being found in right lateral recumbency amid several. small Aspen trees in a normal postmortem
    position, head slightly downhill.<br> <br> (3) The animal's left eye, anus, distal prepuse and penis were cleanly
    severed with a sharp cutting instrument in a practiced fashion. The distal 1/3 of the tongue and the lips on the
    left side were also removed with a sharp cutting instrument however; (a) multiple strokes were employed to remove
    the lips, inconsistent with the precision of the other excisions, and (b) in an anesethetized or freshly killed
    animal, the tongue can be readily grasped and extended beyond the point where it was severed, without removal of the
    lips necessary to gain access.<br> <br> Based on examination findings, it is my opinion that the animal was captured
    and restrained by a chemical agent (injected behind the right elbow) which did not cause him to lie down nor fall.
    once under restraint, the following sequence appears evident:<br> <br> (A) The animal was completely washed and
    dried.<br> <br> (B) Removal of the animal's blood was begun via a 12-14 gauge needle inserted into the left jugular
    vein.<br> <br> In the anesethetized or heavily sedated animal, the animal's own heart will continue to function and
    act as a pump until nearly all its blood has been drained.<br> <br> The necropsy findings of subcutaneous and
    intramuscular hemorrhage and emphysema in the cervical and brisket regions indicate that at some point during this
    process, the needle became dislodged from the vein. These lesions are seen following death of an animal which has
    recently been treated by the administration of intravenous medication and caused the needle to become dislodged by
    struggling. This may coincide in this case with the administration of additional chemical restraint agent in the
    muscles of the back (wound and muscle lesion with emphysema in mid-theracic area).<br> <br> (C) A second
    veinapuncture was accomplished in the left jugular, and removal of the animal's blood continued until nearly
    complete. Total exsanguination by this method is not possible.<br> <br> (D) The eye, prepuce and penis, anus, lip,
    and tongue were then excised. With the majority of the animal's blood removed, bleeding from these peripheral sites
    would be almost nonexistent.<br> <br> (E) The animal was then abandoned, still standing, and he moved to the point
    of discovery under his own power, collapsing and dying from cerebral anoxia. Muscle stores of energy not dependent
    upon available oxygen are present which would allow the animal to move a short distance.<br> <br> To accomplish this
    process I believe would require; a minimum of two individuals; a period of 1-2 hours (primarily for cleaning the
    animal, as the exsanguination and excision of organs could be accomplished in 15-20 minutes or less); a capture gun,
    blowgun, or specially designed arrow; one or more sharp knives and/or scissors; hypodermic needles; and some
    knowledge of bovine anatomy and treatment procedures (but not in excess of that possessed by many ranchers who have
    observed and treated their own animals.<br> <br> The method of utilizing the animals own heart as a. pump to
    accomplish exsanguination is only practiced, to my knowledge, in such places which seek to replace the blood with a
    preservative chemical in order to more adequately preserve the entire carcass or to replace the blood with colored
    latex for identification of the vessels for the teaching of anatomy.</p>

<p> To help determine whether or not the opinions and conclusions advocated in the necropsy report are supported by the
  facts contained in the necropsy record, a copy of this record is reproduced as follows: </p>

</blockquote>
<p> To evaluate these necropsy reports, I contacted seven very experienced veterinarians. Of these seven veterinarians,
  five were board certified pathologists. Four of them had had extensive experience in diagnostic work.</p>
<p> Six of them stated that the opinions as set forth by the veterinarian in the necropsy report were not supported by
  the data. Their comments ranged from "honorable and sincere, but misguided," to "a bunch of malarkey." One stated that
  the "conclusions drawn were ridiculous" while another commented "I laughed myself silly" reading this material.</p>
<p> One of the seven veterinarians declined to comment on this material, but he did offer an opinion on cattle
  mutilations in general. He stated that in all the examinations made by his laboratory in regard to cattle mutilations,
  no human involvement was over established. Rather, the animals died of natural causes and were subsequently mutilated
  by scavengers.</p>
<p> After having reviewed the comments from these veterinarians, I then wrote a letter to the Colorado veterinarian who
  had written these reports and requested him to answer 16 questions, which had been furnished to me by some of the
  veterinarians just cited. He eventually agreed to do so. The questions and his answers are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> 1. Was the enclosed necropsy record and necropsy report prepared by you?<br> <br> ANSWER: Yes<br> <br> 2. Are they
    complete the way they are enclosed or are there additional documents concerning this examination which are
    missing?<br> <br> ANSWER: Documents detailing the results of laboratory testing are not included.<br> <br> 3. If the
    record and report were prepared by you, has any additional information come to your attention in regards to this
    examination that would alter your conclusions?<br> <br> ANSWER: None, although the postmortem removal of parts and
    organs should be considered as well as ante-mortem.<br> <br> 4. It is noted that the necropsy record contains a
    notation that tissue samples were taken in regards to the lung, kidney, liver, gallbladder, urinary bladder, spleen,
    and cardiac muscle. The report states that rumen contents were also taken. Were any examinations conducted in
    regards to these samples and if so, were the results of any significance to your observation?<br> <br> ANSWER:
    Samples taken were submitted to State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for toxological and histological
    analysis. Results were not significant to necropsy observations.<br> <br> 5. Would not one normally expect the loss
    of an eye, tongue, lips, anus and rectum from the predation of scavengers and carnivores if a dead animal should be
    left thirty-six hours in the field?<br> <br> ANSWER: No. An eye or the tongue, perhaps, but the other parts missing
    in this case are not scavenger target organs and would only have been torn or removed to gain access to the
    intestines. The abdominal cavity was intact.<br> <br> 6. Is it not a rule rather than the exception for these
    animals to do a neat job and not leave either blood or a mess at the site of the carcass?<br> <br> ANSWER: The
    neatness qualities inherent in beak or tooth are significantly different from those arising from a knife edge
    cut.<br> <br> 7. Would it not be normal to expect animals that are in confinement or in a feedlot to be dirty and
    those out on the range to have a clean, brushed hair coat and not have mud or dirt between their hooves?<br> <br>
    ANSWER: No, it would not.<br> <br> 8. Was the possibility of tetanus considered inasmuch as the animal had been
    castrated with an elastic band?<br> <br> ANSWER: No. The castration site had been completely healed for several
    months and no evidence of infection existed at this area.<br> <br> 9. Necrosis of the cortex of the kidney and
    necrosis of the spleen were reported on gross examination of the organs. Would it have been of interest to have had
    these lesions examined histologically? <br> <br> ANSWER: It might have, but it wasn't. Both histopathological
    studies and cultures were requested, were performed, and were not informative.<br> <br> 10. If one assumed that the
    necrosis of the kidney and spleen was caused by the drug injection and exsanguination, is it not true that the
    necrosis would not be developed adequately to be observed on gross inspection in as short a time interval as several
    hours?<br> <br> ANSWER: Thirty-six hours is more than adequate time for the development of grossly observable
    necrosis, especially in a ruminant.<br> <br> 11. Would not the distended gallbladder and the rumen that was only
    one-third full suggest that the animal was off feed and ill for several days?<br> <br> ANSWER: These conditions
    suggest only a limited feed intake, not the reasons for it, and the absence of any other intestinal pathology (which
    usually accompanies such illness) does not support a supposition of this nature.<br> <br> 12. In an animal that has
    been dead for thirty-eight hours, would there not have been considerable diffusion of blood and fluid from vessels
    into tissue or gravitation of blood, thus causing changes resembling exsanguination?<br> <br> ANSWER: Blood does not
    diffuse. Loss of the fluid component of the blood through diffusion is possible to a limited degree, but that which
    remains, as well as the cellular component does not leave the vessels. Gravitation results in relocation within the
    vasculature of certain organs, such as the lungs, but the blood is still in the vessels.<br> <br> 13. Do you feel,
    knowing how rapidly blood clots, that it would be possible to bleed an animal to death with just two twelve to
    fourteen gauge needles in the jugular veins or would not repeated venipunctures as well as vacuum be necessary to
    remove appreciable amounts of blood?<br> <br> ANSWER: This would be entirely possible, as originally stated.<br>
    <br> 14. Could not the clean removal of the eye suggest bird scavengers?<br> <br> ANSWER: Not when the optic nerve
    has been severed by a single stroke of a sharp instrument leaving all nerve fibers cut in a single plane.<br> <br>
    15. Although the puncture wounds of side and back could be from a dart gun, could they have not also been traumas
    that could have allowed entry of bacteria as clostridium septicum or bacillus?<br> <br> ANSWER: Possible, but these
    were the only lesions noted, and their locations are extremely unlikely places for traumatic wounds.<br> <br> 16.
    Would it not be true that if the animal could still move, it would still bleed and evidence of blood should have
    been on the face, tail, and perineal hair if the anus or tongue had been excised before death?<br> <br> ANSWER: Not
    necessarily. Muscle performance is dependent upon energy which is produced and stored in the cell itself, not blood.
    The blood "restocks" the cell, but does not provide directly useable energy to it. Thus, a certain amount of muscle
    function is possible without the presence of blood at all. These circumstances, however are rarely ever encountered
    except in situations of this sort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> I also questioned the veterinarian about his professional qualifications. He replied that his "experience with the
  field of veterinary medicine spans six years." However, on March 5, 1980, I learned from the Colorado Board of
  Veterinary Medicine that the only veterinarian in the state with his name had been licensed to practice medicine only
  two years. More specifically, the information furnished by the board indicates that this person graduated from
  veterinary school on May 13, 1978. On May 25, 1978 this person was licensed to practice medicine. The 1980 Directory
  of the American Veterinarian Medical Association also states that this individual graduated from veterinarian school
  in 1978.</p>
<p>In short, it appears that this veterinarian performed the necropsy on the alleged mutilation victim less than four
  months after he graudated from veterinarian school. It would thus appear from his answer that he is including, as part
  of his experience with veterinary medicine, the time he spent as a student, which I suggest is an unusual
  inclusion.</p>
<p>In summary, many of his interpretations can be questioned. In fact, six veterinarians, as previously noted, totally
  discredit the general thesis he sets out in his necropsy report. Many of his conclusions are suspect such as his
  statement that the two puncture marks in the vicinity of the animal's left jugular vein is an injection site. For as
  Dr. Howard J. Sherrod of the Valverde Animal Clinic in Corrales points out, there are several plausible explanations
  for such marks. According to him, after a cow dies and begins to bloat, the skin becomes taut and in some places,
  thinner and more tender. When this happens carrion birds such as buzzards sometimes puncture holes through the carcass
  attempting to get at the blood vessel.</p>
<p> Dr. Sherrod also points out that such marks could also indicate a snake bite. Such bites, according to him, are
  usually found in the head or neck regions. However, he notes that these bite holes would be relatively close together
  and would be hard to find after a short period of time.</p>
<p> Although the veterinarian claims the cuts on the animal were made with a sharp instrument, he does not specify how
  he arrived at this conclusion. Interestingly, it is the exposed organs -- in this case the left ear and left lip --
  that are missing in the steer. Also consistent with scavenger activity is the type of organs removed -- eye, lips,
  anus, penis, and part of the tongue. The veterinarian also argues that the lack of blood and mess at the site
  indicates that the mutilation was executed by a sophisticated operation. However, as I have noted in Chapter Three, it
  seems to be the rule rather than the exception for scavengers to do a neat job.</p>
