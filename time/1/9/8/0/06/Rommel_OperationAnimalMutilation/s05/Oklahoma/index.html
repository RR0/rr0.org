<p> In 1974 a special task force was organized in Oklahoma to investigate the cattle mutilation phenomenon, and the
  results of which were to be reported to the current governor, David Boren. The people assigned to this task force
  included state veterinarians, veterinary pathologists from Oklahoma State University, the director of Radiation
  Protection at the Oklahoma State Department of Health, the director of theft investigation for the Oklahoma
  Cattlemen's Association, a representative from the governor's office, investigators from the Oklahoma Highway Patrol,
  and the commissioner of Public Safety.</p>
<p>On March 3, 1975, this task force prepared a report for the governor covering the joint investigation of 26 cattle
  deaths, as well as the results of contacts with officials from other states. Necropsies were performed on all 26
  animals by Oklahoma State University.</p>
<p> The task force concluded that the "dismemberment or so-called mutilation of cattle was from scavenger animals." Dr.
  J. W. Holecombe, state veterinarian for the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture made the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The evidence... in my opinion is so strong and factual in my concluding of the deaths and dismemberments and/or
    mutilations were caused by natural conditions, including malnutrition, anemia from parasitism, weather stress; and
    both predatory and scavenger animals and birds."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Roger Panciera, veterinary pathologist at Oklahoma State University also observed: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "All investigations that have been completed have indicated death due to natural causes, death due to disease.' In
    no case has the observation and opinion of task force indicated man as a primary .factor in death or
    mutilation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On July 20, 1979, I sent a letter to authorities in Oklahoma asking whether the conclusions reached by this task
  force also applied to mutilations subsequently investigated. I received the following reply: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The special investigation section of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol continued to monitor the cattle death phenomenon
    closely for approximately a year after out formal report. Although there were some new reports, there were no cases
    that would cause any official modification of our existing report."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twenty-eight incidents have been reported in Oklahoma since 1975, the most recent one being in April 1979.
  Authorities have determined that these animals had died of natural causes, their carcasses subsequently being attacked
  by scavengers. </p>
