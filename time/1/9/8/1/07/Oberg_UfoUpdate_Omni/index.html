<p>The question of <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/canular">hoaxes</a> presents an interesting aspect of
  the UFO phenomenon. It can test the adequacy of UFO investigations and measure the powerful "will to believe" of many
  UFO investigators and authors. Only when, and if, these lessons are fully appreciated will serious UFO investigators
  be able to escape the suspicion that they are often victimized, willingly or unwillingly by hoaxes.</p>
<p>English physicist David I. Simpson engineered some very revealing "UFO controlled experiment" hoaxes several years
  ago. According to his report published in the Spring <time>1980</time> issue of the <em>Skeptical Inquirer</em>, the
  tests <q>compared known details of fabricated 'UFO' stimuli with the issued statements of investigators</q>. In
  addition, Simpson wanted to test the abilities of UFO researchers by leaving clues that could suggest a practical
  solution. The hoaxes <q>were designed to present substantial inconsistencies that would allow any moderately critical
    investigator to cast strong suspicion on their authenticity</q>.</p>
<p>One particular experiment was performed on the evening of <time>1970-03-28</time>, while a group ot British UFO
  enthusiasts near <span class="place">Warminster, in Wiltshire</span>, were watching for UFOs that reportedly frequent
  the region. Simpson installed a purple spotlight on a neighboring hill. As it suddenly flashed on and off, a phony
  "magnetic detector" sounded an alarm at the observation site. An accomplice with a camera containing preexposed film
  (which already showed UFO images) made several exposures of the horizon and then handed the camera— the film still
  inside— to a prominent UFO researcher.</p>
<p>Simpson prepared the hoax film so that the photographed direction and appearance of the "UFO" were grossly at odds
  with what observers actually beheld. He also saw to it that the first two preexposed frames (taken almost a year
  earlier) showed background scenes significantly different from the two subsequent real exposures (which of course did
  not show any UFO). This should have been evident even to the least experienced investigator.</p>

</figure>
<p>But no one seemed to notice (and no one even interviewed the photographer). After two months of study by top UFO
  experts in Europe, the photographs were declared by <a
      href="/org/uk/media/press/FSR.html"><i lang="en">Flying Saucer Review</i></a> editor <span
      class="people">Charles Bowen</span> to be <q>genuine beyond all reasonable doubt</q>.</p>
<p>One consultant reported that <q>there is nothing about these photographs that suggests to me they have been faked in
  any way whatsoever</q>.</p>
<p>Ufologist Dr. <span class="people">Pierre Guerin</span>, director of research at the <a
    href="/org/eu/fr/iap">Astrophysical Institute of the French National Center for Scientitic Research</a>, reported
  that <q>there is no question that the object photographed was the result of faking</q>.</p>
<p>An artist's impression of the UFO appeared on the cover of the <time>1970-07/1970-08</time> issue of <a
    href="/org/uk/media/press/FSR.html"><i lang="en">Flying Saucer Review</i></a>; it showed the "object" with an
  angular diameter ten times too large (the experts had computed that the flying saucer was 60 feet long and 30 feet in
  diameter). </p>
<p>Eyewitness accounts described how the UFO — purple, fringed with white, having a crimson light in the middle— hovered
  for a moment and then moved toward Warminster before stopping again. All estimates of direction and duration were
  significantly erroneous, and the errors accumulated as time passed. (Later the object was described as giving off
  ultraviolet light and being surrounded by a <q>ruby-red halo</q>.)</p>
<p>Simpson's critique of the "investigation," which he allowed to continue for two and a half years before revealing the
  hoax, was devastating: <q>My experiences in the UFO field have shown that the investigative incompetence demonstrated
    by this particular experiment, far from being exceptional, is typical. . . . Occasionally individuals with relevant
    technical backgrounds become involved; it is disturbing to witness the abandonment of their mental disciplines and
    common sense. ... If ever there is subtle evidence suggesting extraterrestrial visitation, it is unlikely that it
    will be discovered by a typical ufologist.</q></p>
<p>Some UFO hoaxes start out as impulsive pranks rather than as carefully planned scientific experiments. In <time>1968-03</time>
  several college students at the University of Maryland were listening to a call-in radio-show interview with a man who
  claimed to have been taken by flying saucer people to their home planet, Lanulos, <q>in the distant constellation
    Ganymede</q>. One of the students, Tom Monteleone, an avid science-fiction buff, called to ask a question. Then
  Monteleone suddenly thought, <q>Just for the heck of it, why not claim I've been to Lanulos, too? It'll blow his
    mind!</q></p>
<p>And so he did and it did. The dumbfounded "contactee," <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Derenberger">Woodrow
  Derenberger</a>, quickly regained his composure and corroborated Monteleone's description ot the planet Lanulos,
  agreeing with details that contradicted things Derenberger had just disclosed on the show. Fifteen minutes later
  Monteleone hung up and enjoyed a good laugh with his roommates—until the phone rang. The radio station had traced his
  call and now wanted further information.</p>
<p>For the next fwo years Monteleone went along with the ruse, cleverly providing UFO investigators with information
  gleaned from Derenberger's accounts and from the general UFO literature. Whenever he "corroborated" information given
  earlier his credibility rose further (he had told investigators that he was unfamiliar with UFO literature, and they
  believed him), UFO publicist <span class="people">Harold Salkin</span> was impressed that Monteleone's story was <q>so
    tightly synchronized</q> with Derenberger's, UFO writer and editor <span class="people">Timothy Green Beckley</span>
  taped an interview and wrote several magazine articles that presented the account as factual; noted UFO author and
  theorist <span
      class="people">John A. Keel</span> called the story <q>one of the most puzzling contact stories in my files. ...
    I'm forced to accept that it's true</q> (even though, as Monteleone noted, Keel's published accounts of the story
  were'vastly distorted).</p>
<p><q>I underwent long interviews</q>, Monteleone recounted in Omni (<span class="people">1979-05</span>). <q>I not only
  repeated my false experiences but also added further embellishments and absurdities — just to see how far I could
  carry the hoax before being discredited</q>. Monteleone even submitted to a hypnosis session, sponsored by <span
    class="people">Salkin</span>, during which he faked the trance and "passed" the test like a champion.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, when the full admission of the hoax was published in Fate magazine late last year (Omni had scooped
  Fate by a year and a half), Monteleone was the one blamed for all the confusion. His actions, wrote author <span
      class="people">Karl Pflock</span>, <q>served to muddy still further the already muddy waters of ufology. The last
    thing we need, if we are to unravel the UFO mystery, is false leads that absorb any part of the far-too-limited
    resources of serious researchers</q> — which <span class="people">Pflock</span> considered <span class="people">Salkin</span>,
  <span class="people">Beckley</span> and <span class="people">Keel</span>, among others, to be. This ironic complaint
  appeared to absolve the gullible investigators of any responsibility for their careless and credulous acceptance of
  Monleleone's deliberately absurd fabrications. Fate magazine seemed to be saying that it was not their fault that they
  were hoaxed.</p>
<p>Some other reactions to Monteleone's confession are quite amusing. <span class="people">Salkin</span>, who is
  described by long-time ufological observer <span class="people">James Moseley</span> as <q>a warm, likable, but
    somewhat gullible sort.</q> still refuses to believe Monteleone's confession. Keel is particularly upset and has
  issued a statement calling the Fate piece "an attempt to discredit my entire body of work and my professional
  reputation as a journalist for over 35 years." <span class="people">Keel</span> is preparing a lawsuit, according to
  some accounts.</p>
<p>As for Beckley, he has to worry about fresher wounds in his credibility as a competent UFO investigator. In a recent
  issue of his monthly tabloid <i lang="en">UFO Review</i>, Beckley apparently became the victim of yet another UFO
  hoax.</p>
<p>In an article entitled "Erotic Encounters of the Very Close Kind," <span class="people">Beckley</span> opened with
  the startling words, <q>It is not uncommon for the occupants of UFOs to have sexual contact with humans.</q> He tried
  to lay the foundation for this far-out story in an editorial on the facing page: <q>Some readers undoubtedly will
    believe that we are getting a wee bit carried away when we turn to sex in order to sell a UFO newspaper. , . . We
    really aren't trying to capture a larger audience by printing a sensationalistic headline on our cover. If we wanted
    to take this approach, we'd . . . simply fabricate the stories we print. But we don't cater to the gullible. ... All
    the items we mention in our story are fully documented. We need not substitute fiction for truth -- for truth is far
    greater than fiction in the field of UFOlogy.</q></p>
<p>The principal source of Beckley's "saucer sex" story was a newspaper account dated <time>1978-02-12</time>, which
  carried the headline kidnapped to venus. Reporter Jerry Burger told of a thirty-one-year-old librarian found by police
  as she rambled around in a park, wearing no clothes. She claimed she had been <q><a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/scenario/Abduction.html">abducted</a> by Venusians</q> and taken to the <q>back
    of the moon</q>, where she was <q>implanted with outer-space semen</q> before being returned to Earth. Beckley
  reported the case as true and added that <q>such reports are taking place on a global scale There can be little doubt
    from the documented evidence that some tremendous event is slated to happen that will guide us to a higher
    understanding ot ourselves and the cosmos. . . . The UFOnauts are trying to teach us a lesson — that love is
    universal and encompasses every living creature, regardless of their planet or dimension of origin.</q> And for
  those readers who wanted more information, Beckley added that the "saucer sex" story is just one chapter in his new
  book, <i lang="en">Strange Encounters Bizarre & Eerie Contacts with Flying Saucers</i>, available from the author for
  $6.95 plus postage and handling.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Beckley's story is even more absurd than it first appears. Houston spaceflight expert Robert Nichols
  sent Omni the actual source of the <q>outer-space semen</q> story, in the form of the newspaper clipping Beckley
  quoted. The article did not come from a newspaper at all, but from a' <time>1978</time> satirical publication, the <i
      lang="en">Sunday Newspaper Parody</i>, written by the <i lang="en">National Lampoon</i>. Beckley (or someone on
  his staff) evidently made some editorial changes by adding realistic touches to the article and changing the original
  spelling of the saucer-rape victim from the highly suspicious "Penelope Cuntz" to the acceptably ethnic "Penelope
  Kuntz." Beckley also altered the name of the newspaper from the Utopian Dacron, Ohio, Republican Democrat to the
  Toronto Sunday Sun. The entire account, then, is a fictional spoof, but the extent of Beckley's role in promoting and
  altering it (or merely passing it along credulously) is still undetermined.</p>
<p>Photographs are even more subject to hoaxing. In fact, while only a very small percentage of raw UFO reports are
  hoaxes, it is generally acknowledged even by UFO believers that the overwhelming majority of published UFO photographs
  are hoax - either forgeries, models, or misrepresented ordinary phenomena</p>
<p>A classic UFO photographic hoax involved the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Fogl">"Fogl flying saucer"
  pictures</a> taken in <time>1957-12</time> and first published in <time>1959</time>. As chronicled by skeptical
  ufologist David A. Schroth, the photographs were embraced by magazines in Great Britain and the United States; UFO
  experts argued that some features on the bottom of the flying saucer were identical to features seen in other
  photographs, testifying to the authenticity of Fogl's photographs. American UFO publicist <span class="people">Ray Palmer</span>
  declared, <q>We are forced to admit this is not a fake.</q> In <time>1966</time> one of the photographs was presented
  as authentic in Life, That may have been the last straw for Fogl, who finally revealed that the UFOs were faked — made
  with a small model hung on a wire. When asked why he did what he did, Fogl replied that he wanted to show <q>that
    certain people make utter fools of themselves. Far too many people make a racket of the UFO business, writing phony
    books, supported by faked pictures.</q></p>
<p>As if in fulfillment of Fogl's point, UFO writers continued to use the hoax pictures. Palmer (who is credited by UFO
  historian Daniel Cohen with having "invented" the concept of "flying saucers") wrote that it was <q>impossible</q> for
  the photos to be fakes and that Fogl's confession must be a hoax. And in <time>1979</time> McGraw-Hill published David
  C. <em>Knight's UFOs; A Pictorial History</em>, with page 86 proudly presenting one of Fogl's pictures as still
  authentic. </p>
<p>Another famous UFO hoax provides eloquent warning against well-meaning UFO stories that originate at a great dis-
  tance in space or time. They are thus immune from any real investigation. If they are hoaxes, it is next to impossible
  to prove. As part of a <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Airships/1897">"UFO flap" in 1897</a>, the story
  of Alexander Hamilton, of Yates Center, Kansas, stands out. The farmer reported that a cigar-shaped airship flown by
  jabbering humanoids hovered over his farm and caught hold of a calf with a rope. Hamilton's account was published in
  the local newspaper, along with a statement vouching for his honesty, signed by five leading citizens of the town. The
  story rapidly spread around the world, and for decades UFO writers considered it one of the best-documented "<a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/classification/hynek/rr/3">close encounters of the third kind</a>" ever.</p>
<p>Hamilton and the five leading citizens actually had organized a local Liars Club, and Hamilton's "calfnapping
  airship" whopper, a tall tale through and through, topped all other fabrications. The newspaper story was all a joke,
  as it turned out, but neither the editor nor the town citizens realized how seriously the outside world had taken the
  account. It was not until early <time>1977</time> that the full story appeared, in Fate magazine. Associate editor
  <span class="people">Jerry Clark</span>, a diligent and highly principled pro-UFO investigator, revealed what he
  called <q>the biggest hoax ever known in UFO history</q> when he published hitherto-unknown documentation that
  established beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Kansas farmer's story was phony.</p>
<p>Buf the same old "uforic" patterns continued. New writers based their books and articles on older UFO books and
  articles, not relying On original sources or their own independent verification. Among the subsequent UFO literature
  that continued to use the Hamilton story as if it were authentic were Knight's UFOs: A Pictorial History and Ripley's
  Believe It or Not: Stars, Space and UFOs (thirty-third in a series). </p>
<p>The <time>1980-01</time> issue of <i lang="en">UFO Journal</i> (issued by <a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a>, the
  Mutual UFO Network, a well-organized private research group with a good reputation) provided some very interesting
  insights into the minds of a UFO hoaxer and of the UFO investigator who worked on the case. The witness was a
  twenty-six-year-old security guard who claimed to have encountered aliens in the San Joaquin Valley on <time>1977-02-27</time>.
  A year and a half later, after trying to dig up supporting evidence, he contacted <a
      href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a>.</p>
<p>The investigator (who, along with the witness, was kept anonymous in the article) reported: <q>I was impressed with
  this young man's sincerity, his apparent honesty, and his concern that he was unable to locate any other witnesses. I
  am by nature a cautious and suspicious person . . . having run into enough hoaxes and fraudulent cases in my 22 years
  of investigation to give me adequate insight and recognition for such incidents I was quite satisfied as to his
  honesty.</q> The UFO incident filled nearly four pages in the magazine.</p>
<p>But at the end of the article the entire tone changed: <q>The important message for all of us</q>, wrote editor
  Richard Hall, <q>is that this case is a hoax — a confessed hoax</q>. "The investigators didn't find this out for sure
  until the article had been typeset, but they decided to publish it anyway as a lesson in human vulnerability to
  hoaxes. <q>The story content fit so well with other cases, and the reporter seemed so 'sincere' and in a responsible
    position, that we were nearly taken in.</q> Even without the confession, <a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a>
  investigators had become suspicious of glaring discrepancies in the story as told to different investigators, but even
  those considerations might not have been enough to prove the case a hoax if the witness himself had not confessed when
  confronted with the inconsistencies and contradictions in his story.</p>
<p>In a letter to <a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a>, the hoaxer (code-named "Carl" to preserve his anonymity)
  explained his motives: <q>All my life I had been a nobody, unimportant. ... I wanted to be important. ... I am not
    psychologically deranged but just wanted some attention.</q> But he had not apparently acted as if he sought
  attention. He certainly had not sought publicity. Indeed, the investigator had originally reported that <q>fearing
    ridicule and harassment from friends and coworkers, Carl kept this story to himself until he simply had to tell
    someone who would help ease his frustration and anxiety.</q> Evidently the "adequate insight" into hoaxes that the
  <a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> investigator claimed to possess involved something other than factual evidence.
</p>
<p>MUFON's decision to publish the San Joaquin hoax story with the confession was a courageous one, since it did make
  its investigator sound rather foolish. But the UFO group demonstrated commendable maturity in choosing to try to have
  all its investigators learn from the experience, lest it be repeated on a wide scale. It still may not help.</p>
<p>The other famous hoaxes were not universally swallowed, either. Monteleone's space trip to Lanulos was never believed
  by most of the "nuts and bolts" UFO buffs who have for so long despised the crackpot contactees and the bad publicity
  they have brought to the subject. <span class="people">James Moseley</span>, editor of Flying Saucer News, wrote that
  Monteleone clearly was not a "classic contactee" and evidently never believed his own story. A perceptive conclusion!
  However, the Fogl photographs and Simpson's experiment in England would probably not have survived the sophisticated
  photoanalytical techniques now used by some UFO groups, notably <span class="people">William Spaulding</span>'s
  high-technology <a href="/org/us/asso/GSW.html">Ground Saucer Watch</a>, in Phoenix, and the GEPAN laboratories, in
  Paris.</p>
<p>The extent to which serious UFO groups seem determined to detect and reject hoaxes was demonstrated last year when,
  virtually without exception, all major groups and leading investigators publicly denounced Genesis-Ill Productions'
  book <em>UFOs: Contact from the Pleiades</em>. While the strikingly handsome collection of flying-saucer photographs
  was being billed'by its publishers as the greatest UFO breakthrough in human history, a number of pro-UFO researchers
  circulated reports that claimed that the whole business was a money-making fraud. For once UFO skeptics agreed with
  their traditionally antagonistic pro-UFO counterparts, though a Genesis-Ill spokesman continues to deny that his
  company is involved in any hoax. </p>
<p>UFO skeptics, however, go even further in their allegations that there have been hoaxes, and they find themselves in
  bitter disagreement with pro-UFO forces. Some of the highly publicized classic UFO encounters (such as the <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Pascagoula">1973 Pascagoula fishermen's account</a> and the <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/WaltonTravis">1975 Snowflake, Arizona, woodcutters' account</a>) and
  some of the classic UFO photographs (such as the <a
      class="canular" href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/McMinnville">1950 McMinnville photos</a> and the <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Trinidad">1957 Trinidade Island photos</a>) are considered by skeptics
  to be hoaxes. Half of the "best UFO cases" of the 1970s-as judged by a blue-ribbon panel of UFO experts sponsored by
  the National Enquirer—are considered hoaxes, according to independent research by skeptics. Here the battle lines are
  clearly drawn.</p>
<p>Suggesting that a UFO case is a hoax poses delicate problems. First of all, the UFO witness (whether a hoaxer or not)
  may have grounds for a libel lawsuit. Although many threats along these lines have been made, so far no suits have
  been filed. Second, without a confession it is extremely difficult to prove an accusation of "hoax," however spurious
  the story may sound. Last, UFO skeptics (in particular, the world's undisputed leading skeptic, aviation journalist
  <span class="people">Philip J. Klass</span>) open themselves up fo countercharges of "character assassination" and
  "vicious ad hominem attacks" when they point out, usually quite correctly, that the reliability of many famous UFO
  witnesses is highly questionable because of their past and subsequent histories of exaggeration, fantasy, and outright
  deception (pro-UFO groups generally downplay, or even cover up, such behavior on the part of people whose credibility
  they wish to emphasize).</p>
<p>Despite the problems caused by UFO hoaxes (mainly, that they can be far more difficult to solve or even recognize
  than are "ordinary" honest UFO reports), these patterns in deception can be made useful. Successful hoaxes can help
  calibrate the reliability of UFO research, as in the case of Monteleone's and Simpson's hoaxes; hoaxes can also
  instruct serious investigators in caution and humility, as with the San Joaquin hoax reported in JJFO Journal. The
  claim of the superskeptics, that unsolved UFO cases can all easily be dismissed as unrecognized hoaxes, is
  unsubstantiated; the claim of UFO eager believers, that the hoax problem is under control, is equally unsubstantiated,
  if not refuted. And since no one wants to look foolish, the disagreement continues.</p>
