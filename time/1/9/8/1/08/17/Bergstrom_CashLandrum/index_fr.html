<p><strong>John Camp</strong> (capitaine de l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">USAF</a>) : <q>...le capitaine Davis
  est ici, qui est our chief claims... Il est notre Claims Officer pour la base to be allowed to just take our little
  meeting down here on a tape recorder... avez-vous tous une objection à cela ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash </strong>: <q>Non.</q></p>
<p><strong>Vicky Landrum </strong>: <q>Je n'en ai aucune.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp</strong> : <q>...OK. Maintenant je vais vous poser des questions plutôt ridicules, rappelez-vous
  juste que c'est ainsi pour que peut-être dans 1 an si nous avions à ré-écouter cette bande, nous sachions qui était là
  et ce qu'il se passait, de quoi il était question, OK ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> : <q>D'accord.</q></p>
<p><strong>Camp</strong> : <q>Faisons refléter pour archive que nous sommes réunis dans la Bibliothèque Juridique au
  Bâtiment 2102, le 17 août 1981 à 10 h 40 et sont présent le capitaine John Camp, le Acting Staff Judge Advocate, le
  capitaine Terry Davis, le Claims Officer, Melle Pat Wolf, Assistant Claims Officer, et madame, je vous demanderai de
  vous identifier à votre tour également.</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> : <q>Betty Cash.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp</strong> : <q>Et quelle est votre adresse, où vivez-vous ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong>: <q>Route 1 Box 127B, Dayton Texas.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp</strong> : <q>OK, et vous êtes accompagnée par votre... ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> : <q>Vicki Landrum.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp</strong> : <q>Vicki Landrum. Est-elle parente avec vous ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> : <q>Non.</q></p>
<p><strong>Vicky Landrum </strong>: <q>J'étais dans l'incident...</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp</strong> : <q>OK.</q></p>
<p><strong>Vicky Landrum </strong>: <q>...ainsi que Colby Lee.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp</strong> : <q>OK, pourquoi ne pas continuer et me donner votre nom complet ainsi que votre
  adresse.</q></p>
<p><strong>Vicky Landrum</strong> : <q>Mon nom est Vicky Landrum et je vis au 506 West Clayton, à Dayton, Texas.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp</strong>: <q>OK... Et euh... Colby...</q></p>
<p><strong>Vicky Landrum</strong> : <q>Il peut le dire lui-même. </q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>OK, Colby, qui sont tes parents et où vis-tu ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Colby Landrum </strong>: <q>Je vis au 506 West Clayton aussi.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>OK, et quel âge as-tu ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Colby Landrum </strong>: <q>7 ans.</q></p>
<p><strong>Camp </strong>: <q>Tu as 7 ans ? </q></p>
<p><strong>Colby Landrum </strong>: <q>J'en aurai 8 en janvier.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>8 en janvier, OK.</q></p>
<p><strong>Terry Davis </strong> (capitaine de l'USAF) : <q>Pouvez-vous épeler votre nom ? </q></p>
<p><strong>Vicky Landrum</strong>: <q>L-A-N-D-R-U-M.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>OK, maintenant... je pense d'après votre première conversation 8 en janvier que vous,
  euh, vous avez vécu une observation d'ovni et aurait supposément reçu certaines blessures ou un certain contact de
  cela. Euh, Melle Cash, voudriez-vous commencer en 1er et me dire exactement la date, ce qui s'est passé, où vous vous
  trouviez, etc .?</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> : <q>Oui. Nous... j'étais sur la Farm Market Road 1485 entre New Caney et Huffman
  approximativement entre 21 h et 21 h 30 la nuit du 29 décembre <a href="../../../../0/index.html">1980</a>.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>OK, maintenant permettez-moi de vous demander, euh, d'épeler ces villes voisines
  ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> : <q>N-E-W C-A-N-E-Y et H-U-F-F-M-A-N. </q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>OK. Maintenant face à vous il y a une carte du Texas, pouvez-vous localiser ceci,
  euh, quelque part à proximité de euh, l'endroit où ceci est arrivé ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> : <q>Si mes lunettes vont le permettre. J'ai eu 3 paires depuis que ceci m'est arrivé et
  je ne peux toujours pas voir correctement. </q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>OK.</q></p>
<p>(pause... Betty Cash et Vicky Landrum regardent apparemment sur la carte, ne parlant bas suffisamment fort pour la
  transcription) [interruption dans l'enregistrement]</p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>Nous avons eu une brève pause dans l'enregistrement ici juste pour permettre à Melle
  Cash d'essayer de localiser l'endroit de l'observation sur une carte du Texas, mais en raison du manque de détail de
  la carte, elle n'est pas parvenue à le trouver. Cet zone est-elle au nord-est de Houston ? Est-ce correct de le dire ?
  OK, Melle Wolf est... pouvez-vous indiquer certaines des autres villes proches de la zone ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> ou <strong>Vicky Landrum</strong> (parlant au-dessus de la carte) : <q>Nord-ouest, c'est
  euh... North Crosby, Humboldt...</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> ou <strong>Vicky Landrum</strong> : <q>Oui, euh, c'est directement au nord de Humboldt,
  New Caney est directement au nord de Humboldt, et New Caney et Huffman euh, Huffman est alors à l'est.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>OK, quel... est-ce que ça... cette carte reflète le comté où elles se trouvaient
  ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> ou <strong>Vicky Landrum</strong> : <q>Liberty. ...le comté de Liberty.</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> ou <strong>Vicky Landrum</strong> (au même moment) : <q>Non, nous étions dans le comté de
  Montgomery.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>OK, comté de Montgomery.</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> ou <strong>Vicky Landrum</strong> : <q>...mais nous vivons dans le comté de Liberty. </q>
</p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>OK.</q></p>
<p><strong>Colby Landrum </strong>: <q>Non, nous vivons dans le comté de Dayton. </q></p>
<p>(pause... toussotements de Betty Cash ou Vicky Landrum) </p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>OK, reveniez-vous de Houston ou... quelle était votre raison de vous trouver dans
  cette région ? Pourriez-vous... voudriez-vous nous le dire si cela ne vous dérange pas ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> : <q>Eh bien nous n'y avions pas pensé que c'était un lundi soir parce que nous avions eu
  tellement de vacances, et nous étions allés à Cleveland cette nuit-là pour jouer au Bingo. Nous étions arrivés à
  Cleveland et il n'y avait pas de bingo. Nous n'avions pas pu... nous avons réfléchi, eh bien que c'était pendant les
  vacances qu'ils l'avaient annulé. Donc avions vu juste, et pensé que nous pourrions aller à New Caney, parce qu'ils
  avaient un Bingo là-bas aussi. Nous sommes arrivés à Caney et il n'y avait toujours pas de bingo, ne réalisant pas que
  l'on était lundi soir et non pas un mardi, et nous nous sommes arrêtés à un restaurant là sur... 59 et 1485</q>
  [inintelligible].</p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>Vers quelle heure était-ce ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> : <q>Il devait-être dans les huit heures, huit heure trente.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>Du soir, c'est ça ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> : <q>Oui... et après être sortis de dîner, nous avons repris la voiture pour commencé à
  rentrer vers la maison, et avons roulé approximativement... Je dirais peut-être 20 miles, lorsque nous avons repéré
  cet objet, et nous sommes resté à le regarder, nous ne pouvions identifier ce que c'était, [not ever dreaming that we
  were going to run... dead into it]. Mais tout d'un coup, lorsque nous sommes sortis sur cette route de campagne, il a
  [just set down], presque au même niveau que le sommet des arbres. Eh bien, il avait éclairé tout le ciel. Eh bien, il
  avait été vu aussi loin qu'à 50 miles de distance de l'endroit où nous étions. Mais, sur cette route de campagne, les
  lumières étaient tellement brillantes, et la chaleur était tellement intense, que je sortis de la voiture. Je ne sais
  pas quel était mon but à moins que ce ne fut qu'un instinct normal à bien y réfléchir, peut-être que je me sentais
  plus en sécurité à l'extérieur que je ne le serais à l'intérieur. Mais pour vous dire la vérité, nous pensions que la
  fin du monde était arrivée. Je veux dire que je ne me suis jamais trouvée dans toute ma vie dans une telle situation.
  Mais je savais qu'il n'y avais aucune manière de passer en-dessous de la manière dont le feu émanait de sa base.</q>
</p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>Maintenant, qui était dans la voiture à ce moment ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> : <q>Vicki, Colby et moi-même.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>OK. Ce sont les 3 personnes qui sont ici aujourd'hui ? </q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> : <q>Voilà.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>Quel type de voiture conduisiez-vous ? </q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> : <q>Une Cutlass Oldsmobile de <a href="../../../../0/index.html">1980</a>.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>Etait-ce une 2 ou 4 portes ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> : <q>2 portes. <a href="../../../../0/index.html"></a></q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>OK. Maintenant euh... pourriez-vous juste dessiner... un représentation de quoi ce
  soit que vous ayez vu si cela avait une forme discernable, et signez-le moi juste avec la date si vous voulez bien. Et
  encore une fois, je sais que vous n'êtes pas une artiste donc ne vous préoccupez pas de ça, faites juste de votre
  mieux pour tenter d'en dessiner un représentation.</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> : (riant) <q>Vicki dit que je suis la pire du monde.</q></p>
<p>(pause, ...Betty dessine apparemment l'ovni)</p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>OK.</q></p>
<p><strong>Betty Cash</strong> : <q>C'est supposé être une forme de diamant, mais ce n'est pas très bon.</q></p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>OK, et poursuivez et signez juste votre nom avec la date en bas.</q></p>
<p>(pause, ...Betty signe apparemment le dessin)</p>
<p><strong>John Camp </strong>: <q>Maintenant montrez-le à Melle Landrum, et Melle Landrum, êtes-vous d'accord qu'il
  s'agissait approximativement de la forme ce que vous avez vu ?</q></p>
<p><strong>Vicky Landrum</strong>: <q>Oui monsieur, mais le feu venait droit en bas vers là...</q> (inintelligible)</p>

        was so hot I couldn't stand it with my bare hand, so I got the pocket of my leather jacket to open the car door

        And when the thing began to lift up, well we were all horrified... well in fact Vicki's the one, I guess maybe I
        would have tried to have gone on under it, that's how scared I was. But she screamed for me to stop, and right
        where she put her hands, her fingerprints are still on my dash, it melted my dash in the car with her
        fingerprints imbedded. So we... I finally got the car started and it was so hot I had to turn on the air
        conditioning in order for us to get cool. And by that time we were all burning up. It was just... well it's just

        Williamson said: that since 1969 the Air Force no longer has been made... has been the responsible agency to
        investigate UFO sightings... some of the history that the Congressman told you is correct... ah... before 1969
        there was a Project Bluebook... which Project Bluebook basically was just to keep up with all the sightings...
        all incidents where individuals had seen UFOs and what had happened. In 1969, that was one of the things that
        Congress said that the Air Force will not do anymore. Then in 1974 - 1975, the President of the United States at
        that time recommended that NASA, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration see if it would serve any
        national interest to reopen Project Bluebook with the idea of researching UFOs and occurrences as they happen in
        the United States. It was the response back of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that they not
        reopen Project Bluebook. Now the reason I'm telling you this is that once you tell you me your story today, I am
        without any power at all to do anything here a this level...

        private organizations like you've already been in contact with that also have started investigating, that
        Congress has essentially said that it serves no useful purpose to have all these private organizations
        investigating it and have the United States Government investigate it as well. Now, in other words there'd be no
        value in doing two reports and if these separate companies or groups that investigate UFO sightings can do a
        good job investigating it then there's really no need for the Air Force or for the Army or anybody else to
        investigate it as well. Now it sounds that you have generated quite a bit of interest from these other groups, I
        know that this gentleman that called and talked with you, also you're going to meet with some other people, and
        there was a scientist that said that he wanted to keep your fingernail clippings to subject them to some
