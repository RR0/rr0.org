    <td> U.S., Ottumwa, Iowa: Ten miles south of Ottumwa, a 54-year-old woman saw a red or orange light fly from east to
      west in front of her car, a '72 Ford LTD. Her windshield fogged up and the engine failed. In a few seconds, the
      car restarted without her turning the key and the window defogged. The UFO, which appeared the size of the full
      moon, vanished behind some treetops. (<em>IUR,</em> December, 1978)

    <td> U.S., Ginghamsburg, Ohio: Two 19-year-old girls saw two orange lights, "prominent in the middle, faded at the
      ends." The car radio gave off a hum and the car wouldn't go faster than 20 mph. The two lights also gave off this
      humming sound. One of the lights shone a light beam on the witnesses for one second. The witnesses then looked
      away and didn't see the lights again when they looked back. The car continued to have engine trouble after the
      event. <span class="source">(<em>IUR,</em> December, 1978) </span></td>

      on top and bottom, and a white light in the middle. The driver of the truck reported that it stalled as the object
      flew fairly low, directly overhead. The truck did not have a history of engine trouble. As the object receded into
      the distance, the engine could be restarted. <span class="source">(<em>IUR,</em> December, 1978) </span></td>

      off a dim glow through openings around the edge. The driver stopped the car to watch. The object moved to her
      right, then back to her left. When it was directly in front of the car, her FM car radio had heavy static for
      10-15 s and the headlights went out for one second. The object then flew away quickly. The engine of her '70 Dodge
      Challenger was never affected.<span class="source"> (<em>IUR,</em> July, 1979) </span></td>

      west. It had three bright, white lights on the bottom which seemed to be rotating. It then slowed and the
      witnesses passed by and lost sight of the object in under 1 mn. During the sighting, a pre-recorded cassette tape
      playing in the '69 VW's tape player became erased, even though the tape player had no provision for erasing tape.

      CB radio then stopped working and the area around the car was illuminated by a red, glaring light. As they started
      to drive away, they noticed the car had moved 20 m from where it had been parked and was pointing in the opposite
      direction. As they left, they observed a sphere traveling away in the distance as the red light faded.<span

      hovering low over the road ahead. She kept driving for 1/2 mile, then the car's engine suddenly failed. She
      downshifted and the engine started, but 100 yards further, the headlights and engine both went off and the car
      became surrounded by "blackness." White circles of light one yard across circled the car at window level , then
      disappeared. The next moment the witness was driving in third gear, not recalling starting the car. When she
      arrived home, she found the trip took 10 minutes longer than usual. The sidelight on her car did not work before
      the sighting, but did work afterwards. <span class="source"><i lang="en">BUFORA Journal</i>, 1979-04</span></td>
