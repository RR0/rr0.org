<p>It has not been the purpose or design of this study to attempt an analysis of various vehicles to determine possible
  failure mechanisms. The possibility exists that: </p>
<ol><li> Typical vehicle interference has been associated with an unusual phenomenon which can be explained, or </li>
  <li>The witnesses either imagined or hallucinated the vehicle interference and UFO, or the interference was real, but
    the UFO sighting was hallucinated through unknown mechanisms.
  </li></ol>

<p>To illustrate the first point, consider the case of October 21, 1969 near Twin Falls, Idaho, taken from Project Blue
  Book files (1). A farmer was driving his tractor at 9:45 P.M. (MDT), with the headlights on, when he observed a large
  light rise into the sky from the horizon. A brighter and smaller light rose from within the first and continued to
  ascend into the sky. Just before the farmer had observed the first light, the headlights and radio on the tractor went
  out simultaneously. The duration of the sighting was six or seven minutes. </p>
<p>A fairly typical EM event, at first glance. Yet the Air Force determined that at 9:39 P.M. (MDT), a Minuteman rocket
  had been launched from Vandenburg AFB in California. The farmer's sightline to the UFO was southwest, in the same
  direction as the missile launch. Obviously the sighting could be explained as the first and second stages of the
  launch, and while one can well understand the farmer connecting the two events, as the Air Force stated, "There is no
  evidence that the visual sightings and the electrical failures are related." </p>
<p>Due care has been exercised to discard such events from this study, but that is no guarantee that one or two
  catalogued events do not fall into this category. </p>
<p>While there are no readily available examples of the second category, such events might be quite numerous. Vehicle
  failure occurs fairly often, as those who drive the Interstate system or own a used car can attest. Over approximately
  a thirty-year period, 441 cases of vehicle interference <i>and</i> UFO sightings in conjunction might not be
  considered excessive. Perhaps most can be explained by some type of hallucination or fear reaction. </p>
<p>Perhaps . . . but this study was partially intended to demonstrate that such an explanation for EM events is not
  really tenable. Too many events have multiple witnesses, even two or more vehicles, to be explained by an appeal to
  mass hallucination. Basterfield has suggested an explanation for some sightings, both EM and not, by invoking the
  phenomenon of hypnagogic imagery (2). While plausible for some single witness events, it fails as an explanation for
  those cases with two or more observers. It is prudent to conclude that most witnesses report objectively their
  experience of an EM event, including both the UFO and the vehicle interference. Rather than appeal to various
  psychological mechanisms, our analysis will proceed on the assumption that actual vehicle failure occurred, and that
  the witnesses saw <i>something.</i> Our task is to determine how and why the vehicle failed, as well as the nature of
  the UFO sighted by the witness.

</p>
<p>As a brief digression, let's consider just a few of the numerous means by which an internal combustion engine may be
  affected or halted. They are:
</p>
<ol><li>An increased resistance in the secondary coil of the ignition coil, which will severely decrease current flow to
  the spark plugs.</li><li>The capacitor in the distributor might not charge because of a large electrostatic field
  surrounding the vehicle (though one would expect shielding from the metallic body of the vehicle).</li><li>A high
  magnetic field might saturate the ignition coil and reduce voltage to the spark plugs.</li><li>Through unknown
  mechanisms, fuel might be prevented from entering or leaving the carburetor.</li><li>Resistance could be increased
  within the spark plugs, sufficient to prevent sparking.</li><li>Ionization of the air will also reduce or prevent
  sparking (though there should be effects upon the witnesses not always reported).</li><li>Destruction of connections
  in the electrical system by excessive heat would prevent operation.

<p>Cette list n'est en aucun cas exhaustive, ni ne contient tous those mechanisms by which only the electrical system
  may be affected. It does illustrate the problem of trying to suggest a plausible mechanism to cause vehicle
  interference.</p>
<p>Table 21 is a listing of the number of events in which different vehicle components were affected. It is likely that
  the distribution of effects can be understood by considering the effects of various types of engines, vehicle bodies,
  and electrical equipment in each event. Engine components manufactured by one company may have a quite different
  sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation at various frequencies than the same type of component from another
  manufacturer. Since important details such as type of vehicle, vehicle history, and engine make have been recorded for
  very few cases, and crude magnetic signatures haven't been taken except for two or three cases, we are not in a
  position to speculate authoritatively on specific causes of vehicle interference. However, I suggest that the variance
  displayed in Table 21 is due, in part, to the many different vehicles that have been affected and their likely
  heterogeneous response to the UFO phenomenon. Another source for variation is the distance of the UFO from the
  vehicle, though the relationship between severity of effect and distance has not been established. </p>
<p>Laboratory experiments should be conducted to simulate vehicle interference, and most importantly, rigorous studies
  should be undertaken on all future EM events, recording the answers to questions such as those raised in the special
  BUFORA Vehicle Interference supplementary questionnaire form R4 (3). </p>
<p>Some cases included in this study have been examined in depth, such as the November 5, 1967 case in Lake Elsinore,
  California, which was a part of the Condon report (4). Crude magnetic signature tests with a simple compass were done
  on the affected auto and a comparison vehicle. Results indicated that the car had not been subjected to a strong
  magnetic field. However, F.C. Gillespie has discussed several considerations which cast doubt on this conclusion (5).
  In particular, the Condon investigation did not eliminate a possible change in the vertical component of the car's
  magnetization. Dip readings should always be taken in addition to compass readings. Secondly, the analysis assumes
  that the magnetic field was static. An alternating magnetic field could cause partial demagnetization of the vehicle,
  according to Gillespie. It is also within the realm of possibility that a sufficiently high frequency of field
  reversal will not affect the magnetization, to first order. If the relaxation time for the material composing the
  auto's shell is much longer than the period of field reversal, then the car's body will not "see" the magnetic field.
  Engine components or electrical systems can still be affected. </p>
<p>An experiment was done by Watts in England of interest to this subject (6). He found that only an alternating
  magnetic field (50 cps) produced loss of engine power in his test vehicle. A static magnetic field produced no change
  in engine operation. The induced field was on the order of 500 gauss at the coil, which was placed directly over the
  engine. While inexact, the experiment makes plausible the supposition that an alternating field could cause some EM
  effects. This possibility, in conjunction with the points raised by Gillespie, should give us pause when assessing the
  significance of magnetic signature data. We are still, unfortunately, unable to say with certainty which, if any,
  electromagnetic fields were in the environment of a vehicle experiencing an EM effect. </p>
<p>Partially because of such considerations, a statistical study was attempted, rather than an analytical one. The
  presence of a few cases like the Twin Falls, Idaho, event should not mask the results of a statistical study, by
  definition. Hopefully certain patterns and trends which have been isolated will allow an analytical study in the near
  future. </p>
<p>One event not in the catalogue should be mentioned. It has some bearing on the question of which fields and
  intensities can interfere with a vehicle's operation. The event is not in the catalogue because it did not involve a
  UFO sighting, but a lightning stroke instead. </p>
<p>There were five witnesses, including a high-school chemistry and physics teacher, riding to a football game in
  September or October 1973, at about 5:00 P.M. During an intense rain, necessitating slower than normal travel, they
  discovered that the game had been canceled, so the driver began to execute a U-turn to return home. In the middle of
  the turn, a bright lightning stroke touched the ground within 1000 meters of the automobile. Instantaneously, the
  engine stopped as if the ignition had been switched off. The driver failed in three or four successive tries at
  restarting the engine. After waiting about thirty seconds from the time of engine failure, the car was finally
  restarted (7). The vehicle, a 1968 Oldsmobile sedan with a 455 V-8 engine, had no history of engine trouble or of
  stalling in wet weather. The car has continued to function normally after the incident. </p>
<p>While the failure of the engine <i>could</i> be due to wet weather or regular wear, the fact that no problems were
  encountered, either before or after this event, argues powerfully for the cause to be placed on a change in the
  environment caused by the lightning. Magnetic fields generated by typical lightning strokes are on the order of
  10<sup>4</sup> gauss. At the vehicle, the field strength will be reduced by about a factor of 100 (since the B field
  varies as 1/r for a current flow in one direction), giving a field strength of perhaps 100 gauss. This hardly seems
  adequate to initiate engine failure, unless some combination of the damp conditions, electric and magnetic fields
  caused a momentary halt to current flow or increased resistance in some engine component. No check for residual
  magnetism has been made on the vehicle. </p>
<p>Explanations for EM-like events caused by known phenomena are perhaps necessary precursors to our better
  understanding of the UFO EM phenomenon. </p>
<p>At this point, it would be well to discuss two theories advanced to explain some types of EM events. Persinger's
  theory (8) that many UFO sightings, not only EM events, can be explained by seismic stresses causing electric fields
  above the ground through the piezoelectric effect, has been reviewed briefly by Hendry (9). The theory has numerous
  difficulties when applied to UFO sightings, but should be seriously considered. Persinger has at least advanced a
  plausible mechanism, unlike that advanced by Klass ? plasma phenomena (10). </p>
<p>Persinger's discussion of electromagnetic effects does, though, evince a lack of familiarity with the typical EM
  case. He writes that, "Because of the high electrostatic potential involved (in the EM column), light systems in cars
  would also be influenced as well as automobile engines because of effects across the spark-plug gap" (11). Such a
  field would cause effects on the witnesses, such as paralysis, skin prickling, and ionization of the air, all of which
  are reported in just a few events; moreover, our discussion of engine failure should have shown that we do not know
  whether or not such high electrostatic fields could cause a malfunction. </p>
<p>In addition, data previously presented has demonstrated that the distribution of EM events by time of day is
  non-random (refer to Figures 9, 10, and 12). Such a distribution is not consonant with the Persinger theory, which
  predicts a more uniform distribution. </p>
<p>The correct position to take continues to be that theories should be constructed only <i>after</i> the data has been
  analyzed as to possible patterns and relationships, not beforehand.

</p>
<p><a href="/people/m/McCampbellJamesM/index.html">James McCampbell</a> has demonstrated how microwave radiation,
  focused onto a headlight filament by the parabolic design of the reflector, will cause an increase in filament
  resistivity. This increase will be sufficient, given intense enough radiation, to stop current flow, thereby causing
  the headlight to cease to be illuminated (12). This effect can only occur at close range when the UFO is within a
  narrow region directly ahead of the vehicle. An examination of reports in the catalogue will by no means support the
  conclusion that <i>every</i> instance of headlight failure meets this condition. Numerous instances of headlight
  failure have been reported when the UFO was above or to the side of the vehicle. Donald Johnson has shown that there
  is a statistically significant tendency for headlight failure to occur when the UFO is in front of the vehicle (13),
  but that very result illustrates the difficulty of theorizing. There must be at least one other mechanism causing
  headlight failure, even if McCampbell is correct, to explain those cases with the UFO not in front of the vehicle. And
  if there <i>is</i> another mechanism, why, perhaps it also operates when the UFO is in front (it might not be
  position-dependent). If so, how do we differentiate, at the current level of our knowledge, between the two
  mechanisms? The answer is that we cannot.</p>
<p>I do not wish to detract from the excellent ideas of McCampbell and Persinger, nor the possibility of their very
  original theories being partially correct. Their work is important, but it should be examined in the light of all
  currently available data. </p>
<p>Our discussion of McCampbell's theory led to the possibility that more than one generating mechanism may be causing
  EM events. This view has been taken by numerous investigators of the UFO phenomenon. To wit: It is quite likely that
  more than one theory will be needed to explain the UFO phenomenon, because it is really the UFO <i>phenomena,</i>
  composed of events generated by distinct and different mechanisms. Evidence bearing on this question will be presented
  in the final section, but reference is made here to Merritt's work on landing imprint cases (14). Quantitatively
  distinct categories of reports were isolated out of seemingly homogenous data.
