<p class="abstract">Les enquêteurs précédents ont spéculé sur les schémas que l'on pourrait retrouver dans la masse des
  données sur les ovnis, tels qu'une corrélation entre la vitesse des ovnis et leur couleur <span
    class="source">[1]</span>. De manière surprenante pourtant, très peu de travaux ont été publiés sur les schémas ou
  tendances possibles pour toute sous-classe d'événements majeure. Ce n'est que récemment, dans les années 1970s, qu'un
  tel travail a commencé sérieusement. </p>
<p>Cette étude a été conçue dans le but de faire d'une telle analyse le point de focalisation de son travail.
  Contingency tables were constructed for these characteristics: UFO sound, size, and colors; type of EM effect;
  physiological effect; presence of a light beam; and type of UFO. Chi-square tests were then run on each table to test
  the null hypothesis that the two particular characteristics were independent. Due to low expected frequencies in some
  cells, it was impossible to use the chi-square statistic in every test. Saunder's Remarkability statistic was
  substituted in those cases. </p>
<p>Before tables were constructed, a decision was made that, for the null hypothesis to be rejected, the chi-square
  value should fall within the .02 confidence or significance level. The corresponding R value is about 6, though that
  depends on the number of degrees of freedom. This level of significance is more rigorous than that chosen by other
  investigators; it is in fact a compromise between the .01 and .05 levels. Since over 250 contingency tables were
  tested in this section, a .05 confidence level implies that there will be a possibility of finding about twelve
  spurious correlations. In order to reduce such Type 1 error, the .05 level was therefore considered not rigorous
  enough. Conversely, due to the uncertainties in witness reporting of UFO events, the .01 confidence level was believed
  too rigorous for the purposes of this study, which seeks to locate any possible relationships between event
  characteristics. The .02 confidence level was then chosen to minimize Type 1 error but still allow for a significant
  possibility to discover actual correlations. Even at this level, five spurious correlations might be expected. </p>
<p>The above considerations also played a role when choosing R=6 as the significance level for Saunder's statistic.
  Refer to the Appendix for additional details. The R statistic was not used throughout this study because of reader
  familiarity with the chi-square statistic. Conversion from one to the other is possible, as described in Appendix
  A. </p>

<p>When examining the contingency tables, the reader will observe that totals in each category don't equal totals
  previously recorded. To explain why, consider the contingency table for UFO color and physiological effect.
  Ninety-eight cases including a physiological effect were reported. For the color yellow, forty-two events were
  reported. However, there were seven events where there was a physiological effect but no color was <i>reported.</i>
  There were also sixty-nine cases where no effect was felt by the witness and no color was reported. The totals in each
  cell must be adjusted accordingly so that the actual contingency table looks like Table 22.</p>
<p>This distribution is observed to be random upon inspection, and thus the null hypothesis is supported.

  significant at the .02 level.
</p>
<p>Chi-square = 9.83 Chi-square(.02 significance level) = 5.41</p>
<p>For only these two colors do we reject the null hypothesis that color and physiological effect act independently. We
  find a positive correlation between the color blue and the presence of a metallic surface with a physiological effect
  on the witnesses. It is interesting to reflect that blue is at the more energetic end of the visible spectrum, and
  might be an indication of higher energies involved which extend into the ultraviolet and beyond. </p>

<p>By inspection, the dependence of the variables UFO size and the color red is observed to be due to the relatively
  larqe number of small, red UFOs. The dependency of the variable of UFO size and metallic "color" is due to the larqe
  numbers of-metallic UFOs in the fifteen to thirty-three foot size range. This range corresponds exactly to the classic
  diameter of most disc-shaped. metallic UFOs reported since 1947 (2). In fact, only one metallic-appearing UFO was
  reported to have a diameter exceeding 100 feet. It is unclear what these correlations may imply about UFO origin or
  generating mechanisms.
</p>
<p>The next analysis was done for UFO color and UFO sound. No attempt was made to differentiate among the reported
  sounds; it was either recorded as present or absent. Tables 27 and 28 list the correlations located.</p>

<p>Chi-square(.02 significance level) 5.41

</p>
<p>For both green and metallic, there is a positive correlation, such that when they are reported, a sound is also more
  likely to be reported. Significantly, well over one-half of the UFOs with associated sound were reported to be
  metallic (57%). The color metallic has now been found to be positively correlated with UFO size, sound, and the
  physiological effect.
</p>
<p>An analysis was then attempted for UFO color and EM effect. To remind the reader, EM effect has been subdivided into
  these categories:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> EM: interference with operation of engine or electrical equipment

    <p></p></li>
  <li> Control: vehicle under seeming control by outside forces

    <p></p></li>
  <li>Destruction: engine components or electrical equipment damaged

    <p></p></li>
  <li>Re-start: engine resumes operation by itself without the help of the driver

  </li>
</ol>
<p>Only one possible correlation was discovered, as displayed in Table 29. The numbers in this table are particularly
  low because of the many events when the engine did not fail completely, hence could not re-start by itself.

<p>This association between metallic-appearing UFOs and engine re-starts is an odd, negative relationship. It implies
  that vehicle engines do not re-start in the presence of a metallic UFO. No ready explanation comes to mind to help us
  understand this relationship.
</p>
<p>The hypothesis that UFO color and UFO actions are not correlated was next tested. Table 30 presents the only
  interesting result for the color yellow.

<p>In Table 37, the null hypothesis of independence of the two characteristics is rejected because of a
  lower-than-expected number of metallic UFOs that disappear. It is revealing that those UFOs that are reported to be
  metallic tend to act in a manner consistent with that expected of a real physical object in the atmosphere. They do
  not simply disappear, but leave in a continuous trajectory ? albeit very swiftly at times. They land on the ground,
  but rarely move in a simple straight trajectory. Such relationships may shed light on the origin of these UFOs.
</p>
<p>An investigation was then made concerning the connection between UFO color and shape or type. Here UFO type was
  subdivided into only four categories: light, disc, oval (like a sphere), and "other" (where some shape was
  observable). These may be compared to the finer distinctions of Table 6. Table 38 displays the only relationship
  deemed significant. There is no "light" category because, by definition, metallic UFOs could not be classified as a
  light.

<p>The chi-square value does not quite meet our criterion of significance. However, the computed value for R is
  6.37, which indicates that this distribution may be non-random. By computing expected frequencies, we can observe that
  there are more metallic, disc-shaped UFOs than expected by chance, with slightly lower-than-expected numbers for other
  categories.

<p>Almost half of the EM events with a light beam involved a blue-colored UFO. This may be an indication of the
  higher energies that are necessary to generate a beam, which is actually a rather rare feature of EM events.

<p>There is a tendency for UFOs with light beams to chase vehicles. In most of these cases, the beam falls directly
  on the vehicle (see the October 31, 1967 case from Boyup Brook, Australia, for an example).

<p>The distribution of cases in Table 41 is a fairly remarkable result, with the deviation from randomness occurring
  because of the high number of UFOs both controlling the vehicle and emitting a light beam. It is intriguing that a
  correlation has been found for both chasing and controlling vehicles, for, a priori, we might expect that to gain
  control of a vehicle, the UFO would need to be relatively close, thereby requiring a chase to get into position. This
  has been borne out in the statistics.

<p>In almost half of the events involving a light beam, the witness was affected. This compares to an overall rate
  of about 20%. Of course, this is not too surprising if light beams involve higher energies, as suggested by their
  association with the color blue. Vanackeren and Windey have described how the combination of bright lights, witness
  fear, modulated sound, and negative ionization will cause paralysis in many people (3). Since light beams are reported
  to be quite bright, it is possible that some of the reported physiological effects can be attributed to this
  phenomenon rather than to some specific effect of the light beam. No three-way analysis of UFO sound, light beams, and
  physiological effect was attempted in this study.
</p>
<p>The relation of UFO type with various characteristics was then investigated. Table 43 lists the one correlation
  located.

<p>By calculation of expected frequencies, it can be determined that the large chi-square value is due to a large

<p>Using the remarkability statistic, R is found to be approximately 20 (an exact figure cannot be determined due to
  limitations on tabular values in Saunder's book). This is an extremely high value for R and indicates that the data in
  Table 44 is very non-random. By computation of expected cell frequencies, we can observe that most of the deviation
  from expected values occurs because of the ten lights which are less than fifteen feet in size, and the single oval
  UFO that is small. A possible explanation for the small size of lights will be discussed in the concluding
  section. </p>
<p>For the moment, we will continue the investigation of UFO type. Two possible relationships were located between UFOs
  as lights and certain actions. The first is in Table 45.

<p>Using informational statistics, this table yields an R value of 10.13, a significant result. In fact, there are
  <i>no</i> cases of UFOs as lights which leave instantly. Then consider Table 46:

<p>By inspection, we see that a higher-than-expected number of lights tend to move in straight trajectories.</p>
<p>The fact that no correlations were found for the "other" category of UFO type versus other variables is not
  surprising, as this group was hardly homogeneous. Lumping together the remainder of UFO types in one category probably
  masked whatever significance may reside in the data.

<p>This result might be considered to be another confirmation of the theory of Vanackeren and Windey, because one
  can well imagine that a UFO which chases a vehicle, or appears to chase it, will induce witness fear. Since light
  beams occur frequently in such cases, the conditions would be conducive for witness paralysis. </p>
<p>One possible correlation was found for the presence of sound and UFOs that land, as displayed in Table 48.

<p>A higher-than-expected number of events included both the emission of sound and the landing of the UFO on the
  ground. One might speculate that since it is probably only possible to determine whether or not a UFO has landed if it
  is relatively near the witness, this deviation from chance occurs as an artifact of the event. If there is a minimum
  threshold above which the sound emitted can be detected, it will more likely be detected the closer the UFO. And, as
  discussed above, UFOs observed to land might be expected to be closer because of physical requisites. Therefore, we
  may tentatively conclude that this observed tendency for landed UFOs to emit sound is not an association requiring an
  appeal to obscure mechanisms for an explanation.

<p>The departure from randomness in this table occurs because of the higher numbers of small UFOs that chase
  vehicles and almost no UFOs larger than 100 feet that do so. No reason comes immediately to mind to explain this
  result. </p>
<p>Tables 50 and 51 then present the results of an analysis of UFO action and type of EM effect.

<p>Using the informational statistic, we find R~=14.7 a significant result. Indeed, over one-half of the cases
  involving vehicle control occurred when the UFO chased the car or truck. As discussed before, if control of the
  vehicle necessitates being relatively near the vehicle, then it perhaps implies a chase to get into range.

<p>The total number of events is only 268 in Table 51. This is because of the many events where the engine did not
  stop completely ? such events cannot be included in this analysis. The computed value for R is 6.19, which just does
  meet our criterion for significance. A higher-than-expected number of UFOs which disappear occur simultaneously with
  engines which start by themselves. </p>
<p>Finally, correlations were investigated between UFO action and other actions. The first interesting result is
  displayed in Table 52:
</p>
<p>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="3"><p><b>TABLE 52 -</b> UFO LANDING BY UFO DISAPPEARANCE</p></td>

  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Using remarkability, R is found to be 6.87, well into the significant range. Over one-half of the objects that
  disappear also landed. This is a somewhat problematical result; why there should be such an association is unclear.
</p>
<p>One additional result was important, in Table 53:

    <td colspan="3"><p><b>TABLE 53 -</b> UFO TRAJECTORY BY UFO CHASING VEHICLE</p></td>

    <td><p>Chi-square (.02 significance level) = 5.41 </p></td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>This clear association between UFOs that chase vehicles and an erratic trajectory, or conversely, a
  disassociation between chasing and straight trajectories, can be readily explained. One cannot chase a vehicle by
  simply moving in a straight line, unless the vehicle is on a straight road. Even then, the initial and final
  trajectories must follow the same path before and after interaction with the vehicle. It is not surprising, then, that
  UFOs that follow a straight trajectory do not chase vehicles. Nevertheless, this explanation is predicated on the
  hidden assumption that the UFO is physically present in the environment of the witness, i.e., that it must follow
  physical laws. </p>
<p>The various categories of the EM effect were then analyzed in conjunction with all remaining variables. Only one
  possible association was discovered, which seems quite likely not to be spurious. It is presented in Table 54.

</table>
<p>From inspection we see that the large chi-square value is attributed to the large proportion of UFOs that control a
  vehicle <i>and</i> also affect the witness. We might suppose that, isolated from previous results, this correlation
  could be explained by some type of fear reaction on the witness' part, inasmuch as his or her vehicle is out of
  control, a phenomenon likely to cause various physiological symptoms to appear. However, the symptoms which appear in
  EM control events are rarely reported in traffic accidents, which are their closest analogy. In any case, this is a
  definite correlation which must be explained in any theory of EM events. </p>
<p>It is of interest to mention in passing that no correlation was found between UFO size and type of EM effect. We
  might have expected larger UFOs to occur more frequently in cases with destruction of engine components. Such is not
  the case. </p>
<p>Remaining possible relationships between characteristics not yet mentioned were all found not to reject the null
  hypothesis that the characteristics acted independently. Specifically, UFO size was <i>not</i> related to the presence
  of sound or the physiological effect; neither were the last two characteristics correlated. After the many reported
  positive results noted above, we might be tempted to think of this lack of an association as somewhat unexpected. </p>
<p>The several associations between variables that have been discovered may, at this point, be rather confusing to the
  reader. A diagram will be constructed in the next section to make readily discernible these relationships.</p>
