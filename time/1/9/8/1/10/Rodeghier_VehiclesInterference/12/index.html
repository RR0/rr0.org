  <p><b>Appendix</b></p>
  <p>Remarkability,* or R, refers in a very technical sense to the "weight of evidence," derived from specified data and
    favoring a most plausible alternative explanatory hypothesis over a null hypothesis. R is most conveniently
    quantified as bits of information. R maintains two important properties: the value of R expected from an isolated
    analysis of random data is zero, and more generally, 2<sup>R</sup> is an estimate of the number of independent
    analyses of random data that must be performed in order to have a fifty-fifty chance of observing a new R greater
    than the given R. Thus, the implications of a large positive R are similar to the implications of conventional
    "statistical significance," but with the advantage that R may be legitimately computed in a variety of situations
    that do not permit significance tests. </p>
  <p>A great advantage of the informational metric used for remarkability is that it is relatively easy, even at the end
    of the process, to identify and isolate the contribution of the data, independent of any subjective coloration.
    There is, of course, a subjective component in any complete description of a process for scientific use of data. The
    unavoidable subjective ingredient in the remarkability approach lies in the choice of a minimum value for "large,
    positive R." Investigators are free to disagree in this choice, but when they do so, the origin and impact of the
    disagreement will be immediately clear to all. </p>
  <p>The informational transform of p = .05 is 4.25 bits, and the transform of p = .001 is 9.96 bits. Thresholds for
    minimally impressive R in the range from about 5 to about 15 bits are roughly consistent with typical decision rules
    used in significance testing.

    points.</p>
