<h3>Les témoins</h3>
<p>As has been remarked upon by many investigators of the UFO phenomenon, science must study UFO <i>reports,</i> not
  UFOs themselves. In addition, the witness may also be studied as the source of these reports. Though this study was
  not designed to make a concerted investigation into the type of individual who reports an EM event, some gross data is
  available.</p>

<p>Roughly half of the reports involved a single witness, but the converse is that half of the cases had two or more
  witnesses. Barring a <a href="../../../../../../../enquete/dossier/canular/">hoax</a>, it is difficult to disregard an
  event reported by more than one witness.</p>

<p>In every age group, the majority of witnesses are male, a not-unexpected result. Even today, more men drive than do
  women; this difference was even more pronounced in the period from which the bulk of data was gathered. Later in this
  study, some comparisons will be attempted with traffic statistics to analyze the rate of EM event reporting by various
  witness types.</p>
<h3>Event Location</h3>

  </table><p>The location of the witnesses was divided into the three categories of "Urban," "Suburban," and "Rural"
  according to definitions of Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas used by the government. A fourth category labeled
  "Deserted" was added to include those localities with no nearby human habitation. The decision of where to place each
  event was made by referring to the best available maps, on-site investigation, or derived from the original report.
  The location of the witness was used when it did not coincide with that of the UFO. Figure 1 presents the results.</p>
  <p>Fully 74% of the events occurred in rural or deserted areas. This result coincides with that reported by other
    investigators, such as <a href="/people/v/ValleeJacques/index.html">Vallee</a> (2), that high strangeness events
    occur predominantly in areas of low population density. There is no absolute data available concerning comparative
    traffic volume in these different localities; however, it is common sense that, despite the greater distances to be
    traveled in rural areas, the proportion of miles driven to that in suburban and urban areas must be quite low. This
    high rate of reports from sparsely populated areas would thus seem to be determined by the nature of the UFO
    phenomenon itself, rather than just an artifact of the reporting process.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to make any estimates regarding the expected frequency of different weather conditions. One can
    observe that the high proportion of clear and partly cloudy weather should have afforded the witnesses good
    visibility when viewing the phenomenon.</p>

    </table><p>Figure 2 presents the reported distance to the UFO as either estimated by the witness, measured by an
    investigator after the fact, or calculated through angular estimates or comparisons with known objects. Note that
    the variation of the number of reports versus distance follows a roughly exponential curve. The median distance to
    the UFO was about 200 feet, but fully 35% of all reports where data was available placed the UFO within 100 feet of
    the witness. This is an important fact, for it allows us to place more confidence in the witness' report of UFO
    characteristics. The phenomenon <i>was</i> near enough to offer the chance for careful observation, depending upon
    the duration of the event.</p>

    <p>This data indicates that an EM event is likely to last for a brief period of time, anywhere from a few seconds to
      about ten minutes. This result does not compare exactly with that reported from other sources, such as UFOCAT
      high-strangeness cases, which show a peak duration around five minutes (3). It is not characteristic of reported
      durations of ball lightning ? one explanation proferred for EM events, which peak at three to five seconds, but in
      rare cases may persist for several minutes (4). </p>
    <p>Since over half of the events recorded lasted for over four minutes, we can conclude that the witnesses often had
      sufficient time to determine whether the phenomenon in view was ordinary and mundane or extraordinary. They also
      had time to note carefully the phenomenon's characteristics.</p>
    <h3>Geographical Location of Event</h3>
    <p>Roughly one-half of the events occurred in the United States, or 217 cases (49.2%). This figure can be compared
      to the percentage of all primary entries in UFOCAT from the U.S., which is slightly over 40%. Other countries with
      several reports are listed below:</p>

    <p>As with all other subclasses of UFO events, some witnesses to EM events have reported an effect on their bodies
      or immediate surroundings during or after the event. In Table 5, a listing of these effects is presented. While
      128 total effects are listed, only 98 events involved a physiological effect. Several witnesses reported more than
      one effect. The various categories arose during my initial inspection of the reports, but obviously some
      individual judgment was necessary in categorizing effects. Instances of making apparent contact with entities are
      listed separately because of their unusual nature. "Stunned" refers to witnesses who felt as if they were in
      shock, more intense than the fear which most people reported. That is also why there is a separate category for
      "Feelings of peace" because of the contrast with the normal reaction.</p>

    <p>No one effect occurs so often that it could be labeled a typical EM event characteristic. Heating of the air or
      vehicle occurred in only 7% of the cases; no other effect more often than in 4% of the cases. One possible
      inference is that each witness reacts in a unique manner to the energy released by the phenomenon. Another is that
      the phenomenon is not monolithic, but is actually caused by several different mechanisms, each with its particular
      energy distribution and consequent effect on the atmosphere and witness. Still, 22.4% of the EM events included a
      physiological effect, a higher frequency than that derived from other studies of high-strangeness UFO events
      (5).</p>

      include those UFOs which appeared as a bright light of no discernible structure. Various subdivisions could have
      been made, but it was decided instead to keep the number of categories small . Under "Irregular" are placed UFOs
      that were, for example, rectangular, cubic, jellyfish-shaped, or other very odd shapes.

      obviously of a lower quality than actual measurement of the phenomenon would provide, but may still be useful in
      assessing the nature of the phenomenon. Size was recorded in feet rather than meters because it was reported in
      that system by most witnesses.</p>
      <p>There is a decided peak of reports in the ten to thirty-foot range, but a wide variation is evident. Over 9% of
        the available estimates place the UFO size at over 200 feet.</p>

      <p>About 12% of the EM events included the sighting of one or more entities, either humanoid or not, which were on
        or near the UFO. Table 7 lists the frequency of entity reports.
      </p></p><p>Approximately 16% of the reports from Phillips' catalogue of physical traces involved an entity, a
      figure that compares closely to this result (6). While not frequent, the observation of an entity during an EM
      event is not rare.</p>
      <p>Much of the data presented in the text has compared closely to previous studies of high-strangeness events.
        This study has supported or confirmed previous results, extending them to the domain of EM events.</p>
      <h3>UFO Actions</h3>
      <p>While the UFO may remain stationary for several minutes during an event, the phenomenon usually displays some
        type of motion or activity. Table 8 lists the various categories under which these activities have been
        classified. To "Disappear" means that the UFO simply vanished from sight, without any apparent movement (see
        case from Risdon Vale, Tasmania on November 9, 1978). "Left Instantly" means that the witness could observe the
        UFO leave the vicinity, but that this motion occurred in under five seconds, implying a terminal velocity well
        in excess of 1,000 mph (see the August 1, 1979 case from Lewisboro, New York). "Chased Vehicle" is the author's
        subjective judgment, or that of the witness when mentioned, that the UFO purposefully followed or chased the
        vehicle. "Light Beam" refers to the presence of one or more well-delineated beams of light, as from a spotlight
        or laser. "Rotation" refers to actual rotation of one or more portions of the UFO (rotational periods were
        rarely specified). The results:</p>

      <p>As BalIester-Olmos has noted in his book, UFOs, A Landing Phenomenon (7), one of the most widely-reported
        characteristics of all high strangeness UFO events is the frequency of landings by the UFO. About 24% of the EM
        events involved actual contact with the ground by the phenomenon. This is an interesting result, which may be a
        clue as to the nature of the phenomenon. At least one researcher, <a
            href="/people/p/PersingerMichael/index.html">Persinger</a>, has proposed a mechanism to generate EM events
        which requires such proximity to the ground (8).</p>
      <p>No other reported UFO activity occurs frequently, except for chasing of the vehicle, which, given the nature of
        the EM event, might be expected. Cases involving the actual disappearance of the phenomenon are non-negligible,
        though, and will be discussed later.</p>

      <p>UFOs at close range are rather noisy, as is evident from the data reported in Table 9. Over 20% of the events
        included some type of sound attributable to the UFO. In most cases, it could be located as emanating from the
        UFO itself, though in a few instances it pervaded the witness' area so completely that point of origin was hard
        to pinpoint.</p>
      <p>These sounds were categorized using the witnesses' own words whenever possible. Sorting of events was found to
        be not too difficult or imprecise, as only 17% of the events were either one-of-a-kind or too vaguely described
        to be of use.</p>
      <p>A humming sound, like generators in a power plant, was most often reported, though it occurred in only 8% of
        <i>all</i> EM events. Therefore, no one sound can be described as a typical characteristic of an event.</p>
      <h3>Couleur de l'ovni</h3>
      <p>Without the use of a standard color chart in investigations, and when using secondhand reports, one must be
        quite careful when analyzing color data. Whenever possible, sorting was accomplished by using the witnesses' own
        words. If two or more colors were reported on one UFO, both were recorded separately. No distinction was made
        between large, bright color sources and small, dim sources. Only the primary colors were utilized in coding. The
        category "Metallic" refers to the colors silver or dark gray, but in particular to those instances when the
        colored surface appeared metallic to the witness.</p>
