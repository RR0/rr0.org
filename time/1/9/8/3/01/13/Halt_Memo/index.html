  <li>Early in the morning of 27 Dec 80 (approximately 0300L) two USAF security police patrolmen saw unusual lights
    outside the back gate at RAF Woodbridge. Thinking an aircraft might have crashed or been forced down, they called
    for permission to go outside the gate to investigate. The individuals reported seeing a strange glowing object in
    the forest. The object was described as being metallic in appearance and triangular in shape, approximately two to
    three meters across the base and approximately two meters high. It illuminated the entire forest with a white light.
    The object itself had a pulsing red light on top and a bank(s) of blue lights underneath. The object was hovering or
    on legs. As the patrolmen approached the object it maneuvered through the trees and disappeared. At this time the
    animals on a nearby farm went into a frenzy. The object was briefly sighted approximately an hour later near the
    back gate.</li>
  <li> The next day, three depressions 1 1/2″ deep and 7″ in diameter were found where the object had been sighted on
    the ground. The following night (29 Dec 80) the area was checked for radiation. Beta/Gamma readings of 0.1
    milliroentgens were recorded with peak readings in the three depressions and near the center of the triangle formed
    by the three depressions. A nearby tree had moderate (0.05 – 0.07) readings on the side of the tree facing towards
    the three depressions.</li>
  <li> Later in the night a red sun-like object was seen through the trees. It moved about and pulsed. At one point it
    appeared to throw off glowing particles and then broke into five separate white objects and disappeared. Immediately
    thereafter, three star like objects were noticed in the sky, two objects to the north and one to the south, all of
    which were about 10 degrees off of the horizon. The objects moved rapidly in sharp, angular movements and displayed
    red, green and blue lights. The objects to the north appeared to be elliptical through 8-10 power lens. They then
    turned to full circles. The objects in the north remained in the sky for an hour or more. The object to the south
    was visible for two to three hours and beamed down a stream of light from time to time. Numerous individuals,
    including the undersigned, witnessed the activities in paragraphs 2 and 3. </li>
