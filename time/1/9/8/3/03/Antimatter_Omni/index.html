    conversed with an American.</p>
    <p>On the night of <a href="../../../0/12/index.html">December</a> 30, <a href="../../../0/index.html">1980</a>, a
      spaceship <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Bentwaters/index.html">supposedly crashed in the forest
        near the Bentwaters / Woodbridge</a> <a href="/org/uk/mod/RAF.html">Royal Air Force</a> Base, a <a
          href="/org/int/onu/index.html">NATO</a> installation in England. Three silver-suited aliens, each three feet
      tail and hovering above the ground in a beam of light, repaired the damaged craft while conversing with an
      American base commander. Four hours later, repairs complete, the spaceship shot off at tremendous speed.</p>
    <p>A year later, local <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/UFO.html">UFO</a> buff Brenda Butler learned of the incident
      from two <a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">U.S. Air Force</a> men stationed at the base. One claimed to be an
      eyewitness; the other said he had been dispatched to the scene after the spaceship lifted off and could offer only
      hearsay.</p>
    <p>In fear of losing their jobs, both men asked Butler to hide their identity, but she couldn't help revealing the
      unlikely tale to her friend, housewife Dot Street, a member of the <a href="/org/uk/asso/BUFORA.html">British UFO
        Research Association (BUFORA)</a>.</p>
    <p>Intrigued, and hoping to confirm the report, the two women interviewed area foresters and farmers, who reported "<q>strange
      lights and loud bangs</q>" over the air base the day of the <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/scenario/Crashes.html">crash</a>. They also met Woodbridge's British
      liaison officer, Squadron Leader Donald Moreland. He says "<q>I told them I didn't know anything... and they went
        away.</q>"</p>
    <p>But Moreland now concedes there was a "<q>minor incident</q>," one that he reported to the <a
        href="/org/uk/mod/index.html">British Ministry of Defence</a>, a couple of years ago. "<q>There were a few
      lights flipping amongst the trees,</q>" he notes, "<q>but any talk of humanoids is just absolutely ridiculous.</q>"
    </p>
    <p>Colonel Ted Conrad, the base commander alleged to have spoken with the aliens, has a more dramatic version of the
      story: At <time>10:30</time> on that fateful night, he recalls, five Air Force policemen spotted lights from what
      they thought was a small plane descending into the forest. Two of the men tracked the object on foot and came upon
      a large tripod-mounted craft. It had no windows, but was studded with brilliant red and blue lights. Each time the
      men came within 50 yards of the ship, Conrad relates, it levitated six feet in the air and backed away. They
      followed it for almost an hour through the woods and across a field until it took off at "<q>phenomenal speed</q>."
    </p>
    <p>Acting on the reports made by his men, Colonel Conrad began a brief investigation of the incident in the morning.
      He went into the forest and located a triangular pattern ostensibly made by the tripod legs. He claims that the
      never observed any aliens, but he did interview two of the eyewitness, and concludes, "<q>Those lads saw
        something, but I don't know what it was</q>."</p>
    <p>Conrad's chat with his men was the only official probe ever mounted, and it seems unlikely that we'll ever learn
      more. But when Dot Street, of <a href="/org/uk/asso/BUFORA.html">BUFORA</a>, was asked whether she believed this
      incredible tale, she opined. "<q>I'll stick me neck out and say yes</q>." Street's colleague <a
          href="/org/uk/asso/BUFORA.html">BUFORA</a> director <a href="/people/r/RandlesJennifer/index.html">Jenny
        Randles</a> ventured a theory of her own, however: The alien spaceship, she suggests, is just a fiction leaked
      by the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">U.S. Air Force</a> to cover up the <a
          href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/scenario/Crashes.html">crash</a> of a plane carrying nuclear bombs.</p>
