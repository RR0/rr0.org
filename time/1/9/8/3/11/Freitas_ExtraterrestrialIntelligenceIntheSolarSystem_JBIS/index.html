<span class="note">This web version is derived from an earlier draft of the paper and may possibly differ in some substantial aspects from the final published paper</span>
<p class="abstract">The assertion that extraterrestrial intelligences (ETI) do not exist, based on the apparent
  contradictions inherent in the Fermi Paradox, rests upon an unproven and untenable presumption: That ETI are not now
  present in the Solar System. The current observational status of the Solar System is insufficient to support the
  assumption that ETI are not here. Most advanced civilisations also would be either invisible or unrecognisable using
  current human observational methods, so millions of advanced societies may exist and still not be directly detectable
  by us. Thus the Fermi Paradox cannot logically be raised as an objection to the existence of ETI until these major
  observational deficiencies have been corrected.</p>
<section>
  <h2>Introduction to the Argument</h2>
  <p>The Fermi Paradox, attributed to a question from Enrico Fermi after a discussion of the possibility of
    extraterrestrial life during the 1940's, is traditionally formulated as follows: If there are intelligent beings
    elsewhere, then in time they must achieve the technology of nuclear power and space flight and would explore and
    colonise the Galaxy, as humanity has explored and colonised the Earth. Thus they should have been able to travel to
    Earth, but we see no evidence of such visitations, ergo they cannot exist. Fermi's question "Where are they?"
    implicitly construes the absence of extraterrestrials on Earth as positive evidence of their nonexistence elsewhere
    in the Universe. Dormant for many decades, recently the Fermi Paradox has re-emerged as a major modern challenge to
    the existence of extraterrestrial intelligences (ETI). For example, Dyson [1] asserts that the necessary
    technological advancement of advanced ETI implies that the Galaxy should appear far less "wild" if they exist. Hart
    [2] states "Fact A" that "there are no intelligent beings from outer space on Earth now," then suggests and disposes
    of four allegedly exhaustive explanations for this fact: (1) Space travel is infeasible, (2) ETI might choose not to
    explore or colonise, (3) ETI are coming but haven't arrived here yet, and (4) Earth has been visited in the past.
    Tipler [3-4] argues that advanced civilisations would quickly develop self-replicating machine technology, which at
    least one of them would employ to mine, organise and colonise the entire Galaxy in no more than 300 million years;
    our Solar System is still intact, hence ETI cannot exist. Past and recent [5-8] discussions of the Fermi Paradox
    make one critical assumption challenged in the present work: That the absence of extraterrestrials or their
    artifacts on Earth or in the Solar System is an undisputed fact, and, more generally, that advanced technology
    invariably leads to observable alteration of the large-scale physical environment. Cox [9] implicitly recognises
    this when he notes that Hart's "Fact A" is not an empirical fact but rather a theory, and Schwartzman [10] rejects
    the assumption to best reconcile Hart's arguments with those of the advocates of large N (the number of
    communicative civilisations in the Galaxy). But the extent of our ignorance of potential evidence of ETI in the
    Solar System is not generally appreciated. We have not yet looked very hard for extraterrestrials in the Solar
    System, or elsewhere. Until these observational deficiencies are corrected, the Fermi Paradox cannot logically be
    raised as a valid objection to the existence of ETI. </p>
  <p>For purposes of the following discussion it is conceded that continuing reports of UFOs in our skies [11], however
    controversial [12-13], cannot be taken as convincing evidence of extraterrestrial visitation or technology. Hence
    the discussion is restricted to a brief review of the evidence that ETI are absent from the human observational
    Universe, excluding Earth. </p>

  <h2>Non-Observability of Advanced Civilisations</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>Advanced Civilisations May Not be Visible</h3>
    <p>Why might ETI move out into the Galaxy, and not just stay at home? Possible motives might include physical
      resource shortages, the need for new habitats for expanding populations <em>(Lebensraum), </em>the drive for
      sociopolitical power or prestige, the thirst for adventure by certain segments of the population, mischief or
      criminal activity, genuine curiosity about the cosmos and the search for knowledge, religious proselytization of
      other sentient races, propagation of biological genetic material, and so forth. All of these mechanisms, in one
      guise or another, have proved very effective in driving mankind to colonise his entire planet. Similar drives are
      likely to motivate a highly successful, intelligent extraterrestrial species, but most may not produce
      astronomically visible effects.
    </p>
    <p>There are also many reasons why advanced ETI might not engage in colonisation, missionary, or exploitative
      activities. Unless interstellar cargo transport is feasible the most important resource is knowledge, implying
      noninvasive exploration rather than physical exploitation. Self-replicating systems would then be used only to
      build probes and libraries. Even if the material needs of a planetary system full of sentient beings requires the
      rapacious strip-mining of an entire galaxy, our Solar System would probably be spared if stellar systems with life
      are exceedingly rare. </p>
    <p>Genes are environment-specific survival instructions, so transmission of pure genetic information seems pointless
      unless the target planet is terraformed. Interstellar ovum arks, generation ships, and automated bio-regeneration
      only generates more independent competitors for exactly the same limited galactic resources. Like the
      bottle-babies of Huxley's Brave <em>New World, </em>there might be little "parental" attachment or sense of
      community with cloned societies whose cultural interactions have information feedback loops with delays of 104-105
      years, comparable to the timescale of speciation. In these cases each society would remain isolated from the
      others and never forge a pangalactic union, or might choose not to spread their clones throughout the Galaxy. </p>
    <p>These kinds of arguments suggest that the mere possession of advanced technology and civilisation need not imply
      astronomically observable effects. Planetary (Type 1), stellar (Type II), and benign or diminutive galactic (Type
      III) civilisations are not precluded by existing data (see Section 2.3). Our Galaxy may have millions of such
      societies. Both ETI and very advanced technologies may exist - indeed, Type II cultures should possess any
      technical skill we can now imagine. But large-scale observational effects of the astroengineering activities of
      these organisations lie, for the most part, below the threshold of detectability of instruments employed by
      present-day mankind. </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Cosmic Censorship of Rapacious Galactic Civilisations?</h3>
    <p>Such explanations for the absence of obvious astroengineering activity in the Galaxy, if ETI exist, cannot
      conclusively resolve the Fermi Paradox because they cannot apply to all ETI at all times after they achieve
      interstellar flight as required by Hart [2]. In theory, some civilisations might be unable to resist their
      rapacious sociological urges to colonise and to overpopulate, and might proceed to do both at a phenomenal rate.
      Others may be driven by motives too alien to contemplate, resulting in a "cancer of purposeless technological
      exploitation" [14]. Any one such species in theory would press to the physical limits of the Galaxy, creating an
      observably artificially-ordered, "tamed" Galaxy which, because of our failure to observe it, supposedly
      demonstrates the nonexistence of ETI. </p>
    <p>This reasoning is unconvincing because it assumes that "one bad apple spoils the lot." Perhaps there can be no
      bad apples, because they self-destruct before damaging any others. The interstellar abyss may prove an excellent
      quarantine mechanism. We may see no spoilative Type III civilisations either because some unknown selective
      process [15-20] rules out their existence, or because they have never survived long enough to complete their
      galactiforming programme and leave any major observable effects. </p>
    <p>Apparently Type III civilisations who make extensive and exploitative use of highly visible, very advanced
      technology are very rare or nonexistent. Why might this be? Extinction as a natural phenomenon is quite common on
      Earth, where biological life has a 99.9% species extinction rate. Social pessimists might argue that the almost
      instinctual voracity of humans, coupled with our technological capability for self-destruction, may eventually
      lead to the downfall of our planetary civilisation. It is logically acceptable to infer the existence of selective
      mechanism(s) which result in the "cosmic censorship" of civilisations who exploit glaringly obvious, rapacious
      technologies to the utmost. </p>
    <p>The ultimate outcome of a mastery of fusion, starflight, machine replication and other advanced technologies is
      not necessarily an exploitative, colonial galactic civilisation, nor is the outcome necessarily astronomically
      observable. An information-intensive culture, for instance, would be very difficult to see. The present
      observational record can only support the much more restricted conclusion that no rapacious galactic civilisations
      are currently loose in the Galaxy. </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Limits on Observability of Advanced Civilisations</h3>
    <p>Visual observations of the Galaxy along the plane are limited to a few kiloparsecs; because of interstellar gas
      and dust obscuration. Even radio VLBI cannot resolve 1 AU Dyson-sphere-like structures beyond a range of a few
      kpc, and few celestial objects have been mapped to this extreme resolution. High technology activities by ETI such
      as terraforming and astrophagy might not be immediately obvious at interstellar distances, even to radio
      astronomers, and certainly a major fraction of the Galaxy could have been colonised without us being able to
      observe it. Advanced races could have made many starts on transforming the Galaxy but failed for various reasons,
      yet the observational consequences to humanity would be minimal.</p>
    <p>Perhaps sheer scale in constructing observable artifacts is restricted by the Square-Cube law, gravitational
      tidal forces, available energy sources, and other fundamental physical limitations to astro-engineering projects
      which we may not yet fully appreciate. For example, large-scale artificial habitats may be more likely to consist
      of less-observable swarms of small O'Neill colonies rather than gigantic monolithic architectures, as this
      maximises the ratio of living area to mass. Also, potential but unknown linkage between the existence of ETI and
      such unexplained astronomical phenomena as the galactic "missing mass," quasars, and exploding galaxies like
      Cygnus A cannot be overlooked. </p>
    <p>A well-ordered galaxy could imply an intelligence at work, but the absence of such order is insufficient evidence
      to rule out the existence of galactic ETI. The incomplete observational record at best can exclude only a certain
      limited class of extraterrestrial civilisation - the kind that employs rapacious, cancer-like, exploitative,
      highly-observable technology. Most other galactic-type civilisations are either invisible to or unrecognisable by
      current human observational methods, as are most if not all of expansionist interstellar cultures and Type I or
      Type II societies. Thus millions of extraterrestrial civilisations may exist and still not be directly observable
      by us. </p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>They May Be In The Solar System</h2>
  <p>Two general categories of evidence are commonly used to argue that ETI are not present in the Solar System. These
    are (a) lack of purposeful communications, and (b) lack of physical observables. However, we shall argue that null
    data in each of these two evidentiary classes may be due more to anthropocentric assumptions and the poor
    observational record than to the absence of ETI in the Solar System. </p>
  <section>
    <h3>Lack of Purposeful Communications</h3>
    <p>The first evidentiary category is lack of purposeful communications: If ETI were here, they would have used their
      superior technology to contact us, or to get us to notice them. If they are here, where are they?</p>
    <p>Ball [21] proposes that we may be part of an interstellar zoo or wilderness preserve, carefully isolated for our
      own good. Stephenson [22] suggests that if intelligence is rare in the Galaxy, it is more likely to be handled
      with greater circumspection and care. Kuiper and Morris [23] reiterate the old science fiction notions of culture
      shock and the idea that we might not be contacted until we reach some intellectual threshold to avoid
      "extinguishing the only resource on this planet that could be of any value to [ETI]." Papagiannis [24] suggests
      "confusion and indecision... they might be debating on whether to crush us or help us, postponing their decisions,
      waiting to see what we are going to do with ourselves." </p>
    <p>The author has suggested [<a href="https://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/TheCaseForInterstellarProbes1983.htm">25</a>]
      another more likely possibility - that there is no reason why They should <em>not</em> be silent. It is
      anthropocentric to assume, for example, that alien spacecraft entering the Solar System on a mission of
      reconnaissance or self-replication will feel the obligation to announce their presence to us or to request
      permission to proceed. Probes will probably just ignore us and go on about their business. </p>
    <p>It is entirely conceivable that some ETI may not particularly care whether we find them or not, or may actually
      be interested in communicating with us yet be unwilling to initiate contact unconditionally. For example, they may
      refuse to speak to beings who occupy only one planet, fearing culture shock to a "One Earth" mentality
      unaccustomed to dealing with the environmental and cultural relativities of many worlds. The exercise of finding
      them would serve as an initiation, a kind of "entrance examination" to pass before opening contact. Platt [26]
      suggests that advanced civilisations may be "like the parents who do not talk to the baby until the baby wakes
      up." </p>
    <p>Or, if life is not especially rare in the Universe, then, rather than carefully shepherding our development with
      extreme circumspection like an endangered species [21, 22], ETI may adopt a much more casual approach to contact.
      They may have tremendous confidence in their ability to manage potential contact events to successful resolution,
      based on numerous Previous similar encounters. In this case, humankind might rate neither ultraconservative
      wildlife management nor heedless astrophagic exploitation. The most likely response would be careful and
      unobtrusive observation, with no special effort to conceal the alien presence. Base site would be chosen for
      reasons of efficiency, maintainability, and low environmental risk. </p>
    <p>Of course these arguments may be multiplied endlessly, illustrating the probative weakness of this particular
      category of null evidence. While we have no convincing evidence of purposeful communication between humanity and
      advanced ETI, neither do the null data constitute compelling evidence that ETI are not here because this
      conclusion is contingent upon unknown choices that may be available to such beings and our assumption that they
      would wish to communicate. </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Lack of Physical Observables</h3>
    <p>The only true compelling category of evidence is physical observables. For instance, we might observe their
      spacecraft, their self-replicating machinery, their habitats or strip mines, or a host of other physical
      manifestations which are the hallmark of technological activity. This evidence also depends on alien choice - ETI
      might conceal their technology for the same reasons they choose not to communicate. Some activities might be too
      obvious to disguise, such as planetary xenoforming or astrophagy by voracious swarms of replicating machines, but
      given a sufficiently advanced technology ETI should be able to conceal most of their mechanisms and activities to
      high perfection.</p>
    <p>The present analysis thus concerns only those ETI who, for whatever reason, choose not to use perfect means to
      hide all physical evidence of their technological activities. This is the most conservative assumption possible
      from the standpoint of the Fermi Paradox, as the more restrictive assumption that some or all activities are
      perfectly disguised leads to a trivial explanation for the apparent absence of ETI in the Solar System.</p>
    <section>
      <h4>Physical Evidence in the Solar System</h4>
      <p>What sort of physical evidence might be available for us to find? Material artifacts of a commonplace nature
        including small tools, debris, garbage dumps, radioactive hot spots, and passive monoliths located on planetary
        surfaces [27] would be less than 1-10 metres in size. No body in the Solar System has yet been comprehensively
        mapped to this resolution except Earth, which is excluded from the present analysis, hence none of these
        commonplace items is observable by our present instrumentation.</p>
      <p>If an exploitative Type II civilisation exists or had ever existed in our vicinity, then the Solar System would
        have been wholly converted to replicating machines mass, our planets sorted into their constituent elements for
        transshipment or industrial use and the Sun-stripped of its fuel - and of course we would not be here to discuss
        the outcome of these activities. Since humanity exists, rapacious nearby stellar civilisations are ruled out,
        much as exploitative galactic civilisations are provisionally excluded by the observational evidence as
        discussed earlier. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, Kuiper and Morris [23] and Stephenson [22] argue that the only plausible interstellar
        mission which would be launched by a benign civilisation would be one of pure exploration, the pursuit of
        knowledge as a source of wealth. If this is true, then the most noticeable extraterrestrial artifact we might
        expect to find in the Solar System would be either a self-reproducing machine system which is building and
        launching interstellar probes bound for other star systems (or the aftermath of such activity) or just the
        probes themselves parked here in some convenient locale or orbit [<a
            href="https://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/SETAJBISNov1983.htm">28</a>]. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Observables of Interstellar Messenger Probes</h4>
      <p>Detection of probes would be especially challenging, as these could in theory be located almost anywhere. A
        typical alien probe might be 1-10 metres in size - this is large enough to house a microwave antenna to report
        back to the senders, and to survive micrometeorite impacts for millions of years, but light enough to fly across
        the interstellar gulf without consuming unreasonable amounts of energy [<a
            href="https://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/WhereAreThey1983.htm">29</a>].</p>
      <p>A spherical Solar System boundary enclosing the orbit of Pluto consists of 260,000 AU<sup>3</sup> of mostly
        empty interplanetary space and 10<sup>11</sup> km<sup>2</sup> of planetary and asteroidal surface area. To be
        able to say with any certainty that there is no alien presence in the Solar System, you have to have carefully
        combed most of this space for artifacts. </p>
      <p>Currently the sky has been exhaustively surveyed to perhaps magnitude +14, the Palomar Schmidt Sky Survey
        extends to +21, and the best available magnitude limit for any telescope on Earth is about mv = +24. This means
        that at best, current surveys from Earth might have detected an unmoving, mirror-shiny, optimally-oriented
        10-metre object orbiting 0.01, 0.25, and 1 AU from Earth, respectively. If the artifact is smaller, moving,
        black, or canted at a different angle then it will be even harder to see. </p>
      <p>So we can only scan the nearest 4 AU3 of space for probes, but we have at least 260,000 AU<sup>3</sup> to
        search. Even if the Palomar 200-inch telescope was employed exclusively to search for alien artifacts it could
        reach at most one-millionth of the necessary volume. Orbital space, in other words, is <em>at least </em>99.999%
        unexplored for 1-10 metre objects. </p>
      <p>A more realistic assessment suggests that the visual detection threshold for alien probes for present-day
        humanity includes only 10<sup>-5</sup>-10<sup>-11</sup> of the potential probe residence volume. This estimate
        assumes a random search pattern typical of past serendipitous observations which might have discovered alien
        artifacts if they were present [cf. <a href="https://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/SETAJBISNov1983.htm">28</a>, <a
            href="https://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/WhereAreThey1983.htm">29</a>]. Radar and infrared measurements cannot
        substantially improve this current limit. </p>
      <p>How about probes parked on planetary surfaces? Of the 0.1 trillion square kilometres of Solar System territory
        other than Earth, less than 50 million has been examined to 1-10 metre resolution. So 99.95% is still virgin
        territory as far as a search for extraterrestrial artifacts is concerned. If objects are buried somewhere or
        floating in a Jovian atmosphere, there is almost zero chance we could have found them up to now. Even huge 1-10
        kilometre artificial alien habitats occupying the Asteroid Belt [24] would appear visually indistinguishable
        from asteroids to terrestrial observers, and the Belt population itself is poorly catalogued. So it is
        exceedingly unlikely that we would have spotted an extraterrestrial artifact anywhere in the Solar System unless
        it was desperately trying to get our attention. And why should it bother to do that? </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Observables of Self-Replicating Systems</h4>
      <p>Observation of an operating replicating machine system would be only marginally easier. Likely sites are the
        Asteroid Belt [24] and the outer Jovian and Saturnian moons [<a
            href="https://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm">30</a>]. Recent technical studies [<a
            href="https://www.islandone.org/MMSG/aasm/">31</a>] suggest individual replicating systems may be 100 metres
        in diameter or less, so a factory system for building probes should not exceed 0.1-1 km in size, again well
        beyond our ability to see it except on the Moon and portions of Mars. Ignition of fusion rockets to propel
        daughter probes out of the Solar System is detectable using amateur telescopes, but the observation window is
        very small and of very short duration. Self-reproducing probes should be able to replicate a whole generation in
        1000 years [<a
            href="https://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm">30</a>] or less, and be quickly on their way, so
        only mining pits and small debris may remain at this late date.</p>
      <p>The total mass of probes needed to explore even the entire Galaxy is astonishingly small. If each
        self-replicating probe, mass fully-fueled about 1010 kg [<a
            href="https://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ReproJBISJuly1980.htm">30</a>], makes 10 replicas during each of 11
        generations, enough to span the entire Galaxy [<a
            href="https://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/ComparisonReproNov1980.htm">32</a>], that is 10<sup>11</sup>x
        10<sup>10</sup> kg = 10<sup>21</sup> kg or about the mass of Ceres, the largest known asteroid. If the Solar
        System carried the burden of manufacturing all 10<sup>11</sup> probes to explore the entire Galaxy, how could we
        know if one Ceres-size asteroid had ever been removed from the Asteroid Belt? </p>
      <p>And take the argument one step further. Assume that one million extraterrestrial civilisations each pillage the
        Solar System for materials to build and launch their own million independent probe networks, each covering every
        star in the Galaxy. The total requirement is still only 10<sup>6</sup> x 10<sup>21</sup> kg = 10<sup>27</sup>
        kg, about the mass of Jupiter. It is doubtful we could say for certain if even this much matter had been stolen
        away sometime in the remote past. </p>
      <p>More likely, starfarers won't be greedy and will require each target star system to supply no more than one new
        generation of replicants. This is only 10<sup>11</sup> kg, enough to fill one 1-kilometre crater 40 metres deep
        or to make one 400-metre-wide asteroid. We'd never miss the mass. </p>
      <p>Even more likely, ETI will erect their self-replicating probe factories in uninhabitable star systems to avoid
        disturbing us and just send nonreproducing exploratory probes here [<a
            href="https://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/SETAJBISNov1983.htm">28</a>]. In this case, no local -mass would be
        missing and there'd be no surface debris either. </p>

  <h2>Summary and Conclusions</h2>
  <p>In<strong> </strong>this paper the critical assumption that ETI are not present in the Solar System, essential to
    the logic of the Fermi Paradox argument for the nonexistence of extraterrestrial intelligence, has been challenged.
    Observations suggest that the Galaxy may be devoid only of rapacious, exploitative civilisations, not of all ETI, at
    the present time, and that current knowledge of the Solar System is insufficient to support the presumption that ETI
    are not here. Hence the conclusion that we are alone, based on the Fermi Paradox, is without foundation.</p>
  <p>The observational record is sufficiently incomplete that major galactic technologies may yet have gone unnoticed.
    The strongest conclusion justified by the data is: Due to some special selection effect, galactic civilisations who
    make extensive and exploitative use of large-scale, astronomically observable, very advanced technology are very
    rare or nonexistent. This does not rule out planetary- or stellar-scale technical civilisations, nor does it
    preclude benign, appropriate-technology" galactic civilisations. A well-ordered galaxy would imply the existence of
    ETI, but the absence of such order cannot prove the nonexistence of ETI. </p>
  <p>Two categories of evidence might show that ETI are not present in the Solar System: The admitted lack of purposeful
    communications (uncompelling because it depends upon unknown choices available to ETI and our assumption that they
    would wish to communicate) and physical observables. </p>
  <p>Astronomical searches to date are extremely unlikely to have observed physical evidence of ETI if it exists. The
    most easily observable extraterrestrial artifacts would be self-reproducing machine systems, the aftermath of their
    activity, or interstellar messenger probes. Orbiting probes could be located almost anywhere within a search volume
    of which only 10<sup>-5</sup>-10<sup>-11</sup> has been reliably scanned by terrestrial telescopes, and few
    observations to date would have been capable of detecting operating replicating machine systems. Even building and
    launching probes to every star in the Galaxy generates an unobservably small local mass deficit, but most likely the
    probe factory and its mining pits would be located elsewhere so probes would remain the only observables. </p>
  <p>Evidence from astronomy that could confirm or deny the presence of ETI in the Solar System is scanty or
    nonexistent. Cosmological data arguably also are incomplete, consequently cannot prove the nonexistence of all
    galactic-scale ETI. The Fermi Paradox cannot logically be raised as an objection to the existence of ETI until these
    major observational deficiencies have been corrected.</p>
