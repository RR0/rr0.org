<p>One of the more curious features of the followers of the various religions is that, being so dogmatically certain
  that in their own particular little faith they already possess the whole Truth about all things in Heaven and Earth,
  it almost never occurs to any of them to look elsewhere and find out what the followers of other religions may know or
  may have discovered.
</p>
<p>This is certainly a pity, for study of all the great world religions - and notably Islam - would yield valuable clues
  as to the true nature of the so-called "UFO Phenomenon" and would rapidly eliminate much of the fatuous "Space-Age
  Mythology" that has been spawned in such profusion over the last three decades.
</p>
<p>Islam knows, in fact, of the existence of three entirely separate and distinct species of intelligent beings in the
  Universe, and indeed can furnish surprisingly precise details regarding their natures and roles and activities.
</p>
<section>
  <h2>Angels, Men, and Jinns</h2>

  <p> The first category is of course that of the Angels or Messengers (Greek: <em>Angelos;</em> Hebrew:
    <em>Malach;</em> Arabic: <em>Malak</em>). These are high beings created of light.
  </p>
  <p> The third category are <em>Men</em>, with bodies created according to the <em>Qur'an</em>, of <em>clay</em>, or,
    in other words, this being poetic language, they have physical bodies assembled from the mineral and chemical
    elements of our <em>Periodic Table</em> -- the "<em>planetary body</em>", as Gurdjieff used to call it.
  </p>
  <p> The second category, however, and the one with which we are here concerned, is the category of those beings <em>(created
    before man was)</em> who are referred to collectively in Arabic as <em>Al-Jinn</em>.<a
      href="https://www.ufoinfo.com/news/FSR_ufoentities.html#notes">1</a> Although there is some dispute about it among
    Arab grammarians, most of their lexicologists seem to hold that the word derives - as Arabic words almost invariably
    do - from a verb-root, namely <em>janna</em>, <em>"to hide or to conceal"</em> - indeed a very fitting derivation
    for the name of these creatures.
  </p>
  <p> Whereas the bodies of Angels are of light and the bodies of men are of the gross elements of the Earth, the bodies
    of <em>Al-Jinn</em> consist of what is variously translated as <em>"essential fire"</em>,<a
        href="https://www.ufoinfo.com/news/FSR_ufoentities.html#notes">2</a> or <em>"essential flame"</em>,<a
        href="https://www.ufoinfo.com/news/FSR_ufoentities.html#notes">3</a> or <em>"smokeless fire"</em>, or <em>"smokeless
      flame"</em>, and it is specifically stated in the <em>Qur'an</em> (Surah XV, 26 and 27) that they were created
    before mankind was. (Some scholars have speculated that these might be <em>the "Pre-Adamic men"</em> whose existence
    is hinted at here and there in the "Holy Bible.")
  </p>
  <p> There has been much debate among modern students of Arabic as to precisely what these terms <em>"min nari
    al-samumi"</em> <a href="https://www.ufoinfo.com/news/FSR_ufoentities.html#notes">2</a> and <em>"min marijin min
    narin"</em> <a href="https://www.ufoinfo.com/news/FSR_ufoentities.html#notes">3</a> can conceivably mean in modern
    parlance, and some scholars have concluded that, in using these terms, the Prophet Muhammad (the Peace and Blessings
    of Allah be upon him) was here attempting to describe what Western occultists have tried to describe by such terms
    as <em>ether</em>, or maybe the so-called <em>etheric or astral planes</em>. (I have also seen it suggested that
    some sort of <em>plasma</em> is indicated.)
  </p>
  <p> (Needless to say, such concepts as <em>etheric plane</em> and <em>astral plane</em> have no meaning for modern
    Science and, so far as I know, apart from Dirac, the physicists have abandoned their speculations regarding the
    existence of an ether.)
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The Source of the Jinns</h2>
  <p> Wherever it is that the <em>Jinns</em> are thought of as being normally located, it seems highly likely that the
    source of many of them, at any rate, is not very distant from us, and some Muslim scholars who have become aware of
    the current Western research into the so called "UFO Phenomenon" and have reflected awhile upon it have concluded
    and I think correctly - that maybe the best way we can start to visualise these matters is by thinking of the <em>Jinns
      as being very close indeed to us and yet at the same time somehow very far from us. In other words, on some other
      dimension, or in some other Space/Time framework, "right here", or maybe in a world of antimatter right here, or
      occupying as it were some other Universe that is here, behind Alice's mirror: "a mirror-universe on the other side
      of the Space-Time Continuum" as it has been neatly put by some investigators</em>.
  </p>
  <p> The <em>Qur'an</em>, however, is not clear on this, and admittedly it looks as though it is very possible that
    some of the <em>Jinns</em> could be fully physical and what we call extraterrestrials, while other species of them
    are of an altogether and finer sort of matter, corresponding to what various UFO investigators have tried to
    indicate by such terms as <em>"ultraterrestrial"</em> or <em>"metaterrestrial"</em>.
  </p>
  <p> In thinking about these ideas, we might bear in mind the theory of the Russian philosopher P. D. Ouspensky
    regarding the possible existence of other, more subtle, levels of matter on which the elements of the Periodic Table
    of our own chemical world are repeated - and, if I understand him aright, repeated more than once, on more than one
    level. The early writings of Dr. Meade Layne in the USA about the <em>"Dense Etheric World"</em> from which he
    maintained that the UFO entities and their craft originated should also be borne in mind. (His book <em>The Coming
      of the Guardians</em>, was published in 1958, and may prove one day to have been very important indeed.) Certain
    of the benevolent <em>Jinns</em> may well be our "Guardians".
  </p>
  <p> That there is some close affinity, or some link of destiny between <em>Jinns</em> and Mankind seems certain, for
    although the vast majority of the <em>Jinns</em> are <em>devils, shaytans</em>,<a
        href="https://www.ufoinfo.com/news/FSR_ufoentities.html#notes">4</a> nevertheless we are assured in the <em>Qur'an</em>
    that some among their many species are "goodies" and are capable of salvation. For it is specifically stated that
    Muhammad was sent as a Messenger to both Mankind and the <em>Jinns</em>, so that, in the Final Days, some of the
    <em>Jinns</em> will enter into Paradise, while the rest of them will be cast down into Hell. Their revelation to
    IBLIS,<a href="https://www.ufoinfo.com/news/FSR_ufoentities.html#notes">5</a> the Top Devil (= "SATAN") is in general
    somewhat obscure. In the <em>Qur'an Iblis</em> is certainly described as a <em>Jinn</em>, but elsewhere in the <em>Qur'an</em>
    he is also described as an <em>Angel</em>. (Surely the explanation is that <em>Iblis</em> is that same high being,
    originally of Angelic status, who rebelled against God and is named in the Christian texts as <em>"Lucifer"</em>)
  </p>
  <p> Had we the space, much more might be said about the <em>Jinns</em> and their doings, but only a brief account of
    their main characteristics can here be given. Their principal features, as listed below, are as I have gathered them
    from all the Muslim written and traditional sources that I have been able to consult over the past 15 years. The
    reader can see for himself the parallels with the reported features of UFO entities and can draw his own
    conclusions. I hope I do not have to labour the point, space being precious.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>The Chief Characteristics of the Jinns</h2>

  <p> 1. In the normal state they are not visible to ordinary human sight.</p>
  <p>2. They are, however, capable of materializing and appearing in the physical world. And they can alternately make
    themselves visible or invisible at will.
  </p>
  <p>3. They can change shape, and appear in any sort of guise, large or small. (See for example, Ahmad Jamaludin's
    excellent report, <em>A Wave of Small Humanoids in Malaysia in 1970</em>, in FSR Vol. 28, No. 5). Ahmad Jamaludin is
    a Muslim, and he knows, of course, what it is that we are talking about.
  </p>
  <p> 4. They are able also to appear in the guise of <em>animals</em>. (Yetis? Pumas? Loch Ness Monsters?)</p>
  <p> 5. They are inveterate liars and deceivers, and delight in bamboozling and misleading mankind with all manner of
    nonsense. (See the average Spiritualist <em>seance</em> for examples of their activities, and also the usual
    "communications" from UFO entities in close-encounter cases.)
  </p>
  <p> 6. They are addicted to the abduction or kidnapping of humans. (The Scotsman Robert Kirk, who wrote <em>"The
    Secret Commonwealth"</em> in 1691, evidently "knew more than was good for his health", and was killed by them.)
  </p>
  <p> 7. They delight in tempting humans into sexual intercourse and liaisons with them, and Arabic literature abounds
    with accounts of this kind of contact by mankind with both the <em>"goodies"</em> and the <em>"baddies"</em> among
    the <em>Jinns</em>. There are also even a considerable number of accounts of encounters between the
    <em>"goodies"</em> and famous Muslim saints. For example, the book <em>Manaquib al-Arifin</em><a
        href="https://www.ufoinfo.com/news/FSR_ufoentities.html#notes">6</a> has a number of very significant references
    to contacts between such higher beings, and <em>Jalal al-Din Rumi</em>, Islam's greatest mystical poet, who lived
    from 1207 to 1273.
  </p>
  <p> (I often wonder which category of <em>Jinns</em> it was that was encountered in Brazil by the farmer A. V. B. See
    my third article on "A. V. B.", <em>Postscript to the Most Amazing Case of All</em>, in FSR Vol. 11, No. 4, August
    1965.)
  </p>
  <p><em>In official Islam - and this cannot be over-emphasized - the existence of the Jinns has always been completely
    accepted, even legally, and even to this day, in Islamic jurisprudence. The full consequences implied by their
    existence were worked out long ago. Their legal status, in all respects, was discussed and fixed, and the possible
    relations between them and mankind - especially in relation to questions of marriage and property! - were seriously
    examined by jurists, as the greatest and most authoritative Western source, the Encyclopaedia of Islam,
    confirms.</em></p>
  <p> Stories of sexual commerce between <em>Jinns</em> and mankind have been of perennial interest to Arab readers, and
    it is important at this point to mention that in <em>Chinese</em> literature (and in China the Han population are
    not Muslims - only certain of the smaller minority peoples of the North-West and Far West are) there is also a
    considerable tradition of this sort which awaits examination by Ufologists.
  </p>
  <p> The great Arabic literary catalogue known as the <em>Fihrist</em>,<a
      href="https://www.ufoinfo.com/news/FSR_ufoentities.html#notes">7</a> compiled in the year 373 of the Muslim
    Calendar (= A.D. 995) by Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Abi Ya'qub al-Nadim al-Warraq al-Baghdadi, lists no less than
    sixteen works dealing with this theme. (Compare also the European occultists' records of sexual contact between men
    and female <em>Sylphs</em>, as well as the copious medieval Christian records relating to <em>Incubi</em> and <em>Succabae</em>.)
  </p>
  <p> Most Westerners will discount all this talk about the <em>Jinns</em> with the usual argument that the Arabs "are
    barbarians anyway". Let me therefore point out that, in A.D. 995, when the <em>Fihrist</em> was written, the
    brilliant civilization of the Arabs was incomparably higher than anything elsewhere in the world except for China
    and that our Christian, Western <em>Renaissance</em> owes its origins as much to our contact with Islam (the
    Crusades) as to the early percolation of Greek learning to the West. As a matter of fact quite a lot of the
    philosophy and the literature of the Greeks reached us first, not in Greek at all, but in the Arabic translations
    secured from Cordoba and Toledo in Spain in the 10th and 11th centuries, when the Muslims still held most of Spain.
    It is only in the last few centuries, and particularly since the Industrial Revolution and the growth of modern
    materialistic Science, that the West has forged ahead. But in 1200 A.D. Muslim Science was in the lead, particularly
    in such fields as Medicine, Mathematics, and Astronomy, and it would be grossly impudent to assume that our current
    "superiority" over them has anything permanent about it.
  </p>
  <p> 8. <em>The Jinns</em> are wont to snatch up humans and teleport or transport them, setting them down again - if
    indeed they ever do set them down again - miles away from where they were picked up, and all this is the "twinkling
    of an eye". (See my first article on <em>Teleportations</em>, about the Spanish soldier who, on October 25, 1593,
    was suddenly taken from Manila in the Philippine Islands across the Pacific to Mexico City. In FSR Vol. 11, No. 2,
    1965).
  </p>
  <p> 9. The Arabian tradition asserts that, throughout all known history, there have been a few particular human beings
    who, through some strange favour, have "been in league with the <em>Jinns</em>" or "had a compact with the
    <em>Jinns</em>" - to such a degree that the <em>Jinns</em> have endowed them with what we regard as "preternatural
    powers" - i.e., <em>psychic powers</em>. These humans have consequently become known as wonder-workers, soothsayers,
    and <em>magicians</em>. (Either "white magicians" or "black magicians", depending of course upon what sort of <em>Jinns</em>
    they were in league with.)
  </p>
  <p> Here again, compare the European tradition about individuals who have discovered how to collaborate with the <em>Kingdom
    of the Sylphs</em> or the <em>Fairies</em>. For example, there is the case of the "working partnership", not more
    than seventy years ago, between a <em>Sylph</em> and a highly successful Parisian dealer in rare old books. The <em>Sylph</em>
    made its contribution by acting as the "scout" and finding out where and in whose possession the rare books were.
    All the dealer had to do then was to approach the owners and offer to buy!
  </p>
  <p> 10. Along with all these displays of prowess by the <em>Jinns</em> there goes, finally, a tremendous <em>telepathic
    power</em> and the ability (to use an age-old term) to <em>'cast a glamour'</em> over their human victims. Our UFO
    records are already full of evidence of this.
  </p>
  <p>How much of what we see happening today, at the highest levels of international politics, as well as in ordinary
    human affairs, can be attributed to this subtle control and interference in our lives by insidious and unseen
    forces! Indeed, this is one of the prime reasons for the parlous state in which man finds himself. Some recent
    reports from UFO investigators hint at alien plans to provoke war here and drive the Gadarene Swine (mankind) over
    into the abyss.
  </p>
  <p>The present-day Christians, who generally seem to have very little sense of curiosity, are apparently quite happy
    to pass their days in total ignorance of all this. But a careful study of the New Testament <em>(and only in the
      original Greek!)</em> will show clearly that nothing of what is said above was unknown either to the Teacher and
    Healer Jeshu of Nazareth or to his principal followers - particularly Paul. (Incidentally, Christians may like to
    know that in Islam the full name and title of Jeshu of Nazareth is ISSA, SON OF MARY, WORD OF GOD.
  </p>
  <p>Long before the rise of Christianity or Islam there were of course other great Teachers (Messengers) who perceived
    clearly the situation in which mankind finds itself. One of these was Zarathustra (Zoroaster) in the old Iranian
    civilization of the Achaemenidae -- about 600 or 700 years B. C. The great religious text left by Zarathustra is the
    <em>AVESTA</em>, which tells us much about the Demonic Forces, referred to under the blanket term of AHRIMAN, the
    Enemy of Light. Mankind, in this teaching, is seen as a special creation of ORMAZD, the SUPREME SPIRIT, who is
    locked in permanent conflict with AHRIMAN.
  </p>
  <p><em>The soul of man is the object of the war, and man himself is the battlefield.</em></p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Dr. Rudolph Steiner</h2>
  <p>In our own days, there has probably been no teacher who saw and understood all this more clearly that the great
    Austrian Dr. <span class="people">Rudolf Steiner</span> (1861-1925), founder of the Anthroposophical Society.
  </p>
  <p>Clairvoyant from childhood, <span class="people">Steiner</span> saw into the other worlds and planes and saw deeply
    into the human heart, and no books or teachings are so relevant as his are to the crisis of mankind that is now upon
    us. His lectures throughout <time>1917</time>, for example, show clearly that he foresaw, in their totality, the
    political, social, and military results and the police-state tyranny which would inevitably follow from the Russian
    Revolution, just as the "Lady" of the Apparitions at Fatima in the same year also did. Steiner foresaw what would
    result in the world as a whole from a materialistic science run mad: the development of "test-tube" man, "biological
    engineering" and other horrors; the deliberate creation and development of living monsters; and the soul-less,
    God-less, dehumanized, computerized, insect-like chromium and plastic slave world of "1984" that may now be at hand.
  </p>
  <p>According to Steiner, a tremendous and crucial round in the battle was fought out in the last thirty years of the
    19th century, and on the Inner Planes, between the Forces of AHRIMAN (the term he took over from Zarathustra) and
    the FORCES OF LIGHT. These latter are conventionally known to our Western, Christian tradition as the Cohorts of
    Michael. Steiner said that the fight ended in a complete victory for the LIGHT, but that, as a result of it, a great
    many of the powerful demonic beings had been actually cast down upon the planet Earth, with the consequence that
    their presence and their influence now impinge more than ever upon the prospects and the destiny of mankind.
  </p>
  <p><em>Steiner taught that the coming years will see incredible upheavals, in the course of which this great battle
    will be carried forward, to its conclusion, INSIDE EVERY HUMAN HEART.</em> See Rudolf Steiner: <em>Der Sturz der
    Geister der Finsternis: (The Overthrow of the Spirits of Darkness)</em>, Series of Lectures, 1917. (Available only
    in German.)
  </p>
  <p> The objective of the Forces of Darkness is to take over the stream of human evolution, to merge with it, and to
    divert mankind from the evolutionary development "planned" for it. The end result of this would be new creatures in
    which those qualities that represent the highest that we know would have been eliminated.
  </p>
  <p>Smart-alecky modern man of the Pop Age, the "Trousered Ape" as he has been called, has of course no use for all
    this sort of "rubbish", and immense numbers of our species have discarded all belief in the existence of demons,
    along with any belief in the Great Power that rules the Universe.
  </p>
  <p>(Sophisticated folk nowadays know that the world was not created by God, but by Karl Marx. And they know that Lenin
    and successors are His prophets.)
  </p>
  <p> There is a delightful passage in C.S. Lewis's <em>Screwtape Letters</em>, where the Senior Devil, talking to one
    of his underlings, makes a profoundly important remark: <em>"of course, our greatest trump-card is the fact that
      everybody KNOWS we don't exist."</em> (Or words to that effect.)
  </p>
  <p> Similarly, the vast majority of mankind KNOW that <em>Jinns</em> and UFOs and UFO entities don't exist. And what a
    nice advantage that is for the entities!
  </p>
  <p> But what if <em>Homo Sap</em> (so-called, self-dubbed) were in for some big shocks in the near future? What then?
  </p>
  <p>With the recent advance of Science, man has rapidly become aware of the vastness of the Cosmos and of the
    probability that there exist out there innumerable other physical worlds inhabited by intelligent beings, some of
    which, for all we know, may be (as we dearly hope) identical with men, with our tastes and our values, our hopes and
    our fears.
  </p>
  <p>It is natural that some among us, surveying the impasse into which we have got ourselves, might well be tempted to
    look up to the stars in the hope that someone wiser than we are might arrive one day from there and give us all the
    easy answers.
  </p>
  <p>If there be any truth in the ancient story that the inhabitants of Magonia, unlike men, do not possess the
    possibility of developing immortal souls, and therefore are anxious to acquire such by mating with us and mingling
    their life-stream with ours, what moment could be more propitious to them for achieving their purpose than now?
  </p>
  <p> Can't you just hear the message of their Captain?</p>
  <p> - <em>"We are from Tau Ceti, and we come to bring you salvation and show you the way out of your problems. We will
    get you off the hook!"</em></p>
