<p>I chose the 2 preceding examples partly because Zusne, Jones, and Diaconis are widely regarded as being among the
  more moderate critics of <a href="/science/para/psi/index.html">parapsychology</a>. The uncritical attitude exhibited
  in these examples is extremely widespread among those who call themselves skeptics in this area. Thus, it seems to me
  that <em><a
    href="/science/methode/scepticisme">skeptic</a></em> is an appropriate label for this group. I agree with Paul Kurtz
  <span class="source">1984</span> that the term <em>skeptic </em>should not be restricted to those who, like <span
    class="people">Paul Feyerabend</span>, contend that the <a href="/science/methode/index.html">scientific method</a>
  cannot lead to even approximate truth. But I hope he would agree with me that to go to the other extreme and suggest
  that a skeptical person need only be skeptical about hypotheses he or she dislikes for some a priori reason is equally
  indefensible. Though I cannot stop these people from applying this label to themselves, I do not have to join them in
  what I consider to be a misleading use of language. <span class="people">Marcello Truzzi</span> (in press) has also
  criticized the inappropriate use of the term skeptic on grounds similar to my own.

<p>As a nonpejorative substitute for <em>skeptic</em>, I propose the term <em>conventional theorist</em> (or CT, for
  short). I choose this term because the one positive thing erstwhile skeptics seem to share is a commitment to the view
  that conventional scientific theory provides adequate explanations for OPEs. I hope that others will join me in using
  it, or at least be more circumspect in their use of the term skeptic.</p>
<p>I do not wish to leave the impression that all erstwhile skeptics are CTs. Some critics of <a
  href="/science/para/psi/index.html">parapsychology</a>, especially many of those who identify themselves with the
  field to some degree, are demonstrably capable of consistently adopting a critical attitude toward conventional
  explanations of OPEs while denying that the existence of psi has been established. For this group, the label <em>skeptic</em>
  remains appropriate. Unfortunately, they constitute a small minority.</p>
<p>I fear that some of you may find all this concern with labels a bit sophomoric, and I sympathize. The problem is
  that, regrettably, the psi controversy has a considerable rhetorical element to it that infects even its more
  intellectual levels. An important component of this rhetorical battle is the use of labels that have a positive
  valence for one's own group and labels that have a negative valence for the opposition. The term skeptic has positive
  valence in a scientific context because of its appeal to the important principle of critical doubt. Although the
  appropriate use of labels can have a beneficial effect on scientific discourse, their misuse can give an unfair
  advantage to the guilty side, particularly in communicating with outsiders. Thus I feel I have good reason to be
  concerned about CTs who call themselves skeptics and thereby mask their lack of a uniformly critical attitude.</p>
<p>The CT's lack of skepticism does not necessarily imply incompetence or generalized loose thinking. Ironically, this
  uncritical attitude has a basis in critical philosophy, and it is to these more abstract issues that I now wish to
  turn.</p>
