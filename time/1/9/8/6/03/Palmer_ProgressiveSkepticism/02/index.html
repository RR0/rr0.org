<p>The root of the problem, it seems to me, lies in the premise—ironically shared (at least implicitly) by both
  the CTs and many parapsychologists—that the burden of proof falls exclusively on the claimant and that the only
  claimants are the parapsychologists. The parapsychologist must prove that psi exists; the CT does not need to prove
  that psi does not exist.</p>

<p>On the surface this position seems plausible, for several reasons. It is difficult if not impossible to prove a
  negative proposition, especially in the case of OPEs where the potential domain of their occurrence is so vast that
  the poor CT would have to debunk every case that comes down the pike to prove the nonexistence of something just
  because someone suggests it as a possibility? We don't ask them to prove that fairies do not exist, so why psi?</p>
<p>There is another way to deal with the burden-of-proof question, however, and that is to propose that the question
  "Does psi exist?" is the wrong question, or at least a wrong phrasing of the question. It is certainly odd, if not
  downright inappropriate, to apply the verb<em> to exist</em> to a hypothetical construct such as psi, and this
  reification is implicit in the line of argument summarized in the preceding paragraph. But I think I can attack the
  traditional question most effectively by proposing and defending what I consider to be a better question.</p>
<p>Before I do that, however, I would like to digress a moment and direct a little fire at my own field of <a
    href="/science/para/psi">parapsychology</a>. It turns out that many of the formal definitions of our field are
  patently invalid. For instance, in Michael Thalbourne's glossary <span
      class="source">1984</span>, <a href="/science/para/psi">parapsychology</a> is defined as the <q>scientific study
    of paranormal phenomena</q> (p. 51). Taken literally, this definition implies that we have concluded that a given
  phenomenon is paranormal <em>before</em> studying it. In fact, in most cases the investigation is undertaken to
  determine if the phenomenon is in fact <a href="/science/para">paranormal</a>. Thus, the definition should read, "<a
      href="/science/para/psi">Parapsychology</a> is the scientific study of certain <em>ostensible</em> or <em>potential</em>
  paranormal phenomena."</p>
<p>I doubt that many parapsychologists would defend the traditional definition if the above point were brought to their
  attention. The problem is that this definitional inaccuracy has gone so long unnoticed. I think this unawareness is
  symptomatic of a deeper and more serious problem, the ramification of which I can only touch upon in this talk. The
  problem is that we make no clear distinction in <a href="/science/para/psi">parapsychology</a> between the phenomena
  under investigation and the principles proposed to account for them. We use the same terms (e.g., <em><a
      href="/science/para/psi">psi</a>, <a href="/science/para/psi/pes">ESP</a>, <a
      href="/science/para/psi/pk">PK</a></em>) for both.</p>

<p>We may also have confused some CTs owing to this use of language. Some of them seem to feel that it
    follows from the conclusion that psi (i.e. paranormality) has not been established that there is no subject matter
    in <a href="/science/para/psi">parapsychology</a>. But a moment's reflection can reveal that such an
    inference is incorrect. Surveys have shown that <em>ostensible</em> psychic events have been reported by over half
    the American population <span class="source">e.g. Palmer, 1979</span>. Parapsychologists have carefully documented
    thousands of these spontaneous cases. Moreover, hundreds of documented reports testify that such events occur in the
    controlled setting of the laboratory. Even if one exercises the behaviorist option and equates the phenomena
    themselves with the reports of the phenomena, those reports still constitute a subject matter, a database in need of
    explanation.</p>
    <p>By appreciating this point, one can see that the better alternative to the question "Does psi exist?" is "How can
      OPEs be best explained?" Although I cannot offer a neat deductive argument, I think it is our failure to
      appreciate the distinction between <a href="/science/para/psi">psi</a> as an anomaly (or a report or an
      anomaly) and <a href="/science/para/psi">psi</a> as a <a
          href="/science/para">paranormal</a> process that has prevented us from formulating our fundamental research
      question in this more constructive and scientifically typical manner.</p>
<p>The new question invites us to seek a real <em>understanding</em> of the subject matter in a way that the old
  question—"Does <a href="/science/para/psi">psi</a> exist?"—simply does not. However, its most important
  implication for present purposes is that it places the burden of proof on <em>anyone</em> who proposes to explain the
  anomalous reports. Strictly speaking, it is improper to speak of just one explanation, as inevitably no single
  explanation will account for the entire database. The range of possible explanations varies from pure fabrication at
  one extreme to some paranormally mediated process at the other. The point is that any of these explanations must be
  backed up by sound empirical evidence if it is to be considered acceptable. The situation is no different that it is
  for any other topic in <a
    href="/science/discipline/social/psycho">psychology</a>, and all the problems we have in <a
    href="/science/discipline/social/psycho">psychology</a> about how to define good evidence, how far we can generalize
  research findings, and so forth, tag along the same ride.</p>
