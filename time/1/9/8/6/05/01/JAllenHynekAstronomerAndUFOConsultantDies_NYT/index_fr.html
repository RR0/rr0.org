<p><span class="people">J. Allen Hynek</span>, astrophysicien et consultant pour un projet de l'Air Force visant à
  évaluer les objets volants non-identifiés, est mort d'une tumeur maligne au cerveau dimanche au Memorial Hospital de
  <span class="place">Scottsdale (Arizona)</span>. Il avait 75 ans.</p>
<p>Le Dr. <span class="people">Hynek</span>, qui avait déménagé de Scottsdale à <span
  class="place">Evanston (Illinois)</span> il y a 1 an de cela, a été durant 18 ans professeur et président du
  Département d'Astronomie de l'Université Northwestern et directeur de son Observatoire Dearborn, jusqu'à sa retraite
  en <time>1978</time>. Il fut impliqué dans l'effort de recherche sur les ovnis de l'Air Force de
  <time>1948/1969</time>.</p>
<p>Often his task for the Air Force was to examine at first hand more substantial reports of flying saucers and the
  like. In <time>1966</time>, after a rash of sightings in Michigan, he went to the area to take charge of the
  investigation. After interviewing scores of people, he ascribed certain sightings to luminous marsh gas rather that
  something from space. Nevertheless, he said, <q>Scientists in the year 2066 may think us very naive in our denials</q>.
</p>
<p>He long asserted that U.F.O.'s should be taken seriously and he eventually became displeased with the Air Force
  approach. He said that its methods were slipshod and that it was not conducting a scientific study. The Air Force, in
  turn, concluded that there was no evidence of extraterrestial craft and the U.F.O. project was abandoned. He Avoids
  'UF.O. Nut' Label</p>
<p>In an interview in <time>1974</time>, Dr. Hynek said that he had remained with the program as long as he did to
  retain access to Air Force data and to avoid being marked a <q>U.F.O. nut</q>.</p>
<p>Dr. Hynek founded the <a href="/org/us/asso/cufos">Center for U.F.O. Studies</a> in Evanston in <time>1973</time> and
  took it with him when he moved to Scottsdale.</p>
<p>He is credited with coining the phrase <q><a href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/classification/hynek/rr/3">close
  encounters of the third kind</a></q> to describe humans meeting creatures from space. He used the phrase in his <time>1972</time>
  book <i>The U.F.O. Experience</i> and it became the title of the <time>1977</time> <span class="people">Steven Spielberg</span>
  film, on which he served as technical adviser.</p>
<p>When a reporter once suggested that Dr. <span class="people">Hynek</span> might be remembered not as an astronomer
  but as the man who made U.F.O.'s respectable, he replied: <q>I wouldn't mind. If I can succeed in making the study of
    U.F.O.'s scientifically respectable and do something constructive in it, then I think that would be a real
    contribution</q>.</p>
<p>He resigned from the center he founded a few months ago for ill health, according to the director, Tina Choate. He
  Worked on Proximity Fuse</p>
<p>In World War II, Dr. <span class="people">Hynek</span> was a civilian scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Science
  Laboratory, where he helped to develop the Navy's radio proximity fuze.</p>
<p><span class="people">Josef Allen Hynek</span> was born in Chicago, Ill., to Czechoslovak parents. He graduated from
  the University of Chicago in <time>1931</time> and earned a Ph.D degree there in <time>1935</time>.</p>
<p>He joined the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Ohio State in <time>1936</time>. After the war he returned
  there, rising to full professor in <time>1950</time>.</p>
<p>In <time>1956</time> he left to join Prof. Fred Whipple, the Harvard astronomer, at the Smithsonian Astrophysical
  Observatory, which had combined with the Harvard Observatory at Harvard. Dr. <span class="place">Hynek</span> had the
  assignment of directing the tracking of an American space <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/Satellites.html">satellite</a>, a project for the International
  Geophysical Year in <time>1956</time> and thereafter.</p>
<p>In addition to 247 optical stations around the world, there were to be 12 photographic stations. A special camera was
  devised for the task and a prototype was built and tested and then stripped apart again when, on
  <time>1957-10-04</time>, the Soviet Union launched its first satellite, Sputnik. Assumed the U.S Would Be First</p>
<p><q>We had always assumed that the United States would have the first <a
  href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/Satellites.html">satellite</a></q>, Dr. <span class="place">Hynek</span>
  said ruefully at the time. <q>If I've ever had a traumatic experience, that was it</q>.</p>
<p>Observations of the Soviet satellite were received, and with twice-daily news conferences, Dr. <span class="place">Hynek</span>
  and Dr. Whipple began to reassure the public after what Dr. Hynek called <q>this intellectual Pearl Harbor, a real
    gutsy sock to the stomach</q>.</p>
<p>Once things in satellite tracking settled down to a routine, Dr. <span class="place">Hynek</span> went back to
  teaching, taking the chairmanship at Northwestern in <span class="place">1960</span>.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, the former Miriam Curtis; four sons and a daughter, Scott Josef, of Waltham, Mass.; Joel
  Curtis, of Leonia, N.J., Paul Curtis, of Scottsdale, Ross Allen, of Lake Forest, Ill., Roxane, of Hanover, Mass.; and
  five grandchildren.</p>
