  This is the complete report on <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/JAL1628">the UFO sighting by the Japanese
  crew of a jumbo freighter aircraft</a> in <time>1986-11</time>. This sighting gained international attention when the
  <a href="/org/us/faa/index.html">FAA</a> announced that it was going to officially investigate this sighting because
  the Air
  Route Traffic Control Center in <span class="place">Anchorage, Alaska</span>, had reported that the UFO had been
  detected on radar. Captain Terauchi was featured on numerous radio and TV programs and in People Magazine. Within a
  few months of these events he was grounded, apparently for his indiscretion of reporting a UFO, even though he was a
  senior captain with an excellent flying record. Several years later he was reinstated. What you are about to read is
  the most complete and analytical investigation of this sighting ever published. (Numbers in parentheses refer to
  footnotes at the end of the paper.)

<p> When the FAA announced that it was going to investigate, the airplane captain, Kenju Terauchi became a media star.
  He was featured on numerous radio and TV programs and in People Magazine. Unfortunately his career suffered for his
  indescretion of reporting a UFO. Within a few months of these events he was grounded, even though he was a senior
  captain with an excellent flying record. Several years later he was reinstated.

  What you are about to read is the most complete and analytical investigation of this sighting ever published. (This
  was originally published in the International UFO Reporter, March/April, 1987, published by the Center for UFO
  Studies. This report took up the whole issue of the IUR.)
</p>
<p>In mid-<time>1986-10</time>, Capt. Kenju Terauchi was excited to learn of a special Japan Airlines flight from Paris
  to Anchorage and then to Tokyo. It was to carry a cargo of French wine. There would be an intermediate stop at
  Reykjavik, Iceland.
</p>
<p>The flight began on <time>1986-11-16</time>, with himself and a crew of two (copilot, flight engineer) in the
  cockpit. The plane landed in <span class="place">Iceland</span> and waited for good weather. The next day the plane
  took off heading north northwest. A bright moon helped with the visibility for the night flight over
  <span class="place">Greenland</span>, but as the plane continued over northern Canada the moon set behind them. When
  the plane reached an air route reporting point in far northwestern Canada called "Shingle Point" the sky ahead was
  dark except for an afterglow of sun in the west. The plane reported its position to the flight control center at
  <span class="place">Edmonton, Alberta</span>, and continued across the Canada-Alaska border, where it made history.
  UFO history, that is.
</p>
<p>Although this wasn't a routine flight, it wasn't supposed to be a newsworthy event. But something happened over
  Alaska which caught the attention of the world for several days in late <time>1986-12</time> and early
  <time>1987-01</time>. Virtually every newspaper in the world carried a story about what Capt. Terauchi and his crew
  saw over Alaska. This is the story of that sighting as told to the <a href="/org/us/faa/index.html">FAA</a> by the
  crew
  members and the flight controllers on the ground.
