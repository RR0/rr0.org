<p>It was about 11 minutes past 5 local time, the late afternoon of November 17, while JAL1628 (the designation for this
  particular flight) was high over the frozen northeastern part of Alaska that Capt. Terauchi first realized that he had
  company: there were lights of some crafts to the left and below. After watching them for a short time he decided they
  were the lights of <q>special missioned aircrafts or two fighters</q> on some mission. (Note: Alaska air space, being
  close to the then Soviet Union, was patrolled by USAF jets.) He decided to ignore them. But <q>the position of the
    lights had not changed even after a few minutes and that called our attention.</q> In other words, the lights
  appeared to be traveling along with his plane <span class="source">Interview of Capt. Kenjyu Terauchi, <time>1987-01-02</time>. During the interview Capt. Terauchi reported two
    previous UFO sightings. About five years before the present sighting he saw a "mothership" shortly after taking off
    from Taipai, south of Formosa, but it was <q>so weird I ignored it</q>. Then he saw, from his home during the
    daytime, bright lights that continued for about <time>P10M</time>. Although this was not Terauchi's first UFO, it
    was the first sighting of unidentified phenomena by the other two crew members. In <time>1987-01</time> Capt.
    Terauchi had another sighting of a strange phenomenon which he reported. He subsequently offered a satisfactory
    explanation for it. (From the FAA file on the JAL sighting)</span> <span class="source">Written (in Japanese, with translation) testimony of Capt. Kenjyu Terauchi as received by the FAA on <time>1987-01-02</time>.
    A comparison of the transcript of the conversation with the air traffic controller (ref. 4 below) with Terauchi's
    testimony shows that, a month and a half after the sighting, he recalled the individual events quite but not
    perfectly accurately and that he confused the order of some of the events. The order of events in Terauchi's
    testimony has been modified somewhat in this presentation to place them in the order that is found on the AARTCC
    audio tape.</span>.

<p>At that time the Boeing 747 freighter was operating on autopilot and heading southwestward (a heading of about 215
  degrees) at an altitude of

  The sky to the right had an afterglow of sunset, but ahead and to the left it was very dark.

<p>The <abbr title="Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center">AARTCC</abbr> had called the plane just about
  <time>P2M</time> before this time, i.e., at 5:09:20 <span class="source">Information obtained from the tape recording and transcript of the tape recording of conversations between the

    Anchorage at 5:05 PM. He correctly recalled that the plane was asked to fly directly to Talkeetna and then take air
    route J-125 to Anchorage.</span> (or 20 sec. past 5:09 PM; exact times are based on the AARTCC tape recorded record
  of the events) to report the initial radar contact with the plane, which at that time was about <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">90</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">nautical miles</span></span> northeast of Fort Yukon (Referring to a
  map, the plane at this time was at the "upper right hand corner" of Alaska.) The flight controller had asked the plane
  to head directly toward an air route reporting point called Talkeetna, named after the small Alaska town nearby (north
  of Anchorage and not far from Mt. McKinley) <span class="source">Information obtained from the tape recording and transcript of the tape recording of conversations between the

  handled the aircraft communications, acknowledged the AARTCC request and then turned the plane to the left (<q>left
    rotation</q>) about 15 degrees to a heading of 215 degrees. It was during this turn that Capt. Terauchi, sitting on
  the left side of the cockpit, first saw the unidentifiable lights out his side window <span class="source">Written (in Japanese, with translation) testimony of Capt. Kenjyu Terauchi as received by the FAA on <time>1987-01-02</time>..</span>.

<p>After the plane levelled out he observed <q>lights that looked like aircraft lights, 30 degrees left front, <span
    itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">2000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">feet</span></span> below us, moving exactly in the same direction and
  with the same speed we were</q>. At that time the airplane was flying at about <span itemscope
    itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">525</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="KTS">knots</span></span> ground speed according to the tracking data
  <span class="source">Flight path as constructed from the radar data package supplied by the FAA.</span>. Subsequently
  the speed decreased to about <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">500</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="KTS">knots</span></span>.
</p>
<p>It is important to note the pilot's statement of his belief that the lights were <span itemscope
    itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">2000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">feet</span></span> below him. He could not know how far below the
  lights were just from his visual sighting. (To determine the distance below he would have to know the exact depression
  angle and the distance to the lights.) Nevertheless, his statement indicates that his sighting line to the lights had
  a noticeable depression angle (the angle below horizontal). At <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">35000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">feet</span></span> the horizon distance is about <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">214</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">nautical miles</span></span> so the depression angle of the horizon is
  about 1.5 degrees which is hardly noticeable. The pilot's statement therefore implies that the lights were below,
  probably considerably below, his horizon, i.e., between himself and the ground, thus ruling out any astronomical
  source for the lights <span class="note"><a href="/org/us/asso/csicop">CSICOP</a> published its initial "solution" of the sighting as Jupiter and Mars. This will
  be described later</span>.
</p>
<p>The captain's initial reaction to the lights was to ignore them as US air fighters, probably military aircraft from
  one of the nearby Air Force Bases (Eielson or Elmendorf). But the position of the lights <q>had not changed even after
    a few minutes and that called our attention</q> <span class="source">Written (in Japanese, with translation) testimony of Capt. Kenjyu Terauchi as received by the FAA on <time>1987-01-02</time>.
    A comparison of the transcript of the conversation with the air traffic controller (ref. 4 below) with Terauchi's
    testimony shows that, a month and a half after the sighting, he recalled the individual events quite but not
    perfectly accurately and that he confused the order of some of the events. The order of events in Terauchi's
    testimony has been modified somewhat in this presentation to place them in the order that is found on the AARTCC
    audio tape.</span>. The lights of these two "aircraft" stayed at the left for a while and then the unbelievable
  happened <span class="note">The order of events as presented here follows the order in the AARTCC tape [ref. 11]. The order of events in the
    captain's testimony is somewhat different. It appears that he accurately recalled most of the events which make up
    the total sighting, but he did not always present them in the proper order. His presentation seems to jump forward
    and back in time occasionally. The order of events as presented here seems, to this author, to be the most
    consistent with the testimony of the copilot and the flight engineer and the ARTCC tape. It should be noted that the
    lights were first seen by the captain in a location to the left and below the plane where neither the copilot nor
    the flight engineer would be likely to look. Whether or not the captain mentioned them at that time is not known.
    But all three witnesses recalled seeing the lights remaining in front and somewhat to the left of the aircraft for a
    number of minutes and then seeing the light return to the left side as far back as the 9 o'clock position. After the
    lights dropped back farther than that, only the pilot was easily able to see them because of his position on the
    left side of the cockpit. Thus the total event consisted of a single witness sighting at the beginning, a multiple
    witness sighting in the middle and a single witness sighting at the end.</span>.
