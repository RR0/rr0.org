<p>Shortly after the copilot told the AARTCC, at 5:23:05, that the clouds were "below us", he reported a new and sudden
  event:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="answer">5:23:13 JAL1628 - And now the target, ah, traffic is extinguished. We cannot see it now.</p>
  <p class="question">5:23:19 AARTCC - JAL1628 Roger. And I'm not receiving any radar replies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was probably at this time that the "two ships" which had been quite close to the plane since 5:18 or 5:19 PM
  suddenly moved farther away and to the left. Looking to the left the captain could now see that <q>there was a pale
    white flat light in the direction where the ships flew away, moving in a line along with us, in the same direction
    and same speed and at the same altitude as we were</q> <span class="source">Written (in Japanese, with translation) testimony of Capt. Kenjyu Terauchi as received by the FAA on <time>1987-01-02</time>.
    </span>.
</p>
<p>About this time the AARTCC controller decided to find out if the Air Force at Elmendorf Regional Operational Control
  Center had anything on its radar.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="question">5:23:35 AARTCC - (to the ROCC) Could you look approximately
    <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">40</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> south of Fort Yukon? There should be [JAL1628] up
    there. Can you tell me [if] you see [a] primary target and its position?
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took the ROCC operator about <time>P2M</time> to answer the question. In the meantime significant events occurred
  aboard the plane and at the AARTCC. It was now about <time>P14M30S</time> since Capt. Terauchi had first seen the
  lights traveling along with his plane, about <time>P6M/7M</time> since the lights had appeared abruptly in front of
  the plane, and only <time>P1M</time> or so since the "ships" quickly moved away from the jet, apparently in the
  direction of the <q>flat pale white light</q> <span class="source">Written (in Japanese, with translation) testimony of Capt. Kenjyu Terauchi as received by the FAA on <time>1987-01-02</time>.
   </span> which the captain later described as like <q>two white fluorescent-like lights</q> <span class="source">Personal statement by Carl Henley of the AARTCC, released by the FAA office on December 29, 1986.</span>.
  A drawing made several hours later indicates that the lights were horizontally oriented and spaced apart, like two
  long fluorescent tubes end-to-end with a large dark gap in between them. (See Figure 5a. Figure 5b is the captain’s
  map to illustrate the location of the airplane along its flight track in Alaska when the “traffic” first appeared at
  the left - 1, when the traffic appeared in front of the airplane - 2 and when the traffic departed and the two white
  lights appeared at the left - 3. The illustrations in Figure 5 were drawn several hours after the sighting.)

</figure>
<p>At this time in the flight he could only see the two white lights. He was not sure whether the two "ships" had become
  pale white lights after they moved away from the jet or if the white lights were something entirely different. (He
  reported that later in the flight that he could see the outline of a large shape connecting the lights. After seeing
  the outline the captain had the impression that the distant lights were on a very large "mothership" and that the two
  small "ships" had traveled to the "mothership" <span class="source">Interview of Capt. Kenjyu Terauchi, <time>1987-01-02</time>.</span>.)
  It was difficult for the other crew members to see the pale lights through the left window and they didn't try to
  describe any particular orientation or shape to the lights. They did, however, agree that there were some lights at
  the left where the pilot indicated.
</p>
<p> Up to this time the AARTCC had not acknowledged the detection of any anomalous target on the ground radar. Terauchi
  recalled his feelings at the time: <q>We had [earlier] said we could see lights in the 10 o'clock position (i.e.,
    about 60 degrees to the left) at the same altitude and wondered if they could see anything on their radar. The
    Anchorage Center replied that they could see nothing on their radar</q>. (See the response from the AARTCC at
  5:23:19.) Copilot Tamefuji recalled that, even though the lights were now farther away, the captain decided to <q>search
    the object by the [airplane's] radar</q> <span class="source">Information found in the <time>1987-01-05</time> interview of Copilot Takanori Tamefuji. The difficulty in
    communicating through an interpreter is evident in the transcript of this interview. At one point the interviewer
    asked Tamefuji, referring to the arrays of lights ahead and to the left, <q>And you could distinguish these lights
      as being different from the star...?</q> Tamefuji's response is transcribed as <q>NNNooo...</q>, which some might
    interpret as meaning that Tamefuji couldn't distinguish the lights from stars. But the interviewer immediately
    continued <q>...from the stars?</q> to which Tamefuji replied, "Different is fine." Subsequently Tamefuji made it
    quite clear that the lights were very different from stars.</span>.
</p>
<p>Terauchi wrote <span class="source">Written (in Japanese, with translation) testimony of Capt. Kenjyu Terauchi as received by the FAA on <time>1987-01-02</time>.
    </span>, <q>I thought it would be impossible to find anything on an aircraft radar if a large ground radar did not
  show anything, but I judged the distance of the object visually and it was not very far. I set the digital weather
  radar distance to <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">20</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">(nautical) miles</span></span>, radar angle to horizon (i.e., no
  depression angle). There it was on the screen. A large green and round object (here he refers to the image or "blip"
  on the radar screen) had appeared at <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span
      itemprop="value">7</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> or <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">8</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> away, where the direction of the object was. We
  reported to Anchorage center that our radar caught the object within <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">7</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> or <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">8</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> in the 10 o'clock position. We asked them if they
  could catch it on ground radar but it did not seem they could catch it at all</q> [21]. During the January interview
  Terauchi recalled that the radar detection occurred about <time>P15M</time> after he first saw the lights, i.e., at
  about 5:25 PM. He was only slightly in error.

<blockquote>
  <p class="question">5:24:50 AARTCC - JAL1628, do you still have, uh, visual contact with the, ah, traffic?</p>
  <p class="answer">5:24:53 JAL1628 - Affirmative. Also, <span class="source">Information obtained from the tape recording and transcript of the tape recording of conversations between the

          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="SMI">miles</span></span>, ah, same level. Over.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A month and a half later the captain did not remembered the direction accurately (see above; he recalled the 10
  o'clock position) but he had recalled the distance correctly. Flight engineer Tsukuba recalled seeing on the radar
  screen at <q>about <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">10</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="SMI">miles</span></span></q> a <q>green dot like, not exactly a dot. It was
    not a dot but stream like</q>, i.e., elongated. He did <q>not think it (the radar target) was the same lights as the
    one (sic) I saw in front of us</q>. Here the flight engineer is referring to the visual difference between the two
  bright "ships" which had been nearly in front of the jet and the pale whitish light of the "mothership." Tsukjuba
  described this "second" light as <q>very difficult to see</q> and <q>vague</q>, although he did indicate that he saw
  it for <q>a total of <time>P30M</time></q>.
</p>
<p>According to Tsukuba (and also the pilot and copilot) there was no problem with internal cockpit lights reflecting
  off the windows since the internal lights had all been turned off (except the dim instrument lights). Tsukuba was sure
  that the "mothership" light was indeed outside the aircraft, but it was sufficiently indistinct and <q>hard to see</q>
  from his seat on the right side of the jet that he was <q>not certain whether it was lights of a distant town or a
    strange object</q> <span class="source">Information found in the <time>1987-01-15</time> interview of the flight engineer, Yoshio Tsukuba.</span>.
  He reported that the weather was clear and that none of his instruments showed any disturbances. Copilot Tamefuji
  recalled that the radar echo was <q>just like other traffic, but, ah, I thought a little bit large</q>. He said the
  radar target image was green and at a distance of <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">7</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles (nautical)</span></span> to <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">8</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles (nautical)</span></span>. He said he had <q>many experiences
    before in checking oncoming aircrafts on a radar</q> and in his opinion the radar echo was similar to a conventional
  aircraft echo.

</figure>
<p>Several hours after the sighting the captain, who had the best view of the radar screen, drew a picture of the radar
  image <span class="source">Notes made by Special Agents Jack Wright, James Derry and Ronald Mickle after the crew was interviewed just after
    the plane landed at Anchorage on November 17.</span>. His illustration, Figure 6, shows a filled circle or "dot" at
  the center of a thick arc that covered ten or so degrees of arc [see illustration]. The image was roughly the 60
  degree to the left of straight ahead. (The radar screen was marked with circles at varying distance, <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">5</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span>, <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">10</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span>, <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">15</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span>, etc., and the image of the unknown was an arc
  lying between the <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">5</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> and <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">10</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> circles.) In commenting on the radar image the
  captain pointed out that <q>normally it appears in red when an aircraft radar catches another aircraft</q> whereas
  green is usually the color of a weak weather target such as a cloud. The fact that the echo was green on the screen
  led him to ask whether or not the <q>metal used in the spaceship is different from ours</q> <span class="source">Written (in Japanese, with translation) testimony of Capt. Kenjyu Terauchi as received by the FAA on <time>1987-01-02</time>.
    </span>. One might also speculate on the use of radar signature reduction techniques generally classified as
  "stealth." At any rate, the shape, size and color of the radar target indicated that the object was quite large and
  yet quite a weak reflector.
</p>
<p>The radar target remained on the screen for an undetermined length of time, but probably for no more than several
  minutes. <q>While we were communicating with Anchorage Center</q>, the captain said, <q>the two pale white lights
    gradually moved to the left side and to the left diagonally back 30 degrees as if they understood our conversation
    and then when they were beside our aircraft (i.e., at about the 9 o'clock position or 90 degrees to the left) they
    totally disappeared from our radar.</q> This is not surprising since the weather radar as it scans back and forth
  does not cover an arc greater than 90 degrees to the left or right. While the "mother ship" lights were dropping back
  to the left and the radar echo was going off the screen of the airplane radar, the Air Force and the AARTCC were
  having their own radar detections. At 5:25:45, after spending two minutes looking, the ROCC radar controller reported
  back to the AARTCC that he was getting some "surge primary return." By this he meant an occasional radar echo
  unaccompanied by a transponder signal.
</p>
<p>(It is important to understand the difference between "primary return" and a transponder return. On the radar screen
  each appears as a small dot or "blip" and if a plane with a transponder is present the two blips appear together (if
  one is not masked out). Primary radar, which is the standard echo-based radar, is the only way of detecting a distant
  aircraft that has no transponder. It is what one would expect to use to detect "non-cooperative" objects which don't
  have transponder, such as UFOs! A transponder is a transmitter on an airplane which sends out a coded signal in
  response to a radar pulse from the ground station. All commercial planes carry transponders as the main means of
  detection by the ground controllers. The transponder can carry more information than just the echo, such as the plane
  designation and its altitude. In this case the JAL1628 carried a transponder. Therefore the radar operator would
  expect to see two adjacent blips each time the radar beam, in its continuous rotatory sweep mode, would sweep past the
  airplane. Any primary return without a transponder return would be evidence of a radar reflective object without a
  transponder. The difference between primary radar and transponder signals played a roll in the FAA "explanation" of
  the radar detections described below.)
</p>
<p>The ROCC controller added, <q>I don't know if it's erroneous or whatever, but...</q> The AARTCC responded:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="question">17:25:50 AARTCC - Negative, its not erroneous. I want you to keep a good track on there and if you
    pick up a [transponder signal], verify that you do not have any [military] aircraft operating in that area.
  </p>
  <p class="answer">17:25:57 ROCC - That is affirm(ative). We do not have anybody up there right now. Can you give me
    the position of the primary you're receiving?
  </p>
  <p class="question">17:26:03 AARTCC - I'm picking up a primary approximately <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">50</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> southeast. But it's right in front of the
    (JAL1628) <span class="source">Information obtained from the tape recording and transcript of the tape recording of conversations between the
    plane and the AARTCC.</span>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately the AARTCC controller did not say what the primary return was southeast of (I know; don't end a
  sentence with a preposition!). He may have meant something southeast of Ft. Yukon, since it was displayed as a
  location on his radar screen. At this time the plane was roughly <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">60</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> south southwest, relative to geographic north, of
  Ft. Yukon. But with respect to magnetic north (which is used on air route maps), the plane was southeast of Ft. Yukon.
  (The reason for this difference in direction is that in that area of Alaska magnetic north has a deviation of about 30
  degrees clockwise from true geographic north.)
</p>
<p>The conversation continued as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="answer">17:26:13 ROCC - OK. I've got him about....</p>
  <p class="question">17:26:15 AARTCC - <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span
      itemprop="value">8</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> in front of the (JAL1628) he's got traffic at the
    same altitude (<span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">35000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">feet</span></span>).
  </p>
  <p class="answer">17:26:18 ROCC - OK. I've got him about his, ah, oh, it looks like about, ah, 10 o'clock at about
    that range, yes.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The clear implication of the last ROCC comment is that the Elmendorf radar showed a primary return - an object
  without a transponder - in about the same location as the captain reported! (Keep this in mind as you read the FAA
  "explanation" presented farther on in this paper.) The AARTCC then asked the ROCC to check on any military flights in
  the area around the plane and ended the conversation at 5:26:35.
</p>
<p>About a minute later AARTCC called ROCC to report that the <q>target in front of the (JAL1628) is unknown to us</q>
  <span class="source">Information obtained from the tape recording and transcript of the tape recording of conversations between the
    plane and the AARTCC.</span>. ROCC reponded (5:27:53), <q>OK. We've lost contact with it now</q>. The AARTCC
  controller then went on to say, <q>OK. We're not working that aircraft (meaning the unknown target) in the...
    (unintelligible) ..well, the aircraft (JAL1628) still has a visual contact, only he can't identify the [unknown]
    aircraft. He believes it has white and yellow strobes.</q> To this the ROCC controller responded (5:28:04), <q>OK.
    I'm still not, I, we lost contact on him. I don't see him at all.</q> In other words, there was no longer an unknown
  primary return on the ROCC radar display.
</p>
<p>During this conversation the flight was continuing along a straight line heading of 215 degrees (southwestward)
  toward Talkeetna. The unusual lights were at the left side. The captain recalled, <q>When they were in front of us
    they were positioned slightly higher in altitude than we were, but now they placed themselves slightly below the
    horizon where it was difficult to see. The distance between us was still about seven to eight miles visually.</q>
  The airplane radar no longer showed a radar echo since the lights were too far to the left <span class="source">Notes made by Special Agents Jack Wright, James Derry and Ronald Mickle after the crew was interviewed just after
    the plane landed at Anchorage on November 17.</span>.
</p>
<p>Many minutes earlier, when the sighting began (about 5:10 PM), Ft. Yukon was at the right of the plane. The captain
  recalled the lighting conditions of the sky at the time: <q>When we started to see Ft. Yukon diagonally below us at
    the right the sun was setting down in the Southwest, painting the sky in a slightly red stripe, approximately two to
    three millimeters (at arms length?) and gave a bit of light but the east was still pitch dark.</q> A calculation of
  the angular elevation and azimuth of the sun shows that at the time of the intial sighting the sun was about 15
  degrees below the horizon, from ground level, and was at an azimuth of about 270 degrees, or due west. This would
  place it below the horizon and 55 degrees to the right of straight ahead of the plane. Thus the astronomical
  calculation shows that the captain was incorrect in referring to the sunset direction as "southwest" although he
  wasn't far off. The calculation is consistent with the claim of the captain and crew that the sun had set and that
  there was a thin reddish stripe of sky just at the horizon to the right of straight ahead.
</p>
<p>Under these conditions the sky to the left of the plane would have been very dark and stars would have been visible.
  The nearly full moon which had lighted the sky while the plane was over Greenland was now behind the plane at an
  azimuth of about 50 degrees and an elevation of about 10 degrees. Two planets were visible above the horizon in the
  southeast: Jupiter at an azimuth of about 140 degrees and an elevation of somewhat more than 11 degrees and Mars at
  about the same azimuth but only several degrees above the horizon. Jupiter was quite bright and Mars was much dimmer.
  Jupiter and Mars were 70 degrees to the left of straight ahead as the plane flew southwestward.
</p>
<p>By the time the "small ships" had moved away from the aircraft and the ROCC had detected some "surge primary return"
  near the jet, the sun was several more degrees below the horizon, the sky in the southeast was darker and the plane
  was well south of Ft. Yukon. The captain picks up the narrative: <q>Far in front of us there were lights increasing
    from the U.S. Military Eielson AFB and Fairbanks</q>. Each was about <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">40</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> away at this time. <q>The lights were still
    following us at exactly the same distance. However, it was too dark to identify by only the lights whether or not
    they were the same spaceships that were flying in front of us a few minutes ago. It seemed that we were flying on
    the lighter side and gave them the advantage of being on the dark side.</q>
</p>
<p>That is, from the viewpoint of the supposed "mothership" the airplane was silhouetted against the light western sky,
  but the crew of the jet couldn't see the outline of the "mothership" because it was silhouetted against the dark sky
  in the southeast. The captain was able to see only the faint lights from the "mothership."
</p>
<p>As the plane approached Eielson and Fairbanks the captain saw: <q>two very bright lights</q> appear <q>suddenly from
  the north ... perhaps four or five mountains away</q>. He speculated at the time what these might be. He couldn't
  identify all the normal ground lights because the <q>flight above Alaska territory is generally in daytime and it is
    confusing to identify the kind of lights</q> on the ground. He finally decided that the lights were along the Alaska
  pipe line.
</p>
<p>Continuing his narrative, Capt. Terauchi recalled, <q>We arrived at the sky above Eielson AFB and Fairbanks.</q>
  (Actually, at this time, about 5:30 PM, the plane was about <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">20</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> northeast of Eielson and about <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">30</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> east-northeast of Fairbanks.) <q>The lights (of
    the city) were extremely bright to eyes that were used to the dark</q>. (The cockpit lights had been turned off to
  eliminate window reflections of internal lights.) <q>We were just above the bright city lights and we checked the pale
    white light behind us. Alas! There was a silhouette of a gigantic spaceship. We must run away quickly! <q>Anchorage
      Center. The JAL1628 is requesting a change of course to right 45 degrees.</q> It felt like a long time before we
    received permission</q> <span class="source">Written (in Japanese, with translation) testimony of Capt. Kenjyu Terauchi as received by the FAA on <time>1987-01-02</time>.
    </span>. Actually it took only <time>P15S</time> to get permission, as the transcript of the AARTCC tape recording
  shows. But it did take longer to actually begin the turn.

<p>The radar tracking data show that by asking for a magnetic heading of 240 degrees Tamefuji was requesting a 60 degree
  turn to the right. At 5:31:08, about 50 seconds after Tamefuji called for permission to turn, the plane began to turn
  from its magnetic heading of 182(+/-1) degrees (about 215 degrees with respect to geographic north). By 5:32:08 the
  plane had settled on its new heading of 222 degrees magnetic (255 true), a turn of 40 degrees, which is close to the
  45 degrees which the captain recalled, but less than the 60 degrees requested by Tamefuji.
</p>
<p>The captain's narrative continues after the right turn: <q>We checked our rear [and] there was still the ship
  following us. 'This JAL1628. Again requesting for change course 45 degrees to the right.' We had to get away from that
  object. 'JAL1628. This is Anchorage Center. We advise you, continue and take 360 degree turn.' 'Jal1628, thank you. We
  will continue 360 degree turn</q> <span class="source">Written (in Japanese, with translation) testimony of Capt. Kenjyu Terauchi as received by the FAA on <time>1987-01-02</time>.
    </span>.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately the captain was not totally accurate in his recall of these apparently frightening events. The AARTCC
  transcript shows that there was no request for a second right turn. There was, however, a request for a descent in
  altitude from <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">35000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span></span> to <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">31000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span></span> at 5:32:07 followed by a request to turn to a heading
  of "two one zero," i.e. about a 12 degree turn to the left, at 5:34:56. Later on, at 5:36:37 the AARTCC controller
  asked the plane to make a 360 degree right turn. But all of this is getting ahead of the story.
</p>
<p>So, what was it that the captain saw that caused this "flight response?" What did he mean by the <q>silhouette of a
  gigantic spaceship?</q> The term silhouette is applied to a situation in which the observer sees the outline of a
  relatively dark object against a brighter background, or vice versa. The location of the plane just before the turn
  was northeast of Eielson and roughly east of Fairbanks. East of Eielson there are no cities, just mountains. Looking
  behind and to the left, then, the pilot was looking away from city lights. This would mean that anything in the sky at
  an altitude somewhat below that of the plane would not be silhouetted against a bright background. Something above the
  horizon, however, might have been silhouetted against a slightly bright sky since the moon (on the horizon behind the
  plane) brightened the sky. Perhaps what happened is that before this time the "spaceship" was below the altitude of
  the airplane and thus silhouetted against the dark earth (and so the captain could only see the pale white lights) but
  at this time the "spaceship" moved upward and was above the horizon and the captain could now see its silhouette
  against the sky. Alternatively, perhaps what the captain saw was a reflection of ground lights off the object and thus
  was able to see its outline silouetted against a dark background. At any rate, he got the impression that the object
  was bigger than his airplane, so big, in fact, that in public statements he compared it to the size of an aircraft
  carrier! He could still see the horizontal pale white lights, as illustrated in Figure 5a, but he could now also see
  other structure as illustrated in Figure 8, which was drawn about a month and a half after the event.

<p>Shortly after the plane turned to the right the AARTCC controller called the Fairbanks Approach Radar controller to
  find out whether or not the short range radar had a target near the JAL. The approach radar reported no target other
  than JAL1628.
</p>
<p>Just after the right turn the plane was flying on a heading of about 255 degrees (true) and was about <span itemscope
    itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">20</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> north of Eielson AFB and <span itemscope

          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> east of Fairbanks. At 5:32 PM the conversation
  between the controller and JAL1628 continued:

  <p class="question">5:33:07 AARTCC - JAL1628, understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A minute and a half went by, during which time the plane flew on a straight heading while decreasing in altitude.
  Then the AARTCC decided to find out what had happened to the traffic.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="question">5:34:38 AARTCC - JAL1628 heavy, say position of your traffic.</p>
  <p class="answer">5:34:42 JAL1628 - Affirmative. Just over Fairbanks.</p>

  <p class="question">5:35:02 AARTCC - JAL1628 heavy, roger. Deviations approved as necessary for traffic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This portion of the audio tape transcript shows that the captain was incorrect in recalling a second right turn.
  Instead, the plane turned left about 12 degrees beginning at 5:35:09 and it continued to turn as if it were heading
  back in the direction of Talkeetna. By the time of the left turn the altitude had decreased to about <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">33000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span></span>. The statement at 5:34:42 that the object was <q>over
    Fairbanks</q> could not be correct if the object were at the left side of the plane because at that time Fairbanks
  was still ahead and somewhat to the right.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="question">5:35:15 AARTCC - JAL1628, say altitude of your traffic.</p>
  <p class="answer">5:35:20 JAL1628 - Ah, oh, ah, ah, same level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another minute passed by during which time the AARTCC called the Fairbanks approach radar again and once again the
  approach radar reported no target other than the JAL1628 itself. The copilot indicated that he wanted to resume his
  flight straight directly to Talkeetna:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="answer">5:36.12 JAL1628 - Ah, Anchorage Center, JAL1628. Request direct to Talkeetna.</p>
  <p class="question">5:36:18 AARTCC - JAL1628 heavy, cleared direct to Talkeetna and in, ah, advise me of your (sic)
    position of your traffic.
  </p>
  <p class="answer">5:36:24 JAL1628 - Ah, same po... same position.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words it appeared that the "traffic" had stayed in the same position relative to the aircraft and had
  descended with the aircraft to an altitude which was about <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">31200</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span></span> <span class="source">Flight path as constructed from the radar data package supplied by the FAA.</span>
  . The AARTCC decided it was time to "test" this unusual "traffic."
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="question">5:36:37 AARTCC - JAL1628 heavy, sir. I'm gonna request you to make a right turn three six zero
    degrees, 360 degree turn and advise me what your traffic does then.
  </p>
  <p class="answer">5:36:47 JAL1628 - Right turn 360.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plane commenced the turn at about 5:37:15. The pilot, in his testimony written a month and a half later, recalled
  this event: <q>We had to get away from that object. <q>JAL1628. This is Anchorage Center. We advise you, continue and
    take a 360 degree turn.</q> <q>JAL1628, thank you. We will continue 360 degree turn.</q> It was too slow to circle
    in the automatic pilot mode; therefore we switched to the manual mode and set to turn right on a 30 degree bank. We
    looked to our right forward but did not see any light.</q> (Note: if an object initially behind the plane remained
  stationary as the plane turned to the right it would first be seen by the copilot on the right side.) <q>We were
    relieved, thinking the object may have left us and [we] returned to level flight, but when we checked to our rear
    the object was still there in exactly the same place</q> (i.e., after the turn was complete it was seen again, by
  the captain, far to the left rear of the plane).
</p>
<p>When the plane began the turn the AARTCC communicated with the ROCC. At 5:37:23 the ROCC confirmed that no military
  aircraft were <q>working up there</q> and at 5:37:30 that there was no "traffic" on the radar screen. AARTCC then
  called the plane again. By this time the plane had been turning for about a minute and a half. It would take several
  more minutes to complete the turn.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="question">5:38:55 AARTCC - JAL1628 heavy, sir. Does your traffic appear to be staying with you?</p>
  <p class="answer">5:38:57 JAL1628 - Ah, [unintelligible] distinguished. [He meant extinguished.]</p>
  <p class="question">5:39:01 AARTCC - JAL1628 say again?</p>
  <p class="answer">5:39:04 JAL1628 - It, ah, disappeared.</p>
  <p class="question">5:39:10 AARTCC - JAL1628 heavy, roger. At your discretion proceed directly to Talkeetna, J125 [to]
    Anchorage.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "mothership" was behind and to the left before the right turn. Therefore there were three possible outcomes of
  the turn assuming that the object didn't just "disappear": (a) if the object remained stationary while the plane
  turned it would initially "disappear" from the left side and then reappear nearly behind the plane but on the right
  hand side after 30 seconds to minute of turning; (b) if the object also made a right hand turn but did so on the
  "outside" of the airplane's turn (i.e., at a much larger turning radius) then it would stay to the left and behind and
  be continually visible at the left; (c) if the object also made a right turn but trailed behind the airplane it would
  remain invisible during the turn.
</p>
<p>The fact that it "disappeared" very soon after the plane started the turn indicates that the "mothership" did not
  make a turn on the outside of the turn of the plane. On the other hand, the captain and copilot recall that they
  looked out the right hand side to see if it would reappear during the turn, but they did not see it. Therefore it may
  have trailed the aircraft during the turn. But it did not stay directly behind the aircraft after the turn because the
  captain recalled that after the turn had been completed and they were again heading southward <q>we (the captain,
    since he was the only one who could see to the left and behind) checked to our rear and the object was still there
    in exactly the same place</q>.
</p>
<p>The conclusion that the object may have trailed behind during the turn is consistent with a radar report made at the
  time. While the plane was turning the ROCC confirmed an anomalous radar target in the vicinity of the plane. (Note:
  some of the times given below do not agree with the times in the FAA transcript. This is because some of the
  transcript times are in error. The times given below agree with the FAA-supplied tape recording of the conversations
  between the FAA controllers, ROCC and the aircraft.)

<p>The use of the phrase "flight of two" indicated that, on the radar screen, the JAL1628 had a companion. That
  companion appeared as a primary return only (no transponder). Moreover, it appeared to the ROCC that the companion was
  "following" that is, it was behind the plane.
</p>
<p>Soon after the ROCC confirmed a <q>flight of two</q>, the AARTCC resumed communication with the plane:</p>

  <p class="answer">5:39:47 JAL1628 - I think so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While one of the AARTCC air traffic controllers was conversing with the plane another one was continuing to converse
  with the ROCC:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="question">5:39:24 AARTCC - OK. Do you want to, do you have anybody you can scramble up there or do you want

  <p class="answer">5:39:55 ROCC - OK. We're going to call the military desk on this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point the conversation with the ROCC ended and the plane was contacted again.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="question">5:40:10 AARTCC - JAL1628, Anchorage Center.</p>
  <p class="answer">5:40:12 JAL1628 - Go ahead.</p>

  <p class="answer">5:40:17 JAL1628 - Negative. Negative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Captain Terauchi's immediate reaction to the offer of military assistance was to decline it. In his testimony he
  recalled the event and explained his reaction: <q><q>JAL1628, This is Anchorage center. Would you like to request
    scramble for confirmation?</q> <q>The Anchorage Center, this is JAL1628.</q> We would not request scramble. We
    turned down the offer quickly. I knew that <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Mantell">in the past there
      was a U.S. military fighter called the Mustang that had flown up high for a confirmation and a tragedy had
      happened to it</a>. Even the F-15 with the newest technology had no guarantee of safety against the creature with
    an unknown degree of scientific technology.</q>
</p>
<p>Despite the immediate negative reply the AARTCC was persistent:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="question">5:40:26 AARTCC - Jal1628 heavy, sir, we do have military ah, at Eielson, 40 miles away. I can put
    them up and let them check the traffic for you.

  <p class="question">5:40:35 AARTCC - JAL1628, roger. Would you like us to do that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this time a military aircraft referred to as TOTEM, which was not a fighter aircraft but was already in the air,
  offered to check out the traffic. The transmission was somewhat garbled, however, and the AARTCC controller thought he
  was hearing JAL1628. JAL1628 was also confused momentarily:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="answer">5:40:44 TOTEM - Anchorage Center, you have TOTEM 71 up here. We might be able to get close to him.

  </p>
  <p class="answer">5:41:07 JAL1628 Ah, JAL1628. No radar traffic above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This last statement seems to make no sense in the context of the conversation. Perhaps Mr. Tamefuji did not
  correctly understand what the AARTCC had said.) It was now one minute since the AARTCC had been directed the plane to
  fly directly to Talkeetna. At that time, 5:39:10, the plane was about 1/3 of the way around the circle. Finally at
  5:42:04 the plane responded. By this time it was 3/4 of the way around the circle.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>While the plane was being directed to Talkeetna the AARTCC and the ROCC continued discussing the radar targets.

<p>While this conversation was going on Capt. Terauchi was looking to his left and backwards. It was there again!

  </p>
  <p class="question">5:42:42 AARTCC - JAL1628, understand. In sight, same position.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement, made as the plane was just coming out of the turn to head southward from near Fairbanks toward
  Anchorage, indicates, as described previously that the "mothership" may have followed behind the plane. The captain
  remembers the events this way: <q>The consumption of fuel during this flight was almost as expected but there was only
    3,800 pounds left and as such was not enough for extra flying for running around. We have got to arrive at
    Anchorage.</q> At this point from in his testimony the captain recalled the direction from the AARTCC to proceed
  directly to Talkeetna. But he thought that the plane had initiated the request. He continued, <q>We checked behind us
    again. The ship was in formation and ascending with us. We wondered and feared as to their purpose.</q> The word
  ascending should have been descending (the plane never ascended during the sighting according to the tracking data)
  and furthermore, it is in the wrong temporal location in the testimony because the descent occurred before, not after
  the turn. (The captain incorrectly recalled the descent as occurring after the turn.)
</p>
<p>His testimony continues at this point with his recollection of the query about a scramble of a military jet. But
  according to the transcript, the discussion of a scramble came before the plane completed the turn rather than after,
  as the captain recalled.
</p>
<p>About a minute and a half later the AARTCC decided to find out whether or not the traffic was still with the plane.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="question">5:44:07 AARTCC - JAL1628, sir, do you still have the traffic?</p>
  <p class="answer">5:44:12 JAL1628 - Ah, say again please.</p>
  <p class="question">5:44:13 ARTCC - JAL1628 heavy.. Do you still have the traffic?</p>
  <p class="answer">5:44:17 JAL1628 - Ah, affirmative, ah, nine o'clock.</p>
</blockquote>
Captain Terauchi recalled the reappearance of the "mothership." <q>We flew toward Talkeetna at an altitude of <span
    itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">31000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span></span>. The spaceship was still following us, not leaving us
  at all</q>.
<p>By this time the plane was completely out of the turn and headed southward toward Talkeetna. At about 5:40 a United
  Airlines passenger jet took off from Anchorage and headed north to Fairbanks. Several minutes later it reported being
  at <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">29000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">feet</span></span> and on a 350 degree (magnetic) heading. The AARTCC
  controller decided to ask the UA pilot if he could see anything behind the JAL flight. At 5:44:43 he called the UA
  pilot to say that the JAL flight was in his 11 o'clock position and <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">110</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">nautical miles</span></span> north <q>and he has traffic following
    him, sir. It's unknown traffic... I want you to see if you see anything with him</q>. The UA pilot said he would
  look when he got closer. The controller asked the JAL flight to stay at <span itemscope

          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span></span> and the UA flight to stay at <span itemscope

<p>As the planes approached each other in the dark sky the "mothership" apparently dropped back, allowing the JAL plane
  to get far ahead. Of course the <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span
      itemprop="value">10</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> distance was only the pilot's guess. The object
  was too far back to be detected on the airplane radar, which would give an accurate distance. The United pilot asked
  the AARTCC to have the JAL pilot flash the headlights on the JAL aircraft so he could locate the plane. At 5:49:45 the
  JAL pilot did that. At this time the planes were about <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">25</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> apart.

<p>Terauchi says that at about the time that his plane headed toward Talkeetna after the 360 turn, <q>a United Airline
  passenger jet which left Anchorage to Fairbanks flew into the same air zone and began communicating with Anchorage
  center. We heard them transmitting that there was an object near JAL1628 and requesting for confirmation. We heard the
  Anchorage Center was saying to the United Airline aircraft that JAL1628 was at an altitude of <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">31000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span></span> and therefore the United aircraft should maintain
  <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">33000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span></span>.</q> (Actually the transcript shows that the UA
  altitude was <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">29000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span></span>.) <q>It sounded as if Anchorage Center had the United
    Airline aircraft fly above the spaceship. We were flying the east side of Mt. McKinley. The United Airline aircraft
    came close to us. The United Airline aircraft requested us to flash our landing lights for visual confirmation and
    we both confirmed our positions visually. The United Airlines aircraft was coming close to us. We knew that they
    were watching us. When the United plane came by our side the spaceship disappeared suddenly and there was nothing
    left but the light of the moon.</q>
</p>
<p>When the planes were about <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span
    itemprop="value">12</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> apart and still approaching one another, the UA
  plane reported seeing the JAL plane and nothing else. By this time the "mothership" had apparently disappeared:

  <p class="answer">5:50:35 UA69 - UA69 heavy. We've got the Japan Airliner in sight. I don't see anybody around him.
    He's (referring to the "spaceship") at his seven o'clock position, huh?
  </p>
  <p class="answer">5:50:46 AARTCC - UA69, that's what he says. JAL1628 heavy, say the position of your traffic now.
  </p>
  <p class="answer">5:50:52 JAL1628 - Ah, now, distinguishing (he meant to say "extinguishing"), but, ah, ah, your, I
    guess, ah, 12 o'clock below you.
  </p>
  <p class="question">5:51:02 AARTCC - JAL1628 heavy, say again. You're broken.</p>
  <p class="answer">5:51:06 JAL1628 - Just ahead of United, ah..(unintelligible)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above conversation appears to confirm Terauchi's later recollection that the object disappeared when the two
  planes got close to one another. The copilot used the word <q>distinguishing</q> and followed this with <q>I guess 12
    o'clock below you</q>. Previously he had used the word "distinguished" when he meant "extinguished," or no longer
  visible, because the object had disappeared shortly after the 360 turn began (see 5:38:57 and 5:39:04 above).
  Apparently he meant "extinguishing" or "extinguished" at this time as well. Furthermore, if the object had been still
  visible he would not have said <q>I guess 12 o'clock below you.</q> because the captain would have been able to see
  where the object was relative to the UA jet. Thus it appears that the object/light had disappeared by 5:51 when the
  planes were still about <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span
      itemprop="value">12</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> apart.
</p>
<p>It is also interesting to note that the copilot used the words "below" you which suggests that at that time the JAL
  flight crew thought that the UA plane was above their altitude. This is as the captain remembered it. Perhaps they did
  not hear the controller tell the UA plane to maintain <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span
      itemprop="value">29000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span></span>.
</p>
<p>At 5:51:32, after the planes had passed one another, the UA plane reported being able to see the JAL plane
  silhouetted against the sky. The UA captain could see the contrail as well as the jet but nothing else. The controller
  responded, <q>We got just a few primary hits on the target and then, ah, we really haven't got a good track on him,
    ever</q>, meaning that the radar never showed a continuous track (a continuous series of "blips") of primary-only
  radar targets associated with the unusual "traffic."
</p>
<p>After the UA plane had passed the JAL flight at a point about <span itemscope
    itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">60</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">nautical miles</span></span> south of Fairbanks at about 5:51, the
  AARTCC requested that TOTEM also fly toward the JAL plane for a look. AARTCC then directed the JAL plane to descend.
  The plane made its final report on the "traffic," which was <q>long gone</q> by this time.

  <p class="answer">5:53:31 JAL1628 - Affirmative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the next several minutes TOTEM viewed the JAL plane but couldn't see any other traffic. JAL1628 proceeded to
  <span class="place">Anchorage</span> and landed at 6:20 PM. The Fantastic Flight was over, but the seeds of
  controversy had been sown. They would bear sometimes bitter fruit about a month and a half later.
