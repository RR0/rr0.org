<p>Because of the report of unusual traffic the crew was interviewed immediately by FAA official Jack Wright and by
  agents James Derry and Ronald Mickle. Wright recorded the following information: <span class="source">Klass, P.J., "FAA Data Sheds New Light on JAL Pilot's UFO Report," The Skeptical Inquirer, Summer, 1987 (Buffalo,

  <p>I received a call from Dick Powers concerning a JAL flight which the Captain had stated he was being followed or
    shadowed. I observed the aircraft land at 1820 hours (6:20 PM). No other aircraft was noted. The B747 taxied into
    the international ramp area. I interviewed Capt. Terauchi and the crew of two. The captain stated that this was the
    first time that anything like this had happened to him. He stated that approximately <span itemscope

          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">nautical miles</span></span> after passing the Canadian/Alaskan border
    at <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">35000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span></span> something appeared <span itemscope

          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">nautical miles</span></span> to <span itemscope
        itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">7</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">nautical miles</span></span> in front of the aircraft. It had lights,
    four to five in a line (refer to captain's drawing) and said it was bigger than they were (B-747). At times the
    object would be to the captain's side of the aircraft [left]. Never the other side [right]. He referred to the dark
    side. After passing Fairbanks area he requested to fly parallel to course and this was granted. When he turned to
    the right and flew parallel, the object was gone. (In all cases weather radar was also used to identify the object
    and the <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">5</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">nautical miles</span></span> to <span itemscope

    - <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">20</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">nautical miles</span></span> range.) They returned to course and the
    captain said <q>There it was, as if it was waiting for me</q>. At approximately the Talkeetna area the object took
    off to the east and was gone. A United flight departed from Anchorage and was requested to check if they could see
    anything but it was gone before United got there. Nothing different with the cargo except some expensive wine. The
    captain and crew were shook-up but professional. James Derry interviewed the crew at JAL operations. Capt. Terauchi
    had asked AARTCC if they were picking up two targets and was told <q>just one</q>. The total time was approximately
    <time>P55M</time>. A new crew took the flight on to Tokyo. Capt. Terauchi and the crew were to be in Anchorage a few
    days before any additional flights. James Derry requested that the tapes and any other information be saved <span

<p>The sparse amount of information contained in this initial report indicates that Wright did not carry out an
  extensive interview of the pilot and crew. It also indicates that he did not learn exactly what happened, probably
  because of one or more of the following reasons: (a) he may have failed to ask for a minute-by-minute history of the
  flight; (b) Terauchi may not have been able to recall the events accurately and in the correct order, and (c) it may
  have been difficult to communicate (Japanese-English translation). Special Agents James Derry and Ronald Mickle also
  participated in the interview. However, as will be seen, they did obtain more information. Both Derry and Mickle made
  notes. Agent Derry recorded the second interview as follows <span class="source">Klass, P.J., "FAA Data Sheds New Light on JAL Pilot's UFO Report," The Skeptical Inquirer, Summer, 1987 (Buffalo,

<blockquote>
  <p>On November 17 I responded to a call from the <abbr title="Regional Operational Center">ROC</abbr> reference an
    incident involving unidentified air traffic (UAT) following JAL flight 1628 into Anchorage. I asked Agent Mickle to
    meet me at Anchorage Airport. Upon arriving at the ANC I met Agent Mickle and Inspector Wright who had been at the
    aircraft. All three of us then proceeded to JAL operations to interview the crew. At JAL operations we met with [the
    crew] and Mr. Shibashi, JAL operations manager at Anchorage. The three crewmen stated that just after passing POTAT
    intersection inbound to Anchorage on J529 (an air route) they observed strange lights ahead of the B747. These
    lights changed position after two minutes but remained in front of the aircraft for another <time>P10M</time>, then
    moved to the left side of the aircraft. They stated that all they could see were the lights and at no time could
    they see the craft. However, they did show an object on their WX radar at <span itemscope
        itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">7</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">nautical miles</span></span>. The lights were yellow, amber and green,
    but no red. The lights were in two separate sets which changed position relative to one another. The crew said that
    they contacted AARTCC (and the AARTCC) confirmed that they also had it on radar.
  </p>
  <p>Near Fairbanks the crew executed a 360 turn and the lights stayed with them off their left side. They then
    proceeded to Anchorage and the lights were still visible around <span itemscope
        itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">40</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">miles</span></span> north of Talkeetna when they moved away to the
    east. The crew reported their speed as 0.84 Mach and their altitude between FL390 (flight level <span itemscope
        itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">39000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span></span>) and 310 as assigned along their course. The only
    problem with their systems was some static in the <abbr title="Very High Frequency">VHF</abbr> receiver. The
    navigations system in use was <abbr title="Inertial Navigation System">INS</abbr> with no apparent problems. Upon
    completion of my discussion with the crew I called Capt. Stevens, Duty Officer to
    <a href="/org/NORAD.html">NORAD</a>, and asked if he had any questions other than what I had asked. He said he had
    no other questions, but they also showed two targets on radar (one was JAL). He stated that they would give all data
    to Intelligence in the morning. I then asked Bobby Lamkin by phone if the Air Force was holding the data and he said
    yes <span class="source">Information found in the <time>1987-01-15</time> interview of the flight engineer, Yoshio Tsukuba.</span>.

Special Agent Ronald Mickle recorded the interview as follows <span class="source">Klass, P.J., "FAA Data Sheds New Light on JAL Pilot's UFO Report," The Skeptical Inquirer, Summer, 1987 (Buffalo,
    NY).</span>:
<blockquote>
  <p>As per telephonic request from (Wright), the following are the events which took place on <time>1986-11-17</time>
    and were taken from my personal notes during the interview. I went to the Japan Airlines station office as
    instructed by the Manager (Derry). Myself (sic) and Jim Derry interviewed the crew of JAL Flight 1628, which
    reported the sighting of unidentified air traffic. The flight crew consisted of (Terauchi, Tamefuji and Tsukuba).
    Captain Terauchi stated he first sited (visually) the <abbr title="Unidentified Air Traffic">UAT</abbr> in the
    vicinity of POTAT intersection and the ADIZ. The aircraft he was piloting (B747) was at flight level 390, airspeed
    0.84 Mach. Captain Terauchi indicated that the UAT was in front of his aircraft at a distance of approximately <span
        itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">7</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">nautical miles</span></span> to <span itemscope
        itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">8</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">nautical miles</span></span> for approximately <time>P12M</time>.
    Captain Terauchi stated that while he had a visual on the UAT he spotted yellow, amber and green lights and a
    rotating beacon but no red lights. The captain said there were two distinct sets of lights, but appeared to be
    joined together (as fixed to one object). Captain Terauchi ascertained through visual sighting and radar that the
    UAT was equal in size to a B747, possibly larger.
  </p>
  <p>Captain Terauchi stated that during the visual sighting the lights of the UAT changed from a horizontal position
    to a vertical position and had positioned itself in front of the B747 to the port side. The UAT stayed on the port
    side for approximately <time>P35M</time>. Captain Terauchi said he was communicating with the AARTCC personnel during the
    sighting. The captain stated he requested and received permission to perform a 360 degree turn while in the vicinity
    of Fairbanks which he had a visual on. Captain Terauchi stated the UAT maintained its position on the port side
    during the turn. Captain Terauchi stated that visual sight of the UAT was completely lost approximately <span
        itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">40</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="NMI">nautical miles</span></span> north of Talkeetna, while continuing to
    Anchorage. The captain stated that there was static during VHF communications with the AARTCC, that there was
    erratic movement with lights of the UAT during the visual contact, that navigation was being performed by coupling
    of the onboard INS's, and that the AARTCC had indicated to him the presence of a primary target in addition to his
    aircraft. Through a confidential source at JAL it was stated to me that this is not the first sighting of an
    unidentified aircraft by Captain Terauchi <span class="source">Information found in the <time>1987-01-15</time> interview of the flight engineer, Yoshio Tsukuba.</span>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A comparison of the above versions of the second interview shows that the full and accurate story that I have
  previously presented, as based on the transcripts of the AARTCC audio tape and the detailed testimony of the crew, did
  not come through in the initial interviews. Furthermore, the interviewers had somewhat divergent opinions on what the
  captain told them. Part of this problem may have been, literally, in the translation (Japanese to English), but part
  of the problem also is that different people react to and remember different elements of any story. It is interesting
  to note Derry's reference to NORAD being contacted and NORAD reporting that <q>they also had two targets on radar</q>.
  Derry also indicated that Air Force Intelligence would get a report on the sighting.
</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that the interviewers did not think to tape-record the conversations for later analysis but instead
  simply relied upon their recollections and brief notes. Nevertheless, the basic core of the story is clearly expressed
  in these early interviews and thus they support the captain's subsequent more detailed testimony, written about a
  month and a half later. Particularly supportive of the captain’s later testimony were the drawings made during the
  interview with Derry and Mickle (Figures 2, 3, 5, 6). They show how the lights appeared in front of the aircraft and
  beside the aircraft and how the radar target appeared. These sketches, made only hours after the events, are
  consistent with the more elaborate drawings that the captain made a month and a half later to illustrate his
  testimonial report (Figures 4, 8 - 11). These latter drawings were publicized widely in the news media. The captain
  also made a map of his recollection of the flight (Figure 12).

<p>The air traffic controller who was responsible for guiding the JAL flight recorded his recollections the next day,
  evidently without first listening to the AARTCC tape recording of the conversations with the plane. He wrote as

<blockquote>
  <p>During the period of 2030 UTC (universal time coordinated), November 17, 1986, to 0430 UTC, November 18, 1986 I was
    on duty in the Anchorage ARTCC. I was working the D15 position from 0156 UTC to 0230 UTC, November 18, 1986. (This
    corresponds to 4:56 to 5:30 PM Alaska Standard Time, November 17, 1986.) At approximately 0225Z (5:25 PM) while
    monitoring JL1628 on Sector 15 radar the aircraft requested traffic information. I advised no traffic in his
    vicinity. The aircraft advised he had traffic 12 o'clock, same altitude. I asked JL1628 if he would like high/lower
    altitude and the pilot replied negative. I checked with ROCC to see if they had military traffic in the area and to
    see if they had primary targets in the area. ROCC did have a primary target in the same position JL1628 reported.
    Several times I had primary returns where JL1628 reported the traffic. JL later requested a turn to heading 210. I
    approved JL1628 to make deviations as necessary for traffic. The traffic stayed with JL1628 through turns and
    descent.
  </p>
  <p>In the vicinity of Fairbanks I requested JL1628 to make a right 360 turn to see if he could identify the aircraft.
    He lost contact momentarily at which I time observed a primary target in the six o'clock position, five miles. I
    then vectored UA69 northbound to Fairbanks from Anchorage with his approval to see if he could identify the
    aircraft. He had contact with the JL1628 flight but reported no other traffic. By this time JL1628 had lost contact
    with the traffic. Also a military C-130 southbound to Elmendorf AFB from Eielson AFB advised he had plenty of fuel
    and would take a look. I vectored him toward the flight and climbed him to Flight Level 240 (<span itemscope
        itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">24000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span></span>). He also had no contact. I requested JL1628 to
    identify the type or markings of the aircraft. He could not identify but reported white and yellow strobes. I
    requested the JL1628 to say flight conditions. He reported clear and no clouds. The phrase "single primary returns"
    (used above) is in reference to a target other than JAL and "the traffic" is in reference to the unidentified object
    <span class="source">Information found in the <time>1987-01-15</time> interview of the flight engineer, Yoshio Tsukuba.</span>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the Anchorage FAA alerted the FAA Security Office in Washington, D.C., no further action regarding the
  reported traffic was taken. This is unfortunate since careful debriefing at the time of the event possibly could have
  uncovered details which had been forgotten by the time the crew was interviewed again in <time>1987-01</time>.
