<p>This information about the sighting must have come as a compete surprise to the FAA headquarters. On January 1 the
  FAA reopened its inquiry into the sighting. Capt. Terauchi was interviewed on <time>1987-01-02</time>
  <span class="source">Interview of Capt. Kenjyu Terauchi, <time>1987-01-02</time>. During the interview Capt. Terauchi reported two
    previous UFO sightings. About five years before the present sighting he saw a "mothership" shortly after taking off
    from Taipai, south of Formosa, but it was <q>so weird I ignored it</q>. Then he saw, from his home during the
    daytime, bright lights that continued for about <time>P10M</time>. Although this was not Terauchi's first UFO, it
    was the first sighing of unidentified phenomena by the other two crew members. In <time>1987-01</time> Capt.
    Terauchi had another sighting of a strange phenomenon which he reported. He subsequently offered a satisfactory
    explanation for it. (From the FAA file on the JAL sighting)</span>, at which time he supplied his written testimony
  <span class="source">Written (in Japanese, with translation) testimony of Capt. Kenjyu Terauchi as received by the FAA on <time>1987-01-02</time>.
    A comparison of the transcript of the conversation with the air traffic controller (ref. 4 below) with Terauchi's
    testimony shows that, a month and a half after the sighting, he recalled the individual events quite but not
    perfectly accurately and that he confused the order of some of the events. The order of events in Terauchi's
    testimony has been modified somewhat in this presentation to place them in the order that is found on the AARTCC
    audio tape.</span>. On <time>1987-01-04</time> the national press reported that the FAA had reopened the inquiry and numerous news
  stories followed.
</p>
<p>The FAA released portions of the information through Mr. Steucke as the information became available. Unfortunately
  the FAA did not have a complete and accurate story to report and consequently the early news stories contained
  errors. The most amusing of these was in the reported time of the sightings. For some reason someone had handwritten
  a a note on the master copy of the first FAA release, which was a summary of the AARTCC tape recording. The note
  indicated that the events had begun at 6:19 PM, even though the summary itself clearly said 0219 UTC which
  translated to 5:19 PM Alaska Standard Time. This time error was perpetuated in news reports even though the captain
  recalled the correct time and stated it during an interview with Larry King on <time>1987-01-02</time>.
</p>
<p>While the press was having fun with the story the FAA continued its inquiry. The copilot was interviewed on <time>1987-01-05</time>
  <span class="source">Information found in the <time>1987-01-05</time> interview of Copilot Takanori Tamefuji. The difficulty in
    communicating through an interpreter is evident in the transcript of this interview. At one point the interviewer
    asked Tamefuji, referring to the arrays of lights ahead and to the left, <q>And you could distinguish these lights
      as being different from the star...?</q> Tamefuji's response is transcribed as <q>NNNooo...</q>, which some might
    interpret as meaning that Tamefuji couldn't distinguish the lights from stars. But the interviewer immediately
    continued <q>...from the stars?</q> to which Tamefuji replied, "Different is fine." Subsequently Tamefuji made it
    quite clear that the lights were very different from stars.</span> and the flight engineer on
  <time>1987-01-15</time> <span class="source">Information found in the <time>1987-01-15</time> interview of the flight engineer, Yoshio Tsukuba.</span>.
  A complete transcript of the AARTCC tape recording, although with some errors, was completed on January 9 and the
  radar data tape recording was sent to a special FAA facility for analysis. The FAA announced that it would release
  the material it had collected after it complete the inquiry.
