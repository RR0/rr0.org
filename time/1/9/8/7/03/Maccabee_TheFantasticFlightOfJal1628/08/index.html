<p><time>1987-01</time> went by and then <time>1987-02</time> with still no word from the FAA. But then, on <time>1987-03-05</time>,
  the FAA announced the results of the inquiry. According to the FAA press release the FAA <q>was unable to confirm
    the event</q> <span class="source">“FAA Releases Documents on Reported UFO Sighting Last November,” by Paul Steucke, Office of Public Affairs,
    Alaskan Region, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), U.S. Department of Transport, March 5, 1987 (Anchorage, AK)</span>.
  The event was unconfirmed because <q>a second radar target near the JAL flight at the time of the reported sighting
    was not another aircraft but rather a split radar return from the JAL Boeing 747.</q> In other words, the FAA
  couldn't confirm the sighting on radar because the "traffic" or "primary return" reported by the AARTCC controller
  at the time of the sighting was merely an artifact of the radar set. Or so said the FAA! (Recall that the
  transponder return or "blip" is separate from the primary return blip. These two should be immediately adjacent or
  one-on-top of the other under ordinary conditions. What the FAA was saying was that because of a minor and temporary
  malfunction of the radar the primary return was separated in position on the radar screen from the transponder
  return, thus making look as if there were two separate radar-reflective objects in the sky.) The press release did
  not mention that the "split return effect" was contradicted by the fact that the extra echo did not come back with
  every sweep of the radar and by a statement by an airtraffic controller who said that they rarely, if ever, get a
  split image in the area where the JAL jet was flying. The press release did <b>NOT</b> offer an explanation for the
  visual sighting, nor did it dispute the crew's claim that something unusual was seen. The press release just did not
  address the issue of the visual sighting.
</p>
<p>The March FAA release made a smaller splash in the press than had the original January stories about the FAA
  involvement. This may have been because the press misinterpreted the FAA statement combined with the "fact" that the
  sighting had already been "explained" by CSICOP. The general newsmedia concentrated on the FAA statement that it
  could not confirm the radar sighting and ignored the failure of the FAA to even mention the visual sighting. For
  example, NBC News incorrectly reported that <q>Terauchi's crewmates were not sure that they had seen a UFO</q> and
  that the FAA <q>concluded a three-month investigation saying there is nothing to substantiate the pilot's story</q>.
  From this sort of press reporting one would get the impression that the whole sighting revolved around the Captain's
  story, which was not supported by the crew members. The NBS story failed to mention, probably because the NBC
  reporter didn't know, what you, dear reader, know: that the copilot and flight engineer had independently confirmed
  the pilot's report of seeing numerous lights appear in front and to the left of the aircraft and that the airplane
  radar had picked up a large target in the same direction as the UFO.
</p>
<p>After March 5 the press interest in this story essentially died, leaving the general public with the impression
  that once again an experienced air crew had failed to identify normal phenomena. (Capt. Kenjyu Terauchi was
  subsequently "grounded" for a couple of years, evidently for his boldness in reporting what he and the others had
  seen.)
