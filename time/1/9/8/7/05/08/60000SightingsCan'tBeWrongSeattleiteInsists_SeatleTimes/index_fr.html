<p>Dans leur forme la plus couramment rapportée, les extraterrestres ont de grandes tête et font de 1 m à 1,20 m. Leurs
  yeux énormes resposent sous un casque transparent. Vêtus de combinaisons ornées d'insignes, les humanoïdes marchent de
  mouvements assurés.
</p>
<p>Eloigné ?</p>
<p>Peut-être, mais c'est probablement de là d'où ils viennent.</p>
<p>Et le résident de Seattle <a href="/people/g/GoudieDaleD/index.html">Dale Goudie</a> a parlé à des gens qui disent
  les avoir vus.
</p>
<p><a href="/people/g/GoudieDaleD/index.html">Goudie</a> a passé les 14 dernières années à faire des recherches sur les
  ovnis et à utiliser l'Acte sur la Liberté d'Information pour collecter des documents fédéraux dont il soutient qu'ils
  prouvent que les ovnis existent.
</p>
<p>La position officielle de la <a href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Force Aérienne des USA</a>, par exemple, est qu'elle
  est sortie des affaires d'ovnis lorsque le <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook/index.html">projet
    Bluebook</a> s'est terminé <time>1969</time>. Mais <a href="/people/g/GoudieDaleD/index.html">Goudie</a> dit que
  <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook/index.html">Bluebook</a> a eu pour successeur le projet Aquarius.
</p>
<p>Since <time>1942</time>, there have been an estimated 60,000 UFO sightings in the United States alone and only 5
  percent of sightings are actually reported, Goudie says. Feeding characteristics of the 60,000 sightings into a
  computer, 250 different shapes emerged, suggesting to Goudie that there may be more than one species involved in
  UFO's.
</p>
<p>"The bottom line is: Don't believe me, but do read what is available" says Goudie, who has dedicated a room in his
  home to countless files and papers on UFO's. "The real problem is, no one wants to take the responsibility of telling
  the American public this (UFOs) is real."
</p>
<p>Consider a series of once-classified material on Project Aquarius:</p>
<p>An Air Force document dated Nov. 17 1980, from the Office of Special Investigations at Rolling Air Force Base in
  Washington, D.C. to OSI at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico refers to a "request for photo imagery
  interpretation."
</p>
<p>Other papers indicate that the request stemmed from a series of "alleged sightings of unidentified aerial lights"
  over the Manzano Weapons Storage Area at Kirtland between Aug. 8 and Sept. 3, 1980.
</p>
<p>An analysis of at least two pictures of the sightings concluded that the film was unaltered and that they were
  "legitimate negative(s) if (an) unidentified aerial object," according to the Nov. 17 1980, document. Of the two
  confirmed sightings, one "contained a trilateral insignia on the lower portion of object...."
</p>
<p>The document also states:</p>
<p>"The official U.S. government policy and results of Project Aquarius is still classified top secret with no
  dissemination outside official intelligence channels .... Because of a chance of public disclosure, no knowledgeable
  personnel with SPA (it's not clear it SPA stands for Special Project Aquarius, or something else) will be
  provided...."
</p>
<p>But another Air Force document dated Jan. 25, 1983, says "possible unauthorized release of classified material" cast
  doubt on the authenticity of the Nov. 17, 1980, document. The later document says the earlier one included nonexistent
  offices and officers, it sought to discredit the validity of the purported imagery interpretation.

<p>When a Freedom of Information request letter dated <time>1986-02-20</time>, sought information on Project Aquarius,
  the National Security Agency responded, in part, with a letter dated <time>1986-03-03</time>:
</p>
<p>"Please be advised that Project Aquarius does not deal with unidentified aerial objects. We, therefore, have no
  information to provide you on the subject."
</p>
<p>But when U.S. Sen. <span class="people">John Glenn</span> wrote the National Security Agency on Jan. 7 of this year
  on behalf of a constituent who was having trouble getting responses to Freedom of Information requests about Project
  Aquarius, the reply letter, dated Jan. 27, said in part:
</p>
<p>"Apparently there is or was an Air Force project by that name which dealt with UFOs. Coincidentally, there is also an
  NSA project by that name. The NSA project does not deal with UFOs...."
</p>
<p>It is Goudie's contention that the responses about Project Aquarius demonstrate the government is saying one thing
  and doing another. He theorized that the government is reluctant to admit the existence of even one UFO because as
  soon as it does, it fears opening the door to mass hysteria.
</p>
<p>Spokesmen for the Pentagon, the Air Force and the National Security Agency either declined comment or denied that any
  government agency is actively investigating UFO's.
</p>
<p>The Air Force quit studying UFOs in 1969 after a $500,000 study conducted by the University of Colorado concluded
  that "UFO phenomena do not offer a fruitful field in which to look for major scientific discoveries," according to
  Capt. Jay DeFrank.
</p>
<p>DeFrank noted that in 1977, President Carter asked the National Aeronautic and Space Administration to look into the
  possibility of resuming active investigation of UFOs.
</p>
<p>This is the same man who in 1973, when he was governor of Georgia, said, "I don't laugh at people anymore when they
  say they have seen UFOs because I've seen one myself."
</p>
<p>NASA spokesman Dave Garrett recalls that agency's response to the president: "We said, "Thank you, but no thank you."
  We have never been in the business."
</p>
<p>Dennis Chadwick, chief spokesman for the National Security Agency at Fort George Meade in Maryland, an arm of the
  Pentagon, would not say whether NSA or any other government agency is actively investigating UFOs.
</p>
<p>Goudie, a 45-year-old freelance ad man and former TV talk-show producer, is not deterred by the government's stance.
  Two years ago, he established a computerized UFO bulletin board - CUFON (for Computer UFO Network) - that has more
  than 1,400 members. It spits out information, free of charge, to anyone with a computer and a modem.
</p>
<p>He also runs UFO Information Service International, a global network of UFO sightings, and Puget Sound Aerial
  Phenomena Research Inc.
</p>
<p>None of these enterprises, he says, is a moneymaking operation.</p>
<p>Goudie says he and others like him have been helped in their many Freedom of Information requests by military
  personnel who want the public to know about UFOs, but who can't afford to be named.
</p>
<p>Many of the documents he's obtained indicate that "suspicious unknown air activity" has occurred at top-security
  military installations where nuclear weapon are stored.
</p>
<p>The documents relating to UFOs dropping in on Air Force bases have been published elsewhere - and professional
  skeptics such as Philip Klass, an editor with "Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology," have written books debunking the
  authenticity of those and other sightings.
</p>
<p>But Goudie notes the government itself has never volunteered any information, much less any explanations, about UFOs
  at military bases.
</p>
<p>"You can explain anything away," says Goudie, referring to Klass and the other debunkers, "But these aren't solid
  answers."
</p>
<p>Goudie also says he has consulted with "optical physicists" who have performed "video-negative photoanalysis" of
  video tapes of UFOs to substantiate that the objects are not of this earth.
</p>
<p>Goudie also says he has interviewed about 40 people over the years who claim to have been abducted by UFOs. All
  occurred in rural areas, including some episodes outside Redmond, in Maple Valley and north of Seattle. He thinks
  about three-fourths of them are telling the truth.
</p>
<p>In many cases, the victims have suffered physical scars that they didn't have before their encounter, Goudie says.
  "I've tried to get these people to come forward. They don't want anything to do with newspapers. They're scared to
  death of losing their jobs..."
</p>
<p>Considering the threat to national security and the risk to civilians, Goudie believes the government has an
  obligation to be more forthcoming.
</p>
<p>You don't have to look to faraway places for physical evidence of UFOs, according to Goudie. He has a videotape of an
  object flying over Tacoma in 1982, enhanced by a process know as "video negative photo analysis" which allows the
  viewers to see vertical and horizontal lines within what Goudie calls "the plasma" that covers the true shape within.
  He expects the video to air on Sunday's Town Meeting" on KOMO.
</p>
<p>Television, specifically a Dick Cavett shoe that aired in 1973, stated Goudie's preoccupation with UFOs. He's since
  appeared on CNN's Larry King Show and CBS-TV network news shows, among others.
</p>
<p>He has spent countless hours and dollars pursuing UFOs.</p>
<p>His goal, he says, is to see the subject become an area of serious scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>"I'm doing it because I think people deserve the facts, and no one's taking the time to do it."</p>
