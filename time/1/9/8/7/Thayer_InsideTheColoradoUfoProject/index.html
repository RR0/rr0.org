<p>A great deal has been both spoken and written about the <a href="/time/1/9/6/8/CondonReport">University of Colorado
  UFO study</a>, some of which makes sense, some of which does not. The typical person remains confused. Was the Project
  a valid scientific effort or a gigantic hoax? Did those involved really try to solve the problem, or did they merely
  go through the motions? Who was right in the controversy between Dr. <span class="people" title="Edward U. Condon">
    Condon</span> on the one hand and <span class="people" title="David R. Saunders">Saunders</span> and <span
    class="people">Norman E. Levine</span> on the other? In real life the answers to such questions are never simple,
  nor are they here. Nevertheless, in the hope that I may succeed in better defining the issues, I hereby offer my own
  experience in and opinions about the UFO Project.

<p>I became a member of the UFO Project in the early summer of <time>1968</time>— months after the firing of <span
  class="people">Saunders</span> and <span class="people">Levine</span>—in response to a call for help. The Project had
  let a contract to the <a href="/org/us/university/stanford/sri">Stanford Research Institute</a> to prepare a report on
  “Radar and the Observation of UFOs.” Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> and some of the other staff members
  believed that this report would contain an evaluation of actual UFO cases, but a preliminary draft of the report had
  been received that contained no such analysis, for the very good reason that the contract did not call for it (the
  results of the Stanford contract appear in the final report as <a href="/time/1/9/6/8/CondonReport/s6/c05">Chapter 5
    of Section VI, titled simply “Radar”</a>). Apparently there had been a breakdown in communications somewhere.</p>
<p>Now <span class="people">Condon</span> needed someone to bail him out. He turned to Dr. <span class="people">C. Gordon Little</span>,
  Director of the Wave Propagation Laboratory of what was then the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA),
  a part of the Department of Commerce. Dr. <span class="people">Little</span> had earlier turned down the same Air
  Force contract that <span class="people">Condon</span> was then working under, reportedly saying that it would be “a
  disaster” (I later told Dr. <span class="people">Little</span> that he was quoted as having said that; he laughed and
  said, “Did I say that?”—I got the distinct impression that he still felt the same way). This time, however, he was
  willing to supply some personnel to help out, provided that they did so as employees of the University and not of
  ESSA. He then called my boss, Dr. <span class="people">Bradford R. Bean</span>, who in turn offered the job to me.
  After some deliberation I decided to accept, telling Dr. <span class="people">Bean</span> that <q>notoriety is better
    than obscurity.</q></p>
<p>In retrospect, I believe my comment here was probably misunderstood. I used the word “notoriety” in the sense of
  “notorious” rather than “famous.” I half expected that I might accumulate some negative notoriety from having worked
  on the UFO Project, but I felt that even such adverse publicity would be more advantageous than remaining completely
  unheard of. Whether or not I ever achieved any kind of notoriety from participating in this project is debatable. The
  grand total of results, aside from an invited paper in Astronautics & Aeronautics, about which more later, was an
  interview published in the <time>1977-04-19</time>, issue of the National Inside the Colorado UFO Project Enquirer—if
  that is not notorious, what is?—and a listing in Marquis Who’s Who in the West for 1976–1977. But I digress.</p>

</figure>
<p>I first met Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> when he interviewed me prior to hiring me to work on the UFO
  Project. Then 66 years old, <span class="people">Condon</span> struck me as a rather phlegmatic individual. Rather
  heavyset, with short hair and hornrimmed glasses, he reminded me somehow of Charles Laughton, the Hollywood actor.
  Although he was usually laconic, he could on occasion become rather garrulous. He struck me as guarded, as though he
  did not want anyone to know who he really was. As I was to discover later, he may have had good reason to behave in
  this manner. Nevertheless, he and I struck it off fairly well, and before the interview was over he assured me that I
  would be hired for the UFO Project as a consultant, on leave from ESSA. Condon also said I would be allowed to bring
  along a co-worker to help me with my work, who would also be hired by the Project.</p>
<p>A few days later a meteorologist who worked for me at the time—Burgette “Scotty” Hart—and I were given leave without
  pay from ESSA and hired as consultants to the UFO project. Our assignment was to evaluate a group of the best
  radar-visual UFO cases in the Project files to see how many of them could reasonably be attributed to anomalous
  propagation effects. Note that this contrasts with Dr. <span class="people">James E. McDonald</span>’s statement, made
  to John G. Fuller during the course of the UFO project, that <q>Condon’s disposition was to concentrate on the
    nut-and-kook cases at the expense of the serious evidence…</q> <span class="source">See the introduction by <span
    class="people">John G. Fuller</span> in <span class="people">David R. Saunders</span> and <span class="people">R. Roger Harkins</span>, <i
    lang="en">UFOS? Yes!</i> (page 12) <span class="source">Saunders, David R., and R. Roger Harkins. 1968. UFOS? Yes! New York: Signet Books.
</span> </span>. This may have been true of <span class="people">Condon</span> personally, but he asked me to examine
  only the most credible cases. I believe that he felt all UFO cases were “kooky,” and therefore the best way to shoot
  down the whole mess was to concentrate on the “best” cases.</p>
<p>Before I go on, I should point out that at no time during my work with the UFO Project was pressure of any kind
  brought to bear either on me or on Mrs. Hart. In the preparation of my chapter in the final report, including the
  conclusions thereof, I called all the shots. <a href="/time/1/9/6/8/CondonReport/s3/c5">Chapter 5, Section III</a>, of
  the final report appears, with two minor but significant exceptions that I shall describe presently, exactly as I
  wrote it.</p>

</figure>
<p>And so it was that in early <time>1968-07</time> I found myself—with Mrs. <span class="people">Hart</span> as a very
  capable assistant—a member of the University of Colorado UFO Project. I worked in the same room with Dr. Roy Craig, a
  full-time Project staff member as well a competent physical chemist and—for me— an invaluable source of information on
  the inner workings of the Project. Roy was a tall, slender, well-built man with dark hair. Although the photo of Dr.
  <span class="people">Craig</span> taken by Life magazine photographer <span class="people">Gerald Brimacombe</span> in
  <time>1967</time> shows him wearing heavy horn-rimmed glasses, he normally did not wear glasses when working indoors.
  He struck me as an intelligent, friendly person, and we had many interesting conversations while working together on
  the Colorado UFO Project.</p>
<p><span class="people">Roy Craig</span> had a mind like the proverbial steel trap and was a stickler for details. For
  example, he was careful to point out to me that the Air Force’s <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project
    Bluebook</a> Officer at that time, Major Hector Quintanilla Jr., did not pronounce his name as “keen-tuh-knee-yuh”
  in the usual Hispanic manner but rather had Angli- cized it to “kwin-tuh-nilla” (rhyming with “vanilla”). He offered
  the opinion that knowing this could prove useful should I ever chance to meet the man. Roy also had a strong
  inclination to be evenhanded in all matters and was always quick to give an opposing viewpoint if no one else offered
  one.</p>
<p>After a number of talks with Roy together with observations of my own, I came to the conclusion that Condon’s
  direction of the UFO Project was rather loose. It appeared to me that <span class="people">Condon</span> viewed the
  Project as a great ship headed inexorably toward a destination which he as captain could clearly see, with only an
  occasional order barked to the helmsman needed to keep her on course. During the time I worked on the Project I was to
  find ample confirmation of this picture.</p>
<p>In my second week there, I discovered the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Lakenheath">Lakenheath
  case</a> in the files (see <a href="/time/1/9/6/8/CondonReport/s3/c5">Section III, Chapter 5</a>, pp. 163-4, and <a
  href="/time/1/9/6/8/CondonReport/s4/c1">Section IV, Chapter 1</a>, pp. 248-256, of Scientific Study of Unidentified
  Flying Objects, Dr. Edward U. Condon, Project Director, <span class="people">Daniel S. Gillmor</span>, Editor; New
  York: Bantam Books, 1969). At that time the file consisted only of a letter written to the UFO Project by Forrest D.
  Perkins <span class="note"><span class="people">Forrest Perkins</span>’s name was carefully omitted from documentation about the Lakenheath case to protect his
  privacy. However, he has since died (on <time>1988-04-30</time>), so it is no longer necessary to omit his name.</span>,
  who had been the watch supervisor at Lakenheath on the night in question. A few days after I found this letter there
  was a general Project staff meeting chaired by Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> (the only one I can remember
  while I was there). During this meeting <span class="people">Condon</span> asked me if I had turned up anything
  significant. I replied that I had and related the events at Lakenheath as reported by Perkins. To my surprise <span
    class="people">Condon</span> appeared very disconcerted. Just then <span class="people">Roy Craig</span>—always the
  one to have both sides heard—pointed out that this report came from an unsupported letter written some twelve years
  after the event. Instantly <span
    class="people">Condon</span> relaxed. <q>In that case,</q> he growled, <q>I think we should publish it as an example
    of the sort of rubbish we get from people.</q> Frankly, I was shocked to hear such words coming from a renowned
  scientist like Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span>. I tried not to look as nonplused as I was by his remark.</p>
<p>As it turned out, it was a good thing that we did nothing of the sort. When we finally got copies of the official
  Bluebook files on the Lakenheath UFO case, they supported the letter we had received from Perkins in all major
  details. This episode revealed a great deal about Condon’s approach to the UFO question.</p>
<p>Obtaining the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> files on the Lakenheath case makes an
  interesting story in its own right. After discovering the letter from Forrest Perkins in the case files, I asked Roy
  Craig why there was no Blue Book report on the incident in the Project files. When Roy checked the correspondence
  files, he discovered that Bob Lowe had sent a request for the files to <span class="people">Hector Quintanilla</span>
  at Project Blue Book on <time>1968-03-06</time>, but nothing had ever been received from Blue Book on the case. Roy
  then submitted a second request. This time <span class="people">Quintanilla</span> sent us a small file on the case
  titled “IR-1-56,” which we received in <time>1968-07</time>. This brief report proved almost useless. We then
  submitted a third request for the Blue Book case files on the Lakenheath incident. The complete file, which included a
  document titled “BOI-485,” was received by the UFO Project in mid-<time>1968-09</time>—almost too late to be of any
  use (my draft chapter already had been submitted by then). The case files from Blue Book included a notation by <span
    class="people">Hector Quintanilla, Jr.</span>, that the formerly “Secret” documents had been declassified <q>under
    the authority of AFR 205-1 para 2-176 (ii)</q> on <time>1968-03-15</time>. <span class="people">Bob Low</span>e’s
  first request for the case files dated “3-6-68” was stapled to BOI-485. I suspected stonewalling by <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>’s Quintanilla, but Roy pooh-poohed the idea, saying
  that it was probably coincidence. Perhaps it was, but the timing was certainly close enough to appear suspicious.</p>
<p>Other than this fiasco, little of significance happened between that single staff meeting and the submission of my
  draft chapter for the final report. I worked seven weeks full time (Mrs. <span class="people">Hart</span>, about half
  that), at the end of which I submitted the draft of my chapter. During that time I had screened about 100 UFO reports
  and selected 35 for inclusion in the report (<a href="/time/1/9/6/8/CondonReport/s3/c5">Chapter 5: Optical and Radar
    Analysis of Field Cases</a>), most of them rated high in both credibility and “strangeness.” Rather surprisingly,
  seven of these cases—fully 20 percent of the total—had resisted my best attempts at explanation and remained
  “unidentified.” For the next several months I visited the Project sporadically on my own time, doing most of my
  revisions and editing at night.</p>
<p>When I received my draft chapter back from the typist, I noticed something rather strange. Everywhere that I had
  written “a UFO” the typist had rendered it as “an UFO.” This seemed senseless. I mentioned it to Roy Craig, and he
  told me that it had been done on Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span>’s express orders. Astonished, I asked him why.
  Roy, grinning broadly, replied, “He insists it must be pronounced ‘oofo’ because it rhymes with ‘goofy.’” Dr. <span
    class="people">Condon</span> took pains to point out this rather peculiar pronunciation of UFO on page nine of his
  summary in the final report, although he understandably avoided mentioning his reason for it. I should add that
  Condon’s view on this point was not shared by any of the other Project members. Telephones there were routinely
  answered, “You-foe Project.” I have never heard anyone else pronounce UFO as “oo-foe.”</p>
<p>Not long after this episode another strange thing happened. The Lakenheath case had to be written up in the Case
  Studies section of the report, and I had been selected to do the writing. When I received the type-up of my draft of
  this, I discovered that all the place names had been deleted and code letters (A, B, C, etc.) had been substituted for
  them. Once more I turned to Roy Craig to find out what was going on. Again, he told me that it was done at Dr.
  Condon’s direction, “to prevent nuts from using the Project cases for their own analyses.” I no longer recall whether
  Roy actually heard Condon say this or whether it was his own deduction. In either case, subsequent events showed that
  Roy was correct. Yet despite Condon’s dictum, the place names in my chapter (<a
    href="/time/1/9/6/8/CondonReport/s3/c5">">Section III, Chapter 5</a>) together with the place names on the map that
  goes with the Laken- heath case in Section IV, Chapter 1, somehow “slipped through.” The last time I saw Dr. Condon
  was in early <time>1969</time>. He was in his office in the JILA (Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics) Tower
  on the campus of the University of Colorado at Boulder, busy deleting these place names from the Bantam edition copy
  that was to be used as a “master” by Dutton for their hardcover edition, which I have never seen. It might be of
  interest to the reader to compare the Bantam and Dutton editions of the final report in this respect.</p>
<p>An electronic version of the so-called Condon Report has been published on-line by NCAS (the National Capital Area
  Skeptics), dated <time>1999</time>, with the permission of the Regents of the University of Colorado. It is based on
  the <q>original report as submitted to the Air Force in 1968,</q> and was obtained from the “University of Colorado
  Library System.” This version includes all of the place names that Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> so carefully
  removed from the copy that was used by Dutton for their hardcover edition of the report. <span class="note">The NCAS publication of the Condon Report is at the URL <a

    <figcaption>The author <time>~1968</time></figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>In retrospect, I am convinced that when Condon said <q>nuts</q>, he had in mind primarily the late Dr. <span
    class="people">James E. McDonald</span>, who was then an atmospheric physicist at the University of Arizona and an
    outspoken advocate of the theory that UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin. My experience was that McDonald’s name
    could not be mentioned in Condon’s presence without upsetting him.</p>
  <p><span class="people">James McDonald</span> was certainly a controversial figure, especially after he testified
    before Congress in <time>1968</time>, stating that <q>UFOs are entirely real</q> and possibly <q>are
      extraterrestrial devices.</q> A tall man, tending to be both dominating and abrasive, his oddly high-pitched
    speaking voice was incongruous with the rest of <span class="people">James E. McDonald</span> his demeanor. He was,
    however, a brilliant thinker and could analyze accurately the work of other scientists. Nevertheless, his obvious
    bias on the UFO question often seemed to lead him astray.</p>
  <p>The antagonism between <span class="people">Condon</span> and <span class="people">McDonald</span> is borne out by
    the following incident.</p>
  <p>In <time>1971-01</time>, about two years after working on the UFO Project, I was asked by Dr. <span
    class="people">Joachim P. Kuettner</span>, who was at that time chairman of the UFO Subcommittee of the <a
    href="/org/us/asso/AIAA.html">American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)</a>, to write up the
    Lakenheath case for the AIAA Journal <span class="note">My article on the Lakenheath case appeared as “<a
      href="/time/1/9/7/1/09/ThayerAiaaLakenheath">UFO Encounter
    II</a>” in the <time>1971-09</time> issue of Astronautics & Aeronautics. “<a
      href="/time/1/9/7/1/07/UfoEncounter1_AAAS">UFO Encounter I</a>” was written by Dr. <span
      class="people">McDonald</span> (on the same incident treated as case 103-b on pages 148-150 of the Bantam
    version of the Condon Report) and appeared in the <time>1971-07</time> issue of the same journal. The last time I
    looked at copies of these issues, in the library of New Mexico State University about <time>1984</time>, both articles had
    been razor-bladed out. Notoriety at last?</span>. Dr. <span class="people">Kuettner</span> was also an employee of
    ESSA at the time. We met in his office, which was in the same building where I worked. I found him to be a small,
    wiry, and very energetic man, with a good sense of humor. Despite a noticeable German accent he was easy to talk to
    and came across as an intelligent and effective scientist <span class="note">Born Joachim Küttner in Germany, he earned a PhD in <time>1939</time> and worked at Peenemünde under von Braun.
  He changed the spelling of his surname to <span class="people">Kuettner</span> upon immigrating to America after the war</span>.
    We liked each other right away, and I quickly agreed to do the article for the AIAA Journal.</p>
  <p>I called Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> later that night to ask his permission for access to the UFO case
    files, which had been put in the Norlin Library of the University of Colorado after the disbanding of the UFO
    Project. I was stunned when he told me, <q>They’re gone—I burned the damned things!</q> I no longer recall what
    reason he gave, but I was soon to discover what the real reason was. With the advantage of hindsight, I am now
    positive that Condon realized full well that whatever he told me that night would get back to McDonald.</p>
  <p>The next day when I told Dr. <span class="people">Kuettner</span> what had happened, he suggested that we ask <span
    class="people">Jim McDonald</span> for the loan of his copy of the Lakenheath file (Dr. McDonald had obtained
    permission from the Air Force to make copies of files in the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Bluebook</a>
    archives; he had copied the Lakenheath file, among a number of others). Since <span class="people">Kuettner</span>
    was acquainted with <span
      class="people">McDonald</span>, he agreed to do the talking on the phone. He placed the call, told Jim what we
    wanted, but when he told him what <span class="people">Condon</span> said he had done with the Project files,
    McDonald exploded. Kuettner winced, and I could not bear to listen. He refused to send us the file, saying among
    other things that he had been “underwhelmed” by my work on UFOs. <span class="people">Kuettner</span> and I both
    laughed when he relayed this comment to me; neither of us had ever heard the word “underwhelmed” before, and there
    is a good chance that McDonald may have coined it on the spot (it is now in fairly common usage). Afterwards, <span
      class="people">Kuettner</span> suggested waiting for McDonald to cool off and change his mind. He also said that
    he did not understand McDonald’s criticism of my work on UFOs, since I had, as he put it, “bent over backwards” to
    find conventional explanations for my cases yet still ended up with twenty percent of my cases unidentified.</p>
  <p>Later—just as Dr. <span class="people">Kuettner</span> had predicted—McDonald relented, called him back, and said
    that he would send a copy of the file for my use. He also explained why he had gotten so angry. He said that some
    time previously, he had asked Condon for permission to look through the Project case files, and Condon had told him
    that he would need to get permission from the Air Force. This proved difficult. Eventually, he did get the Air
    Force’s permission, and armed with a letter to this effect he showed up at Norlin Library to have a look at the
    files, only to be told by the librarian that Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> himself had come over to the
    library a few days earlier and removed the files in their entirety. Defeated, he returned to Tucson only to have
    <span
      class="people">Kuettner</span> call him now to say that <span class="people">Condon</span> had destroyed the
    files. It must have been quite apparent to McDonald that <span class="people">Condon</span> had done these things
    simply to frustrate him. Dr. McDonald sent me a copy of his Lakenheath file on <time>1971-02-08</time>, including a
    brief transmittal note in which he wrote in part:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>As I told Dr. <span class="people">Kuettner</span>, my initial reaction on the phone didn’t seem the appropriate
      one—despite my feeling, I have more than casual grounds for being a bit annoyed at this whole turn of events.</p>
    <p>s/s Jim / JEMcDonald</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>As an ironic footnote to this whole sorry affair, I found out about five years later that Condon was lying when he
    said he had burned the Project files. The UFO Project case files had been stored in the archives of the American
    Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where I believe they remain today.</p>
  <p>Sadly, Dr. <span class="people">McDonald</span> lived only four months after sending me a copy of the Lakenheath
    Blue Book case files. Despondent over family affairs, Jim shot himself to death in the desert near his Tucscon,
    Arizona, home on <time>1971-06-13</time>. He was just 51 years old.</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>However, these events may be viewed by the reader, it should be obvious by now that Dr. <span
    class="people">Condon</span> was not objective about UFOs, and objectivity is indispensable to good science.
    Nevertheless, one man does not make a project even if he is the scientific director. Of the thirty-six staff members
    (other than myself) listed in <a
      href="/time/1/9/6/8/CondonReport/s7/appndx-i.htm">Appendix X of the Condon Report</a>, I was acquainted with
    fourteen, nine of them from my Project experience and five of them professionally, outside of the UFO Project. In my
    judgment all of them were competent workers in their field, and all of them—with the two exceptions of Dr. <span
      class="people">Condon</span> and Bob Lowe (of the infamous “trick” memorandum)—did their level best to render a
    just and objective evaluation of the data available. Based on the contents of the final report, I have no reason to
    doubt the competence or objectivity of any of the others whom I do not know personally.</p>
  <p>The final report itself—the so-called Condon Report—stands or falls on its own merits. I believe that on the whole,
    and considering the resources and time available for its preparation, it is a commendable product. Aside from the
    introduction by Walter Sullivan (in the published versions) and the first two sections by Dr. Condon, which in my
    opinion are either trivia or nonsense, the report does represent the results of a scientific study. In particular,
    the “conclusions and recommendations” and summary sections by Condon bear so little resemblance to the contents of
    the report (as others before me have pointed out) that the reader who wishes to study the results of the UFO Project
    would do well to skip them entirely.</p>
  <p>Yet despite this the Condon Report settled nothing. Neither positive nor negative results were obtained. Should it
    have settled the question? I believe not. In the first place, the amount of the contract—originally $313,000—was
    pitifully inadequate. In 1966, this amount was roughly the same as the total annual budget of the small research
    group in which I normally worked. Had I been in Dr. Bean’s position, there is no way that I would have undertaken a
    task of that magnitude on a contract amounting to little more than one year’s budget. Even the final amount of the
    contract after the inevitable extensions—over $500,000—was still far too small. In terms of the realities of
    scientific research, trying to solve the UFO problem with a contract for a mere $500,000 is something like dumping a
    bucket of water into the ocean and then trying to measure the rise in sea level.</p>
  <p>In the second place, I am not at all sure that any amount of money would be sufficient to resolve the question. Of
    course, if the result is negative, proof is impossible. But even to demonstrate the probability of a result—positive
    or negative—is here a task of truly enormous proportions. As I once remarked to Roy Craig, it is like searching
    through dozens of haystacks, one of which may contain a needle. Even a budget of, say, twenty million dollars might
    well be tantamount to throwing away the money, but nothing much less than that would have any real possibility of
    success. And one can well imagine how difficult it would be to find a sponsor for such a project.</p>

  <p>The UFO Project has been history for some four decades now. The principal protagonist, Dr. Condon, and the
    principal antagonist, Dr. McDonald (or should it be the other way around?), are both dead and gone. The song is
    over, does the melody linger on?</p>
