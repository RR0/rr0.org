<h2>THE UFO COVER-UP by John Lear</h2>

The sun does not revolve around the earth. <p>

  The United States government has been in business with little gray extraterrestrials for about 20 years.</p>
<p>
  The first truth stated hero got Giordano Bruno burned at the stake in 1600 for daring to propose that it was real. The
  second truth has gotten far more people killed trying to state it publicly than will ever be known.</p>
<p>
  But the truth must be told. The fact that the earth revolves around the sun was successfully suppressed by the church
  for over 200 years. It eventually caused major upheaval in the church, government and thought. A realignment of social
  and traditional values. That was in the 1800's.</p>
<p>
  Now, about 400 years after the first truth was pronounced we must again face the shocking facts. The horrible truth;
  the government has been hiding from us over 40 years. Unfortunately "the horrible truth" is far more horrible than the
  government ever imagined.</p>
<p>
  in its effort to protect democracy our government sold us to the aliens. And here is how it happened. But before I
  begin I'd like to offer a word in the defense of those who bargained us away. They had the best of intentions .</p>
<p>
  Germany may have recovered a flying saucer in 1939 . General James H. Doolittle went to Sweden in 1946 to investigate
  report of 'ghost rockets' UFO's 1000's of which had been sighted over a 7 month period.</p>
<p>
  The "horrible truth was known by only a very few persons. they were indeed ugly little creatures, Shaped like praying
  mantises and who were more advanced than us by perhaps as much as a billion years. Of the original group that were the
  first to learn "the horrible truth" several committed suicide, the most prominent of which was Defense secretary James
  V. Forrestal who jumped to his death from a 16th story hospltal wlndow . Secy. Forrestal's medical records are sealed
  to this day.</p>
<p>
  President Truman qulckly put a lld on the secret and turned the screws so tight that the general public still think
  that flying saucers are a joke. Have- I ever got a surprise for them.</p>
<p>
  In 1947 President Truman established a group of 12 top military and scientific personnel of their time . They were
  known as MJ-12 . Although the group exists today, none of the original members are still alive. The last one to die
  was Gordon Gray, former Secretary of the Army, in l984. As each member passed away, the group itself appointed a new
  member to fill the position. There is some speculation that the group known ~s MJ-12 expanded to at least several more
  members.</p>
<p>
  There were several more saucer crashes in the late 1940's, one l.. Roswell, Now Mexico, one lnAztec, New Mexico and
  one near Loredo, Texas, about 30 miles inside the Mexican border.</p>
<p>
  Consider if you will the position of the United States government at that tame. They proudly thought of themselves the
  most powerful nation on earth having recently produced the atomic bomb, an achievement so stupendous that lt. would
  take Russians 4 years to catch up and only with the help traitors to democracy. They had built a jet aircraft that had
  exceeded the speed of sound in flight. They had bullet jet bombers with intercontinental range that could carry
  weapons of enormous destruction. The cold war ~ had brought economic prosperity and the future- seemed bright. Now
  imagine what lt. was like for those men. Orson Wells radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds" in 1938. Thousands of
  Americans panicked at a realistically presented invasion of earth of beings from another planet. Imagine their horror
  as they actually viewed the dead bodies of those frightening looking little creatures with enormous eyes, reptilian
  skin and claw like fingers. Imagine their shock as they attempted to determine how these strange saucers were powered
  and could discover no part even remotely similar to components they were familiar with no cylinders or pistons, no
  vacuum tubes or turbines, The stories are legendary on transporting crashed saucers over long distances, moving only
  at night, purchasing complete farms, slashing through forests, blocking major highways, sometimes driving 2 and 3
  lo-boys in tandem with an extraterrestrial load a hundred feet in diameter</p>
<p>
  On April 25, 1964, the first official communication between these aliens and the U S Government took place at Holloman
  Air Force Base in New Mexico 3 saucers landed ~t ~ pre-arranged area and a meeting was held between the aliens and
  intelligence officers of the U S Government</p>
<p>
  During the late 60's or early 70's MJ-12 representing the U.S. Government made a deal with those creatures called
  EBE's (extra-terrestrial biological entities, named by Detley Bronk,origlnal MJ-12 member and 6th president of Johns
  Hopklns University) The 'deal' was that in exchange for 'technology' that they would provide to us we agreed to
  'ignore' the abductions that were going on and suppress information on the cattle mutilations The EBE's assured MJ-12
  that the abductions (usually lasting about 2 hours) were merely the ongoing monitoring of developing civilizations</p>
<p>

  In fact, the purposes for the abductions turned out to b-</p>
<p>
  (1) Insertion of 3 mm spherical device through the nasal cavity of the abductee into the brain. The device is used for
  the biological monitoring, tracking and control of the abductee. (2) Implementation of post hypnotic suggestion to
  carry out a specific activity during a specific tame period, the actuation of which wall occur within the next 2 to 5
  years</p>
<p>

  (3) Termination of some people so that they could function as living sources for biological material and
  substances</p>
<p>

  (4) Termination of individuals who represent a threat to the continuation of their activity.</p>
<p>

  (5) Effect genetic engineering experiments.</p>
<p>

  (6) Impregnation of human females and early termination of pregnancies to procure the crossbred infant.</p>
<p>
  The U.S. Government was not aware of the far reaching consequences of their deal. They were lead to believe that the
  abductions were essentially benign and since they figured the abductions would probably go on anyway whether or not
  they agreed, they merely insisted that a current list of abductees be submitted, on a periodic basis to MJ-12 and the
  National Security Council. Does this sound incredible ? An actual list of abductions to the National Security Council?
  Reed on, because I have news for you</p>
<p>
  The EBE's have a genetic disorder in that their digestive system is atrophied and not functional Some speculate that
  they were involved in some type of accident or nuclear war, or possibly on the back side of an evolutionary genetic
  curve. In order to sustain themselves they use an enzyme or hormonal secretion obtained from the tissue that they
  extract from humans and animals. (Note: cows and humans are genetically similar. In the event of a national disaster
  cow hemoglobin can be used by humans.)</p>
<p>
  The secretions obtained are then mixed with hydrogen peroxide and applied on the skin by spreading or dipping part of
  their bodies in the solution. The body absorbs the solution then excretes the waste back through the skin. The cattle
  mutilations that were prevalent throughout the period from 1973 to 1983 and publicly noted through newspaper and
  magazine stories and included a documentary produced by Linda Howe for the Denver CBS affiliate , were for the
  collection of those tissues by the aliens. The mutilations included genitals taken, rectums cored out to the colon,
  eyes, tongue and throat all surgically removed with extreme precision. In some cases the incisions were made by
  cutting between the cells, a process we are not yet capable of performing in the field. In many of the mutilations
  there was no blood found at all in the carcass, yet there was no vascular collapse of the internal organs. This has
  been also noted in the human mutilations, one of which was Sgt. Jonathan P. Louotte at the White Sands Missile Test
  Range in 1956 who was found three days after on Air Force Major had witnessed his abduction by a 'disk shaped' object
  at 0300 while on a search for missile debris downrange. His genitals had been removed, rectum cored out in a
  surgically precise 'plug' up to the colon, eyes removed and all blood removed with again, no vascular collapse. &gt;From
  some of the evidence lt. is apparent that this surgery is accomplished in most cases while the victim, animal or human
  is still alive.</p>
<p>
  The various parts of the body are taken to various underground laboratories one of which is known to be near the small
  New Mexico town of Dulce. This jointly occupied (CIA-alien) facility has been described as enormous with huge tiled
  walls that 'go on forever'. Witnesses have reported huge vats filled with an amber liquid with parts of human bodies
  being stirred inside.</p>
<p>
  After the initial agreement, Groom Lake, one of this nation's most secret test centers,was closed for a period of
  about a year sometime between 1972 and 1974, and a huge underground facility constructed for and with the help of the
  EBE's. The bargained for technology was set in place but could only be operated by the EBE's themselves. Needless to
  say, the advanced technology could not be used against the EBE's themselves in case of need.</p>
<p>
  During the period between 1979 and 1983 lt. became increasingly obvious to MJ-12 that things were not going as
  planned. It became known that many more people in the thousands) were being abducted than were listed on the official
  abduction lists. In addition it became obvious that some, not all, but some of the nations missing children had been
  used for secretions and other parts required by the aliens.</p>
<p>
  According to some, there was an altercation between the U.S. military and the aliens at the Dulce laboratory. A
  special armed forces unit was called in to try and free a number of our people trapped in the facility who had become
  aware of what was really going on. According to one source 66 of the soldiers were killed in the effort and our people
  were not freed.</p>
<p>
  By 1983, MJ-12 must have been in stark terror at the mistake they had made in dealing with the EBE's. They had subtly
  influenced through Dr. Hynek, formerly with the Blue Book project, who had allegedly broken ties with the Air Force in
  the late 60's but who in reality continued to be their informant in his cover capacity of Director of the Center for
  UFO Studies) "Close Encounters of the Third kind" and "E.T." (now admitted by some members of MJ-12 to have been a
  'drastic mistake') to get the public used to "odd looking" aliens that were compassionate, benevolent and very much
  our "space brothers". MJ-12 had, in effect, 'sold' the EBE's to the public, and were now faced with the fact that
  quite the opposite was true. In addition, a plan had been formulated in 1968 to make the public aware of the existence
  of aliens on earth over the next 20 years to be culminated with several documentaries to be released during the
  1985-1987 period of tame. These documentaries would explain the history and intentions of the EBE's . The discovery of
  the "Grand Deception" put the entire plans, hopes and dreams of MJ-12 into utter confusion and panic.</p>
<p>
  Meeting at the "Country Club", ~ remote lodge with private golf course, comfort- able sleeping and working quarters
  and its own private airstrip bullet by and ex- exclusively for the members of MJ-12, lt. was a factional fight of what
  to do now. Part of MJ-12, which had now become military top-heavy, wanted to confess the whole scheme and shambles lt.
  had become to the public, beg their forgiveness and ask for their support. The other part (and majority) of MJ-12
  argued that there was no way they could do that, that the situation was untenable and there was no use in exciting the
  public with the 'horrible truth' and that the best plan was to continue the development of a weapon or plan of
  containment' that could be used against the EBE's under the guise of "SDI" the so-called Strategic Defense Initiative
  which had nothing whatever to do with a defense for inbound Russian nuclear missiles. In fact, the real definition of
  purpose for SDI reads " The plotting, tracking and acquisition of articles in deep space." As these words are being
  written, Dr. Edward Teller, 'father' of the H-bomb is personally in the nuclear test tunnels of the Nevada Test Site,
  driving his workers and associates in the words of one, 'like a man possessed'. And well he should be for Dr. Teller
  is a member of MJ-12 along with Dr. Kissinger, Admiral Tobby Inman, General Lew Allen to name a few members of
  MJ-12.</p>
<p>
  Before the "Grand Deception" was discovered and according to a meticulous plan of release of information to the
  public, several documentaries and video tapes were made. William Moore, a Burbank, California based UFO researcher who
  wrote "The Roswell Incident a book published in 1980 that detailed the crash, recovery and subsequent cover-up of a
  UFO with 4 alien bodies has a video tape of 2 newsman interviewing a military officer associated with MJ-12. This
  military officer answers questions relating to the history of MJ-12 ant the cover-up, the recovery of a number of
  flying saucers ant the existence of a live alien (one of 3 living aliens captured and designated or named EBE-l, EBE-2
  and EBE-3 being held in a facility designated as YY-II at Los Alamos, New Mexico. The only other facility of this
  type, which is electromagnetically secure, is at Edwards Air Force Base in Mohave, California). The officer names
  names as previously mentioned plus a few others: Harolt Brown, Richard Helms, Gen. Vernon Walters, Dr. Lew Allen and
  Dr. Theodore von Karman to name a few of the current and past members of MJ- 1 2 .</p>
<p>
  The officer also relates the fact that the EBE's claim to have created Christ. The EBE's have a type of recording
  device that has recorded all of earth's history and can display it in the form of a hologram. This hologram can be
  filmed but because of the way holograms work does not come out very clear on movie film or video tape. The crucifixion
  of Christ on the Mount of Olives has allegedly been put on film to show the public. The EBE's claim to have created
  Christ, which, in view of the "Grand Deception" could be on effort to disrupt traditional values for un- determined
  reasons.</p>
<p>
  Another video tape allegedly in existence is an interview with an EBE. Since EBE's communicate telepathically an Air
  Force colonel serves as an interpreter. Just before the recent stock market crash several newsmen including Bill Moore
  had</p>
<p>
  been invited to Washington, D.C. to personally film the EBE in a similar type interview and distribute the film to the
  public. Apparently, because of the market crash, it was felt the timing was not propitious. In any case it certainly
  seems like an odd method to inform the public of extraterrestrials, but it would be in keeping with the actions of a
  panicked organization who at this point in time didn't know which way to turn.</p>
<p>
  Moore is also in possession of more Aquarius documents a few pages of which leaked out several years ago and detailed
  the supersecret NSA project which had been denied by them until just recently. In a letter to Senator John Glenn NSA's
  Director of Policy Julia B. Wetzel wrote, "Apparently there is or was an Air Force project by that name Aquarius)
  which dealt with UFO's. Coincidentally, there is also an NSA project by that name." NSA's project Aquarius deals
  specifically with the 'communications with aliens' (the EBE's). Within the Aquarius program was project 'Snowbird' a
  project to test fly A recovered alien aircraft at Groom Lake, Nevada. This project continues today at that location.
  In the words of an individual who works at Groom Lake 'our people are much better at taking things apart than they are
  at putting them back together'. Another saw a saucer being trucked into the Nevada Test Site in March of 1988. Still
  another informant witnessed a saucer being buried at that location (for God knows whatever reason) during the second
  week of August 1988.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  If the government felt they were being forced to acknowledge the existence of aliens on earth because of the
  overwhelming evidence such as the Hudson Valley sightings during the past 4 years, the Wythevllle, Va. sightings in
  October and November of 1987, the Gulf Breeze, Florlda sightings in which documentary evidence in the form of
  stereoscopic photographs and video tape were taken between November of 1987 and May of l988, the Lake Superior
  sightings of 1987 and the sightings in and around Las Vegas, Nevada and the Nevada Test Site, and taking into
  consideration the "Grand Deception" and obviously hostile intent of the EBE's it might be expedient for MJ-12 to admit
  to the EBE's but conceal the information on the mutilations and abductions of humans and animals.</p>
<p>
  The enormity of the problem must be driving more than a few 'at the top' to drink. But what about the rest of us? Most
  of those reporting sightings are being viciously ridiculed by government sponsored 'debunkers' such as Philip Klass,
  former Avionics editor for Aviation Week and Space Technology, NASA scientist James Oberg and a host of others. When
  the truth does emerge, fl lt. ever does, how is this shabby, dishonest treatment of totally sane, normal and patriotic
  citizens going to be justified ?</p>
<p>
  Now you ask, "Why haven't I heard about any of this?" Who do you think you would hear it from? Dan Rather? Tom Brokaw?
  Sam Donaldson? Wrong. These people just read the news. They don't find lt. They have ladies that call and</p>
<p>
  interview witnesses and verify statements on stories coming over the wire either AP or UPI. It's not like Dan Rather
  would go down to Wytheville, Virginia and dig into why there were 4000 reports of sightings in October and November of
  1987. Better that Tom Brokaw or someone else should risk their credibility on this type of story. Tom Brokaw ? Tom
  wants Sam Donaldson to risk his credibility. No one. ..but no one is going to risk their reputation on such outlandish
  ideas regardless of how many people report sightings of 900 foot objects running them off the road. In the case of the
  Wythevllle, VA. sightings,dozens of vans with NASA lettered on the side failed to interest newsmen. And those that
  asked questions were informed that NASA was doing a weather survey.</p>
<p>
  Well then you ask what about our scientists...what about Carl Sagan? Isaac Asimov? Arthur C. Clarke? Wouldn't they
  have known? If Carl Sagan knows, then he is committing a great fraud through the solicitation of memberships in the
  Planetary Society, 'to search for extraterrestrial intelligence'. Another charade into which the U.S. Government dumps
  millions of dollars every year is the radiotelescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico operated by Cornell University with,
  guess who, Carl Sagan. Cornell University is ostensibly searching for signals from outer space, a sign maybe, that
  somebody is out there. Its hard to believe that relatively intelligent astronomers like Sagan could be so stupid.</p>
<p>

  What about Isaac Asimov? Surely the most prolific science fiction writer of</p>
<p>
  all time would have guessed by now that there must be an enormous cover-up. One current hypothesis is that, on the
  available evidence, it appears that the EBE's are trying to regenerate their own species at our expense. They have
  apparently suffered either some kind of nuclear holocaust or they may be on the back side of a bell-shaped
  evolutionary curve where in essence they are 'devolving' instead of evolving. In any case, according to several
  autopsies of aliens that have leaked out, the EBE's have an atrophied digestive system and other physical problems.
  This would account for their attempts to cross- breed with us as outlined in 'Intruders' by Budd Hopkins (a detailed
  study of an Indianapolis woman who, over several years produces 7 cross-breed alien children none of whom she was
  allowed to keep. Not that she wanted to.)</p>
<p>
  Whatever the answer these facts are indisputable. The extent and number of persons reported missing every year is a
  closely guarded government secret. (Since 1980 at least 20,000 children have been reported missing each year.) Cattle
  mutilations (over 14,000 since 1973) are regarded officially by the gov- ernment as 'a hoax'. Human abductions are
  officially regarded by the government as a 'hoax' . The latest polls show that 88X of all Americans believe that
  intelligent life on other planets is probable and that over 20 million Americans have seen what they believed to be a
  UFO. But the U.S. Government officially dismisses 'flying saucers' as a 'hoax'. What do you think?</p>
<p>
  The best advice I can give you is next time you see a flying saucer and are awed by its obvious display of technology
  and gorgeous lights of pure color:</p>
<p>

  RUN LIKE HELL</p>

<a name="update">Update on Current Events</a>
<p>

  A Public Briefing given by John Lear May 14,1990 Las Vegas</p>
<p>
  What I'm going to do today is just bring you up to date on some of the stuff that I know that's going on. Obviously,
  if you came here today, you know that what they call the phenomenon is real - it's going on. It's very frightening. I
  don't have to convince anybody here about what's going on, so instead of going through the usual background of all of
  this I'll just start off with a list of what's been happening in the last six months - the stuff that I know that's
  going on.</p>
<p>
  To start with, I'd like to start with the issue of missing children. If anyone was at the Bud Hopkins talk at the
  Spring Valley Library, you will remember that Bud has always made a point of saying:</p>
<p>
  My field is abductions, that's all I do, I don't get into any of the other research, I'm not qualified on it, I
  haven't done the research and so I just stick with abductions. By the way, the Meier case was A fraud, the Adamski
  case was a fraud, there's no missing children and Bob Lazar is a fraud.</p>
<p>
  Bud's a nice guy but he speaks of things that he doesn't know anything about. The Adamski case WAS true. I know it
  because I talked with the CIA guy that went down to interview him. he was down there for a couple of days and they
  told him enough that there's no doubt that Adamski had all the experiences that he talked about.</p>
<p>

  As far as the Meier case, when I first got into what they call</p>
<p>
  UFOlogy I was told that the Meier case was a fraud, the pictures were faked,etc. I really believed that, and on one of
  the first George Knapp interviews that I did I said that the Meier case was a fraud. After about a year, I started
  checking around to make sure I was on firm ground. I called all the guys I knew in the field and asked them what their
  best evidence was that Meier was a fraud. They would say things like, Oh, uh somebody else said that. Then you trace
  it further and no one seemed to know who was the one that started it. There was a lot of talk that the photos were
  hoaxed and that he had models in his garage....the bottom line is that there was no evidence that it was a fraud. In
  fact, Lazar worked on a machine identical to one of the craft in the Meier photos.</p>
<p>
  As far as Lazar is concerned, Hopkins said don't believe what government scientists tell you . I have been involved in
  the Lazar case for about two years and there's no question in my mind that everything he says happened up there
  actually happened. There are a number of things that happened to him that we're not telling the public, and with good
  reason. First of all, they wouldn't believe it, and secondly it would not really add that much more to the case. Bud
  was on a little shaky ground there. As far as the missing children issue is concerned Hopkins, in order to prove his
  case, looked around the audience at the Spring Valley Library (about 250 people) and asked "does anybody here know of
  A missing child?". Of course, no one raised their hand and he said, "I rest my case". That's patently ridiculous.
  There are quite a number of missing children. There's an interesting book out called "A Good Night's Story". I heard
  about it from Bob Oechsler, head of the MUFON section in Maryland, and the story is printed like a children's book and
  it's about children being abducted. Copies are going into every library and school. It has nothing to do with aliens
  or anything, but if child abductions is not a big problem, why the wide distribution of the book? There is a telephone
  number that you can call to order the book, 1-800-444-BLUE. I don't know what's behind it.</p>
<p>
  I'd like to talk a little about Dulce. The question is "is this true, does Dulce exist?" I like to have four
  independent confirmations about whatever I look into. The forth confirmation came in several months ago from an
  aerospace engineer who worked for the Air Force, mainly in designing aircraft and rockets. He was deeply involved in
  the Space Shuttle program. He said "yes, that in fact he had been at Dulce, that it exists". he visited the facility
  for something other than genetic engineering. The name that he knew it by WAS "Section B". So Dulce does exist. About
  six months ago, <a href="../../../../../../../../people/v/ValdezGabrielL/index.html">Gabe Valdez</a>' brother found
  some of the aboveground ventilation shafts for the base on the top of Mount Archeleta. There were going to wait until
  the snow clears, which is just about now, before attempting to investigate further. I understand that the ducts were
  rectangular, horizontal, and about 30 feet wide. One of the guys that worked on the Meier video did some very
  sophisticated frequency analysis of the area and he said "whatever is under there puts out energy of a city the size
  of New York. There's just all kinds of stuff going on under there. That's the update on Dulce.</p>
<p>
  As far as the Greys are concerned, there are all types of Greys. They are definitely cybernetic organisms . They are
  not a species' themselves. They work for someone else. There are several different levels of them. There are many
  instances that indicate that they don't function independently by themselves. They operate from higher orders.</p>
<p>
  In one particular abduction case, somebody had grabbed one and by the movements of the arms they could see that the
  Gray had been programmed to fend off an attack by moving its arms in a certain way. All it really had to do was turn
  around and back away. It points out that they are being programmed.</p>
<p>
  I would like to cover the incident where the astronauts were supposed to have said that they had an alien spaceship in
  visual contact. Apparently after very thorough research by Bob Oechsler and his group in Maryland, it turns out that
  this transmission was sent from a 12 square mile area which included CIA headquarters and the NSA facility at Fort
  George Meade. Apparently it was a test of some kind to see if the public would bite". I really don't know what it was,
  but that's the area that it was sent from. It was a very sophisticated transmission. It was Blaha's voice, but it was
  not coming from the Discovery. I thought that was interesting.</p>
<p>
  I would like to briefly talk about Bill Cooper. George Knapp did a very brutal 20 minutes about Cooper. There are a
  number of things that are very suspicious about Bill, but I would like to tell you that I believe that Bill Cooper did
  have access to information in 1973 when he was in the Navy, and that the information did include some information
  about some of the dealings with the aliens. It was my understanding when I first met Bill, that when he was stationed
  at Pearl Harbor he had the key to a classified area. He would go in there at night and read some of these briefings.
  That's what he told me. Later on, he started saying that he was part of an intelligence briefing team. I don't think
  he was; at least that's not what he told me. Also, in the beginning he limited his verification of what I was saying
  by saying " Look, I can only support 50% of what you 're saying It later became 150%. Nothing is black or white - it's
  all shades of Gray. Cooper did have access to some information in 1973, but not as much as he would like you to
  believe he did. You can take that for what it 's worth. He has done some very strange things. He has threatened me on
  at least four occasions. He thinks that I'm with the agency and involved in disinformation, so that's his deal.</p>
<p>
  The other day, a guy came up to my house who was out in the forest with Charles Halt the very first night of the
  Bentwaters incident that something landed. There was a rectangular object that landed, and he actually jumped on top
  of it. He said he could look down inside the object . He has never made any public statement at all . I never thought
  that I would ever get to meet him. He did in fact confirm that the incident did in fact happen.</p>
<p>
  As far as an update on AIDS is concerned, AIDS was developed by the Navy in 19l2. The specific doctor that developed
  it was a doctor by the name of R.M. Donner. The initial AIDS research was financed by Congress. July 1, 1969 is when
  they had the hearings. This is a copy of the DOD appropriations report for 1970 (Ed note: See July 90 Leading Edge).
  It was chaired by Robert Sykes. The testimony reveals exactly what they wanted - a biological virus for which there
  was no known immunity. They finally got it developed in 1972 and started doing experiments. The biggest experiment was
  in 1977/78 when they released it in Africa, which is now lOO% infected. In the United States in 1978/79 AIDS was
  released to the white male homosexual population through the Hepatitis B vaccine. The reason they wanted to start with
  the white male homosexual population was that they wanted to get it to spread very quickly, and they thought that
  people would not worry about it if they thought that only drug abusers or homosexuals were involved. That 's what
  happened. The Navy goal WAS to infect 75% of the worlds population by April of 1991. Those are from top classified
  government documents. What's interesting is that by the present rate of infection, 75% of the population will not be
  infected by the April 91 target, so what we're looking at is other ways the government may have of spreading this
  disease. I am kind of happy I don't live in California, where those helicopters are flying up and down spraying for
  the Medfly. Whitley Streiber. I heard the other day that he's become a recluse, that he's destroyed emotionally by the
  reception of Communion and his second book Majestic, even though it's an excellent book and I would recommend it to
  anyone who wants a good outline on what the Government did in 194l when they recovered the saucer at Roswell. It's an
  excellent book. One of the interesting things about the book is the two autopsy reports in the back. They are
  absolutely the truth. I don't know where he got those - the original reports about the two aliens. Whitley used to
  call me all the time in the middle of the night and chat for two or three hours up until about a year ago.</p>

  A little more about Bob Oechsler. Oechsler has done a lot of research in the Chesapeake Bay area. There's really
  something big going on there. Basically, it appears the HQ of MJ-12 is back on Kent Island or somewhere back there. A
  lot of EMP research and engineering is going on. A lot of underground activity - all kinds of stuff. What's
  interesting is that about a year ago he ran into Admiral Inman, who is supposedly one of the MJ-12 members. Bob
  stopped him and asked to be put in touch with somebody in MJ-12. Inman took Bob's card and looked at him with kind of
  a half smile and said, let me see what I can do." About 6 months later he called and set up a meeting for Oechsler to
  go and see General Stafford, who is head of some kind of organization at the Pentagon. Oechsler went to see him and
  went down some ramps under the Pentagon and into this one corridor where he was required to walk through what he
  thought was a metal detector, but when he walked through it he felt real dizzy and walked in Staffords office still
  kind of reeling from this thing. He asked Stafford, "what in the world was that?". Stafford said, don't worry about
  it, I had a headache for six weeks after first going through that thing". Bob had a lot of strange things happen to
  him. Supposedly in September 90, there is going to be another release of government information about UFOs or aliens.
  Here we go again. Supposedly Oechsler's going to be a part of it. Supposedly they're going to show a saucer and a dead
  body. I've heard that so many times I don't believe it. Oechsler is supposedly being briefed on some of the things the
  government is doing. He was sent down to Ellington AFB near Houston and shown a government research laboratory that we
  have down there that was 40 feet long, 20 feet wide and it was a zero gravity chamber. It has a very bright light at
  the top and everybody was floating. Oechsler is not quite sure where this lab is. He was taken there in a black
  helicopter that did not look like any of the helicopters we have in inventory. It was very smooth and looked like it
  WAS molded in one piece. Oechsler said that it sounded like a helicopter until it was 25 feet off the ground and then
  there was dead silence. He didn't hear a thing. He estimates that it was near Pensacola where there was a large
  platform and a number of buildings. He was taken into the building and shown the primary SDI facility, which was a
  great big room, and suspended on the ceiling was a 25'x25' three dimensional video "presentation". On it was
  represented the southeastern portion of the United States and then there was a grid pattern that came up to what was
  represented as 300,000 feet. There were "vortexes" represented here and there in the gridwork. There were little dots
  labeled "ASC's". We don't know what that means. You could see flights of some type enter these "vortex~ areas and
  apparently go underground, but if one went down in a different area, it would split up into eight blips. Interesting.
  There were only men in there, no woman. Everybody had on black pants with a white shirt buttoned up to the collar with
  a tie. No one smiled. Oechsler doesn't know what the place was. He was just shown it and given no other information.
  He tried to get in touch with General Stafford after that, but so far no luck.</p>
<p>
  The aerospace engineer that I spoke of confirmed that Dulce existed and that we do have a base on the Moon. I have
  several other sources that confirm the base on the Moon. They go there regularly. I don't know what they do there, but
  it does exist. He also confirmed the existence of the base on Mars. It's already there.</p>
<p>
  I have come up with some information during the past month about the Challenger accident from an individual who has
  worked at Cape Kennedy for a number of years. Apparently, the Challenger was blown up by the Russians. It was a KGB
  unit that did it. They did it using 1l Libyans who had access to the protected areas. An explosive charge was put on
  the strut that held the SRB to the main fuel tank and it ignited, banging the SRB against the fuel tank. It was the
  only launch were all the Russian trawlers pulled out several hundred miles into the ocean away from the Cape. There
  was also a video and radio link that was held aloft by a balloon, and the night before the launch the cable was cut so
  they couldn't get any pictures on launch day of the SRB strut area. There were also a number of other things that
  happened. Apparently, the Soviet Chernobyl incident was caused by the United States in retaliation for the Challenger
  indecent. Now I am looking into that, and I will let you know what I find out.</p>
<p>
  I went to a very interesting talk by Bill Hamilton, who's here to- night, and after the talk we went on a very
  interesting mission to check out the Lockheed skunk works near Los Angeles. This skunk works has done a lot of secret
  of work. As you've read in the papers, they're moving Lockheed to Georgia to do a lot of the work down there. They are
  also closing down the plant at Burbank, saying that they Are going to move it down to Palmdale, but we think they are
  moving operations to the Tehachapi mountain area, where there already is an underground facility in the western
  portion of the Antelope Valley. There was a lot of activity going on there. We think that saucer craft are being
  produced at this underground facility using other types of technology. Bill is here today and brings the information
  that the silo doors at this so-called "Tehachpi Ranch" have been seen to open and a saucer shaped craft has flown out
  of it. I would have like to have seen that Sunday night.</p>
<p>
  The other day I was over Bob Lazar's house and we were looking through a classified book on nuclear bomb technology up
  until 1960, and we were discussing how many bombs have been exp1oded in space. Up until 1960 there were at least four.
  The first one was in August 1958 and was called TEAK. It was A hydrogen bomb exploded 252,000 feet over Johnston
  Island. What's interesting about this is that I don't think</p>
<p>
  we had that kind of capability" in those days of launching things like that. I took out my Jane's "All the Worlds
  Spacecraft And went back and found out that after Sputnik was launched we had ( as far as the public was concerned)
  quite an effort to get something up there ourselves. that Was the Redstone and Vanguard rockets. It turns out that the
  first launch was successful but every one after that failed. We just couldn't get anything off the ground. All that
  stuff was just a ruse, because a year later we were launching hydrogen bombs over Johnston Island that weighed two
  tons. The public was told that we couldn't even get a three pound object into space. Apparently there was a classified
  launch facility in the Pacific.</p>
<p>
  With regard to the South African incident, it appears that it was a hoax perpetrated by James Van Gruenen, who has A
  history of hoaxes. We don't know what the final outcome was. Van Gruenen even offered one producer a chance to meet an
  alien from the Space Council. This producer contacted me and I told him to check Van Gruenen's background.</p>
<p>
  I got a call from Linda Howe a couple days ago, and she told me that there WAS A discussion by VP Quayle about
  reorienting the SDI toward shooting down an incoming asteroid and that it was in a paper. She's supposed to send me
  the article. What is interesting is that we've heard this story for the last two or three years About an incoming
  asteroid. It's obviously under intelligent control, it's putting out radio emissions. Supposedly it's on the edge of
  the solar system now, heading this way. I have at least three confirmations that it does exist. The code name is
  supposedly Wormwood. One of the confirmations came from a friend of s guy in the CIA. They were out one night and the
  CIA guy was drinking heavily And was very depressed. His friend asked him what the matter was, asking "is it the thing
  that is coming in from space?. The agency guy dropped his glass and said, how do you know about that?. That's one of
  them. If we are reorienting SDI in that way, that opens a lot of questions about what is going on.</p>

<h2>'Lear Text' Discrepancies by Craig McCann</h2>

January 31, 1988<p>

  I've read LEAR.TXT several times to get the full impact of its contents.</p>
<p>
  The first time, I read it on-line and was quite shaken by the implications of the article as I let it scroll by. Since
  the text was captured to a disk file I was able to re-read it more carefully and am now "skeptically open minded". I
  say open minded because I believe this universe is teaming with life at different stages of development and
  interstellar travel is most likely a technical matter for the most advanced life forms.</p>
<p>
  My skepticism arises because although the article is smoothly written (in spite of several spelling and grammatical
  errors) it seems like a collage of tabloid sensationalism woven together with a few real names, places, and historical
  events to give it more credibility. Adding to my disbelief are a few nagging questions that come to mind:</p>
<p>

</p>
<ol>
  <li> This one has already been mentioned by you, Brad. How did 'advanced' beings that have no apparent regard for
    other intelligent life survive their technical ability to destroy themselves?
  </li><li> Why haven't they used their superior technological and medical expertise to synthesize the required enzymes
  instead of hacking and slashing other intelligent life forms?
</li><li> They 'invented' Jesus Christ? The intent of Jesus Christ was a message of love, universal harmony, and
  brotherhood. Obviously not the intent of these EBEs (if they exist).
</li><li> Their technology can 'record all earth history' but their crafts are crashing with no recovery plan of their
  own. Why would they allow our scientists to examine them and then deny the use of 'bargained for technology'?
</li><li> A 'well planned invasion'? It would be more sensible for this type of being to crush us back into the stone
  age and then harvest and take what they want. To allow us technology at all would be a dangerous move. No tech - no
  SDI!!
</li><li> An enormous saucer was buried at a crash site where it remains to this day? Whatever happened to disassembly
  and examination?

</li><li> Because a stock market correction took place a decision to postpone a public announcement about the EBEs was
  made? Forgive me, but I find this to be senseless. If the EBEs exist as this document describes, an upheaval in the
  financial markets would certainly follow any credible announcement of this type no matter how healthy they were prior
  to the announcement.
</li></ol>
<p>Etc......etc....(yes, I could go on a bit more, but.....) Mr. Lear, the next time you want to 'inform' me you don't
  have to start off with intimidating inferences to my possible gullibility and load your article with sensational
  verbiage that any tabloid would be proud of. Stick closer to the facts, than you. Nuff said...-C.M.</p>
