<p>Congrès européen sur les AAP, Bruxelles 11 au 19 novembre 1988</p>
<p>By Michel Figuet</p>
<p>presented by Jacques Scornaux</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>At least some of the criticisms addressed to ufology since some years (1) are well-founded, and we have learned from
  them that it was necessary to review our attitude towards existing cases and investigations. We have to "purify" our
  files, and I have begun to do it, because we can no longer afford the risk of working on valueless cases. It is of no
  use, and it is like offering a present to debunkers, who will eagerly and easily destroy them. The best approach is
  therefore to apply immediately, both to new cases and to already investigated and published ones, a set of criteria
  for selecting the hardest cases, what we call in French "cas béton" (béton = concrete). I therefore suggest that my
  FRANCAT file of French close encounters (2) be revised in the light of the criteria defined hereafter.</p>
<h2>Rationale of the criteria</h2>
<p>Why develop a new set of criteria ? It appeared that the conventional methods for selecting hard cases, like <a
    href="/people/p/PoherClaude/index.html">Claude Poher</a>'s credibility-strangeness graph, were not severe enough,
  for cases that have since been explained, or that appear now very dubious, passed this kind of tests.</p>
<p>That is the reason why an informal group of French and Belgian ufologists, to which I collaborated, found it
  necessary to establish a new set of extremely strict criteria. The hardest cases will not necessarily be the greatest
  "classics", which were often not or ill investigated and whose reputation may be overstated. It is therefore possible
  that many cases considered as "classical" will not pass the criteria. Generally speaking, this selection method will
  quite surely lead to eliminate a great many cases as "waste" or "noise". It notably appears more severe than the one
  used by Dr <a href="/people/s/SmithWilly/index.html">Willy Smith</a> for UNICAT : indeed, many cases included in
  UNICAT would not reach a high mark. It is quite possible that some cases will be unduly rejected, but the authors of
  these new criteria believe it is better to wrongly exclude potentially hard cases than to wrongly include explainable
  cases. What really matters is that that will remain will be very solid.</p>
<p>In fact, the aim of these criteria is to isolate cases, even if their number is very small, that would testify with a
  high degree of certainty to the existence of at least one original phenomenon (whatever it may be) having a physical
  component. Thus the criteria are designed so as to eliminate the main causes of confusion and to give some assurance
  about the witnesses' reliability and the investigation completness : they concern the phenomenon features (B to D),
  the sighting conditions (E to J), the witnesses (K and L) and the investigation (M to Q).</p>
<p>Even if no case would satisfy all criteria, no radically sceptical conclusion would be allowed, because it is quite
  possible to conceive that there exist a perfectly real phenomenon whose characteristics are such that it cannot
  satisfy these criteria. Anyway, the precise nature of the particular criterion or criteria which would be satisfied by
  no case or by the least number of cases could be a very interesting clue to the nature of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Moreover, if no or very few cases satisfy all criteria, it always remains possible to lower our requirements and to
  select for an in-depth study all cases that obtain a mark higher than a certain threshold.</p>
<p>I should like to emphasize that, although the criteria are obviously intended to highlight phenomena that are at
  least partly physical, it does not mean that we reject other explanations, like <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses/HPS/index.html">psycho-sociological</a> or <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses/HPN">paranormal</a> ones. The fact simply is that it is very much
  easier to design criteria for physical phenomena. What would constitute a "good", a "reliable" psychological case?
  Every idea for selecting such cases would be welcome.</p>
<h2>Use of the criteria</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If a criterion is satisfied, make 1. If a criterion is not applicable to a case (for instance criterion E for a
    daylight sighting and criteria L and O when K, is not satisfied), it is considered as satisfied.</li>
  <li>If a criterion is not satisfied, eliminate the case.</li>
  <li>However, "mitigation circumstances" are allowed for some criteria (they are typed in small letters under the main
    criterion); the cases satisfying them are accepted, but have a mark lower than 1 for that criterion.</li>
  <li>The total mark of a case is obtained by multiplying by one hundred the product of the individual marks; thus the
    maximum mark is 100.</li>
  <li>The precise meaning of the words underlined in dotted line is given in Note II.</li>

      <li>witnesses' reaction during the sighting;</li>
      <li>wear, if any, of optical or acoustical prostheses (spectacles, contact lenses, etc.), in general and during
        the sighting;</li>
      <li>education level, hobbies and readings of the witnesses;</li>
      <li>belief, if any, in parapsychological and other strange phenomena and attitude toward the UFO phenomenon;</li>
      <li>detailed record of interviews with the witnesses;</li>
      <li>investigation among the neighbours;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The phenomenon distance, when it is mentionned, must have been assessed :
    <ol>
      <li>by the occultation of a landmark, or</li>
      <li>by triangulation, or</li>

<h2>Note 2 - Definitions of some words used in the criteria</h2>
<h3>Angular coordinates (crit. C and H)</h3>
<p><img align="right" height="253" src="Breysse_Schema.jpg" width="500">&alpha; = azimuth</p>
<p>&beta; = elevation </p>
<h3>Close (crit. I<sub>3</sub>)</h3>
<p>Distance shorter than about 200 meters (see evaluation methods in Note I.2)</p>
<h3>Close proximity of the ground (crit. D<sub>1</sub>)</h3>
<p>Distance of the order of a few dozens of centimeters. </p>
<h3>Complex trajectory (crit. B<sub>2</sub>)</h3>
<p>Complex trajectories are not taken into account :</p>
<ul>
  <li>if they occur near the horizon, or</li>
  <li>if, at night, their amplitude remains low, or</li>
  <li>if they are observed only with optical instruments without tripod (binoculars, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Constant or repetitive (crit. G)</h3>
<p>Constant : no feature of the phenomenon (trajectory, colour, shape, etc.) varies.</p>
<p>Repetitive : the only changes in the phenomenon features occur repetitively.</p>
<h3>Independent (crit. L<sub>1</sub>)</h3>
<p>Witnesses are too far from each other to be able to communicate verbally during the sighting. Other communication
  means (radio, CB, telephone, etc.) are also excluded. The distance may however be shorter if communication is not
  possible for any reason (e.g. a group of witnesses aboard a vehicle and another group in open air near the vehicle
  without communication being possible between the two groups). Moreover, the witnesses belonging to different groups
  cannot meet before the investigation.</p>
<h3>Light blob (crit. D<sub>1</sub>)</h3>
<p>Area whose light intensity does not vary sharply from one place to another.</p>
<h3>Lit (crit. E<sub>1</sub>)</h3>
<p>The light source is external to the phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Physical effects (crit. F<sub>2</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>)</h3>
<p>The two following conditions must be simultaneously satisfied : </p>
<ul>
  <li>the effect was noticed during the sighting or immediately after ;</li>
  <li>in case of a trace on the ground, the investigator him/herself is able to see it ; in case of another type of
    effect, a competent specialist (physician, motor mechanic, etc.) who is not a close relative to the witnesses
    certifies that the effect is unexplainable. </li>
</ul>
