<p class="abstract">Dr. <span class="people" title="Vladimir Rubtsov">Rubtsov</span> is a sociologist teaching at the
  Ukranian Extramural Polytechnical Institute in Kharkov, U.S.S.R., and serves MUFON in the dual role of a consultant in
  Philosophy and Foreign Representative for the U.S.S.R. He is the author of a book titled The Problem of
  Extraterrestrial Civilizations, published in 1984 and 1987 in the Russian language. This article is the paper Dr.
  Rubtsov delivered at the “First European Congress on Anomal By Vladimir V. Rubtsov, Ph.D. ous Aerial Phenomena:
  Physical and Psychosocial Aspects” in Brussels, Belgium on November 11-13, 1983, hosted by SOBEPS.</p>
<p>An expert who acquaints himself with a certain set of UFO reports can discard some of them at once, based on his
  knowledge of the nature, technology and special features of the human perception, as descriptions of quite
  understandable things. Reliability of such an elimination is not certainly absolute, but if the expert has a good and
  wide qualification, it is rather high. As a result, there will be selected from the set of reports “subset one,” which
  may be called a subset of “obvious pseudo-anomalous aerial phenomena.” </p>
<p>The rest of the set will be studied more elaborately, by using the expertise of specialists in other fields of
  science and technology. They will explain Some more of the reports, that is, the “subset two”; namely “complicated
  pseudo-anomalous phenomena.” It is not improbable that the initial set will be covered exhaustively. But as a matter
  of fact, a small percentage of UFO observations remain unexplained even after fairly thorough investigation, and these
  form the third subset - “likely anomalous phenomena.” Certainly, this subset may become some day quite understandable
  to researchers even without any significant revolution in science, but it will remain a mystery, at least for some
  time. </p>
<p>The existing body of UFO reports does not allow us to come to any definite conclusion on the nature of the third
  subset of observed phenomena. This information is so heterogeneous and interfered with by various influences, that,
  strictly speaking, it cannot provide serious evidence of the real existence of true anomalous objects. The coherence
  of the UFO reports is not in itself such an evidence. There in the folklore rather a coherent image of the devil, but
  it should hardly be considered as a physical body. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, however strange as it may seem, one can build on this information, an image of a “physical equivalent”
  of the UFO reports from the third subset. lt has been made in fact by the ufological community for the last forty
  years. This image is not even so fantastic. On the whole it is a ball» or disc-shaped object with the diameter from
  several metres to several tens of metres, which may be sometimes a powerful source of light, thermal and microwave
  radiation, as vvell as a magnetic field. It may hover in the air, move with great speeds and accelerations, reflect
  visible light and radio­waves, ionize the air, influence living beings, electronic equipment and internal combustion
  engines. There is nothing “obviously extraterrestrial” in this model; it rather reminds me of a plasma phenomenon,
  something like a “ball superlightning.” </p>
<p>However, one should realize clearly that what we have before us is not a result of logical inductions on the solid
  basis of a system of empirical facts. Really, it is nothing more than an associative image, derived from a set of
  heterogeneous data. Let’s consider, why it is $0. What are the main epistemological differences of the UFO problem
  from the “usual” scientific problems? What can and must be done to raise and solve it in a strictly scientific way?
  Science obtains its hardest data from experiments, but many theories were built on the basis of what may be called
  “correct observations,” that is, observations which conform to certain standards, thus allowing the obtained
  information to be considered reliable. The scheme of a scientific observation may be represented as a system of four
  components: 1) sensors (that is, registering equipment); 2) a channel for transmission of the data; 3) the instruments
  processing the data and presenting them in a form suitable for farther analysis; 4) a researcher. </p>
<p>One might expand this scheme or, on the contrary, shorten it, restricting it to only three elements: sensors, a
  channel, and a researcher, but there is another more important thing. A scientific observation implies that these
  components are regulated, and their parameters are strictly definite. Mistakes are .inevitable,.but they must not go
  beyond some specified bounds or be distributed on an unknown curve of probabilities. Only then can a researcher draw
  from the data obtained a sure conclusion of the nature of the observed phenomenon. But if we do not know the
  parameters of the components, or if they range too widely and irregularly, the results of such an observation cannot
  be regarded as reliable, nor used for building an empirical fact. A tentative empirical fact is constructed when some
  parameters of the components are known exactly, and other ones hypothetically. That’s why it is tentative and not
  quite reliable. </p>
<p>The associative image of the anomalous aerial phenomena l have described above has been built within the framework of
  a fully unregulated system. Its sensors, channels and - not infrequently - researchers are characterized by so large a
  variability of their parameters, that it is impossible to relate uniquely the “output” of the observation to its
  "input."</p>
<p>By sensors we mean just the sensing organs of the witness. The main processing instrument is his brain, which builds
  an image of the phenomenon on the basis of sensory data; the channel includes, on the one hand, the neural links
  between the sensing organs and the brain, and, on the other hand, those pathways by which the information moves from
  an observer to a researcher. One cannot tell that all „these components are “principally chaotic” and irregular, but
  they are highly variable and, what is more -important, we know too little of the characteristics of this variability.
  Therefore our “associative image” of the anomalous phenomena may hardly be identified even with a tentative empirical
  fact. </p>
<p>The main source of ufological information is a person who witnessed a UFO during his usual work or past time. The
  observation is usually quite unexpected and lasts for several minutes at best. Can we hope to derive from his
  testimony- any scientifically valuable information on the observed phenomenon? The past forty years of investigations
  make it doubtful. ln any case, it is rather a difficult task. First, the image of the phenomenon, created in the mind
  of the witness, is not equal to a photograph. lt comes into being as a result of the interaction between the sensory
  data and “anticipating patterns,” that are kept deep in human memory. Seeing a completely new object means building
  promptly a new pattern to assimilate the non-standard sensory information. Such a pattern is usually slructed by
  association, which does not always warrant its conformity to the real structure of the observed phenomenon and may
  lead to various illusions. </p>
<p>Sensation (that is, perception of Sensory stimuli), formation of an image and its interpretation are three aspects of
  a single process, rather than its stages. One can define the interpretation as fondation of a three-dimensional model
  of the object or phenomenon, imparting it some “objective meaning” and putting the model into the actual context of
  the events, occurring around the witness at the given moment in the given place. Joìning the new “anticipating
  pattern” to older ones, kept in somebody's mind, also requires certain reformation of the person’s world picture. It
  is well known that sensory informa</p>
