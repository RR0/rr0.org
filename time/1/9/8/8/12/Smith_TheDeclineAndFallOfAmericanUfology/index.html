<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p> The first version of this paper was prepared during December 1988 at the request of the prestigious British magazine
  Flying Saucer Review. Understandably, American affairs have low priority in Europe, and thus the publication of this
  paper has been delayed while its import is rapidly decreasing. This reason has decided me to revise the article and
  seek immediate publication in an American magazine. </p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Only a few years back, <a href="/science/crypto/ufo">ufology</a> in the United States was booming. Several major
  national organizations grouped under their banners a large number of members who were interested in the UFO phenomenon
  and provided ample financial support and a ready market for specialized publications. In addition, many smaller groups
  were active enough in more localized geographical areas. </p>
<p>Two of the major organizations, <a href="/org/us/asso/nicap">NICAP</a> and <a
    href="/org/us/asso/apro">APRO</a>, existed almost from the beginning of public interest in flying saucers. <a
    href="/org/us/asso/nicap">NICAP</a> was mainly organized by Major <span class="people">Donald E. Keyhoe</span> (*)
  and attracted many distinguished members formerly associated with the government and the military. As the years went
  by, the backbone of <a
      href="/org/us/asso/nicap">NICAP</a> dispersed, and the organization slowly but irreversibly ceased to exist. Some
  files were acquired by <a href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a>, where presumably they still are. However, not even Dr.
  <a href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen">Hynek</a>, who allegedly had paid for the files from his own funds, could gain
  access to them during the last two years of his life, so one must consider them all but lost for future research.</p>
<p> The other society, <a href="/org/us/asso/apro">APRO</a>, was created and organized by <a
    href="/people/l/LorenzenJames">Jim</a> and <a href="/people/l/LorenzenCoralE">Coral Lorenzen</a>, and attracted some
  of the best investigators abroad, such as Dr. <a href="/people/f/FontesOlavoT">Olavo Fontes</a> in Brazil and Horacio
  Gutierrez Ganteaume in Venezuela. There is no question that the prime mover behind <a
      href="/org/us/asso/apro">APRO</a> was <a href="/people/l/LorenzenCoralE">Coral</a>, and as her health declined, so
  did the organization. The library was dispersed through a secondhand book dealer, and as for the files proper, nobody
  seems to know what happened to them after Coral's death in <time>1988</time>. Once again, valuable records have ceased
  to exist for all practical purposes. </p>
<p>The other two major organizations were <a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> and <a
    href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a>, the former a splinter group from <a
    href="/org/us/asso/apro">APRO</a> centered around <a href="/people/a/AndrusWalterH">Walter Andrus</a>, then a
  manager at Motorola, and the latter founded by Dr. <a href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen">J. Allen Hynek</a> in 1973.
  While Dr. <a href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen">Hynek</a> attempted to create a credible scientific organization, the <a
      href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> emphasis was and still is at the grass-roots level, as it admits to its rank
  and file anyone able to pay the subscription rates.</p>
<p> At the beginning of the 80's, essentially only <a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> and <a
    href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a> survived. <a href="/people/a/AndrusWalterH">Walter Andrus</a> had organized his
  society in a very effective way, using the subscribers to the <em>MUFON UFO Journal </em> as potential but untrained
  investigators and creating a network covering the whole country. On the other hand, Dr. <a
      href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen">Hynek</a> insisted that the <a href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a> investigators
  should be competent, and a much thinner network was deployed under the able direction of <a
      href="/people/h/HendryAllan">Allan Hendry</a>. </p>
<p>The above is just background information, but essential for understanding what has happened to those organizations in
  the last year or so. Although both groups boast a Board of Directors and claim to have guidelines for what they are
  doing, the truth is that they are totally controlled by a few individuals who dictate policy and do as they please.
  This fact is kept from the membership at large, more interested in receiving the publication on time than in its
  contents or internal politics. </p>
<p>As is always the case for monolithic structures, the success or lack thereof depends basically on the personal
  qualities of the leaders; and when the founders grow old or die, a slow but perceptible decline of the organizations
  is initiated. Often enough a deceptive steady state is maintained for years because nothing occurs to shake the
  complacency of the leadership or to challenge it. But then, one day, a sudden event occurs, a controversial case is
  mishandled, and the ineffectual leadership faces a situation beyond its capabilities which threatens the very
  existence of the organization.</p>
<h2> A hard look at CUFOS</h2>
<p>The destiny of <a href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a> is controlled effectively by only two individuals: <a
    href="/people/c/ClarkJerome">Jerry Clark</a>, the editor of the <em>International UFO Reporter</em>, and Mark
  Rodeghier, president (whatever that means) and scientific director of <a
      href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a>. Oh yes, there is a Board of Directors, but they are not important enough to
  have their names listed on the publication's masthead. I discovered how little say they actually have when following
  Dr. <a href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen">Hynek</a>'s death I attempted, very naively, to bring to their attention the
  fact that <a href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a> was precipitously departing from what had been the basic philosophy
  of its founder. This is not meant to say that all the persons on the <a
      href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a> Board of "Directors" are bad guys, because some of them, such as John P.
  Timmerman, are gentlemen who find themselves incapable of influencing events, for reasons too complex to deal with
  here.</p>
<p><a href="/people/c/ClarkJerome">Jerry Clark</a> has a dubious pedigree because of his long association with <a
    href="/org/us/media/press/Fate.html"><em>Fate Magazine</em></a>, where he achieved the position of full editor
  before being terminated when the publication changed ownership. Perhaps the orientation of <a
      href="/org/us/media/press/Fate.html"><em>Fate</em></a> will now change, but in the past it has been devoted mostly
  to the occult, offering a mixed bag of articles dealing with esoteric subjects such as astrology, witchcraft, and life
  after death. Indeed, ufology was treated here and there, sometimes by Mr. <a href="/people/c/ClarkJerome">Clark</a>
  himself, but the articles have been slanted toward sensationalism and not science.</p>
<p> The serious problem with Mr. <a href="/people/c/ClarkJerome">Clark</a>, besides the imponderable influence that his
  relationship with <a href="/org/us/media/press/Fate.html"><em>Fate</em></a> undoubtedly had, is that he can be swayed
  too easily, and not always for the right reasons. For instance, he has been strongly influenced by his friendship with
  <a href="/people/r/RandlesJennifer">Jenny Randles</a>, resulting in publication by the <em>IUR</em> of unjustified
  attacks against FSR which are written in vague terms and not in a constructive manner amenable to rebuttal <span
      class="source"><a href="/people/f/FullerPaul">Fuller, P.</a>: in IUR Vol. 13, No. 3, May/June 1988, p.4</span>.
</p>
<p>Even Dr. <a href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen">Hynek</a> was not happy with his own choice of editor for the
  <em>IUR</em> <span class="source"><a href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen">Hynek, J. Allen</a>: "Letter to the editor from the editor-in-chief", <em>IUR </em>vol. 10, n° 4, juillet/août 1985.</span>,
  and he told me during the last months of his life that <a href="/people/c/ClarkJerome">Clark</a> was selected "<q>because
    there was nobody else!</q>" Not a very happy choice, indeed, as Mr. <a
      href="/people/c/ClarkJerome">Clark</a> has been telling all who care to hear how <a
      href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a> had a turn for the better after the departure of Dr. <a
      href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen">Hynek</a>, having finally achieved a "truly scientific orientation". Well, I
  guess one cannot expect any better from weekend ufologists. </p>
<p>Two issues have recently dominated the ufological picture in the United States. The first is the <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs">MJ-12 documents</a>, the second the <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/GulfBreeze">Gulf Breeze sightings</a>. The official position of <a
    href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a> on the <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs">MJ-12 affair</a> is that the documents are genuine (and they might
  be right) but this position seems to be based not on the available evidence, but mostly on the feelings of the editor
  toward <a href="/people/g/GreenwoodBarry">Barry Greenwood</a> et al, who have taken the opposite view. I don't have
  enough information about this topic to assume a posture, but it seems to me that both proponents and detractors should
  realize that the existence of <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/Majestic12.html">MJ-12</a> and the genuineness of the documents
  are two separate issues.</p>
<p> On the other hand, I have expended a great deal of time and effort in studying the alleged <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/GulfBreeze">Gulf Breeze sightings</a>. The validity of the case is based
  on a collection of Polaroid photos, which at the moment of this writing are unconditionally accepted as genuine--I
  believe--by only a few persons: <a href="/people/a/AndrusWalterH">Walt Andrus</a> (<a
      href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> International Director), Lt. Col. Donald Ware et al. (local investigators), <a
      href="/people/h/HopkinsBudd">Budd Hopkins</a> (abduction expert), Dr. <span class="people">Bruce Maccabee</span>
  (physicist), and Dan Wright (a <a
      href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> henchman who really doesn't count).</p>
<p> It is my considered opinion that overwhelming evidence exists to label this case a hoax, but <a
    href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a> has been vacillating on publishing any of that evidence, in spite of the fact
  that a capable <a href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a> investigator, Robert Boyd, has been involved in the case since
  the very beginning. Why? Because two of <a href="/people/c/ClarkJerome">Jerry Clark</a>'s friends have taken the other
  tack: <a href="/people/h/HopkinsBudd">Budd Hopkins</a>, of controversial <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/scenario/Abduction.html">abduction</a> fame, by his own admission not a
  photographic expert, but who after only a cursory examination of the photos proclaimed them genuine, "the best ever
  obtained". And Dr. <span class="people">Bruce Maccabee</span>, certainly a photographic expert, who suddenly seems
  blind to the blatant negative evidence existing in the photos and who has engaged in a massive disinformation effort
  <span class="source">Maccabee, B. S.: "A  History of the Gulf Breeze,  Fla,   sighting events",  in the 1988 <a
      href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> Symposium Proceedings, Lincoln, NE, June          24-26, 1988</span> <span
      class="note">material covered by the author's presentation          at the symposium was essentially different.</span>
  <span class="source">Maccabee,  B. S.: "The Scale Remains Unbalanced",  in <em>MUFON Journal </em>n° 252, Special Gulf Breeze Issue, April 1989, pp. 3-24.</span>
  pathetically attempting to validate what cannot be validated. Friendship is admirable but should not obfuscate reason,
  and when our friends err, it is part of the obligation of friendship to bring them back to their senses, even if
  painfully. Apparently, Mr. <a href="/people/c/ClarkJerome">Clark</a> has a different opinion, but historically silence
  has never mollified guilt; and as the Piltdown hoax has shown, the passage of time makes things worse for those who
  conspired to hide the truth <span class="source">Gould,  Stephen Jay: HEN'S teeth and Horse's toes, W.W.  Norton and          Co., 1983, p.201.</span>.
</p>
<p> As for <a href="/people/r/RodeghierMark">Mark Rodeghier</a>, he has yet to obtain his Ph.D., as Dr. <a
    href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen">Hynek</a> had hoped when he appointed him Scientific Director of <a
    href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a>. Nonetheless, he could have become an effective leader had he developed the
  strong personality that such a position requires. Clearly, this is not the case, and in all matters he yields to <a
      href="/people/c/ClarkJerome">Jerry</a>. </p>
<p>This has been deplorable in the specific instance of the <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/GulfBreeze">Gulf Breeze incidents</a>, and <a
    href="/people/r/RodeghierMark">Rodeghier</a>'s lack of resolve has resulted in unmitigated thrashing of <a
    href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a> and his leadership from the pages of the <em>MUFON UFO Journal</em>, not only by
  <a href="/people/a/AndrusWalterH">Walter Andrus</a> <span class="source"><a
      href="/people/a/AndrusWalterH">Andrus, W.</a> &amp; al.; "The Gulf Breeze, FL.,  Photographic Case",          Part IV, in <em>MUFON Journal</em> n° 243, July, 1988, p.9.</span>
  but also by <a href="/people/w/WaltersEdwardDaniel">Ed Walters</a>, the dubious and supposedly anonymous Gulf Breeze
  photographer <span class="source"><a href="/people/w/WaltersEdwardDaniel">Walters, Ed</a>: "Ed Responds", in <em>MUFON Journal</em> n° 244, Sept.  1988,          p.3.</span>.
  To top it off, lately the pages of the IUR to disclose Dr. <span class="people">Maccabee</span>'s adamant opposition
  to an independent computer analysis of the suspected photos, which would have resolved the issue once and for all.
</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the <em>IUR</em> readership feels that something is missing in the publication, that the selection of the
  articles is not determined by a firmly established policy but by the predominant wind, and that Dr. <a
      href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen">Hynek</a>'s ideals of serious scientific orientation have been betrayed. Although
  the exact circulation of the IUR is not known, a secret maintained at the price of higher postage rates, the
  publication delays seem to indicate a decreasing readership and a not very promising future for <a
      href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a>. For the memory of Dr. <a
      href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen">Hynek</a>, whose philosophy I share, I sincerely hope to be proved wrong, and
  that one of these days Mark Rodeghier will overcome his timidity and give us all a surprise. </p>
<h2>And a harder look at MUFON</h2>
<p>If the picture I have sketched of <a href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a> doesn't look bright, the reality of <a
    href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> is still worse. </p>
<p>As stated above, Walter <a href="/people/a/AndrusWalterH">Andrus</a> used to be a good manager; and if he had limited
  himself to administrative tasks, <a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> could have fulfilled its destiny.
  Unfortunately, this has not been the case. The many capable individuals in <a
      href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a>, such as Ray Fowler, Walter Webb, Richard Hall and Marge Christensen don't
  seem to have a hand in determining policy and have progressively withdrawn from the limelight. Perhaps they feel that
  nothing can be done, and as one of the many dissatisfied persons has put it, "Walt owns MUFON". Instead of seeking the
  advice of all those consultants that <a href="/people/a/AndrusWalterH">Andrus</a> claims are available to the
  organization, he rarely if ever consults them; and when the expertise is volunteered, he ignores it if it does not
  satisfy his desires.</p>
<p> In fact, many respected ufologists have resigned from <a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a>, while
  others--including myself and Robert Boyd--have been "expelled" because of their refusal to endorse the fake Gulf
  Breeze photographs. In recent weeks the split has possibly become irreversible due mainly to the issues raised by the
  controversial viewpoints of John Lear, which may or may not be presented in July at the Reno <a
      href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> Symposium. </p>
<p><a href="/people/a/AndrusWalterH">Walter Andrus</a> has surrounded himself with persons willing to dance to his tune,
  provided that they are given positions that they (and perhaps nobody else) perceive as important. Outstanding among
  these, we find Dan Wright, a bureaucratic employee from Michigan, whose ambition has allowed him to rise in the ranks
  in spite of his obvious shortcomings. As Deputy Director of Investigations, or a similar resounding title, he has
  undermined the seriousness of <a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> investigations by establishing absurd rules which
  consider that having the appropriate forms completed is more important than the investigative process itself. The
  worst thing about Mr. Wright is his lack of ufological knowledge and experience, and his unshakable belief that he is
  favored with both. Again, I have firsthand experience with this, because in my naivete I attempted to educate him
  about the complexities of the evaluation of UFO reports. I soon discovered that his only emphasis was on the number of
  reports sent to <a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> headquarters to be placed in dusty filing cabinets, out of
  circulation forever.</p>
<p> The capital sin committed by <a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> is related to the <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/GulfBreeze">Gulf Breeze sightings</a>. The distressing part of the Gulf
  Breeze saga is not whether the photos are real or a hoax but the extremes to which both the investigators and Walt <a
      href="/people/a/AndrusWalterH">Andrus</a> have resorted to maintain the illusion of a true and extraordinary case
  which was properly investigated. To narrate in detail the many incidents would take too much space <span
      class="source">Smith, Willy; "The Gulf Breeze Saga",  paper presented on September          17, 1988 at the National UFO Conference, Cleveland, Ohio (Available          from R.D.  Boyd, P.O. Box 66404, Mobile, AL, USA,  $6.00  including          postage).</span>
  so I will limit myself to the most outrageous breaches of accepted investigative procedures and established scientific
  discourse. </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Censorship </strong>: Walt <a href="/people/a/AndrusWalterH">Andrus</a>, as well as the local
    investigators (Don Ware et al.) have systematically suppressed all negative evidence, or simply not followed leads
    that could affect the credibility of the witness. None of the many scientific papers that I submitted to the <a
        href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> Journal have been published or even acknowledged. Only due to the extreme
    pressure exerted by Richard Hall did a single negative article of less than 5 pages <span class="source">Hall, R. &amp; Smith, W.; "<a
        href="../Hall-Smith_BalancingTheScale_MufonUfoJournal">Balancing the Scale:  Unanswered Questions          about Gulf Breeze</a>", in <em>MUFON Journal</em> n° 248, Dec. 1988, p.3.</span>
    appear in the pages of the <a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> Journal. The rebuttal by the chief proponent, Dr.
    <span class="people">Bruce Maccabee</span> <span class="source">Maccabee,  B. S.: "The Scale Remains Unbalanced",  in <em>MUFON Journal </em>n° 252, Special Gulf Breeze Issue, April 1989, pp. 3-24.</span>,
    took 18 pages of text plus photos and tables, skillfully dodging the fundamental issues, and containing so many
    errors of fact that they make a suitable response difficult, if not impossible, within the editorial constraints.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Lack of confidentiality </strong>: The local investigators (mainly Lt. Col. Ware and Col. Reid) did not
    hesitate to release confidential analyses of other investigators (like myself), to the witnesses, thus allowing Mr.
    <a href="/people/w/WaltersEdwardDaniel">Walters</a> to correct his errors and change his story in an attempt to
    nullify the negative evidence. An interesting example of this is that the "craft" shown in the initial photos is
    grossly asymmetric, but was replaced by a symmetric one at a later date. Incredibly, this change has been attributed
    to the alleged extra-terrestrials, rather than an improvement of Ed's techniques! Yet, those same investigators
    created an issue when I disclosed the name of Mr. <a href="/people/w/WaltersEdwardDaniel">Walters</a> (a.k.a. Mr.
    Hanson) at a lecture, ignoring the fact that his TWO names are common knowledge in Gulf Breeze. </li>
  <li><strong>Failure to disclose </strong>: Last, but the most important irregularity: only Dr. <span class="people">Maccabee</span>
    has had unrestricted and free access to the original Polaroid photographs. It has been well documented that all
    requests for "independent examination", including the use of computer image enhancement, have been simply ignored.
    Since the basic tenet of scientific investigation is duplication by independent parties, if we are to invoke science
    the ORIGINAL photographs have to be made available. This has not been the case, and probably will never be. Having
    detected many shortcomings using photographs many generations removed from the Polaroid originals, I seriously
    wonder what is in them that <a
        href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> and the proponents do not want others to see. Perhaps the lack of agreement
    between Mr. <a href="/people/w/WaltersEdwardDaniel">Walters</a>' story and the manufacturer numbers on the reverse?
    Or the fact that apparently some of those numbers have been tampered with? </li>
</ol>
<h2>What is in the future?</h2>
<p>Very little, if we don't do something about it. It seems that ufology in the United States is changing, and not for
  the better. The ideals that inspired the early pioneers in the field seem to have disappeared, and the present day
  publications only reflect the personal ambitions of those who write them. I find this depressing, and also
  intolerable, because in science the overwhelming driving force has to be the search for truth. Unfortunately, the
  leadership of <a href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a> seems to have forgotten what the goal is, while the <a
      href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> leaders cannot remember what they never knew. </p>
<p>I often wonder why <a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> continues the pretense of "investigating" cases, just to
  file them away. When the UNICAT Project agreed to joint efforts with <a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a>, it was
  with the clear understanding that <a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> would make the "hidden" reports available to
  us in exchange for free access to the UNICAT database. Neither of those things ever happened: I was unable to obtain a
  single investigation report from Walt <a href="/people/a/AndrusWalterH">Andrus</a>, and no inquiries were ever made to
  the database. The reasons are now clear to me: Walt <a
      href="/people/a/AndrusWalterH">Andrus</a> (that is, <a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a>) has no interest in
  solving the problem posed by the UFO phenomenon. In fact, such an occurrence would mark the end of <a
      href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> as a viable organization: why would anyone buy the MUFON UFO Journal or the
  IUR if the mystery has been solved? </p>
<p>As for <a href="/org/us/asso/cufos">CUFOS</a>, the weekend ufologists are set in their ways not to share information
  with others, in spite of the fact that this is contrary to the philosophy established by Dr. <a
      href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen">Hynek</a>, for whom divulging and exchanging knowledge was of fundamental
  importance. Their files, or whatever still remains of them, are not accessible to anyone, much less to me because of
  my close relationship with Dr. <a href="/people/h/HynekJosefAllen">Hynek</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/asso/mufon">MUFON</a> is at the breaking point, and perhaps this is the moment to offer some
  creative thoughts. Ufology in the United States is stagnant because of the lack of leadership in the extant
  organizations. They live in the past, controlled by a few persons who, bound by canons of loyalty to old friends, are
  unable to recognize when those friends-- also set in their ways--are violating the rigid principles of scientific
  methodology. Those false leaders have reached the point where the decisive basis for their editorial policies is not
  the search for truth, but publishing what sells regardless of its lack of scientific value.</p>
<p> What is needed is a new organization, formed by a younger generation more committed to scientific research than to
  making a profit at the expense of truth. I sincerely hope that a few such individuals exist out there and that they
  will be able to form a new and more honest organization. Needless to say, the UNICAT Project is prepared to provide
  support and assistance. </p>

<h2>POST SCRIPTUM</h2>
<p>As I am not naive anymore, I am quite aware that what is published in the <em>MUFON UFO Journal</em> and the
  <em>IUR</em> pages is heavily dependent on politics. Thus, I foresee that this article will bring a vitriolic attack
  from those named in it. Very likely their frustration will be vented in the only way they seem to know well:
  attempting a destructive critique of the UNICAT Project. So be it. My associates and I are open to constructive
  criticism, which is always welcome. Not welcome are those critics whose main objection to the UNICAT Project is their
  fear that we may be approaching basic results, and whose arguments are invariably based on lack of accurate
  information about what we do.</p>
