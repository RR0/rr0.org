<p class="abstract">Comprendre les aspects d'une interaction dissimulée avec la culture, la technologie extraterrestre
  et les structures de puissances planétaires<b> </b></p>
<h2>Note de l'auteur</h2>
<p>Ce projet est la distillation de plus de 15 ans de recherches. De ces 15 années, la dernière a été la plus
  significative. La plupart des données controversées est apparue la dernière année. Bien qu'une partie puisse sembler
  un peu "far out", much of it has been corroborated from so many sources that it is no longer a question of
  coincidence.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the following basic items are true:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Government has and is interacting with alien cultures.</li>
  <li>The Government has captured alien technology and has interacted with them to ensure a similar development of our
    technology along the same lines.</li>
  <li>The Government maintains underground facilities, some of which are jointly occupied by alien entities.</li>
  <li>Diffrent alien species are interacting with human beings. Some of the alien species maintain <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/scenario/Souterrains.html">underground facilities</a>. Humans are being
    manipulated in these facilities. </li>
  <li>Manipulation of the human species extends to very deep levels ; levels of alien manipulation affect human
    evolution, genetics and planetary power structures.</li>
  <li>Various entities that have a non-terrestrial origin walk freely among us.</li>
  <li><a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a>/PI-40/54-12 organizations do (and did)
    exist. </li>
  <li><a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MutilationsBetail">Animal and human mutilations</a> are being
    performed. </li>
  <li><a href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/scenario/Abduction.html">Abduction of human beings</a> occurs on a
    regular basis. </li>
  <li>Alien interaction with the human community will soon have increased impact on society.</li>
  <li>Star Wars, SDI, and the "space program" are superficial public constructs that are "fronts" for funding other
    "black projects" </li>
  <li>The <a href="/org/us">United States</a> and the Soviet Union are not adversaries at all, especially in terms of
    interaction with alien species. </li>
  <li>The project loosely known as "<a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Alternative3">Alternative Three</a>" is
    at least 60 % true. </li>
  <li>Aliens have affected the human religious systems.</li>
  <li>Some of the most outspoken <a href="/people/ufologues.html">ufologists</a> work for and with the Government. </li>
  <li>The public is being acclimated through the media to the following information:
    <ul>
      <li>Reinforcement of the "One World" concept.</li>
      <li>Aliens do exist and are among us.</li>
      <li>Alien motives may not be pleasant.</li>
      <li>Acceptance of the dehumanization of man.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mind control is actively being used by alien entities insofar as their ability to manipulate the human mind is
    being used to subdue human beings for their own purposes.</li>
  <li>The <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> and other Government agencies have used Mind Control Techniques to perform
    assasinations and to further negative operations that are counterproductive to human progress.</li>
  <li>World domination groups are interwoven with alien control groups. The <a
      href="/org/int/asso/illuminati/index.html">Illuminati</a>, <a href="/org/int/asso/Bilderberg">Bilderbergers</a>,
    Council on <a href="/org/CFR.html">Foreign Relations</a>, <a
        href="/org/int/asso/TrilateraleCommission.html">Trilateral Commission</a>, <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a>, <a
        href="/org/us/ic/fbi">FBI</a>, <a href="/org/us/ic/nsa">NSA</a>, <a href="/org/us/dod/NRO.html">NRO</a>, the
    military, Federal Reserve and other groups have areas within them that have conspired to rule the world under a
    domination based system. This system is committed to the dehumanization of man and the "One World" concept. Society
    is maintained in a static state of disarray, fostered by ego-oriented activities that focus on security, sensation,
    and power.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more areas to cover, and I am sure that you will reach some conclusions yourself. These conclusions
  may not be comfortable, but they will appear. You will think very hard after reviewing this book. That's the purpose
  of it. To stimulate thought and change within the consciousness of those who read it.</p>
<p>We're all after peace in our lives. We all want and need the same kind of things out of life (in the end). Someday,
  we may see a better world and a better life for all beings, no matter where they come from. This book is intended to
  be part of the start of that process. Read it, reflect on it, and do a little checking on your own. You'll be glad you
  did.</p>
