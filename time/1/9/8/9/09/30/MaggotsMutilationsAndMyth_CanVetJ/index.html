<p class="abstract">Une revue des modeles de nécrophagie des carcasses de bovins fut effectuée en utilisant les données
  des habitudes connues des nécrophages communs en Alberta. Une comparaison fut faite entre ces modèles et ceux
  rapportés par la presse et par des vétérinaires qui ont eu à enquêter sur des cas de mutilation de bovins en Alberta.
  La conclusion qui résulte de cette comparaison indique qu'il ne s'agissait pas de mutilation mais bien de nécrophagie.

<p>cattle "mutilation" phenomenon drew attention to this </p>
<p>cass with pieces missing and, assuming that it was maliciously done, did not look for evidence of scavengers in the
  area. Often neighbors would gather, trample the local environment, and destroy evidence that might have existed. In
  many such cases, no post-mortem examination was performed and consequently a definite cause of death was not
  established. Many veterinary practitioners attributed the phenomenon to scavenging following death by natural causes.
  Although this view is widely held in the veterinary profession, it has never been documented in the veterinary press.
  Our purpose in this review is</p>
<p>to summarize what is known about the scavenging of bovine carcasses, to provide a brief overview of the distribution
  of defects that occurred in cattle in Alberta, and to present evidence that the "mutilation" observed was the work of
  scavengers. </p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Some ten years ago, the news media in Alberta reported unusual findings in dead cattle. Various</p>
<h2>Predation</h2>
<p>An important distinction is that between a scavenger and a predator. A scavenger is "an animal that feeds on decaying
  matter" (7) (Figure1), which in this review means an animal that feeds on a bovine carcass. A predator is "an animal
  that preys on other animals" (7) (Figure2). In the range land of western North America, many predators are also
  scavengers (8) depending upon season and circumstances.</p>
<p>structures, usually either genital organs or portions of the face and head, were missing in animals found dead on
  range (1,2). Characteristicaly, tissue edges surrounding there move dare as were described as being remarkably smooth
  (2). This phenomenon was the subject of newspaper and magazine articles, television interviews, and at least one
  half-hour television program. Ranchers who were normally rational and critical, and other wise analytical members of
  the media, were given to wild speculation about the possible origins of these findings. The phenomenon was attributed
  in the popular press to visitors from outer space (2-5), satanic cults (3,6), deranged persons (1), and/or the
  military or CIA (2,3).</p>
<p>Distinguishing scavenging from predation is reasonably easy if the carcass is discovered prior to or shortly after
  feeding has commenced; it becomes more difficult as consumption progresses. Both the environment and the carcass
  should be examined to establish predation. In the environment there may be signs of a struggle which may include
  disturbed turf and broken bushes. There will usually be blood either in the area or at some point removed from the
  carcass. Hair or pieces of hide may be present on fences, or the carcass may have barbed wire cuts on the skin. During
  wintertime, footprints of predators may be </p>

  about the patterns of scavenging of cattle carcasses on range in western North America. It also became apparent that
  many experienced cattle- men who had seen dead animals in the past, had not, paid much attention to the details of
  scavenging. The lack of observation. In some cases, suspicion of foul play developed in the minds of ranchers and this
  often interfered with examination of the circumstances under which the animal died. Often the owner would not accept
  that an animal had died of disease and had been scavenged. In several situations, people observed a car- </p>

  particularly Clostridiaspp. from the gastrointestinal tract, rapidly invade the carcass and putrefaction begins. This
  process releases considerable gas, and, in combination with postmortem gas-driven expansion of the rumen, causes the
  carcass to bloat. Bloating and putrefaction cause protrusion of the tongue, eyes, rectum, anus and vulva.
  Sub-cutaneous and abdominal gas causes swelling of the scrotum and increased prominence of the prepuce. Viscera
  protrude from any defects in the abdominal wall. The skin stretches as bloating develops. Consequently, the edges of
  any defects in the skin become taut and straighten, and the defects become circular or ovoid. As decomposition
  progresses, and parts are removed by scavengers, gas production decreases, bloating subsides and the carcass
  dehydrates. At this point, remnants of protruding structures retract into the carcass. If structures have been removed
  by the ground immediately around the carcass is not necessarily a sign of predation as this may occur after
  scavengers, the cavity produced is accentuated, making death if there are skin defects due to scavenging. On it appear
  that removal has occurred from deep within the other hand, bloodsome distance from the carcass the cavity (3). is an
  indicat or of predation. Examination of the carcass should include skinning Scavenging -the throat and the hindlimbs
  and examining for bite wounds. Subcutaneous hemorrhage and tearing of muscles are invariably present. Canine teeth
  produce small punctures in the skin but extensive damage in the underlying tissue. There will often be holes in the
  trachea if the predator kills by grabbing the neck. The head and neck region is most commonly attacked by predators
  (8) but is often the last part of the carcass consumed. Thus antemortem hemorrhage, bite wounds, and trauma in the
  head and neck areas often can be found after extensive consumption of the carcass. Further discussion of predation is
  well covered in references 8-11. Many invertebrates and vertebrates are scavengers, and several species may either
  consecutively or concurrenlty scavenge a carcass (8). Undisturbed, scavenging continues until alm soft tissues have
  been eaten, leaving only the bones. If scavengers are disturbed, the carcass will remain intact except for the parts
  removed prior to disturbance. Consequently, if only the soft protruding parts had been removed when disturbance
  occurred, the carcass may present a bizarre appearance as scavengers will leave with only the early part of their
  feeding pattern complete, i.e. facial structures, anus, other body openings (see below). They may never complete
  scavenging the carcass. Scavenger species include wolves, coyotes, dogs, skunks, badgers, foxes, pigs, weasels, bears,
  bobcats, other mammalian species, and various birds including Postmortem changes Whenan animal dies, decomposition

  1978 and 1980, the news media reportedthatcatlewerebeingfounddeadwithvarious
  partsmissing;thesewerereferredtoas"cattlemutila- tions".Thistermcameintowidespreadusewiththe
  implicationthatthedeathandremovalofparts occurredundersuspicouscircumstances.Thesefind- ings were attributed to
  perverts, cults, and aliens in unidentifiedflyingobjects(1).Manymutilationswere
  reportedbutwereneverformallybroughttotheatten- tionofpoliceorotherauthorities.Ofthosethatwere,
  onlyafewcaseswereexaminedinveterinarydiagnostic laboratories. The descriptions of missing parts were strikingly
  similar. Two reports are representative of those in whichcatlewerenotsubjectedtolaboratoryexamina- tion (1,19). In
  one, seven animals were reported as missing"sexorgans,tongues,lips,oreventails"(19).
  Intheother,theanimalsinquestionweremissingthe "lower lip, tongue, an ear and a straight-edged rec- tangle of hide from

  had a pattern of parts missing that was similar to those listed in the newsmedia.Inthoseanimalssubmittedbeforeexten-
  sive autolysis occurred, a diagnosis was usually established as the following examples show. Case1:A

  suspectedthattheanimalhadbeenmutilated.We con- cluded that alfour had been scavenged. Conclusions It can be seen from
  the previously mentioned news- paperaccountsandcasereportsthatthepartsreported missing from mutilated cattle are the
  same as those knowntoberemovedbyscavengers,primarilycoyotes andbirds,intheearlystagesofscavengingacarcass. Jagged
  edges and tooth marks were found in al laboratory-examinedanimals.Therefore,wepropose that in the absence of any
  evidence to the contrary: 1. dead cattle are mutilated in Alberta (according to the dictionary definition given
  above); 2. the mutilations are the work of scavenger animals, mainly coyotes and birds; 3.
  themutilationsoccuraftertheanimalhasdied; and 4. anyinvestigationofbizarregrossfindingsindead
  cattlemustruleoutscavengingbeyondanyreasonable doubt before proceeding to investigation of other posibilities. These
  conclusions are not original. Rather, they havebeenarrivedatbyanumberofinvestigators,and, although mentioned in the
  lay press (2,3,5,19), they have never been documented in the veterinary litera- ture. They are hereby entered to this
  literature as a reference for those who are called upon to investigate cattle deaths and "mutilations".
