<title>The Jinn from a Scientific(?) Viewpoint</title>

<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<p> This article came about as a result of a discussion concerning the nature of the JINN, and their apparent activity
  in the UFO and psychic fields.
</p>
<p> The assumption that underlines the following viewpoint is that the Jinns are beings which dwell on a parallel level
  to man, but <em>due to their existing at a different vibratory rate, they are not normally visible to us or detectable
    by us.</em></p>
<p> In spite of this invisibility, when UFO events or psychic events occur, there are often changes in an energy that we
  can measure - <em>and this is the electro-magnetic spectrum.</em></p>
<p> This article, then, is an attempt to bring together (1): observed effects associated with UFOs and with psychic
  events; (2) traditional "occult" wisdom; and (3) contemporary scientific knowledge.
</p>
<p> Our starting point is with the traditions of Islam, and, in particular, the Qur'an, which contains some quantity of
  information of a metaphysical nature, a proportion of which deals with the Jinn. This material is summarized in Gordon
  Creighton's article, <em>"A Brief Account of the True Nature of the UFO Entities"</em>, published originally in FSR
  29/1 (October 1983) and reprinted in FSR 33/3 (September 1988).

  <h2>The Jinn and the Infra-red</h2>

  <p> In that article, the Jinn are described as having <em>"bodies of essential flame"</em> <em class="note">Min nari
    al-samumi</em>,<a href="https://www.ufoinfo.com/news/FSR_scientific.shtml#1"></a> or <em>"smokeless flame"</em> <span
      class="note"><em>Min marijin min narin</em></span></p>
  <p class="note"> (Incidentally, one very highly-placed British-trained Arab doctor, Dr Adil Mosa Al-Nahhas, MB, Chb
    (Baghdad), MSc (London), who was educated and trained at London University and St Bartholomew's Hospital, London,
    <em>and who in 1984 was the Head of the Department of Nuclear Medicine, in the Institute of Radiology &amp; Nuclear
      Medicine, Aliwiya, Baghdad, Iraq, had this to say in a letter to me about the UFOs and the "JINNS" dated March 22,
      1984, and which I subsequently published on page iii of FSR Vol.29, No.4 (1984).</em></p>
  <p><span class="note">"Regarding the explanation of the verse from the <em>Holy Qur'an</em> which you quoted on page 8 of FSR  Vol.28, No.6, I  could not find in any of my reference sources a better explanation  for the UFOs than yours. The sources all speak of some sort of  'smokeless fire, a pure flame which penetrates even the orifices  of the skin and which kills!'"</span>
  </p>
  <p class="note"> (In further private correspondence with me, Dr Al-Nahhas, who has long been a subscriber to FSR,
    agreed with me that maybe <em>plasma</em>, or something of the nature of <em>plasma</em>, may be involved. <em>At
      any rate - something - as he says, that is not yet known in our modern Science.)</em></p>
  <p class="note"> Apropos of this matter of the "Islamic theory about UFOs", it is to be noted that, in the new and
    enlarged 1989 edition of her very important book <em>"The Tujunga Canyon Contacts"</em> (first published in 1980.
    See her article <em>"Can We Battle These Entities?"</em>, in FSR 33/3, 1988), Ann Druffel, FSR Consultant and
    Contributing Editor to MUFON UFO JOURNAL, has shown herself to be the only person in the Western world who has had
    the guts to state that she thinks the "Jinn Theory" may very likely be right. (Several other leading "Ufologists"
    have written privately to me to say that they too think there "might be something in it". Not one of them has had
    the guts to say so publicly).
  </p>
  <p class="note"> On page 285 of the new paperback edition of the <em>"Tujunga Canyon Contacts"</em>, Ann Druffel
    discusses the <em>"underground denunciation, slowly increasing to diatribe, directed against FSR, mainly by English
      researchers who disagree violently with Creighton".</em></p>
  <p class="note"> Some of my correspondents seem to think that this deluge of venom is directed at me <em>"because I am
    a Muslim"</em>(!). <em>I don't happen to be a Muslim. I have been a student of Hindu Vedanta and of Buddhism for
    almost 50 years. And I happen to detest a great deal of modern Islam, and the modern Ayatollahs, for their cruelty
    and bigotry and sub-human intolerance, in which they are even far worse than the Christians have ever been. (And
    that is saying something!)</em></p>
  <p class="note"> The reason for the hate-FSR campaign is far simpler and far easier to find than that. It is:-</p>
  <p class="note"> In the seven years since I took over the editorship, FSR has not foundered without trace, as they all
    hoped it would. Several of the venom-bags even wrote to me at the outset giving me details of how they intended to
    bring this about. The objection to me is in any case not based on any <em>"religious"</em> grounds, since none of
    these individuals is remotely <em>"religious"</em>, as their conduct proves. (On the other hand, had I been a
    Commie, like some of them, things would no doubt have been very different.)
  </p>
  <p>,<a href="https://www.ufoinfo.com/news/FSR_scientific.shtml#2"></a> or <em>"smokeless fire"</em>.</p>
  <p> In the same article by the Editor, ANGELS are described ( according to the Qur'an) as having <em>bodies of
    light</em> <span class="note">While the Qur'an has several express references to the fact  that the physical body of man is made of <em>"soil"</em>,  or <em>"clay"</em>, or <em>"loam"</em>, as it  is rendered by various translators, and that the bodies of the  Jinn are of <em>"smokeless
    fire"</em> or <em>"smokeless
    flame"</em>, as already stated, the description of the bodies  of the Angels <em>(Malak</em>, pl. <em>Malayikat)</em> as consisting  of<em>
    "light" (nur)</em> is not to be found - so far  as I can see - within the Qur'an itself, but in the body of <em>traditional</em> notes and references known as the <em>Hadith.</em></span>.
    Since they are generally invisible to us, and also for reasons which I will put forward later, I would suggest that
    <em>the Angels' bodies are of an invisible energy from the opposite end of the spectrum, i.e. - the
      ultra-violet.</em></p>
  <p> Before I get too involved with technical discussions, I would just like to point out that there is another well
    known Islamic book that also deals extensively with our unseen neighbours. In fact one might call it a manual of
    mankind's interaction with the Jinn! And this is "THE ONE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS" <em class="note">The Thousand
      Nights And One Night (Alf Layla wa-Layla).</em>,<a href="https://www.ufoinfo.com/news/FSR_scientific.shtml#4"></a>
    or "ARABIAN NIGHTS".

  <h2>Why did UFOs Appear En Masse in 1947?</h2>

  <p> One of the questions that often crop up in the UFO field is: <em>"Why did UFOs start to appear in great numbers,
    around and after 1947?"</em></p>
  <p> Although plenty of UFOs were undoubtedly seen long before the year 1947, it does seem that something may have
    provoked their increased activity, and increased appearances, at that time.
  </p>
  <p> Well now - an interesting answer to our question has been provided by the New Zealander Trevor James Constable in
    his second book, <em>"The Cosmic Pulse of Life"</em>, in which he states that <em>UFOs began to appear in numbers
      around the time when man started to use Radar. Or - to put it another way - the UFOs began to appear around the
      time when man started to fill the Earth's atmosphere with microwave radiation</em> <span class="note">We should not overlook the claim, which has been <em>repeatedly
      voiced, and appears to be well-founded</em>, that curiously enough - <em>it was the Americans' radar which brought
      about the malfunctioning and resultant crashes of the first discs in 1947 and 1948!</em></span>.
  </p>
  <p> Since the use of Radar became commonplace throughout the world shortly after World War II, the dates certainly
    coincide, and, if we look at the nature of Radar - bearing in mind that the Jinn may possess bodies of infra-red -
    then we can certainly see a good reason for their becoming concerned!
  </p>
  <p><em>Microwave radiation is just below infra-red in the electro-magnetic spectrum (i.e. - just above Radio waves) -
    therefore our projection of microwaves into the Earth's atmosphere may well disrupt, or disturb, the bodies of the
    Jinn and the medium in which they live and dwell.</em></p>

  <h2>How the Jinn Materialize</h2>

  <p> In the Islamic texts it is stated that the Jinn are able to materialize or disappear at will. This would imply one
    of three things:- (!) They have control over the matter that we consider to be "everyday reality"; (2) They have
    control over certain aspects of our own psyche, and can create in us the subjective experience of matter; (3) They
    can create illusions of an external and very realistic nature in the same way that we create <em>holograms</em>. It
    is possible that this last suggestion includes the first.
  </p>
  <p> The reason for this is as follows:-</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>A Blueprint for all Matter?</h2>

  <p> Various researchers on the cutting edge of nuclear physics (i.e. Paul Davies) and also in the border-line medical
    field (i.e. Harry Oldfield) <span class="note">My friend Harry Oldfield, the British pioneer in <em>Electrocrystal
      Therapy</em>,  has made a remarkable impact upon the medical profession and the  hospitals in recent years. With his books and articles and his School  of Electrocrystal Therapy, and his many journeys overseas to  demonstrate and to lecture, he has really <em>"started
      something"</em>, and that <em>"something"</em> deserves attention. See: <em>The Dark Side of the Brain: Major
      Discoveries In The Use of Kirlian Photography and Electrocrystal Therapy</em>, , by Harry  Oldfield and Roger Coghill. (Element Books, 1988) </span>have
    speculated that there exists a kind of blueprint for physical beings and physical materials - this may be an
    electro-magnetic lattice or hologram which tells each atom r molecule what to do and where to go.
  </p>
  <p> The reason for this kind of speculation is that our present knowledge of natural control systems is unable to
    explain the degree of specialization that many atoms/molecules/cells exhibit.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The Mysterious "Crashed Discs"</h2>

  <p> Suppose, then, that the Jinn were able to construct and to destroy electronic blueprints, and suppose, further,
    that, once set up, a blueprint will attract to it, from our environment, the necessary minerals, gases, etc., in
    order to make up the corresponding physical form. When the blueprint is removed or destroyed, the physical form will
    disintegrate or "return to dust".
  </p>
  <p> This may provide an explanation for the physical reality of the <em>crashed discs</em>, whilst still allowing that
    they are actually <em>of etheric origin.</em></p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Jinn may function on Two Levels?</h2>

  <p> In ascribing intelligent behaviour to the Jinn, it must be accepted that they have at least two levels of
    functioning - i.e. (1) the body of electromagnetic energy, and (2) a psyche of some finer energy. <em>This might be
      called "etheric", or possibly "astral", in the Western Occult Tradition.)</em> The reason why I am unsure about
    this terminology is that it may well be the case that the term "etheric", as used, is a traditional, empirical
    description of the electromagnetic environment which surrounds us. Therefore the psychology of the Jinn would have
    to be on what we call the "Astral Level".
  </p>
  <p> Here I think it necessary to clear up a misunderstanding which often occurs with regard to the term "Ether" or
    "Etheric".
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The Etheric Level</h2>

  <p> In the Western Occult Tradition, the "Etheric" is described as the <em>innermost</em> of a series of "bands"
    around the Earth, penetrating deep into the Planet, and reaching to a certain height in the Atmosphere. Higher above
    that in the Atmosphere is the "Astral" <span class="note">It seems difficult to establish when this term <em>"astral"</em> was first employed by Western mystics and occultists. Interestingly  enough, however, it is a fact that away back in the earliest Sanskrit  literature of 2,000 years ago, there is a philosophical or metaphysical  term, <em>"Akasha"</em>, which may possibly encompass  both <em>"astral"</em> and <em>"etheric"</em>.  And it is also a highly interesting fact that, when the British  scholars in the 19th century set about translating India's great  classical texts into English and making the richness of <em>Vedanta</em> known to the world, they cast around for a long time in search  of a good rendering for <em>"Akasha"</em>,  and finally  they plumped for the words <em>"Ether"</em> and <em>"Etheric"</em>.  According to the ancient Hindu philosophy and cosmology, <em>"Akasha"</em> is in fact one of the <em>seven
      recognized states of matter.</em> Whereas we in the West perceive and recognize "matter"  in three forms - <em>solid,
      liquid,</em> and <em>gaseous</em> - the  ancient Hindu writers state emphatically that there is also <em>"Ether"
      ("Akasha"), and that there is not merely one form of Ether, but four different levels of it, thus giving a total
      of seven levels on which existence is possible.</em> During the 19th century the hypothesis of the existence of the <em>Ether</em> (from the classical Greek word for the <em>upper
      atmosphere</em>)  as a substance filling all space, inclusive of those volumes occupied  by ordinary matter, and serving to transmit those forces (gravitational,  electric, magnetic)  which one material object exerts on another  located at a distance, seems to have been accepted by all competent  Western scientific authorities, although there was, of course,  diversity of opinion as to the Ether's possible properties. So  far, then, one might have said that this Western concept of the  all-pervading <em>Ether</em> corresponded very largely and very  neatly to the old Hindu idea. By 1850 the concept of the existence  of the <em>Ether</em> appeared to have triumphed, but the failure  of the famous Michelson-Morley Experiment in 1881 dealt it a fatal  blow, and by 1900 it seems that no Western scientists any longer  believed in it. Nevertheless I recall that by the 1920's, so important  a scientist as Paul Dirac, who died only recently, was expressing  most emphatically his conviction that <em>"we
      would have to return to the Ether
      Theory"</em>. So - who knows? Maybe the ancient Hindus were right after all!</span> ; above that is the "Mental"
    <span class="note">What  is called the "Mental Level" in Western philosophical, religious, and  "occult" speculations corresponds very exactly with the level of what  is called in  Sanskrit <em>"Manas"</em>, MIND, cognate with the Latin  word MENS. In the Hindu scheme of things this was another one  of the seven levels of which the Universe is constructed.</span>
    - and so on, depending on which terminology you prefer to use.
  </p>
  <p> At some point one of the unseen levels must be so expansive that it is - in fact - <em>interplanetary.</em> (This
    would perhaps be the "Spiritual" or "Casual" Level.)
  </p>
  <p> Another use of the word "Ether", which conflicts with the occult method of usage, is to employ it in order to
    describe the <em>interplanetary medium.</em><a href="https://www.ufoinfo.com/news/FSR_scientific.shtml#9"></a> This
    application of it was used, up until the late 19th century, by astronomers and philosophers, but, as I have
    explained above, the "interplanetary medium" would in occult terminology probably be called the "Casual" or
    "Spiritual" Level.

  <h2>Trevor Constable's "They Live in the Sky"</h2>

  <p> Therefore problems can occur, as, for example, in Trevor J. Constable's <span class="note">Trevor James Constable, a New Zealander by birth, was serving as the Radio Officer aboard the huge British luxury liner RMS <em>Queen
    Mary</em> in the years immediately following World War II. And our Editor of that  time, Waveney Girvan, published the first article by Trevor James (the  pen-name being used then by Constable) in FSR Vol. 5 No. 6 (Nov/Dec.  1959), under the title <em>"Saucers
    And Psychism"</em>. Subsequent articles were <em>"Scientists, Contactees &amp; Equilibrium"</em> FSR Vol. 6, No. 1 (Jan./Feb. 1960); <em>"Space
    Animals - A Fact of Life</em>", in FSR Vol. 6 No. 4 (July/Aug.  1960); <em>"Get Off The Defensive"</em> in FSR Vol. 6,  No. 5 (Sept./Oct. 1960); <em>"The
    Case For Contact"</em>,  in FSR Vol. 7 No. 6 (Nov./Dec. 1961) and Vol. 8 No. 1 (Jan./Feb.  1962); <em>"Ufology:
    Something More Than A Science"</em>,  in FSR Vol. 8 No. 4 (July/Aug. 1962). Naturally, Trevor James Constable's claims to have made Infra-red  photographs of some mysterious and unknown forces or energies  or even craft or living beings (some of the photos look, as Constable  says, merely "two-dimensional") have been received with  total suspicion by not only all scientists, but also by all laymen  who cling to the purely <em>materialistic</em> explanation for everything.  I regret that I lack the necessary knowledge required to say more  about it. But I will state most emphatically my complete confidence  that Robert James Constable is no trickster, but, more likely,  a great pioneer. (As such, he cannot expect to be treated any  better than his remarkable contemporary, Dr Wilhelm Reich, who  had the misfortune to re-discover - as Constable has done - some  of the things that the great German scientist Baron Karl von Reichenbach  (1788-1869) had been investigating. Though pilloried then and  forgotten today, Karl von Reichenbach at least did not die t the  stake or on the scaffold, as so many pioneers have done. But Dr  Wilhelm Reich did. He died in 1957 as the result of incarceration  in a United States prison, and because he had discovered too much.  Such a termination of life is called <em>murder</em>. And justly  so.)</span>
    first book, <em>"They Live in the Sky"</em> <span class="note"><em>They Live In The Sky!"</em>, by Trevor James, appeared in 1958, when he was 26 years old, and was his first book. It  only underwent two impressions and the photographs in the first  were much better and clearer than the second. The brave sponsor  and publisher of this "uncomfortable" book was Dr Franklin  Thomas, and there were plenty who felt no surprise when they learned  that Dr Thomas had died very soon after its appearance. Trevor  James Constable's second, and far better known, book, is <em>"The
      Cosmic Pulse Of Life"</em>, published in 1978 by the Merlin  Press. It discusses at length the ideas of Dr <span
        class="people">Rudolf Steiner</span> and  Dr Wilhelm Reich and likewise the hounding and persecution of  another equally important pioneer investigator of "unpopular"  subjects, Dr Ruth Drown, who was also <em>"legally
      murdered"</em>. </span>, where the (apparently beneficent) contacting entities describe themselves as being <em>"from
      the interplanetary Etheric".</em> Later in the same book, they are responsible for protecting Mr Constable from
    attack by a lower order of unseen entities which I would call <em>"Etheric"</em>, using the occult terminology to
    refer to the unseen "band" closest to the Earth.
  </p>
  <p> Be it noted, therefore, that any reference in the present article holds to the usage of the term as employed in
    the Western Occult Tradition.
  </p>
  <p> Having thus set out the basis of this idea concerning the nature of the Jinn, I would now like to bring in some
    corroborating examples from the field of Psychical Research.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Changes of Temperature and Psychic Phenomena</h2>

  <p> In the typical "Ghost experience", a <em>change in temperature</em> is often felt around, or preceding, the
    appearance of the apparition.
  </p>
  <p> Since, to my knowledge, our experience of heat is directly related to the amount of Infra-red present, then if an
    apparition were created by concentrating or converting localised electro-magnetic energy, one would expect there to
    be a drop in Infra-red (and probably other frequencies) around the phantom, - hence a drop in temperature?
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Matthew Manning</h2>

  <p> Matthew Manning <span class="note">The young British paragnost, Matthew Manning (born 1956)  has obliged not a few doctors and scientists to take "psychic  phenomena" seriously. In June 1974 he was the subject of  extensive tests and experiments on Toronto. Twenty-one leading  scientists, among them Britain's Nobel Prize Winner in Physics  Prof. Dr Brian Josephson, and Dr George Owen, examined Matthew  and his abilities, and having done so they at once stated publicly  that he was probably the most gifted psychic in the western world. <em>The
    scientists' discovery in Matthew of an entirely new brainwave pattern has set a milestone in psychical research</em>. With his  three books and numerous lectures and cassettes and many TV and  radio appearances, Matthew Manning has become known to most households  in Britain and many overseas. He is also a <em>healer</em> with  many remarkable successes to his credit, and there are cases of  people, formerly gravely ill, who have been cured simply by listening  to his tapes.</span>
    the British psychic, describes in his book <em>"The Link"</em> <span class="note">His main writings are: 1. <em>"The
      Link: The Extraordinary Gifts of a Teenage Psychic"</em>.  (Pub. By Colin Smythe, London, 1978.) 2. <em>"In the
      Minds of Millions"</em>. (Pub. W.H. Allen,  London, 1977.) 3. <em>"The Strangers"</em>. (Pub. W.H. Allen, London,  1978.)</span>
    how, when he was sleeping in his boarding school dormitory, "poltergeist" activities would occur. On one such
    occasion a large red circle appeared on the wall, and it became very hot. This - it turned out - was a way of
    attracting his attention, used by the earth-bound spirit of a girl who had died some fifty years before in tragic
    circumstances.
  </p>
  <p> The obvious inference is that the red circle that became hot (so hot in fact, that the people were afraid of a
    fire starting) <em>was a concentration of Infra-red.</em></p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>"Psychic Photographs"</h2>

  <p> There have been in the past many psychic and paranormal photographs. Many admittedly were probably fakes. However,
    a proportion remain which have been authenticated. In his book <em>"Beyond the Spectrum"</em> <span class="note">Cyril Permutt; "Beyond The Spectrum". (Pub. Patrick  Stevens, 1983.)</span>,
    Cyril Permutt surveys many of these photos and he describes the techniques required for securing paranormal psychic
    photography of this kind. <em>He found that the best results could be secured with Infra-red,</em> and this again
    would seem to bear out a theory which I will put forward in the following paragraphs.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The Earth's atmosphere</h2>

  <p> Pursuing the idea of there being various different Planes in the unseen world, which surround the Earth, and
    pursuing also the thought that they might be connected with electromagnetic energy., I began an investigation of the
    Earth's Atmosphere and it's practical structure.
  </p>
  <p> Putting it in a simplified form, it seems that High Energy Radiation (Cosmic Rays, etc.), from the Sun, penetrate
    right through the Earth's atmosphere and are absorbed by the Earth, to be re-emitted as Infra-red, Radiation,
    producing most of the warmth that we experience. The Infra-red is kept in the lower part of the Atmosphere by clouds
    and by the Ionosphere (Ozone Layer) from which it is reflected.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>"Infra-red" denizens could dwell inside Earth!</h2>

  <p> Lower-frequency Infra-red penetrates deep into the Earth. <em>Consequently, if a being had a body of low-frequency
    Infra-red, it could live deep down inside the Earth, interpenetrating what we consider to be solid materiality.</em>
  </p>
  <p> The Ionosphere has - as is presently well publicised - another function: this is the reflection of Ultra-Violet
    coming from the Sun and hence reducing the amount of it that reaches us. Therefore it can be said that
    <em>above</em> the Ozone Layer there is a comparatively high level of Ultra-Violet and a <em>low</em> level of
    Infra-red, whilst <em>below</em> the Ozone Layer there is a much higher amount of Infra-red, but comparatively <em>little
      Ultra-Violet.</em></p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The Angels dwell in Ultra-Violet</h2>

  <p> If we take the Islamic description of <em>ANGELS</em> <span class="note">The ANGELS. See under (<a
      href="https://www.ufoinfo.com/news/FSR_scientific.shtml#3">3</a>) above.</span> as having <em>bodies of Light</em>,
    and if we ascribe this to the lighter or finer end of the spectrum (i.e. the Ultra-Violet), <em>then we have an
      explanation for the age-old tradition that Angels live "in the clouds", i.e., above the Ozone Layer, where
      Ultra-Violet prevails.</em></p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Lower-level creature inhabit Infra-red</h2>

  <p> This is why, I suspect, Cyril Permutt, author of <em>"Beyond the Spectrum"</em>, had greater success with his
    Infra-red photography, since we humans dwell in the Etheric, where Infra-red predominates. It must be comparatively
    rarely that the "FORCES OF LIGHT" come down and help us on our way. Conversely, of course, most "ghost experiences"
    occur in darkness or in dark places, from where the "Forces of Light" (Ultra-Violet) have receded.
  </p>
  <p> From the "occult" point of view, as given in the Western as well as the Eastern Traditions, it may very well be
    that the upper limit of the so-called "Etheric Plane" is the Ozone Layer (Ionosphere), and that above and beyond
    this lies the "Astral".
  </p>
  <p> The tradition that unseen beings originate from different areas within the Etheric (i.e. Dense Etheric) may be
    explained by variations in frequency of Infra-red: i.e. <em>Dense Etheric</em> around 1012 Hz., and <em>Finer
      Etheric</em> nearer 1014 Hz., which would seem to imply that there should be a corresponding frequency gradient
    through the lower part of the Atmosphere, the frequency rising with the height above the Earth's surface. (Whether
    this is a fact or not remains to be seen.)
  </p>
  <p> At this point I would like to make it clear that, whilst it is possible that electro-magnetic energy is the medium
    of the Etheric, it is equally possible that electromagnetism interacts with a finer energy which is the true Etheric
    medium, but that it interacts in such a way as to be like a stain or indicator, showing the form of the unseen
    Etheric/Psychic energy.

  <h2>Baron von Reichenbach</h2>

  <p> The German scientist Baron von Reichenbach <span class="note">BARON VON REICHENBACH (1788-1869). A remarkable pioneering German scientist, who, like so many others whom we have mentioned, <em>had
    the misfortune to be born far ahead of his time</em>. There  is a mysterious vital force or energy that permeates all Nature.  It is bluish in colour. It can be demonstrated visually, by heat,  and by electrical charge, in plants, animals and human beings.  It may well be the most important Force in the Universe. But it  has one strange and perplexing characteristic: it can only be  perceived by individuals of great sensitivity under careful guidance  by sympathetic scientists. In other words, it is in the same predicament  as the study of telepathy, clairvoyance, and other subjects of  Parapsychology. Baron von Reichenbach was not the first human  to have stumbled upon this mysterious force, to which he gave  the name of OD. Two thousand years ago and more, the sages and  gurus of India knew all about it. And they had a name for it.  They called it PRANA (the Life Principle). It was also the <em>Vis
    Medicatrix Naturae (Healing Power of Nature)</em> of Hippocrates  in the days of ancient Greece. It has been rediscovered many times,  and continues to pop up, as the <em>Mana</em> of the Polynesians;   the <em>Telesma</em> of Hermes Trismegistus; the <em>Pneuma</em> of Galen and the Greek Stoics and others; the <em>Astral
    Light</em> of the Kabbalists; the <em>Spiritus</em> of Fludd, and the <em>Magnetic Fluid</em> of Mesmer. And nearly a century after the death of Baron  von Reichenbach, another German, Dr Wilhelm Reich, was rediscovering  it and calling it ORGONE - and lost his life on account of his  "unwelcome" revelations.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="note"> Von Reichenbach had a brilliant career as a metallurgist, building some of the first big steelworks,
    blast-furnaces etc., and achieving vast wealth as an industrialsist. He was also a recognized expert on meteorites.
    But all to no avail. None of that earned him a decent hearing anywhere once it became known that h e had discovered
    this new universal cosmic force and named it OD.
  </p>
  <p class="note"> In 1845 he published his findings. From then until the day of his death in 1869 he and all his
    indefatiguable studies were totally ignored or condemned without a hearing. But they remained the precious
    possession of a small number of scientists and students who have kept the memory of von Reichenbach and his work
    alive for posterity.
  </p>
  <p class="note"> The most important of Baron von Reichenbach's publications are the following:-</p>
  <p class="note"> 1. <em>Untersuchungen uber die Dynamide des Magnetismus, der Elektrizitat, der Warme, des Lichtes, in
    ihren Bezihungen zur Lebenskraft.</em> (2 vols.)(English title:<em> Researches Into The Forces Of Magnetism,
    Electricity, Heat, and Light, in relation to the Life Force.)</em> The English translation by Dr William Gregory,
    Professor of Chemistry in the University of Edinburgh, came out in 1850.
  </p>
  <p class="note"> 2. <em>Odische-Magnetische Briefe.</em> (1852). (English title: <em>"Odic-Magnetic Letters".</em>)
  </p>
  <p class="note"> He also wrote a mass of other material, none of it, I believe, ever translated into English. In his
    native land, Germany, Baron von Reichenbach had a vast reputation as a scholar and a scientist. Today you will not
    even find his <em>name</em> in the <em>Encylopaedia Brittanica! Yet Chemistry, in particular, owes him several
      important discoveries</em>, notably those of <em>paraffin</em> (1830), <em>eupion</em> (1831), <em>creosote</em>
    (1832), and <em>pittacal</em> (1833)! In the field of geology, he was the first person to produce an exact,
    scientific account of the geological formation of Moravia (now part of Czechoslovakia). This was published in his
    <em>"Geologische Mittheilungen aus Mahren"</em>, in 1834.
  </p>
  <p>wrote, in the last century, about what he called <em>"the Odic Force"</em>, visible to sensitives, and emanating
    from each end of a natural crystal, one end being OD POSITIVE (red and warm), and the other end producing OD
    NEGATIVE (light blue and cool). <em>Could these be the Infra-red and Ultra-Violet respectively?</em></p>
  <p> Trevor J. Constable <span class="note">Trevor James Constable. (see under (<a
      href="https://www.ufoinfo.com/news/FSR_scientific.shtml#10">10</a>).)</span> suggests that if one looks through a
    red filter at ordinary daylight for some time and then looks at a living thing without the filter, the aura of that
    thing becomes visible for a short while. This information probably originates with the British Dr W.J. Kilner <span
        class="note">Dr Walter J. Kilner, B.A., M.B. (Cantab.) M.R.C.P., etc.  Some time Electrician to St. Thomas's Hospital, London.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="note"><em>This remarkable man discovered a scientific, physical, method for rendering the human aura
    temporarily visible</em>, and wrote  a remarkable book about it. From 1879 to 1893, he was in charge  of all electrotherapeutic work at St. Thomas's Hospital, and wrote  many learned papers on a wide range of subjects. In 1883 he became  an M.R.C.P. (Member of the Royal College of Physicians). He had  a private practice at Ladbrook Grove, London, then a very fashionable  neighbourhood. In his spare time he was a keen and brilliant chess  player.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="note"> In 1908 he conceived the idea that the human aura might be made visible if viewed through a suitable
    substance, and he experimented (successfully) with <em>dicyanin</em>, a remarkable coal-tar dye. Published in 1911,
    his book was at first called <em>"The Human Atmosphere". Kilner said that there were marked changes in the
      appearance of the human aura in states of health and sickness, and that his viewing screen could be used for
      diagnosis!</em></p>
  <p class="note"> In a review published in the august columns of <em>The British Medical Journal</em> (January 6, 1912)
    a decidedly sceptical view of the whole affair was of course proclaimed. <em>"Dr Kilner has failed to convince us
      that his aura is more real than Macbeth's visionary dagger."</em></p>
  <p class="note"> In making his claim about use of the aura to diagnose disease Kilner was of course only doing what
    clairvoyants have been saying for centuries past, <em>and are still doing today!</em> (Phoebe Payne, one of the 20th
    century's greatest clairvoyantes, used to work professionally from her office in Chelsea, supporting and confirming
    the medical findings of her husband, Dr John Bendit, M.D., and with resounding success, as I know personally, for I
    was their medical patient over quite a long time period. Incidentally Dr Bendit received his PhD. From Cambridge
    University on the strength of his thesis on the psychic and diagnostic powers of his wife! (G.C.)
  </p>
  <p class="note"> Gradually some very important people began to be interested in Kilner's studies and discoveries. Sir
    Oliver Lodge was one of them. But in 1914 the First World War interrupted the work.
  </p>
  <p class="note"> In <time>1920</time> a new and revised edition of Kilner's great book received a far more favourable
    reception in <em>"The Medical Times"</em>. Many reputable medical men were noe endorsing Kilner's views. And in
    March 1922 there was even an enthusiastic review of the book in the prestigious but cautious journal, <em>"The
      Scientific American"</em>.
  </p>
  <p class="note"> But Kilner did not live to see either of these favourable reviews. He died on June 23, 1920, at the
    age of 73.
  </p>
  <p class="note"> Afterwards, an Englishman named Harry Boddington devised the well known <em>"Kilner goggles"</em>,
    which may possibly still be available today in some quarters.
  </p>
  <p class="note"> Kilner's book, more aptly re-titled THE HUMAN AURA, was edited by my good friend Leslie Shepard, and
    re-published in <time>1965</time> by University Books Inc., New York, U.S.A., otherwise it would by now probably
    have "sunk without trace".
  </p>
  <p class="note"> (Incidentally, in 1968 the same American publishers brought out what is probably the only book
    available in English today on Baron von Reichenbach. This is THE ODIC FORCE, LETTERS ON OD AND MAGNETISM, translated
    into English by F.D. O'Byrne, <em>and once again the Foreword is written by Leslie Shepard. As Gurdjieff always
      taught, for every piece of "new knowledge" mankind acquires, ten pieces of "old knowledge" are lost. Undoubtedly
      this is true, but nobody has done more to attempt to attempt to stem the process than Leslie Shepard.</em>)

    century on the human aura, employing magenta filters. Now, if the eye accommodates in the same way as our other
    senses do, then, after looking for some time through the red filter, it may begin to recalibrate the visual range,
    taking red as it were the usual light blue (of the sky in daylight). Hence, when the filter is removed, the usual
    range may, for a short while, extend down into the Infra-red.

  <h2>Clairvoyant faculties</h2>
  <p> This latter idea brings up an interesting explanation for psychics like the Anthropologist Dr <span

      class="people">Rudolf Steiner</span> (1861-1925)  or that his enormous output of books and articles and lectured  will be lost, although it is true that there is still a lot of  valuable material by Steiner (written in an unusually difficult  style of German) which nobody has yet translated into English.</span>

    Suppose that for reasons of exceptional physiology (or possibly only of mental programming) they are able to
    perceive a greater range of frequencies than is normal, and can therefore see into the Infra-red and the
    Ultra-Violet realms?
  </p>
  <p> In conclusion, I would like to bring a few points to the fore:-</p>

  <h2>Man's pollution of both the material level and the finer levels?</h2>

  <p> Ever since the Industrial Revolution, spurred on by 19th century Rationalism, we have been poisoning and
    disturbing life for other types of physical beings on this Planet. <em>Perhaps with the harnessing and mass
      employment of electromagnetism, we have now started on yet a further stage, i.e., the poisoning and disturbing for
      a whole variety of beings dwelling on the subtler levels of this Planet?</em></p>
  <p><em>If so, is it any surprise that many of them should be hostile towards us?</em></p>
  <p> I see no reason to consider the lower unseen kingdom - i.e., the Lower Etheric - to be in any way different from
    the Animal Kingdom in which we ourselves live. Some of the animals here like us humans. Some of them hate us. And
    some are simply benign and objective.
