<p>Everyone agrees that the universe is vast and old and loaded with galaxies and stars. Almost nothing in science is
  more obvious. And because of this, and the foundation stone faith of science in the "Uniformity of Nature," almost no
  intuition is stronger than that the universe is filled with life. There are many people for whom all that is required
  to settle that question is one good look at the night sky. The methods and attitudes of science are more slow afoot,
  however, yet perhaps more sure. The factor in the Drake Equation which takes "one good look at the night sky" is
  R<sub>*</sub>.</p>
<p>R<sub>*</sub>, the rate of star formation in our galaxy, seems a straightforward matter, and in fact there is very
  little debate. If we have a reasonable understanding of star birth, we can look to likely galactic locations and make
  a direct estimate. Or, if we have a reasonable history/timescale of the galaxy and a good star count, we can divide
  stars by time and get another estimate. Both approaches have been taken and the results are given with an aura of
  confidence: our galaxy has averaged about 25 star births per year, and has perhaps slowed down to between 1 and 10
  starbirths per year in its current mature stage of development.</p>
<p>This author prefers to alter the meaning of R<sub>*</sub> to remove some of the confusion which enters later
  factor-analyses in the Drake Equation. Because some stars are never suitable for life-formation, and others become
  unsuitable as their life histories progress, it seems appropriate to settle the "star question" all at one at the
  beginning, and to eliminate unsuitable categories of stars now. This amounts to changing the concept R<sub>*</sub> to
  R<sub>&#9788;</sub>, the rate of "sun-formation" in the galaxy. "Sun" is here defined in its limited sense as a star
  possessing the proper lifespan, metallicity, and force-environment (re: Luminosity; stability; companion stars) such
  that a life-advancing timescale and planet-formation were at least possible.</p>
<p>How many proper stars or suns are born in the galaxy per year? The question is less difficult than it may seem. In
  fact there is also little debate about it in the literature. The key assumptions are regarded as conservative:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Life in advanced forms needs a long time to evolve, perhaps 2 to 6 billion years. Any proper star should
    have a lifetime at least that long;</li>
  <li>Life in advanced forms needs a planet to develop upon. Any proper star should have arisen from a
    molecular cloud rich in heavy elements so as to make planet formation at least possible;</li>
  <li>Life in any form needs a hospitable energy environment, not involving wild energy swings and radiation
    bursts. Any proper star should allow stable orbits for rotating planets and planets beyond radiation flare
    zones.</li>
</ol>
<p>Assumption "a" eliminates all fast-and-hot burning blue giant stars of the so-called O, B, A, and upper-F classes.
  Assumption "b" eliminates all so-called first generation stars, stars arising early in the history of the galaxy from
  the only available elements of that era: hydrogen and helium. Forming as they did before the building and dispersal
  (by supernovas) of the heavy elements, there was no heavy material to initiate planetary cores, ergo no planets, no
  base upon which to evolve ecologies.</p>
<p>Assumption "c" eliminates several categories of stars. No stars close to the galactic center are candidates due to
  extreme violent energy environments throughout the nucleus area. In fact it has been postulated that the nucleus
  occasionally erupts violently in extreme forms of radiation outbursts, the waves of which would scour at least the
  near-nuclear systems of life <span class="source">Clarke 1981</span>. Such outbursts could be violent enough to
  destroy ecologies galaxy-wide unless their systems were shielded in the galactic arms when the "killer wave" passed
  by. On the other hand such shock waves could be the impetus for new star-system condensation and be ultimately a
  "biogenic" wave instead. Either way, the concept of the Milky Way as an occasionally explosive Seyfert galaxy brings
  an unknown but potentially time-synchronizing element into the discussion about the level of advancement of galactic
  ecologies.</p>
<p>Other stars are eliminated by assumption "c" as well. No small cool red-dwarf stars or so-called M and Lower-K
  classes are proper suns. Their relatively dim heat sources require planets so close as to be at risk from solar
  flaring and to be gravitationally locked (one face always roasting while the other freezes). A third category,
  multiple star systems, might be eliminated due to the planetary formation and orbital destabilization problems caused
  by the gravitational dynamics between the close stars. Many multiple star systems have been shown to all stable
  close-in planetary orbits, however, and the estimates of acceptable multistar systems vary from 10 to 90% <span

      class="source">Dole 1964</span> <span class="source">Harrington 1977</span>. </p>
<p>When we take our "good look at the night sky" with these restrictions in mind, we find that our galaxy has about 250
  billion stars. Eliminating the mass at the nucleus and the non-heavy-metaled star systems of the halo, we are left
  with about 100 billion disk stars. Getting rid of the few large bright stars and the many small dim ones, and about
  half of the remainder which exist in multiple systems (keeping the other 50% of the sun-like multiple partners), we
  are graced with a total of about 6 to 15 billion "proper stars," or suns. </p>
<p>These are the later generation stars of the lower F, G, and upper K classes, most single but some in permissible
  double-star arrangements, and all in the galactic disk. If these stars formed at a somewhat regular rate across
  galactic history, there would have been about one per year. Because we are interested in the formation rate far back
  into the past (5 billion years ago when our solar system was being born) so as to estimate civilizations of our level
  of advancement or greater, perhaps this would be the most accurate figure to accept. Our system formed about halfway
  into the current lifespan of the galaxy. The use of R<sub>&#9788; </sub>= 1 is, if anything, conservative, as there
  was certainly an initial period in galactic history when no high-metallicity stars formed whatever, and so the proper
  stars we count are probably more bunched toward our own time frame. But, R<sub>&#9788;</sub> = 1 is an acceptable
  starting point... and 6 to 15 billion sun-like environments.</p>
<p>Such a beginning springboard of the imagination could lead a prominent scientist such as <span class="people">Philip Morrison</span>
  of <a href="/org/us/region/ma/MIT">MIT</a> to state <q>it is both timely and feasible to begin a serious search for
    extraterrestrial intelligence</q>, while almost simultaneously declaring about ufology: <q>I have now, after a
    couple years of fairly systematic listening and reading, no sympathy left for the extraterrestrial hypothesis</q>
  (quoted in Ridpath 1975). </p>
<p>As this is on the surface of things an extremely puzzling dichotomy of positions, and yet one which seems to
  accurately reflect establishment scientific thinking, we must proceed on in search of some explanation.</p>
