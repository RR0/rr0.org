<p>Whereas there is almost no confusion about the vast numbers of proper stars, there is an apparent disagreement about
  planetary systems around them. This "debate" evaporates into a near uniformity of opinion once it is unraveled,
  however. Planet theorists and observational astronomers are arguing about whether clear evidence exists as yet for an
  extra-solar planetary system, leading some listeners, perhaps, to conclude that scientists think that planets are
  rare. Actually, astronomers are nearly universal in their belief that although planets are extremely difficult to
  detect with our current tools, they are commonplace, almost ubiquitous in the galactic disk. David Black, one of the
  most eminent planetary researchers, has stated that "Current planetary theories suggest that planets should be the
  rule rather that then exception" <span class="source">Black 1987</span>. In fact he asserts that if, once our
  technology improves, we cannot find large numbers of other planetary systems, we will have to revise our whole theory
  of star formation.</p>
<p>Confidence in numerous planetary systems is based upon more than pure theory. Several lines of research have
  indicated the overwhelming likelihood of such systems. They include:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Since, in terms of the mechanisms of formation, stars and planets differ from one another only in the
    amount of mass originally involved in their condensation, the formation of a <em>second</em> star orbiting about a
    primary is essentially no different than the formation of a big planet. Multiple stars are, therefore, planetary
    systems wherein at least one "planet" condensed from a lump of the cloud which was so large that it allowed nuclear
    fusion in the core, and the "planet" became self-luminous, a second star. We can see and count such "planetary
    systems" quite easily. About one half of our disk stars seem to be in such systems, and on that observation alone
    the pheonomenon of a larger mass with smaller masses allied to it must be common. Unless there is something
    unforseenly unique about stellar-sized objects which favors their formation while blocking that of slightly smaller
    planet-sized objects, planetary systems must be at least as common as double stars.</li>
  <li>Our own solar system provides several, not one, examples of such systems. Not only do we have our system
    at large, but also several mini-systems in the moons of the Jovian planets. Large rotating centers-of-mass seem to
    naturally acquire secondary bodies revolving about them. An intriguing added fact that the elemental composition of
    our solar system almost precisely matches the composition of the galactic disk leads to a further intuition as to
    the normalcy of our situation. Given similar basic materials and forces, what took place here should have taken
    place elsewhere in the galaxy as standard practice. Leading planetologists John Lewis and Ronald Prinn say: <q>It is
      widely, but not universally, accepted that stars form from moderately dense nebulae comprising gases and dust with
      overall elemental abundances essentially identical to those in the sun and in other normal (Main Sequence)
      hydrogen-burning stars</q> <span class="source">Lewis &amp; Prinn 1984</span>. </li>
  <li>Several physical measurements have indicated the probable existence of planets around specific nearby
    stars. These measurements include gravitational tugs or wobbles caused by the pull of large unseeable objects on the
    stars, or infrared indications of circumstellar dust disks (expected accompaniments of planet-formation), or the
    slow rotational movements of stars (as if they had transferred some of their rotary motion to other bodies which now
    revolve about them) <span class="source">Hobbs 1986</span> <span class="source">Hecht 1987</span> <span
        class="source">Gatewood 1987</span>. Recent Doppler shift work by Campbell seems to confirm our positive
    expectations on the common occurence of planets around nearby stars <span class="source">Waltrop 1987</span>. </li>
</ol>
<p>The subsequent conclusions of almost all planetary theorists and astronomers are optimistic and eminently
  reasonable:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Planets are a natural ordinary feature of the cosmos;</li>
  <li>Only our inadequate technology prevents us from directly settling the question. To this position, the current
    author would add the following corollary, which is the view of almost everyone interested in ETI;</li>
  <li>Probably <em>all</em> the sun-like stars in the galactic disk, as defined above, will have planetary systems. In
    the terms of the Drake Equation, the fraction of "suns" which are accompagnied by planets is very close to unity
    (f<sub>p</sub> = 1). There are perhaps 6 to 15 billion sun-like disk stars with associated planetary systems.</li>
