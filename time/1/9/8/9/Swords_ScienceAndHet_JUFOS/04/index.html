<p>Will the right sort of planet revolving at the right sort of distance around the right sort of star produce life? The
  answer seems to be: yes, if it has the right sort of material to work with. Everything to date points to the
  conclusion that the right materials are automatically there. It is a conclusion practically without debate.</p>
<p>We have a convincing concept for the general formation of the elements (everything heavier than hydrogen and helium).
  They are formed ubiquitously in the galaxy in the cores and the death throes of stars. The larger stars disperse these
  elements to space in similar ratios wherever they destroy themselves in their titanic explosions. We have measured the
  composition of the resultant molecular clouds by spectroscopy. It is a pleasing revelation to find that the
  composition of the galaxy at large matches that of our solar system. The crucial fact seems assured: the elemental
  stuff that allowed planets, Earth, and life in our solar system was, and is, available everywhere else in the disk,
  once the galaxy sent through its initial element-building and dispersing stage <span class="source">Fowler 1984</span>
  <span class="source">Wood &amp; Chang 1985</span>. </p>
<p>We find, then, that the proper elements exist ready for further formation, and these elementals are already combining
  to form useful molecules. Some of these molecules are chemically active organics which could lead to biology.
  Especially creative scientists have even imagined life itself being pieced together in space on dust grains or
  cometary particles <span class="source">Hoyle &amp; Wickramasinghe 1980</span>. Whatever the truth of that, it is
  almost a certainty that the chemistry-of-space produces important biological molecules such as amino acids, the
  monomeric units of proteins <span class="source">Ferris 1984</span> <span class="source">Greenberg 1984</span>. Such
  substances and others of importance have been found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites <span class="source">Engel &amp; Nagy 1985</span>
  <span class="source">Irvine 1987</span>. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Around 4 billion years ago, showers of comets and meteorites may have carried the basic compounds of life to
    Earth. During their encounters with Halley's Comet, the Vega and Giotto spacecraft detected many of the elements
    necessary for life. Analyses of meteorites and cometary dust that have fallen to Earth have shown us that these
    interplanetary objects are often rich in organic material <span class="source">William Irvine, University of Massachusetts</span>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These discoveries are important in that they add three almost certain pieces to our vision of the formative days of
  planetary systems and earthlike worlds:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>chemical reactions between the elements are so programmed that massive quantities of organic chemicals
    are made in space and exist in the heavy molecular clouds from which planetary systems form;</li>
  <li>much of this organic substance condenses into chondritic dust and lumps which form the basis for early
    planetary cores, contributing ready-made organic chemicals to the neonatal planets;</li>
  <li>even after planet formation, more lumps and dust (a carbonaceous meteoric rain) continue to fall into the
    new environments of the "earths," seeding them with potentially biogenic compounds.</li>
</ol>
<p>This should be happening, and did happen in the past, all over the galaxy: billions of earths soaking up a
  prebiological rain. The right stuff is present at the right time. Is this enough to ensure life?</p>
<p>When our chemists began to simulate the primordial atmosphere and energy conditions, they were delighted to discover
  that these original circumstances spontaneously began creating the chemical for life. For two decades the advances
  have been continual and positive <span class="source">Calvin 1975</span> <span class="source">Dickerson 1978</span>
  <span class="source">Hartman &amp; al. 1985</span>. The primitive conditions not only produce the right biochemicals
  but they seem to do so in a non-random way. Chemistry's products are determined, and not just anything is possible.
  Certain atomic arrangements (for example, just certain amino acids or nucleic acid bases) are strongly favored over
  other arrangements in the same biochemical classes of compounds. There seems to be a limited set of biochemical units
  out of which earthlike life, and presumably all galactic life, can be constructed.</p>
<p>The linking together, or polymerization, of these small units into the vital structures of proteins or nucleic acids
  is currently impossible to imitate in our labs in short time frames. Nevertheless, three lines of reasoning lead us
  confidently to suspect that such polymerization occurs on orderly, rapid and probably uniform fashions on Earthlike
  worlds: </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Several polymerization mechanisms have been researched and a few seem to work. They involve high-energy
    sources (e.g., UV-radiation, lightning, volcanic heat) and high-surface-areas for encouraging catalysis (such as on
    the bubbles of sea-foam or in the matrices of clay materials). All of these conditions should be available
    galaxy-wide. Related work, such as the melting of pure biochemical monomers together, and analyzing the resultant
    products, again shows that not just anything is possible. These melts yield a surprisingly limited variety of
    polymers.</li>
  <li>A second line of reasoning involves attempts to calculate the most stable aggregation of molecules, the
    molecular alliance which would have the best chance to persist in primitive planetary environments. The winners seem
    to be those aggregates which ally proteins and nucleic acid polymers, the same crucial alliance which lies
    universally at the basis of Earth's life <span class="source">Eigen &amp; al. 1981</span> <span class="source">Schuster 1984</span>.
  </li>
  <li>The third line of reasoning is a deduction from a single observation. <em>Whatever</em> route the
    biochemicals took to form polymers and beyond to simple life, it was not difficult and it happened very rapidly.
    Life appeared in its simplest forms almost as soon as the Earth has cooled and settled enough to permit it <span
        class="source">Groves &amp; al. 1982</span> <span class="source">Ferris 1987</span> <span class="source">Gould 1978</span>.
  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>On Earth, life began almost as soon as the planet was cool enough to form seas. It is typical, there may be as
    many as 10 billion Earth-like planets in our Milky Way alone. Today we contemplate a universe teeming with life,
    some of which may be intelligent <span class="source">Bernard Oliver, chief, NASA SETI program, 1987</span>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>More pieces of the prebiological puzzle continue to come to light. The discovery of microspheres, bilayered spherules
  which spontaneously form from certain proteins, is another important example. These structures behave much like cell
  membranes, creating differential electric charges on their surfaces and showing division behaviors uncannily like
  living units. Work with these microspheres and other simple pre-biological systems has inspired their discoverer,
  Sidney Fox (1984), to say: <q>The experiments suggest that evolution of molecular complexity was capable of occuring
    from simple beginnings very rapidly... in days or less</q> <span class="source">quoted in Ridpath 1975</span>. </p>
<p>Such optimisms about life formation abound in the cosmochemical and protobiological literature. The trend of the work
  to date supports such optimism. Given the right stuff in the right places (a situation which is the expected galactic
  norm), life will spontaneously and rapidly form. Returning to the Drake Equation, the factor "f<sub>l</sub>" is "1";
  life does it everytime, and quickly. It is the basic biochemistry of the universe.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The elements required for life?carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur?originate in the
    formation of stars. Then they evolve into larger organic (carbon-based) molecules in space between the stars. In
    primitive planetary environments they combine into the building blocks of life, evolve into enzymes and the genetic
    code, organize into complex and stable cell-like strutures, develop self-replication processes, and grow from simple
    to complex living things <span class="source">Donald DeVincenzi, NASA Ames Research Center, 1987</span>. </p>
