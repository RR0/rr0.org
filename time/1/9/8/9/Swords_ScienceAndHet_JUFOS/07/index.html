<p>As we have seen, knowledgeable commentators on <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/index.html">ufology</a> do not object to
  the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses/intelligence/HET/index.html">extraterrestrial hypothesis</a> on
  the basis that there are no extraterrestrials. Some apparently learned commentators do object that any visiting
  extraterrestrials will not look at all like us, and that the anthropomorphic similarity of the described look at all
  like us, and that the anthropomorphic similarity of the described "<a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/etre/index.html">ufonauts</a>" is alone enough to disqualify those reports
  as fantasy <span class="source">Simpson 1964</span> <span class="source">Dobzhansky 1972</span>. But, whereas a
  precise identity to <em>Homo sapiens</em> in UFO reports would be very difficult to explain in any independent
  evolution scenario, a similarity of basic patterns of structure may be far more likely than is generally recognized.
</p>
<p>Commentators on advanced extraterrestrial life can agree on several foundation stone concepts. This life will be
  based upon the same primary elemental mix, the same solvent, the same basic chemistry, and polymers of amino acids and
  nucleic acids, and the energy systems utilizing phosphate molecules. The life forms will develop in relatively similar
  physical environments, including solar radiation, atmosphere contents, comparative planetary masses, temperature
  similarities.</p>
<p>Observing the apparently required sequence of evolutionary events, one must add to those similarities
  multicellularity, oxygen-use, sexual reproduction, large size, mobility, and, if a manipulative tool-user, evolved
  from a land-dwelling animal form. The large size (required of any intelligent evolved creature) demands several other
  crucial characteristics. The creature must be a large tube with an input end and an output end, a "head" and "tail."
  Nutritional intake, processing, absorption, and rejection proceeds most efficiently on a linear assembly line basis.
  Simple osmosis or other more passive mechanisms cannot deal with a large land-dwelling situation. For the same reason
  there must be a branching tubal circulatory system powered by a pump to reach all cells. The gas transport system
  should use the same tubes to avoid redundancy. The large mass will require a skeleton, which must be internal to allow
  mobility and flexibility. Such an animal will be bilaterally symmetrical along the line of the tube. The head end will
  concentrate the central nervous system and the major information-gathering senses, especially sight and sound. The
  brain must be seriously protected by some enclosure, and be directly and proximately attached to the major sensory
  organs.</p>
<p>These traits are recognized as required or determined by simple logic and physical laws. They are also recognized as
  being wholly dominant in all large land-dwellers and most large water-dwellers on Earth. This is not in any way an
  accident peculiar to our planet, but the result of limited sets of possible forms being tested and retested in the
  fires of universal physics, chemistry, and predator-prey relations. We are beginning to discover these limitations as
  biologists begin to apply physical principles to biological structures and systems. We are beginning to realize the
  power of certain structures or packages of chararacteristics as we learn more about evolution and its parallel or
  convergent production of similar traits. As is now commonly stated in reference to the two dozen or more independently
  evolved eye structures: some ideas are so important that they must independently reoccur many times. If ETI life forms
  did not have <em>very</em> similar visual organs situated close to the brain and above the food-intake orifice it
  would be an astonishing surprise.</p>
<p>The most convincing trend in biology which will indicate the likelihood of structural similarity of advanced life
  forms everywhere comes from the growing application of physical principles to biology. The field is still largely in
  infancy but the initial insights are impressive. Limitations on the variety possible in design turn out to be far more
  restrictive than most biologists suspected. The systems of fluid transport and filtration are based on only 5 and 6
  design principles, respectively, no matter in which life form they appear. An interesting specific example of limited
  design is the "fibrewound cylinder," the commonest skeletal unit on the planet. This structure appears in plants, many
  lower animal forms, and some higher animal forms such as the swimming mammals. It allows lateral bending while
  resisting longitudinal compression, a useful combination of flexibility, mobility, and strength. A particular angle
  for winding the fibre around the cylinder is most efficient in balancing these traits.<em> This exact angle evolved
    several times,</em> let alone the separate evolution of the structure-at-large <span
      class="source">LaBarbera 1986</span>. Mathematics and physics will apply everywhere. So too will fibre-wound
  cylinders wound at <q>terrestrially-observed angles</q>. </p>
<p>Even large biological categories, such as skeletons, have limited numbers of designs. A finite definable number of
  skeletal types has been described and related to earthly forms. Almost every type turns out to exist on Earth, most of
  them with many representatives <span class="source">Reif &amp; Thomas 1986</span>. The message is this: physics,
  geometry, strength of materials limit the number of structural possibilities. Within these limits a dynamic ecology
  will inevitably fill each useful structural niche, usually many times over.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We are not pretending that the outcome of evolution was fully determined or predictable, but we want to argue
    against the supposition that all things are possible. The same design elements show up again and again <span
        class="source">R. D. K. Thomas, Franklin &amp; Marshall University</span>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A rather amazing case of structural determinism has been presented in the relationship between the capacity of
  mammalian bones to accept stress (before breaking) and the maximum likely stress those bones will be called upon to
  withstand in their owner's lifestyle. Investigators looked at small mammals such as rodents, at medium ones such as
  humans, at big ones such as elephants. All the ratios turned out to be <em>exactly the same</em>. Somehow the trials
  and errors of survival in nature have converged <span class="source">Reif &amp; Thomas 1986</span>. Balancing all the
  differences of mass, activity, jumping, running, fighting, every type of mammalian bone became designed to achieve the
  same safety factor: they all can sustain three times the force they are likely to encounter in their lifestyles. This
  is another apparent example of a powerful order-giving trend governed by basic physical principles, which in this case
  makes all bony skeletal mammals astonishingly the same. Similar mathematical relationships exist for hydrostatic
  skeletal structures such as tentacles, tongues, and elephant trunks. Would these same principles apply elsewhere in
  the galaxy? It is difficult to conceive why not.</p>
<p>With these encouragements in mind let us address a prominent observable feature in advanced life forms which some
  scientists seem ready to doubt in an alien life form: the number of limbs, two arms, two legs. How really unlikely is
  it that advanced intelligent life forms evolving elsewhere will have this familiar morphology? A brief examination of
  our own development of this pattern may offer some grounds for more than a purely intuitive comment. Life here
  developed in the seas and moved to the land. Such a pattern must be the pattern elsewhere as well. Earthly life in the
  seas had a long period for advancement before the constitution of the atmosphere allowed movement to the land. Oceanic
  life was therefore quite advanced before any elaborate land life was possible. Given the time scale for such
  atmospheric change, this also should be the general pattern elsewhere. Many sorts of things can ultimately crawl up
  out of the sea to make a living on the land, but only the bony skeletal vertabrates were able to support the size,
  mobility, and potential for intelligence necessary to be a dominant advanced form. Again, and as we have seen, it is
  simple physics. It was therefore the fishes from which came the dominant land animals, amphibians, reptiles, and
  mammals. But what determined the limbs? <span class="source">Radinsky 1987</span></p>
<p>Fish have fins, and it is from the fins that the four-limbed pattern of land-forms developed. Not all fins evolved.
  Fins along the midline of the animals simply disappeared in the land-forms. Why? They weren't useful anymore. They
  didn't help move the animal, and steering and stability in a dense fluid medium were no longer relevant. Fins
  distributed bilaterally in pairs were still useful. Primitive amphibious landlubbers could paddle and flop themselves
  forward using such fins in the way we might use oars in a rowboat. The more out-of-water time spent by the species,
  the more effective these fins needed to be as true walking structures. But why "four," and not six as in the insects,
  or eight as in the octopus, or any other number?</p>
<p>One might claim that the major reason for advanced land animals having four limbs was simply an accident of having
  evolved from fish having four bilaterally paired fins, the pectoral and the pelvic. But fish were not always this way.
  The earliest forms had no fins. Later, all sorts of patterns appeared, including types with more that four bilaterally
  paired. Such experimentation by nature continued until the seas became dominated by the pectoral/pelvic pairs pattern.
  Accidental? Random chance? Almost no serious evolutionist utilizes such explanations today. This pattern became
  dominant because four was, on the average, more useful; it had a survival advantage. Can we understand what that
  advantage was?</p>
<p>Any such understandings, like all scientific queries which probe into the past, cannot be stated with certainty. We
  can, however, make some reasonable assessments based on our current knowledge. To start, since all advanced land life
  develops from bony vertebrate mobile ocean forms, and such forms are tubal and strongly "ended" in structure, these
  developed land forms will be tubal, ended and bilaterally symmetric. The likely numbers of fins, which become
  primitive and evolved limbs, will be "paired": two, four, six, etc., rather than three, five, seven. For all of our
  advanced forms, the "answer" has been four. A large animal not yet possessed of a significant intelligence, might
  benefit on the basis of stability alone from more than two limbs. But the main reason is simply that having only two
  limbs nearly cripples the individual from doing more than one thing at the same time (e.g., standing while defending
  oneself). But then should not six or eight be better yet? There are two possible reasons why this may not be true, and
  as knowledge progresses, we'll probably know exactly why four is not only a useful number but a demanded one.</p>
<p>When an animal is large, every major structure of its body is a major genetic and energy expenditure, and a major
  site of risk. It is a place which can be hurt, infected, and cause death. Adding major structures to a species' form
  is a situation, therefore, which is carefully weighed by nature's struggle of survival. Six, eight, or multi-limbed
  organisms minimize their problems by strategies of dropping limbs or regrowing them, strategies inconceivable for a
  large advanced animal, given the energy and material commitment. Small creatures such as salamanders are probably at
  the limit of those which can afford such a luxury. Large land-dwellers need very strong supportive members. The
  problems of dispensing with strong joints and elaborative circulatory and nervous connections, and then restructuring
  it all later, make it obvious why such a large animal is "stuck with" the number of limbs it has in good times and in
  bad. More is, then, not necessarily better.</p>
<p>The main factor may be the nature of the brain. A big animal is, in a sense, in more than one place at the same time.
  Its brain must be able to independently and effectively control each of its limbs so as to avoid the most trouble and
  accomplish the most gain. The brain seems to be limited as to just how much of this it can do. Perhaps because of the
  stree of monitoring and station-keeping labor it does keeping track of bones, muscles, sense perceptions, and spatial
  relations in the limbs, or perhaps because of something even more fundamental about brain structure, the brain seems
  not to be able to properly focus upon 6 or 7 things at a time. Four things, four limbs, seem easily manageable. Five
  appendages as with prehensile tails or elephant trunks, seem well-managed also. But six? At this point the brain seems
  to fail. The six-legged world of insects operates on a non-independent 3-up/3-down "tripod" walking pattern, most of
  the time. Very little independent control is possible for the minute brains of insects, and so the complex task of
  walking is simplified by a six-limbed robotic system with a stable tripod always on the ground. Instead of six, we
  might better consider their brain's task a task of controlling <em>two</em> sets of three during this apparently
  complex activity.</p>
<p>The octopus is quite intelligent and seems to do a good job controlling its eight limbs, thus contradicting our
  theory. But despite its abilities as one of the Earth's best problem-solvers, the burden of controlling eight limbs
  severely limits what it can do. Tentacle movement is extremely complex and most of it must always be left to
  unconscious robotic control rather than focused intentionality. So limiting is this burden, that despite its high
  intelligence no octopus can learn a maze <span class="source">Reif &amp; Thomas 1986</span>. The explanation for this
  brain-dependent preference for lower numbers of limbs is not clear, but it seems to be clearly true, and points to why
  we have four limbs and not six or more. Does this mysterious "mathematics" of our earthly brains apply only to our
  world? Maybe, but considering that the preference has held so strongly across time and types of species on Earth, one
  wonders if something more powerful and universal may be going on.</p>
<p>The point of the foregoing is not to prove anything but to show that, at the least, the facile dismissal of
  morphologically similar aliens needs a lot more work than authoritarian guesswork. A reasonable case can be made that
  common macroscopic designs happened here and elsewhere on the basic of simple physics, geometry, strength of
  materials, and whatever yet unknown processes limit the controlling abilities of central nervous systems. Further
  arguments might be made for four or five digits on hands and feet, the arrangement of facial features, basic advanced
  reproduction designs, certain patterns of sensory intake and brain processing. But there are also many areas allowing
  much room for variation within these larger structural designs: mass, size, relative dimensions of structures, colors,
  textures, secondary sex characteristics, aging and immune system patterns, consciousness cycles, etc. <em>Exact</em>
  duplication of an Earth-human by an independently evolved ETI is indeed inconceivable by any biologist. Such a UFO
  report would cry out for a <em>non</em>-independent relationship between the reported "alien" and the reporter. The
  first place a researcher would look for such a relationship would be in the imagination of the reporter. But a report
  of a morphologically <em>similar</em> but non-identical alien seems a totally different matter. It is intriguing in
  fact to note, that on the facts and reasoning discussed above, these reports tend to agree with those things deemed
  likely to be universal, while differing in those things we know may differ <span class="source">Bower 1969</span>
  <span class="source">Webb 1976</span>. Such an "inspired" dichotomy might well be seen as a positive aspect of the
  reports than a reason to dismiss them.</p>
