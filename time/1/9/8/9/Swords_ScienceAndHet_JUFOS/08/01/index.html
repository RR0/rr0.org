<p>Writings concerned with ETI almost always admit that interstellar travel is not only possible within the limits of
  what we know and can project but that advanced civilizations could probably manage it if they were so motivated. It
  should be enough for us to learn from history about the absurdity of assuming that we know what our absolute
  technological limits are. But if vague intuitions about history aren't enough, we need only to look at the present.
  Any serious perusal of the writings of Robert Forward, among others, should convince a reasonable person that even
  extensions of today's technologies could achieve travel to the neareast stars in travel times of twenty or one hundred
  years <span class="source">Forward 1984, 1985</span>. Nuclear fusion designs and lightsails seem most concrete, and
  anti-matter engines are much written about as well <span class="source">Forward 1982</span> <span class="source">Bond 1977 Winterberg 1983</span>.
  Certainly we and others will uncover other methods as our knowledge progresses. </p>
