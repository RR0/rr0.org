<p>The subsequent two factors in the Drake Equation, f<sub>i</sub> and f<sub>c</sub>, which concern themselves with the
  advance of life in complexity until it achieves intelligence and tool-using civilization, are usually considered
  together, and often an arbitrary benchmarks on an inevitable progression of bio-abilities. Some years ago opinions
  concerning biological advance would have been largely intuitive. Now the answer is essentially certain. Life
  inevitably advances in complexity. This insight is the gift of one of the twentieth century's great discoverers, Ilya
  Prigogine <span class="source">Prigogine 1980</span> <span class="source">Nicolis &amp; Prigongine 1977</span>. </p>
<p>Prigogine solved the paradox of an evolving life-force in a thermodynamically dissipating universe by demonstrating
  the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li type="a">If an entity is both unstable (i.e., malleable, alterable, flexible, changeable) and self-organizing
    (i.e. capable of structuring and maintaining itself),</li>
  <li type="a">and such an entity is "perturbed" (i.e. challenged, altered, stressed, damaged) by some force,</li>
  <li type="a">then that entity will re-organize itself taking the perturbing force into account. It will tend to
    maintain its previous talents, while adding to them something which contends with the offending perturbation. It
    will become "more clever" in existing. </li>
</ol>
<p>Such great insights always have the characteristic of being "obvious," once someone finally sees them.</p>
<p>Life forms are quintessential "unstable, self-organizing systems." Unless the perturbations they face are so
  disruptive as to kill, they will advance, they will evolve. Although this "advance," through extinctions and difficult
  times, is not uniform, the arrow of time and the arrow of bioevolution generally are in step.</p>
<p>All accross Earth's surface and Earth's time, perturbations and restructurings have been taking place. Uncounted
  numbers of biological trials and errors have offered themselves up for testing by the physical and living environment.
  The winners have survived. Some writers have suggested that we make very risky judgments about advanced life in the
  galaxy when we base our thoughts on the "single case" of life on Earth. "Planetary chauvinism," <a
      href="/people/s/SaganCarlEdward/index.html">Carl Sagan</a> and others call it. Surely life fills the galaxy in
  unthought variations. Perhaps. But, whereas we are probably at great risk to apply specific macroscopic appearances
  from Earth forms to other galactic life, concerning the fundamental patterns of life there may be little or no risk at
  all. The patterns of design and basic structures of our life forms are neither random nor inflexibly linked to some
  peculiar or singular set of conditions on this planet. Our life forms do not represent "one case." They are the
  consummation of the experiments of billions of years to find the tools of survival, the structures and behaviors that
  work. And we have already seen how much alike the earthlike physical environments throughout the galaxy should be.</p>
<p>Support for the idea of common patterns of advanced life comes from more than intuition. Concrete evidence lies all
  about us. It is called convergent evolution. In isolated ecologies we see life forms which not only occupy similar
  niches but have also developed similar sizes, shapes, functional structures, and even behaviors. Life, through all the
  experiments-to-exist, finds and refinds the paths to success. Convergence of form and behavior implies that "getting
  it right" involves a limited number of structures and abilities for each task. Our world separately evolved two kinds
  of bats, animals so alike that we didn't recognize their evolutionary separateness until very recently <span
      class="source">Pettigrew 1986</span>. We have marsupials almost indistinguisable from placentals. We have mammals
  (dolphins) looking like fish (sharks) looking like reptils (mosasaurs). We have two dozen independently developed
  kinds of eyes. Some things obviously work and some don't. Some are so valuable that they are bound to arise many
  times. As biologists begin to take more and more physics into account in their discipline, it will be seen that the
  forms and abilities of organisms can not be infinitely variable in their basic patterns. And the same physics will
  operate throughout the galaxy <span class="source">Reif and Thomas 1986</span>. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>Parallel or convergent evolution is a common phenomenon. Hence we see on Earth repeated, but separate,
    appearance of advantageous characteristics such as multicellular organisms, eyes, or wings. Such evolutionary
    developments are therefore not unlikely in living systems elsewhere in space</q> <span class="source">John Billingham, NASA Ames Research Center, 1986</span>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intelligence, or encephalization, has been shown to be part of the strong trend of complication in bio-development as
  well <span class="source">Russel 1981</span>, and our own advanced intelligence is viewed as the product of a sequence
  of events which could as well operate on other life forms of our world should have failed.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>The view that mankind's development was a lucky chance, and the only one, may perhaps be not quite right. It may
    well be that nature was making a number of experiments in homonization... It's quite conceivable that, given the
    same starting conditions, and given enough time and evolutionary opportunity, it could happen more than one</q>
    <span class="source">Philip Tobias, University of Witwatersrand &lt; Ridpath 1975</span>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reflecting on these matters, David Attenborough argued that, if man became extinct and vacated the top of the
  intelligence niche in Earth's ecologies, there exists <q>a modest unobstrusive creature somewhere that would develop
    into a new form and take our place</q> <span class="source">Attenborough, D.: <em>Life on Earth</em>, London: Collins</span>.
</p>
<p>Without quibbling about the exact details of similarity between ours and other planets' life forms, the consensus of
  the litterature upon the Drake Equation factors f<sub>i</sub> et f<sub>c</sub> is: once life begins on a long-existing
  earthlike planet, the advance to intelligence and tool-using civilization is inevitable. f<sub>i</sub> and
  f<sub>c</sub> are "1." </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>Something like the processes that on Earth led to man must have happened billions of other times in the history
    of the galaxy. There must be other starfolk... these non-human creatures of great learning have doubtlessly been
    sending explorative expeditions through interstellar space for countless millenniums</q> <span class="source"><a
