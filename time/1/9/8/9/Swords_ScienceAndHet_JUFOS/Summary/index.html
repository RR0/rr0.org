<p>There have been many goals of this paper and many issues treated. The following general positions have been
  defended:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li type="a">The UFO phenomenon is a proper field of scientific study.</li>
  <li type="a">Some UFO researchers have proceeded with the elementary first steps of the scientific method in a proper
    fashion.</li>
  <li type="a">Some UFO researchers have pursued the more advanced steps of the scientific method properly, albeit with
    the difficulty expected in a complex, uncontrollable, de novo science.</li>
  <li type="a">The <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses/intelligence/HET/index.html">ET hypothesis</a> is a
    proper alternative hypothesis for use in evaluating UFO reports.</li>
  <li type="a">Reasonable scenarios within the ET hypothesis are consistent with debated and puzzling characteristics of
    many unexplained UFO reports.</li>
</ol>
<p>And, concerning the possibility that an advanced ETI civilization could be visiting our planet, it is easy to
  conceive why the following specific characteristics of the UFO phenomenon would follow:</p>
<ol start="6" type="a">
  <li type="a">UFO experiences would not be able to be controlled or easily predicted by Earth scientists.</li>
  <li type="a">UFO experiences might be deliberately made confusing whenever total secrecy was not possible or
    desired.</li>
  <li type="a">"Good" (related to ETI) UFO cases would be relatively rare, buried within a multitude of mundane
    experiences.</li>
  <li type="a">Some UFO experiences might appear to be deliberately "staged" to accomplish some specific purpose.</li>
  <li type="a">"Magical" or "impossible" characteristics of some experiences might rather be manifestations of
    ultra-advanced technology according to the "Clarke Law" of the impact of such technology on relative
    primitives.</li>
  <li type="a">Occasional awarenesses or subtle programmed information might be transferred, but never concrete physical
    evidence.</li>
</ol>
<p>These last comments are highlighted simply as a reminder that the rejection of some reports, or the whole study area,
  on the basis of "absurd or confusing content" is another inappropriate attitude in this ETI context. Such a list as
  above may be a bit depressing for the scientist who would much rather be the controller than part of the controlled,
  but it is a possibility well within our concept of the universe and what could be going on around us.</p>
<p class="exergue">I cannot presume to describe, however, what UFOs are, because I don't know; but I can establish
  beyond reasonable doubt that they are not all misperceptions or hoaxes <span
