<p>This conviction that there is little (technologically) to prevent ETI from traveling to the stars has inspired a
  "back door" argument that ETI doesn't exist. It is an argument of a puzzling sort. It is dominated with peculiar
  assumptions, even prejudices, and it fails the test of logic <span class="source">Freitas 1983ab, 1985</span>.
  Nevertheless, it has received an apparently serious hearing in the literature, giving one some concern about
  presumptions and prejudices playing overly important roles in scientific discussion. Perhaps, though, this is better
  viewed as a healthy willingness to explore new concepts, however unlikely.</p>
<p>The argument is called the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses/intelligence/HET/FermiParadoxe.html">Fermi
  Paradox</a>, after <a href="/people/f/FermiEnrico/index.html">Enrico Fermi</a>, who allegedly first, even casually,
  formulated it. The thinking goes, in its briefest form:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li type="a">if lots of ETI exists, and </li>
  <li type="a">if they can travel from star-to-star in any reasonable time-frame, then</li>
  <li type="a">because the galaxy is so old and many of the ETI's comparably old with it, the earliest ETIs will have
    had plenty of time to travel to all the stars many times over.</li>
</ol>
<p>But, since we have no evidence of them visiting here, one of our assumption must be wrong. Conclusion: since the case
  for possible space travel technology seems secure, it can only be that no such ETI existed in the first place <span
      class="source">Tipler 1980</span> <span class="source">Martin &amp; Bond 1983</span>. </p>
<p>Most readers will have already spotted the flaws in this position, but, especially for <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/index.html">ufology</a>'s sake, it is useful to point out the major fallacies. The initial
  prejudice which is apparent to anyone even midly conversant with the UFO phenomenon is the cavalier assumption that we
  have no evidence whatever which could be interpreted as ETI visiting this planet. Most serious UFO researchers would
  be willing to admit that we have no <em>conclusive</em> evidence for an extraterrestrial visitation, but to say that
  nothing in our recent, or even distant, history might be so interpreted bespeaks of a profound prejudice or ignorance
  of some kind. In a straightforward way, the whole trust of the ETI literature should lead one to an intense research
  interest in the mysterious elements of the UFO phenomenon, as it is in these elements that the predictions of the <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses/intelligence/HET/FermiParadoxe.html">Fermi Paradox</a><a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses/intelligence/HET/FermiParadoxe.html"></a> reasoners would be borne
  out: that is, by every scientific line-of-reasoning, ETI should have visited our system. Any refusal of interest in
  investigating the UFO phenomenon, using an ETI concept as one working hypothesis, should surely be astonishing.</p>
<p>But, for the moment, we may set aside this problem and move on to a second, equally troublesome one. This second
  fallacy or unnecessary assumption was originally hidden between the lines, but is now openly discussed in the body of
  <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses/intelligence/HET/FermiParadoxe.html">Fermi Paradox</a><a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses/intelligence/HET/FermiParadoxe.html"></a> articles. The assumption
  begins with the view that, if ETI visited our solar system, the evidence of these visitations would be overt if not
  overwhelming. This rather <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/culture/litterature/index.html">"science-fiction" vision of ETI
    activity</a> seems to pervade all thinking by the Paradox supporters. They seem to have grave difficulty imagining
  their ET-travelers as being anything other than colonizers.</p>
<p>When one speaks of <q>colonizing</q>, giving <q>overt display</q>, or <q>leaving obvious evidence about to be
  observed</q>, we are talking about behavior, and we are talking about motivation primarily. Almost everyone addressing
  the topic admits that it is a dangerous game to guess what alien behavior and motivation would be, and <em>that </em>wisdom
  alone should place the "colonization hypothesis" into perspective as just one of many possible ideas. A certain sort
  of reflecting upon possible behavior and motivation is not dangerous however, if we display the proper attitude. Such
  reflection will be objective if we do not arbitrarily select just one motivation or behavior and then build absolutist
  conclusions out of that viewpoint. Some consciousness of alternatives is healthy surely. </p>
