    <p>GULF BREEZE — A model spaceship resembling the UFOs reportedly seen above Gulf Breeze was found in a house once
      occupied by the man whose photographs started a UFO craze that focused worldwide attention on this community.</p>
  <p><a href="/people/w/WaltersEd/index.html">Ed Walters</a>, the enthusiast who co-wrote a nationally
      published book about the UFOs, denied any knowledge of the model Saturday and said someone who wants to discredit
      him must have put the model in the house.</p>
  <p>"They will do whatever necessary to debunk a case," said <a href="/people/w/WaltersEd/index.html">Walters</a>,
      who refused to take a lie detector test but signed a sworn statement denying any knowledge of the model UFO.</p>
    <p>Gulf Breeze Mayor Ed Gray III, whose city has become the focal point for UFO</p>
    <p>(...)</p>
    <p>The model, constructed of four plastic foam plates and some drafting paper, was found by the resident of a house
      at 612 Silverthorn Road in Gulf Breeze. The man who found the model also signed a sworn statement xxxxxx he did
      not know</p>
    <p>(...)</p>
    <p>"I was going to install an icemaker, and I needed to turn off the water. I was fooling around in the attic, and I
      was moving insulation aside when I saw it. I never would have found it if I hadn't been looking for the
      pipe." </p>
    <p>"The model was 9 inches long across the top and 5 inches deep. Made of "two nine-inch foam plates attached to two
      six-inch foam plates; a six inch square blue-color gel (plastic film) and on six inch round orange paper ring, a
      3.5 inch long tube, and a 2 inch wide paper ring between the 2 nine-inch plates. There were windows drawn on the
      model which was covered with drafting paper. "</p>
