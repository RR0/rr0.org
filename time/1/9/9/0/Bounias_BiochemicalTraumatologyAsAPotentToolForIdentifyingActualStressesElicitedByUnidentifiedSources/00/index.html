<p>One of the most challenging aspects of anomalous phenomenon studies is the question of their reproducibility,which is
  often considered as a condition for a study to be considered scientific. Another critical aspect in such a study is
  the validity of human testimonies, which is the object of some specific branches of human sciences and has led to a
  number of famous controversies in terms of what is science (Abelson, 1974; Bauer, 1979) or what the value of
  testimonies is (Loftus 1979). [See: Sturrock, 1987, for review in a similar area.]</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are several scientific domains, undoubtedly accepted as full sciences, that do not actually need
  any experimental reproducibility. For instance, in paleontology, no one can say when and where the next discovery of
  an Australopithecus skeleton will occur, although this is never depicted in a joking manner as, for instance,
  observations (even including material evidence, such as photographs or sonar recordings) concerning the Loch Ness
  Monster (see Bauer, 1987, for review).</p>
<p>Now the major problem is to record indisputable traces of something that is presently interpreted as an unknown or
  anomalous event, in view of further classification after more knowledge has been received by the scientific
  community.</p>
<p>
  The aim of this paper is to give an example of how to study the effects of a phenomenon of unknown origin (of the
  UFO-type) on the biochemistry of living nonhuman organisms (i.e., on facts that cannot be suspected of lacking
  objectivity). The question of comparison with controls arises, and will also be dealt with in this study; despite the
  fact that one cannot know where and when such phenomena will occur, so that no experimental protocol and planning can
  be actually organized in view of the comparison of "treated" organisms with untreated ones in as exactly similar
  conditions as possible.</p>
<p>The particular case that will be analyzed here has been widely reported by French newspapers, radio, and TV as the "
  Trans-en-Provence UFO landing." A preliminary report on a first set of experiments was published in the CNESIGEPAN
  Technical Notes (Bounias, 1983a), but major and entirely new aspects of this work had not yet been reported.
