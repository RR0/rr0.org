  Plotting dn versus <i>R</i>/<i>d<sup>n</sup></i> with the upper 2 and 3 points give a fairly good estimation of
  <i>R</i><sup>max</sup> = 15.0 Ã  0.7 units (nmol per mg). Then, the Hill plot:</p>
<p>


  ln[<i>Ri</i>/(100 - <i>Ri</i>)] = <i>n</i>ln <i>di</i>- ln(<i>L</i>)

<p>
  illustrated by Figure 1B gives <i>n</i> = 2.00 and <i>L</i> = 0.65 m. This reveals that the response varies according
  to d<sup>-2</sup>, like most electromagnetic events. Accordingly, roughly representing the results as (<i>Ro</i>-
  <i>R</i>) versus d<sup>-2</sup> would have given a fairly linear plot (<i>p</i> = -0.97 1; <i>p(t)</i>= 0.02; <i>b</i>
  = -6.59: Figure 1C), <i>i.e.</i>a much better correlation than using natural units (<i>p</i> = -0.580!). Then the
  theoretical curve would actually be:</p>

  <i>Ri</i>= 14.95 + 8 <i>di</i><sup>2</sup>/(0.65 + <i>di</i><sup>2</sup>) (3)

<p>Nothing similar could be obtained from control samples using plants extracted at (D + 730), as illustrated inside
  Fig. 1A.</p>
<p>Raffinose and ribose concentrations exhibit quite a different relation versus distances: minimum values occur at the
  epicenter, whereas maximum ones can be observed at an intermediate distance. Assuming that the energy</p>
