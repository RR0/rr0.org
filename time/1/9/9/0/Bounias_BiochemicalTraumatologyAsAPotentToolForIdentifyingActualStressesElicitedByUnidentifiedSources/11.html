  gradient can be roughly linearized in exponential units, and in a decreasing value from distances to the epicenter,
  one can replot the data using R versus <i>e<sup>-d</sup>.</i>This leads to typical biphasic dose/effects relationships
  (Figures 2A and 2B) as encountered in ligand-receptor interactions (Bounias &amp;
  Pachï¿½co, 1972; Sanchez &amp; Changeux, 1966) (Figure 2C.)</p>
<p>
  The equation of such a phenomenon is rather complex (Bounias, 1987), but highly representative of a number of
  toxicological stresses in plants (Stevens &amp; Merril, 1985) (Figure 2D).</p>

  Threonine and serine exhibit a similar response, except that concentrations reach an intermediate minimum instead of a
  maximum value (Figures 3A and B in small frames).</p>
<p>
  In this case, plotting Ro-R versus <i>e<sup>-d</sup></i> gives curves similar to those on Fig. 2, except that values
  reach zero for <i>e<sup>-d</sup></i>= 1 (Figures 3A and 3B). Similar features encountered under the stress of toxins
  or electromagnetic parameters are shown on Figures 3C and 3D, respectively.</p>

  <i>Alteration of Functional Relationships in Connection With the UE</i></p>
<p>
  It has been shown that the algebraic form of the relations between two biochemical parameters may prove to be a
  sensitive way for evidencing stress effects (Bounias, 1975; Bounias <i>et al.,</i>1987). This might allow the
  characterization</p>
