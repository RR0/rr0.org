    <td><p> The significant correlations obtained by plotting the results with distances from the UE epicenter, suggest
      that the "thing" that happened globally elicited biochemical effects as a reciprocal function of the distance from
      the source. It is noteworthy that in some cases, such as for glucose, a <i>d</i><sup>-2</sup> dependent relation
      was evidenced, consistent with a radiative energy emission.</p></td>

    <td><p> Some apparent exceptions did occur for various carbohydrates and amino acids, but a more detailed algebraic
      study revealed that they were quite consistent with typical cases of biphasic dose/effect pharmacological or
      toxicological relations, including chemical but even physical (electromagnetic) sources of stresses (Sornjen <i>et
        al.,</i> 1982). This confirmed that the "thing" that happened did generate a distance-dependent energetic source
      of stress.</p></td>

    <td><p> In a last step, it was clearly emphasized that dramatic changes from the natural features of functional
      relationships occurred in the samples that were the most exposed to the unknown event. Here, two phases were
      clearly distinguished; in the first one (<i>D</i> + 4), the metabolism of the most exposed samples was shifted to
      the most extreme parts of the normal equations, whereas in the second one it was situated on the extreme points of
      reversed equations. This indicates very deep, delayed physiological effects. Since chemical sources could hardly
      explain such a strong remaining effect after almost two months, the hypothesis of a wavy radiative source remains
      the more likely, since electromagnetic impulses are able to generate delayed responses (Gorczynska <i>et al.,</i>1982).
      From a series of comparisons with known sources of stress (Bounias, 1972; 1973; 1975; 1976; 1979; 1980a; 1980b;
      1983a; 1983b; 1983c), it could be suggested that the observed effects of <i>D</i> + 4 might reflect a stress of
      the same type as would have caused a dim light shock, whereas at <i>D</i> + 40, the symptoms are partly-but only
      partly-consistent with an alteration of the oxidative phosphorylation mechanisms. None</p></td>
