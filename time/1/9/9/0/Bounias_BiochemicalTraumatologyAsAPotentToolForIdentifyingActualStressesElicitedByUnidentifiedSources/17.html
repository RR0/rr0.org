      suggested explications was that somebody might have spread some cement on the area. In this case, the pH of the
      soil should have been modified; the results of pH determinations in the clods gave the results summarized in Table
      13.</p></td>

      significant.</p></td>

    <td><p> It was not the aim of the author to identify the exact nature of the phenomenon observed on the 8th of
      January 1981 at Trans-en-Provence. But it can reasonably be concluded that something unusual did occur that might
      be consistent, for instance, with an electromagnetic source of stress. The most striking coincidence is that at
      the same time the French physicist J. P. Petit was plotting the equations that led, a few years later (Petit,
      1986), to the evidence that flying objects could be propelled at very high speeds without turbulences nor shock
      waves using the magnetohydrodynarnic effects of Laplace force action!</p></td>

    <td><p> It should now be most interesting to determine a catalog of the biochemical effects of electromagnetic
      waves, particularly the spectra of the continuous effects of varying em parameters, such as frequencies,
      intensities modulation and pulses. A number of experimental data found in the literature (Bounias, 1984) and in
      theoretical studies (Veve &amp; Bounias, 1987) suggest that such a program would be of wide importance not only
      for UFO studies, but also, for instance, in medicine (Douss <i>et al.,</i> 1985; Sornjen <i>et al.,</i> 1982) and
      related areas.</p></td>
