<p class="exergue">Oftentimes have I heard you speak of one who commits a wrong as though he were not one of you, but a
  stranger unto you and an intruder upon your world.</p>
<p class="exergue">But I say that even as the holy and the righteous cannot rise beyond the highest which is in each one
  of you,</p>
<p class="exergue">So the wicked and the weak cannot fall lower than then lowest which is in you also.</p>
<p class="exergue">And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree,</p>
<p class="exergue">So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.</p>
<p class="exergue">Like a procession you walk together towards your godself.</p>
<p class="exergue">You are the way and the wayfarers.</p>

  <h2>Dedication</h2>
  <p>Matrix 2 is the result of <a href="../../../8/8/Grace_Matrix/index.html">Matrix</a> plus 2 years of intense work.
    We feel that it is probably one of the most significant works that has even been accomplished. The knowledge
    contained within it is a product of the blood, sweat and tears of many people. The <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/scenario/Abduction.html">abduction</a> and manipulation of human beings by
    other species is a natural process that occurs when the awareness and intelligence of one species is less than
    another. It is the collective goal of many on this planet to raise the awareness and intelligence of the human
    species, as well as the awareness and intelligence of the human species, as well as the awareness and intelligence
    of some alien species, to a point where unmanipulated evolving harmony can occur. The conflict, we feel, is based on
    energetic societal variants called "service to self" and "service to others". It is quite obvious that many species,
    including the majority of humans, do not realize the true possibilities that expanded awareness can bring. We have
    tried to balance the problem of polarities whith in-depth discussions about states of mind that do not require
    polarities, which provides individual entities who read this material with an "out". Since the <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/scenario/Abduction.html">abduction</a> of humans is a primary goal for
    some species, it is important that individual entities know the scope of what is happening to them and why. We have
    looked a lot deeper into what is happening with humans here, including alien mind sets and a construction of the
    societal structures and operation of some species. This information was obtained in the interest of all the species
    involved, and should be digested by all parties involved with this composite multidimensional scenario called
    "reality".</p>
  <p>This book is dedicated to all entities who are growing, learning and teaching ; to all entities that are the
    manipulators and the manipulated ; to all entities that are "victims" and "participants" and to the continued
    evolvement of the Universal Intelligent Matrix that is generating all that they perceive. It is dedicated to those
    who view with judgement or non-judgement - so that they may understand each other. </p></section>
