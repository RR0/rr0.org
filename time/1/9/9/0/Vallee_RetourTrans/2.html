<p>
  On November 19, 1988 the author and his wife (a psychologist by training) visited the site of the Trans-en- Provence
  phenomenon in the company of Dr. Bounias. Weather conditions were dry and clear as we arrived at the home of Mr. and
  Mrs. Nicolai, who collaborated fully with our requests and patiently answered our questions over the next two hours

  position one does have a long view down to the flat area behind the house on the east side.</p>
<p>
  We noted several other structures nearby: a small, one-story stone house near the pump shack, the ruins of a one-room
  stone cabin higher on the hill, and a round cavity lined with stones at the far eastern side of the property. It was
  used at one time as a garbage dump. Only the small house and the pump shelter show evidence of masonry work over the
  last ten years.</p>
<p>
  At the time of our visit, most of the site was overgrown with wild grass and weeds. There were some bare spots along

<p>
  We questioned Mr. and Mrs. Nicolai at length about the sequence and the nature of the work to which the area had been
  subjected since they had</p>
