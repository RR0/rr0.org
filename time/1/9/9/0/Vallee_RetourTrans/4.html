  performed by CNES. However, there remained one avenue of verification, namely a comparison of the soil on the surface
  of the ring itself with the soil at the same spot but just below the surface. Mr. Velasco kindly supplied the author
  with samples (labeled Q1 and Q2) that had been gathered at the same time as the main samples but had not been used in
  the CNES analysis. We were able to perform a series of tests on these samples.</p>
<p>
</p>
<center><b>Sample Analysis</b></center>
<p>
  During 1988 samples Q1 and Q2 were subjected to a number of analyses at a large, well-equipped California laboratory
  with the capability to process both biological specimens and physical substances. Unfortunately there is no civilian
  organization similar to the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Study Group within CNES (GEPAN) in the United States, and
  the analysis of physical evidence alleged to be related to UFO phenomena still carries considerable stigma in
  scientific circles. Accordingly, the analysis was performed as a personal favor to us and not as part of the normal
  work of the corporation in question, and we have agreed to keep its name confidential in any publication of the
  results. The samples are available, subject to the agreement of CNES, to any bona fide research organization that
  might show an interest in reproducing our analyses.</p>
<p>
  The technical staff who conducted the analysis were given the vials containing the Q1 and Q2 samples but were told
  nothing about their origin and nature, except for the fact that they were not hazardous in terms of radioactivity or
  toxicity and could be manipulated in normal fashion in the laboratory. Excerpts from the technical report are given
  below.</p>

<i>Sample Q1</i>
<p>
  This sample has the appearance of damp sand with tiny particles of varying size. It is predominantly beige in color
  with some brown, white, grey, or black particles. There are tiny dark brown fibers with branches that may be plant or
  animal in origin, the term "fiber" being used for lack of a better descriptor. There is evidence of a few insect parts
  (black round bodies with wings or black-brown bodies with a leg). There is an occasional black fiber without branches
  and very few white fibers. There are few black particles which are soft, possibly insect bodies and very few tiny
  black particles that are hard (Figure 2).</p>
<p>

  <i>Sample Q2</i></p>
<p>
  This sample has the appearance of damp sand with tiny particles of varying size. It is predominantly beige in color
  with some white, grey, or black particles. No fibers were seen in the whole sample with the dissecting microscope
  (Figure 3).
