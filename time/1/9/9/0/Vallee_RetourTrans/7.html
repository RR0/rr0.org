  have been masked by the high detector noise at low keV. One field from the examination of Q1 showed some evidence for
  the presence of copper.</p>
<p>
  When changing fields within these samples, the relative abundance of the elements changed somewhat, but all elements
  detected in the sample were present in each field examined, except for the possible copper.</p>
<p>
  Calcium or silicon was the predominant element in all fields examined. The calcium/iron ratio changed by a factor of
  four or less. X-ray mapping was performed for calcium and again for iron in an attempt to see if there was a localized
  source of these elements, but none was identified. Spot analysis of the fibers was identical to the broad scan of the
  same area; however, <i>bremsstrahlung</i>is important at these small dimensions. One large roughsurfaced oval particle
  from Q1 was examined at high magnification and found to have a very low x-ray yield indicative of organic material.
  The Q1b sample with more concentrated black particles did not differ from the Q1a sample.</p>
<p>
  To help understand the results from samples Q1 and Q2, a sample of "house dirt" from a vacuum cleaner bag, and a
  sample of Mount St. Helens ash from Montana were examined. The ash (very homogenous) showed an identical x-ray
  spectrum, dominated by silicon, in each field examined. The "house dirt," however, was very heterogenous. It contained
  aluminum, silicon, calcium, iron, potassium, sodium, copper, and sulfur. The interesting result was the dramatic
  difference in elemental composition between fields. Elements would appear and disappear as fields of view changed.
  These changes did not appear to correlate with the SEM images of the field.</p>
<p>
  No elements were detected in Q1 and Q2 that were not normal constituents of dust and dirt, and the ratio of elements
  does not appear to be unique.</p>

<center><b>Conclusion</b></center>
<p>
  The results of our analysis of the soil samples from Trans-en-Provence are consistent with the statements by the
  witness and his wife regarding the history of the soil. In particular, careful microscopic and physical analysis
  failed to detect any of the substances, such as cement or other construction and drilling materials, that have been
  proposed to "explain" the traces. Our results tend to support the earlier findings of the French laboratories
  consulted by the CNES as well as the truthfulness of the witness' testimony.</p>
