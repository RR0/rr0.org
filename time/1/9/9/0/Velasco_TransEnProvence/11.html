<p>Further analysis was conducted at the Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse (Rangueil Faculty) by dissolving parts of
  the samples in water, dessicating them by ultrasound dispersion and processing them by electronic diffraction. When
  applied to P2, this analysis led to the identification of at least three compounds: BaCa(CO<sub>3</sub>)2,
  (CaO<sub>2</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O) and to a lesser extent Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The first two compounds may have
  been an artifact of the process itself.</p>
<p>When applied to P1b, a larger concentration of (CaO<sub>2</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O) was found in crystalline form. It
  is noteworthy that at least one of the components of this sample is in a mono-crystalline state, which is not found in
  the reference sample (namely P2).</p>
