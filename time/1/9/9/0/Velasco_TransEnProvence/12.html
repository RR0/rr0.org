<p> In order to permit a more objective interpretation of the analytical results, GEPAN entrusted various laboratories
  with the same tasks. Thus the LAMMA analysis laboratory at Metz University was sent part of the soil, both from the
  reference sample and from the hardened ring. The scientists at Metz performed a mass spectrometry analysis by ion
  bombardment. When applied to the ring sample they found the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Negative ion analysis disclosed that the larger black particles (100 microns) exhibited the presence of
    C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O with a significant effective section. They also found ions 63 and 79 which are typical
    of iron phosphate. The negative spectra thus obtained were analogous to those of some polymers or petrochemical
    residues</li>
  <li>Positive ion analysis showed that the black particles differed from the surrounding dirt through the lack of
    Aluminum. The elements Sodium, magnesium and titanium were only present in very small amounts. The dominant
    component was Calcium. Other fragments already found in negative ion analysis confirmed the existence of a
    carbon-based polymer matrix.</li>
</ul>
<p> From these tests it was concluded that the larger black particles appeared to be a combustion residue. </p>
