<p> The report by Mr. Nicolai describes an observation made in daylight from a distance of about 30 meters, for a
  duration measured in multiples of 10 seconds, during which time the phenomenon was stationary. The investigation
  failed to discover any indication, either in the behavior or in the discourse of the witness, that would cast doubt on
  his report because of exaggeration, invention, or distortion. However, the absence of evidence is not evidence of
  absence and this lack of grounds for doubt does not establish the truth of his testimony.</p>
<p> Complementary efforts were attempted through physical analysis of visible impressions in the environment. The
  particular conditions of the terrain did not allow precise measurement of mass, pressure, or thermal effects. However,
  we were able to show in quantitative fashion that a large-size event had indeed occurred, triggering mechanical
  deformations, heating, and perhaps even the depositing of trace materials. Possible interpretations (shock, friction)
  remain too vague for us to conclude that they absolutely verify the testimony of the witness. </p>
<p>Biochemical analyses (Bounias, 1990) encompassed the effects on photosynthesis, lipids, sugars, and amino acids in
  plants found at the site. Multiple differences were found between the reference vegetal samples collected far from the
  imprint and those that were located closer. In most cases these differences are graphically exhibited as logarithmic
  or bilogarithmic functions of distance, measured away from the center of the imprint. However, current knowledge about
  vegetal trauma is still too fragmentary for us to draw a single, precise conclusion from this remarkable set of
  results. We can only observe that they furnish yet another confirmation that a large-size effect did take place at
  this particular location. Whether or not it corresponds to the description given by the witness remains to be
  proven.</p>
<p> We find ourselves balancing between two expectations: First, the desire to "prove" that the witness' report is
  "true" (or, alternately, that it is "false"); second, the hope to reach a precise physical understanding of the events
  that have taken place, whatever they are. It is important to note that these two aspirations are not contradictory. In
  fact they meet precisely within the scientific mode of reasoning. It is only through understanding that one can
  demonstrate. Conversely, the "proofs" brought to light by physical analysis are only measured by the clarity and the
  precision of their interpretation.</p>
<p> At the present time these "proofs" do remain vague. This state of affairs will last until more advanced research
  programs can address physical and chemical interactions both specifically and systematically. Thus, it is natural for
  the investigation we have presented to ask more questions than it solves. What is important here is that the right
  questions are indeed posed. In this respect the Trans-en-Provence case represents one of the more enriching
  investigations ever undertaken by GEPAN.</p>
