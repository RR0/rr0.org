    <b>Translator's Note</b>
  </p>
  <p></p></center>

The above text is primarily based on the 65-page <i>Technical Note No. 16</i> published by CNES on March 1st, 1983
(CNES, 1983). In view of the space limitations imposed by a Journal article, the structure of the presentation was
simplified and only the most significant illustrations were retained. The section of the Technical Note describing the
analysis of effects on vegetal samples, which is now the subject of a separate, updated publication by Dr. Bounias, was
not included in the translation.<p>
  While the CNES report used fictitious names for the witness and for the town itself in accordance with French privacy
  laws, much of that information has become public knowledge in the intervening time. Therefore we have found it simpler
  to use the actual names throughout.</p>
<p>
  The translator had the opportunity to meet several times with Mr. Velasco, to review manuscript laboratory notes about
  the case, and to travel to Trans-en-Provence on November 19, 1988 to interview Mr. Nicolai and his wife and to visit
  the site with Dr. Bounias. Independent French and Belgian investigators who are still conducting their own analysis of
  the case were also consulted. They were kind enough to report on their work in progress. These interviews, which are
  gratefully acknowledged, highlighted the significance of specific items in the analysis and thus influenced the format
  of the final presentation.</p>
