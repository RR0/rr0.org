  <h2>Translator's Note</h2>
  <p>The above text is primarily based on the 65-page <i>Technical Note No. 16</i> published by CNES on March 1st, 1983
    (CNES, 1983). In view of the space limitations imposed by a Journal article, the structure of the presentation was
    simplified and only the most significant illustrations were retained. The section of the Technical Note describing
    the analysis of effects on vegetal samples, which is now the subject of a separate, updated publication by Dr.
    Bounias, was not included in the translation.
  <p>
    While the CNES report used fictitious names for the witness and for the town itself in accordance with French
    privacy laws, much of that information has become public knowledge in the intervening time. Therefore we have found
    it simpler to use the actual names throughout.</p>
  <p>
    The translator had the opportunity to meet several times with Mr. Velasco, to review manuscript laboratory notes
    about the case, and to travel to Trans-en-Provence on November 19, 1988 to interview Mr. Nicolai and his wife and to
    visit the site with Dr. Bounias. Independent French and Belgian investigators who are still conducting their own
    analysis of the case were also consulted. They were kind enough to report on their work in progress. These
    interviews, which are gratefully acknowledged, highlighted the significance of specific items in the analysis and
    thus influenced the format of the final presentation.</p></section>
