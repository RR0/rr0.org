<p> A series of photographs were taken using an optical microscope with low magnification. In these tests sample P1 was
  divided into two parts, respectively designated as P1a and P1b.</p>

    </table><p>Sample P1a showed heavily compacted dirt with a crust 6 to 7 mm thick, predominantly composed of very dry
    limestone with only a few traces of dessicated vegetation in the form of moss. Curved striations are clearly seen on
    the surface, indicating that this dirt has been exposed to a rubbing effect that has resulted in the abrasion of
    some silicium grains (Figure 16). Further examination disclosed a spot where a small silex had been not only
    imprinted but ground to the level of the surrounding dirt (Figure 17). The soil has been fractured on either side of
    this silex, possibly under a combination of mechanical and thermal action. To the right of this area in Figure 17 it
    appears that the soil is darker and contains small vegetal shoots that have germinated after the gathering of the
    sample. The abrasion effect is less visible in that area.</p>
    <p> Sample P1b comes from the same part of the ring as P1a. It exhibits similar compression effects as well as
      striations. It also shows a darker area that could correspond to foreign material or even to a transformation of
      the surface material (Figure 18). This is clearly observable in Figure 19 and also in Figure 20, where some plants
      are germinating and pushing back the black material.</p>
