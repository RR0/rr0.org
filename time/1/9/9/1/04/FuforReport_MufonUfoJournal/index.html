<p>The investigation into the apparent crash of one or more UFOs outside <span class="place">Roswell, NM</span>, in
  <time>1947-07</time> continued to be the primary focus of the Fund's activities during die last quarter of
  <time>1990</time>.
</p>
<p>The primary goal was to raise at least $10,000 to support the costs of the investigators in identifying additional
  first-hand witnesses, to record their testimony, and to produce a videotaped record of their testimony. A fundraising
  letter requesting donations for the project was mailed to the Fund's supporters; copies of a briefing paper and a
  videotape were offered as premium for contributions of $50 and $100 respectively. As of December 31, the effort had
  generated more than $16,000 in revenue.
</p>
<p>As a result of the fundraising appeal, we were able to compensate investigators <span class="people">Stanton T. Friedman</span>,
  <span class="people">Kevin Randle</span> and <span class="people">Don Schmitt</span> for their costs in conducting
  interviews with more than a half-dozen additional witnesses located in four states. Their testimony, in addition to
  the interviews recorded at the Fund's "Crash II" conference in July, were edited into a <time>P25M</time> videotape
  entitled "Recollections of Roswell." Expenditures for the project at year's end were nearly $10,000. The total amount
  spent on crash/retrieval research in <time>1991</time> exceeded $40,000.
</p>
<p>Having reached its fundraising goal,the Fund is now able to make copies of the videotape and briefing paper available
  for purchase by the public.(Those who already contributed to support the Roswell investigation will receive regular
  update reports.) During the quarter, the Executive Committee approved the publication of several other items,
  including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Advanced Aerial Devices Reported During the Korean War</em> by <span class="people">Richard F. Haines</span>,
    Ph.D., a member of the Fund'sBoard of Directors;
  </li>
  <li><em>Phantom Helicopters Over Britain</em> by <span class="people">David Clarke</span> and Nigel Watson, the result
    of a grant provided by the Fund for UFOResearch; and
  </li>
  <li><em>The Allagash Affair</em> by <span class="people">Raymond Fowler</span>, a respected author and UFO
    investigator; a detailed investigation into the apparent abduction of four men from a canoe on the Allagash
    Waterwayin Northern Maine.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Members of the Fund's Board con-ducted an extensive program of public appearances and media promotion during this
  period. Chairman <span class="people">Bruce Maccabee</span>, Ph.D., spoke at the International Conference on New
  Sciences at the University of Colorado, the "Show Me UFO Conference" in St. Louis, a conference cosponsored by the
  Center for Humanistic Studies and the Center for UFO Studies in Santa Barbara, CA; and the "UFO and Space Symposium"
  in Hakui City, Japan. The latter was particularly notable, because it was sponsored by the city and endorsed by the
  Japanese Prime Minister.
</p>
<p>Dr. <span class="people">Richard Haines</span> made a presentation of "Using Concepts from UFO Studies to Teach
  Science and Critical Thinking" at the Arizona State Teachers Association annual conference. Board members Don
  Berliner, <span class="people">Richard Hall</span>, Rob Swiatek and Fred Whiting attended a conference on "The UFO
  Experience" in North Haven, CT. And Mr. Berliner reported conducting a total of 39 media interviews resulting in more
  than 27 hours of air time in <time>1990</time>.
</p>
<p><time>1991</time> was a record-setting year for the Fund, in terms of both income and expenditures, primarily because
  of the "CRASH II" conference in July. As a result, the amount spent during the year on grants, awards and special
  projects (suchas the Roswell case investigation) exceeded $55,000, or nearly 70% of the Fund's total expenditures.
</p>
<p>Income from contributions is the only significant way we can support scientific research and education projects,
  inour effort to solve the UFO mystery.Because we have no office or paid staff, we are able to make maximum use of
  every dollar contributed.
</p>
<p>However, because of the increasingcost of postage and printing, we will no longer be able to send the Quarterly MUFON
  UFO JOURNAL No. 276 <time>1991-04</time> Report to individuals who have not made a contribution to the Fund in <time>1991</time>.
  Therefore, unless your contribution of at least $10 ($15 for residents of foreign countries) is received withinthe
  next 30 days, this may be the last Quarterly Report you will receive. We will send copies of Pat Nolan's UFODAZE, a
  listing of UFO reports for each day of the year, to those who res-pond to this appeal, as long as supplies last. (See
  address, next page.)

  <h2>The Book on MJ-12</h2>
  <p>Nothing in the past few years has caused more controversy in the UFO field than the release of the Operation
    Majestic-12 Briefing Document in <time>1987</time>.
  </p>
  <p>The document, dated <time>1952-09-18</time>, states that on <time>1947-09-24</time>, President Harry S Truman
    established a secret panel of twelve distinguished scientists, military [officials], and intelligence officials to
    oversee and study crashed UFOs and their occupants.
  </p>
  <p>Majestic's first case [had] occurred two months earlier, when the team allegedly recovered a crashed disc on <time>1947-07-07</time>
    near Roswell, New Mexico. Although the Roswell crash is well-documented in UFO literature, is what is described in
    the MJ-12 document itself an accurate portrayal of the recovery? For four years UFO researchers have been debating
    whether the MJ-12 document is authentic and whether or not the content of the document represents reality.
  </p>
  <p>Shortly after the MJ-12 document was released, Manitoba UFO researcher Grant Cameron and I began looking for former
    scientists who may have had knowledge of the MJ-12 committee. We worked under the assumption that the document was
    accurate in its description of a special group to handle UFO recoveries for the government. If MJ-12 was real,
    someone working in the upper levels of the government would surely remember a committee by that name that was active
    in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
  </p>
  <p>Confirming MJ-12 has been difficult. All the original, designated MJ-12 members are dead. Although various alleged
    government documents have been uncovered alluding to the MJ-12 committee, the U.S. Government has not publicly
    acknowledged that these documents or, for that matter, the MJ-12 documents, are genuine.
  </p>
  <p>An interesting development occurred in November 1983, when UFO researcher William Steinman received a letter back
    from American physicist Dr. Robert I. Sarbacher regarding UFO recoveries. In the early 1950s, Sarbacher was working
    as a consultant for the military's Research and Development Board, the same Board that allegedly controlled
    Operation Majestic-12, according to the MJ-12 documents.
  </p>
  <p>In his letter to Steinman, Sarbacher reported that secret meetings about UFO recoveries were held but [that] he did
    not personally attend them. Gordon Creighton wrote in the October 1985 issue of the *Flying Saucer Review*,
    published in England, that Dr. Sarbacher stated [that] these meetings were held at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
    in Dayton, Ohio.
  </p>
  <p>Apparently those involved in the recoveries were to report their findings to scientists connected with the Research
    & Development Board. Sarbacher wrote [to] Steinman that he did talk to some of the people at the office about what
    was learned. According to Sarbacher, U.S. laboratories analyzed UFO hardware from the crashes and ... the pilots
    looked like certain insects observed on earth.
  </p>
  <p>During a telephone interview with UFO researcher Stanton Friedman, Sarbacher was asked if he could recall anyone
    who did attend the meetings. Sarbacher gave enough clues to Friedman about a scientist he remembered being there
    that when Steinman cross-checked the information, the description fit the profile for Dr. Eric A. Walker, the former
    President of Penn State University.
  </p>
  <p>Steinman said [that] he called Sarbacher to confirm his suspicions and [that] Sarbacher allegedly confirmed that
    Dr. Eric Walker, who was then Executive Secretary of the Research & Development Board, attended all the UFO
    meetings. When Cameron and I discovered [that] Dr. Walker might be involved, we set out to document what he may have
    learned from those meetings and what the Canadian and American governments were doing with this new-found knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>Although our investigation started in 1987, William Steinman had been familiar with Walker's potential involvement
    since 1984. After several ... [unproductive] attempts to correspond with Walker by mail, Steinman phoned him on
    August 30, 1987. During the conversation, Steinman said that Walker indicated [that] he had known about MJ-12 since
    1947 and that Steinman '... was delving into an area that you can do absolutely nothing about,' and to '... drop
    it."
  </p>
  <p>Cameron and I pursued the Walker connection for a book we were working on entitled *UFOs, MJ-12, and the
    Government* [subtitle: *A Report on Government Involvement in UFO Crash Retrievals*] up until 1991.
  </p>
  <p>Walker was contacted by various UFO researchers from 1987-1990, and we were privy to the notes of these
    conversations in which Walker made some very candid remarks about MJ-12 and UFO crashes. In a conversation in 1990,
    Walker described MJ-12 as a '... handful of elite' and [that] he would know if you were invited into the group.
  </p>
  <p>Besides the in-depth reporting on Walker, we investigated several other scientists who may have been involved,
    including Dr. Luis W. Alvarez, a Nobel Prize winner, who allegedly assisted in the recovery of a saucer in Mexico.
  </p>
  <p>We corresponded frequently with news commentator George Knapp of KLAS-TV in Las Vegas, Nevada, to get the story
    behind physicist Robert Lazar, who claims the government has at least nine flying saucers they're test flying and
    taking apart out at Nellis Air Force Base, in Nevada.
  </p>
  <p>We looked at the experiences noted UFO researchers have had in dealing with the government, including those of Bill
    Moore, Linda Howe, Wilbert Smith, Lee Graham and Donald Keyhoe.
  </p>
  <p>We also looked at putative government agents who appear to be involved, including Richard Doty and several who go
    by the names 'Falcon' and "Condor." We examined several UFO crashes that the government appears to have been
    involved in, including those in Roswell, New Mexico; Kecksburg, Pennsylvania; and the Kalahari Desert in South
    Africa.
  </p>
  <p>MUFON's State Director Stan Gordon opened up his files to us on the 1965 Kecksburg UFO crash. New evidence released
    in December 1990 indicated that the acorn-shaped object [recovered] was eventually moved to Wright-Patterson Air
    Force Base.
  </p>
  <p>We corresponded with Michael Hesemann in Germany and Henry Azadehdel in England to uncover the facts behind the
    alleged 1989 incident over South Africa, where a UFO was supposedly shot down by a South African Air Force pilot.
  </p>
  <p>Finally, we explored the possibility that perhaps what might have been learned from UFO crashes in the late
    1940s/early 1950s may have been instrumental in helping the U.S. Government develop certain technologies that are
    now being used on the advanced aircraft being secretly test flown in the 'Dreamland' area of Nellis Air Force Base.
  </p>
  <p>The evidence we have gathered seems to indicate [that] the government developed teams to retrieve unknown aerial
    objects, that they analyzed the recovered UFO hardware, and [that] they are now attempting to duplicate that
    technology on today's aircraft.
  </p>
  <p>Our book presents an interesting mix of various government documents, letters, telephone notes, and photographs
    detailing how the government is misleading the public about the true nature of UFOs.
  </p>
