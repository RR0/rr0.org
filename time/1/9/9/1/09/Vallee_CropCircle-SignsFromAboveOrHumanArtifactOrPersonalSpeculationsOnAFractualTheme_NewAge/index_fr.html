<p> Le clé pour enquêter sur des anomalies réside souvent dans le fait de poser les bonnes questions plutôt que de
  soupeser une longue liste de réponses supposées et de se battre sur des hypothèses. Les <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/CropCircle/index.html">crop circles</a> qui ont orné les champs anglais
  ces 2 dernières décennies illustrent bien ce principle. Nombre d'enquêteurs sur le "paranormal" bien intentionnés et
  d'enthousiastes de la Nouvelle Ere ont immédiatement posé que les cercles devaient être causés par des
  extraterrestres, tandis que l'opinion générale des journalistes et universitaires tendait à dire qu'ils étaient le
  produit de <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/canular/index.html">canulars</a>. EIndeed two retired men were
  featured in the world media as the confessed authors of many circles. Over the years several interested researchers -
  including this author - have met with and interviewed self-described "artists" who had generated some complex crop
  formations as a new type of display where the landscape is used as a canvas to shock popular consciousness and
  stimulate reaction. There is no question that at least some of the formations - including some remarkably complex ones
  - are their handiwork. </p>
<p>This leaves most of the formations unexplained, especially those that have appeared in a very short time or under
  conditions of very high mathematical accuracy. Drawing a bicycle or a spider in a wheat field is one thing, the
  Mandelbrot set of fractal geometry is quite another. </p>
<p>When sophisticated formations started appearing in the English countryside several teams of UFO investigators (who
  came from a background of soil and trace studies related to the familiar imprints often left behind after sightings
  such as Delphos or Trans-en-Provence) began to take notice. Rather than jumping to conclusions about the origin and
  purpose of the formations they drew up a list of fundamental questions that went like this: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Is there a change in the nature of the formations over time? </li>
  <li>What is it, exactly, that happens to the vegetation inside the affected areas? </li>
  <li>Is there anything special about the location of the phenomenon? </li>
</ol>
<p>To seek information on these topics they established a protocol to gather vegetation samples and sent them to a
  number of laboratories for microscopic studies. The results, which have been discussed at meetings of the Society for
  Scientific Exploration and other public events, have never seemed of sufficient interest for the media (or, indeed,
  the ufological mainstream) to take notice, perhaps because they conflicted with the sensational nature of other
  hypotheses.</p>
<p> The answers are as follows: </p>
<ol>
  <li>The early formations were simple circles, then circles with satellites. In later years more and more sophisticated
    and precisely-drawn geometric figures appeared.</li>
  <li> Vegetation is bent because the nodes are exploded. The stalks are not broken and indeed the plants are often
    reported to start growing again. </li>
  <li>All the significant formations were observed in an area in close proximity to major research facilities of the
    British defense establishment, often in controlled airspace. </li>
</ol>
<p>So much for Aliens and Druids. These studies point to the crop formations as the result of sophisticated electronic
  warfare experiments conducted by defense contractors. The answer to question (1) provides the first clue: If you are
  trying to calibrate a beam, drawing a pattern on a wheat field can yield precision information within the diameter of
  one stalk over hundreds of feet, an ideal test situation. The answer to question (2) narrows down the type of energy
  that can be responsible, because the amount of heat radiation that needs to be coupled into one node of a stalk of
  wheat to vaporize the water content is a known quantity, as laboratory tests in France and in the United States soon
  established. The answer to question (3) points to the likely authors of the tests.</p>
<p> It is tempting to jump to the conclusion that some sort of space-based weapon is being developed. I am reluctant to
  assume this because of the cost involved. Even if satellites represent the ultimate platform for such a weapon, which
  does not seem obvious to me, the calibration tests can be carried out far more cheaply from a conventional aircraft.
  In those cases when witnesses on the ground have seen formations in the process of being created, they have described
  a reddish glow at ground level, with the vegetation bent over in a matter of minutes. This would be consistent with a
  beam directed at the field from a hovering dirigible, painting a figure very much in the same way as an electron beam
  "paints" a digital image on a computer screen. From conversations I have had with the investigators involved, the beam
  would be unlikely to be a simple infrared beam. Instead a combination of laser and microwave transmitters may be
  involved, or a form of maser. Perhaps the increasingly sophisticated tests are designed, precisely, to discover
  optimal combinations. </p>
<p>This leaves several issues pending: Why don't witnesses see the supposed hovering platforms if they simply fly over
  the countryside? What about the "confessions" of the two retired men who claimed they made the circles with a
  two-by-four and a piece of string? And why do the experiments continue at a point where the technology seems to have
  reached a high level of perfection? I only have tentative answers to this new set of questions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Many years ago I gave a lecture on UFO research at Oxford University. One of the people attending, a physics
    faculty member, told me of an interesting personal experience. His hobby was to fly gliders over the English
    countryside. On one occasion, on a bright afternoon, he was astonished to see his plane reflected in a surface that
    appeared to be motionless in the atmosphere. He actually flew around the object and determined it was a perfectly
    reflecting cylinder. It is obvious that such a device would have "low-observable" characteristics - a visual stealth
    platform. </li>
  <li>What is suspicious about the two older men's "confession" is that it appeared simultaneously on the front pages of
    international papers and on CNN the same day. Any published author familiar with the difficulty of getting media
    attention will know that it takes a very powerful public relations firm to get a story to the front page of the Wall
    Street Journal and the New York Times, Le Figaro and many other papers the same day. Where did the two pensioners
    get the kind of clout that would spin their claim around the planet? The result was instantaneous: The press and,
    more importantly, most scientists lost all interest in the story for 10 years. </li>
  <li>Why do the tests continue? I admit I have no good answer to this. It seems farfetched to assume that they have
    become more sociological than technological in nature, yet this could provide an explanation. Soon or later the
    truth will be known, and it can be used to discredit the community of paranormal researchers who have rushed to
    decipher alien scripts in the formations, or have hypothesized a return of the Druids, earth lights or messages from
    Gaia without first testing the basic physics of the situation. It may also be that such hypotheses have been coldly
    planted among the New Age milieu as part of a psychological warfare experiment, and that the real nature of the crop
    formations can thus be hidden from serious attention for a very long time. </li>
</ul>
<p>Why would one need to develop such a beam? Destruction of incoming missiles (or simple confusion of their
  electronics) would be an obvious purpose, but several projects are already under way to produce such weapons, notably
  at Boeing and other defense contractors. But we may be wrong in assuming that the beam itself is a weapon; it might be
  used simply to guide a much larger amount of energy (contained plasma, or the fireball created by a nuclear explosion,
  for example) to its ultimate destination. The type of threat that is present in today's world includes targets that
  one may not want to blow up, but rather to fuse inside a fireball. Such a target might be a biological laboratory, or
  a chemical factory, where dispersion of a pathogen is undesirable. Is that what the innocent designs in English fields
  are really telling us to get ready for? If so, their message may be far more ominous that any communication from ETs,
  friendly or not. </p>
