<p> CALGARY (CP) - Many people have "missing time" in their lives they can't account for, says a woman from Langley,
  B.C., who believes she was abducted by aliens in a UFO. </p>
<p>"People who have undergone trauma may not be able to remember it. It's like missing time," says Linda Taylor, a
  registered nurse and trauma counsellor. </p>
<p>"It may have been that they suffered from sexual abuse or an accident or illness when they were young and it's been
  blocked from their consciousness."</p>
<p> Taylor says that until she was in her 30s she was plagued by the feeling that something traumatic happened to her
  when she was four. </p>
<p>"I thought I'd been a sexual abuse victim." </p>
<p>When she confronted her parents about it, they told her she'd been abducted by humanoids in a UFO near Langley and
  examined on a table. </p>
<p>Since then, she's had "spontaneous recall" of that event and subsequent other times aliens followed and contacted
  her. </p>
<p>"Aliens treat us like we treat bears," she says. "They give us a shot, take us away, tag us, then drop us miles from
  where they originally knocked us out." </p>
<p>Taylor says she feels more at peace with her experiences since going public with them several months ago and by
  helping other victims of aliens, childhood incidents and sexual attacks. </p>
<p>Taylor and Ed Hicks lectured about UFO experiences at the ninth annual Psychic ESP Fair at the Calgary Convention
  Centre, which also includes talks by psychics. </p>
<p>Hicks, from Tofield, Alta., says that crop circles found in Alberta fields are mathematical signs given to us by
  aliens that Earth is going through major weather, crop and environmental changes. </p>
<p>He says an alien gave him an idea for his invention, the Dream Dome, a canopy put over a bed which reportedly aids
  sleep. </p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced spaceships have landed in Alberta. There have been few UFO sightings in Calgary in
  recent years, says Bill Peters, executive director of the Alberta Science Centre. </p>
<p>"No one has convinced me that we're being visited by Little Green Men," he says. "Most things that people see in the
  sky have logical explanations." </p>
<p>Sightings around North America have dropped off in the past five years, partly because of lack of evidence of UFOs,
  which has "devolved the subject from science down to the checkout counter tabloids." </p>
<p>"We live in a big, complex universe. We've learned in 5,000 years of astronomy not to set up our world as special and
  unique."</p>
