<p>For almost 40 years rumours have been around concerning a crashed flying saucer on the remote island of Spitsbergen.
  As the story goes, the wreckage was discovered by jet pilots and later transported to Narvik where an investigation
  allegedly uncovered a composition of unknown metallic alloys -- and an extraterrestrial origin...</p>
<p>But what did really happen, if anything at all, on this remote island in, or around, June 1952..? In this article we
  will follow the story's development through the years, with all the surrounding rumours, changes and
  misunderstandings. The article is a summary of a 38-page special issue of UFO (the periodical of UFO-Norway) devoted
  entirely to the Spitsbergen issue.</p>
<section>
  <h2>Spitsbergen facts</h2>
  <p>Svalbard is a group of several islands, six of which are fairly large. The group lies between 76° and 81° N, about
    930 km north of Tromsø. The islands belong to Norway since 1920. They cover an area of about 62.000 km², and are
    mostly covered by ice and snow. There are no trees, but in fact 125 species of extra tough arctic growths. The
    highest mountain is Mt. Newton, rising to 1700 meters.</p>
  <p>The Hinlopen Straits, place of the alleged crash, separates the islands of Spitsbergen and Nordaustlandet. The
    straits are going NNW, between 79° and 80° N. The straits are 120 km long and 10 km broad, at the narrow point.</p>
  <p>The number of people living on Svalbard today is 3500. In the 1950s, population numbered some 1500. Norway and the
    Soviet Union has an agreement on coal mining on these islands. Most people living here are working in the mines. In
    later years, tourist traffic has increased noticeably, due to the beautiful nature of these areas.</p>
  <p>Some of you are certainly familiar with the basic facts of the story, but for all of us to get well acquainted with
    it, we'll start off with the original source. We believe the first mention of a saucer crash on Spitsbergen is
    probably an article in a German newspaper, Saarbrücker Zeitung (1), 28 June 1952, entitled "Auf Spitzbergen landete
    Fliegende Untertasse". We will give you an english translation of it, here:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>FLYING SAUCER LANDED ON SPITSBERGEN</p>
    <p>The puzzle finally solved? - "Silvery disc with dome of plexiglass and 46 jets on the rim" - Soviet origin?
    </p>
    <p>Narvik, mid-June.</p>
    <p>Norwegian jet planes had just started this year's summer maneuvers over Spitsbergen. A squadron of six planes
      were approaching, at maximum speed, the Nordaustlandet, where units of the supposed opponent had been reported.
      The jets had just crossed over the Hinlopen Straits when crackling and rustling noises could be heard on all ear
      phones and radio receivers. Radio contact among the jets was no longer possible; all means of communication
      between the jets seemed to be out of order. The radar reading, which had been showing "white" since from Narvik,
      was now on "red". This indicated an alert, the approach of a metallic alien object equipped with a radio direction
      finder that had a different frequency from that of the fighters.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, the highly experienced pilots were able to communicate with each other by means of circling and
      diving, so that each of them was aware of circling and diving, so that each of them was aware of their common
      situation, each one searching the horizon with the utmost attention. The six fighters circled for some time not
      finding anything that was out of the ordinary.</p>
    <p>By chance, Air Captain Olaf Larsen happened to look down. Immediately he started to dive, followed by his
      squadron. On the white snowy landscape, the crusty surface of which had an icy glitter, there was a metallic,
      glittering circular disc of between 40 and 50 meters diameter, which was even brighter than icy snow. Between some
      wires and a tangle of supporting struts in the middle, the remains of an apparently partly destroyed cockpit
      protruded. While circling for 60 minutes, the jet pilots could neither detect any sign of life nor determine the
      origin or type of the vehicle. Finally, they took course for Narvik in order to report their strange findings.</p>
    <p>Just a few hours later, five big flying boats, equipped with landing skis, took off for the place of discovery.
      They landed safely next to the bluish steel disc, which was sitting in a bed of snow and ice of more than one
      meter's depth.</p>
    <p>"Undoubtedly one of the infamous flying saucers", claimed Dr. Norsel, a Norwegian rocket specialist, who had
      insisted on joining the flight. He also established the reason why all means of communication of the fighter
      planes had broken down on entering the zone of the landing spot, and why the radar equipment had signaled the
      alarm: a radio direction finder equipped with a plutonium core was undamaged and transmitting on all wave lengths
      at a frequency of 934 Hertz, which is not known by any country.</p>
    <p>A precise inspection of the remote-controlled flying disc that landed on the Nordaustlandet of Spitsbergen due to
      interference problems, led to the following indisputable information. The flying object, which has a diameter of
      48,88 meters and slanting sides, is round and was unmanned. The circular steel object, is made out of an unknown
      metal compound, resembles a silver disc. After ignition, 46 automatic jets, located at equal distances on the
      outer ring, rotate the disc around a plexiglassed center ball, that contains measuring and control devices for
      remote control. The measuring instruments (gauges) have Russian symbols. The action radius of the disc seems to be
      more than 30.000 km, and the altitude over 160 km. The flying object, which resembles one of the legendary "flying
      saucers", has sufficient room for high explosive bombs, possibly nuclear bombs.
    </p>
    <p>The Norwegian specialists assumed that the disc had started from the Soviet Union and had gone down over
      Spitsbergen due to a mistake in transmitting or receiving, being incapacitated because of the hard landing. The
      strange, remote-controlled, unmanned jet plane will be brought to Narvik on board a ship for further
      investigation. After hearing of the description of the disc, the German V-weapon designer Riedel stated: "That's a
      typical V-7 on whose serial production I have worked myself". J.M.M.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The author of the "Zeitung" article - J.M.M. - has not been poosible to track down. Newspaper archives have no
    information which can be of help to us. The very same article was also published by yet another newspaper, Berliner
    Volksblatt (2), on July 9, 1952. In early August 1952, the story got another mention in the German periodical Der
    Flieger (3), in an article by a Dr. Waldemar Beck. This mention probably spread the story to a far greater audience,
    even carried by the AFP news service into the CIA archives (4). Later authors often refer to the "Der Flieger"
    version.</p>
  <p>There are several points in the "Zeitung" article which are quite interesting. They include the speculation about a
    possible Soviet origin, and the fact that we get the names of two persons presumably involved in the discovery and
    investigation of the disc itself - Air Captain Olaf Larsen and Dr. Norsel. This we must keep in mind as we proceed
    on our investigation.</p>
  <p>A few books that appeared in 1953-54, briefly mentioned the Spitsbergen story (5, 6, 7).</p>
  <p>Additional information comes then to our attention through yet another German newspaper, the Hessische Nachrichten
    (8), which published this account on July 26, 1954:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"FLYING SAUCERS" ARE NO FABLE</p>
    <p>Norwegian military report of "unknown flying object" on Spitsbergen</p>
    <p>Only now a board of inquiry of the Norwegian General Staff is preparing the publication of a report on the
      examinations of the remains of a flying saucer crashed on Spitsbergen, presumably some time ago. The chairman of
      the board, Colonel Gernod Darnhyl, stated, during an instruction lesson for Air Force officers: "The Spitsbergen
      crash was very rewarding. True enough, our science still faces many riddles. I am sure, however, that they can
      soon be solved by these remains from Spitsbergen. A misunderstanding developed, some time ago, when it was stated
      that the flying disc was probably of Soviet origin. It has - this we must state emphatically - not been built by
      any country on earth. The materials are completely unknown to all experts, either not to be found on Earth, or
      processed by physical or chemical processes unknown to us".</p>
    <p>According to Colonel Darnhyl, the board of inquiry is not going to publish an extensive report until "some
      sensational facts" have been discussed with experts from the USA and Great Britain. "We must tell the public what
      we know about the unknown flying objects. A misplaced secrecy may well one day lead to panic!"</p>
    <p>The North Pole, base for unknowns?</p>
    <p>The Norwegian fighter pilots, Lieutenant Brobs and Lieutenant Tyllensen, who, since the Spitsbergen event have
      been assigned as observers of the polar area, claim that, contrary to American and other sources, the flying discs
      have already landed repeatedly in the northern polar zone.</p>
    <p>"I believe that the polar area is an air base for the unknowns. Especially during snow and ice storms, when we,
      with our machines, must retreat to our base, it is my belief that the flying objects take advantage of this to
      make landings. I have, shortly after such bad weather conditions, seen them land and take off three times", said
      Lieutenant Tyllensen. "I noticed then, that having landed, they execute a very speedy rotation around their axis.
      During flight, and take off, or landing, the brilliant light prevents any view of the events behind this wall of
      brilliance and on, or inside, the flying object itself."</p>
    <p>Enough of physical evidence</p>
    <p>Colonel Darnhyl thinks that, within the next twelve months, a solution to these technical problems will be found,
      or, at least, science will be on the right track towards solving the UFO problem. "We now have material at hand,
      on which we can start. That means laboratories can start the work right away and they might give us preliminary
      results shortly. Norwegian scientists think that the material from Spitsbergen can only give away its secrets by
      nuclear crushing; this because it does not change either at absolute zero, when air is liquified, or at the
      highest temperatures technically possible with our technology. Also, every chemical treatment has been tried.
      Scientific results will only be released subsequent to a UFO conference in London or Washington."</p>
    <p>The communication from Swedish TV-set owners, that their reception recently was interfered with every time flying
      saucers were reported over northern Sweden, caused sensation in circles of the Norwegian board of inquiry. In
      consequence of this Colonel Darnhyl hopes, sooner or later, to track down the communication system of unknown
      flying objects. Sven Thygesen.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A lot of people will think that this definitely is a change for the better! The wreckage is no longer of a possible
    Soviet origin, but extraterrestrial. And we also got additional named persons involved: Chairman of the board
    Colonel Gernod Darnhyl (misspelled Darnbyl by several later sources), and Norwegian Lieutenants Brobs and Tyllensen.
    Sven Thygesen, the author of the "Nachrichten" article, is another person we haven't been able to track down. Yet,
    in this case we have a name, not just initials.</p>
  <p>Later this same year a new twist to the Spitsbergen story appears in the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang (9),
    published on December 19, 1954. It goes like this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>SOUTH AMERICAN REPORT OF FLYING SAUCER IN NORWAY</p>
    <p>Contradicts information of it having Russian writing</p>
    <p>The Uruguayan newspaper "El Nacional" of Montevideo has recently, with big fuzz, brought a message "about the
      Norwegian scientist Hans Larsen Løberg's discovery of a flying saucer on Heligoland". It concerns, says the
      newspaper, the same flying saucer that "was reported to have fallen down into the mountains of Spitsbergen in
      August 1952".</p>
    <p>Mr. Larsen Løberg says that this saucer in reality crashed (fell down) on Heligoland (Hålogaland - Helgeland?)
      which is a small island in the North Sea (Nordsjøen), used as a submarine base by the Germans during the war. Of
      Hans Larsen Løberg is said that he won a prize in physics in Hungary. The newspaper also features his picture.
      (Editor/AFU: Due to it's bad quality the picture cannot be reproduced here, but it depicts a smiling, middle-aged
      man in suit and tie.)</p>
    <p>Larsen Løberg also retracts the rumour that the saucer was supposed to have Russian writing. It had, he says, a
      diameter of 91 feet and a thickness on the middle of about 70 feet. In the spaceship's control room they found a
      number of push-buttons. It was deduced that it could travel aided by the magnetic forces that hold the planets in
      their positions in space, and these forces are controlled by said buttons. They found no engine in the spaceship,
      nor could they discover any rivets, fuses or bolts. The outer surface was shiny and transparent.</p>
    <p>Pills and heavy water</p>
    <p>The material used was as light as aluminum, but very much harder, and probably much heat-resistant. Of the things
      found in its interior, they noticed some water that was three times as heavy as normal water, and a few pills
      which were taken to be food. There was also an apparatus which probably was a radio. It was quite small and had no
      antenna. They also found some books, probably navigational instructions, in a completely unknown writing. The
      doors of the spaceship were open. Just inside of the doors were 7 bodies, burned beyond recognition. Scientists
      are of the opinion, according to Larsen Løberg, that the bodies were of men at the age of between 25 and 30 years,
      about 1,65 m tall. All had perfect sets of teeth.</p>
    <p>Beam-gun</p>
    <p>Dr. Hans Larsen Løberg could also tell about the finding of a completely unknown weapon, a beam-gun which used
      magnetic rays. This gun, he thinks, explains a number of strange incidents in the USA. In Wyoming, Oklahoma City,
      Pittsburg and New York windows were broken, for unexplained reasons, on thousands and thousands of cars. And it
      must be obvious, he says, that the young pilot Mantell, who during a flight reported on radio that he had
      encountered a flying saucer and shortly thereafter crashed in pursuit of it, must have been shot down by this
      beam-gun.</p>
    <p>Crew burned to death</p>
    <p>The reason for the crash of this saucer, he thought, had to be that it was affected by the American hydrogen-bomb
      explosions. The material of the spaceship, and its apparatus, resisted the enormous heat, but the crew burned to
      death. The newspaper which picked up the story in Brazil, admits that it sounds fantastic, but draws attention to
      it not having been officially denied!</p>
    <p>VG has investigated, in Oslo, whether there is a scientist by the name of Hans Larsen Løberg, but everyone
      queried, and who ought to know about him, says that the name is completely unknown.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Obviously, somebody is mixing two different versions of the story, here. We are told that the saucer didn't fall on
    Spitsbergen, but on the german island of Helgoland, in the North Sea. We are also given information about a magnetic
    beam-gun, heavy water, pills as food, books with unknown writing...and dead bodies. None of this has previously
    figured in our stories.</p>
  <p>In addition we get to know yet another person by name: the Norwegian scientist Hans Larsen Løberg. He becomes
    person number 7 in this jigsaw. The "Verdens Gang" article refers to an Uruguayan newspaper, El Nacional (10), which
    again, has a Brazilian source. Our South American contacts have not yet been able to get hold of this article, but
    we have managed to track down the first mention of the Helgoland story, as published in Sir (11), September
    1954:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>FIRST REPORT ON THE CAPTURED FLYING SAUCER!</p>
    <p>By E.W. Greenfell</p>
    <p>On a tiny island in the North Sea off the German coast, a secret investigation is in progress to determine
      whether hydrogen bomb explosions in the Pacific Ocean knocked a flying saucer to earth. Preliminary findings were
      revealed recently in Oslo, Norway, by Dr. Hans Larsen Løberg, a retired Norwegian scientist, who said
      investigators have already made some startling discoveries.</p>
    <p>In his report, Dr. Løberg said the mysterious cracking and shattering of automobile windshields in several U.S.
      cities a few months ago may be explained when results of the investigation are in. Because, he added, the grounded
      saucer is reported to carry firing instruments capable of shattering glass with magnetic rays.</p>
    <p>The saucer came down on Heligoland, a small island which the Germans used as a U-boat base during World War I.
      Since the Island is only a speck of land in a large body of water, Dr. Løberg believes the disk was forced to
      earth when H-bomb blasts created conditions of atmospheric pressure that made flight impossible.</p>
    <p>It was not a crash-up, and investigators found most of the saucer's instruments in good condition. On ground near
      the ship were found the bodies of seven men, all burned beyond recognition. They may, or may not, have been
      passengers aboard the weird flying craft.</p>
    <p>Dr. Løberg, one-time winner of the Hungarian Physics Award, said descriptive details of the saucer were told him
      by a fellow-scientist who is with the investigating team on Heligoland.</p>
    <p>If magnetic rays from the flying saucer shattered auto windshields, then police in several American cities will
      close the books on a case which drove then to the boiling point a few months ago. it all began in the city of
      Bellingham, Washington, where horrified citizens learned that, in one week's time, 1500 automobiles had turned up
      with cracked windshields - and no one could explain the reason why. Bellingham's 34000 people began to wonder if
      ghosts had invaded their midst. Even house and store windows slithered into bits. The windshields at times cracked
      up while cars were in motion, but no one could pin down any concrete cause.</p>
    <p>While the astounding story made headlines throughout the US, Bellingham's city officials were dodging frantic
      citizens, police were going crazy, and local glass manufacturers were making a fortune. Then windshields began
      falling apart in Wyoming, in Oklahoma City, in Pittsburgh and finally in New York City. Nobody, not even glass
      experts, could come up with a reasonable explanation.</p>
    <p>The saucer's magnetic ray gun, which Dr. Løberg believes responsible for all the disintegrating glass, may also
      provide a solution for yet another mystery - an airplane crash near Fort Knox, Ky., on January 7, 1948. On that
      day an unidentified object was sighted over Goodman Air force Base at Fort Knox by both military and civilian
      observers. Air force Captain Thomas K. Bandell (obviously a misprint for Mantell - OJB), flying his plane over the
      base, radioed the Goodman tower and reported the object was travelling at half his speed.</p>
    <p>"I'm closing in now to take a good look," he reported. "It's directly ahead of me and still moving at about half
      my speed. This thing looks metallic and of tremendous size... It's going up now and forward as fast as I am.
      That's 360 miles per hour... I'm going up to 20000 feet and if I'm no closer I'll abandon chase."</p>
    <p>The time was 1:15 P.M. and that was the last radio contact Bandell ha with the Goodman tower. Several hours
      later, his body was found in the wreckage of his plane near the base.</p>
    <p>If the Heligoland saucer's magnetic ray gun is in good condition, it may reveal the power to shatter airplanes as
      well as glass.</p>
    <p>Dr. Løberg contends the craft apparently landed under guidance of its own instruments and the investigators
      studied it at a distance for two days before risking closer observation. The area where the saucer came down was
      bombarded with cosmic rays, Geiger counters and other protective devices before investigation began.</p>
    <p>The seven charred bodies found around the saucer are yet unidentified. Their clothing was burned away completely
      and there were no clues to indicate whether they were passengers aboard the craft, or whether they were Heligoland
      residents ventured too close to the saucer too soon. Curiously, all seven men seemed to be from 25 to 30 years of
      age and of the same height - about 5 feet 8 inches. All had excellent teeth.</p>
    <p>Investigators have one theory: That the seven men were passengers who were consumed by fire inside the descending
      ship. The blaze had been caused by sudden changes in atmospheric pressure conditions inside the saucer's
      hermetically sealed cabin. Atop the craft was a trap-door through which the seven bodies could have been thrown by
      the impact of landing.</p>
    <p>Even more curious were the ship's measurements. It was 91 feet in diameter and the cabin 70 feet high. In fact,
      all dimensions were dividable by seven. On the control board were a series of push-buttons, but investigators are
      still studying the interior mechanism to learn what propelled the saucer in flight.</p>
    <p>Dr. Løberg's theory is that the disk may have travelled by harnessing magnetic lines of force which scientists
      know encircle the nine planets of the solar system. He points out that there was no motor and no propeller, but if
      magnetic force is involved, the saucer would move just as a nail moves when approached by a magnet.</p>
    <p>The landing gear resembled a tripod of three metal cylinders which would revolve in any direction. There were no
      bolts, rivets or screws on the saucer and in the construction were found two metals which are entirely unknown to
      scientists. Outer metal of the ship was light in weight and resembled aluminum, but it was so hard that even
      15,000 degrees Fahrenheit could not melt it down. Two men could easily lift one side of the saucer.</p>
    <p>Although it was not immediately established that the seven burned men were former passengers of the ship,
      investigators found equipment inside which definitely resembled living quarters! Well-enclosed bunks were
      ingeniously placed on one side of the cabin's interior.</p>
    <p>A liquid resembling water but almost three times as heavy as normal drinking water, was found in two small
      containers. On a wall-bracket was a tube filled with a large number of pills, possibly tabulated food.</p>
    <p>The saucer's radio, which had no tubes, no wires and no aerial, was about as small as a king-size cigarette
      package. Pamphlets and booklets, which seem to deal with navigation problems, were also found but investigators
      are still trying to decipher the script used in the text.</p>
    <p>Dr. Løberg emphasized that when the Heligoland investigation is completed, the report will add a new chapter to
      flying saucer history.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Where, or by whom, these two stories have been mixed up, will possibly be a lot easier to determine when we get the
    South American articles, but it is quite clear that we are dealing with two different stories.</p>
  <p>Now, if we move forward in time to November 1956, we find that the Dutch magazine UFO-Gids (12) publish, with minor
    changes, almost the same text as the "Hessische Nachrichten". But the Dutch magazine does not credit "Hessische
    Nacrichten" for the story. Instead, it gives "Stuttgarts Dagblad" for September 5, 1955, as it's source.</p>
  <p>In later accounts, Stuttgarter Tageblatt (13) has been alleged to have been the origin of the Darnhyl version, a
    story which surfaced already in 1954. Obviously, someone tried to 'germanize' "Stuttgarts Dagblad", and didn't care
    too much for investigating his source.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Non-existent newspaper</h2>
  <p>Several sources has used "Stuttgarter Tageblatt" as a source for the Spitsbergen story, which is, in fact, a
    non-existent newspaper! Neither CENAP nor other researchers have ever found any trace of such a newspaper or even
    such an article published on, or around, the date given by UFO-Gids. Actually, "Stuttgarts Dagblad" may simply mean
    "a newspaper from Stuttgart" in Dutch.</p>
  <p>The story goes on, and in 1966 Frank Edwards' book Flying Saucers - Serious Business (14) is published. Edwards
    claims to have been in contact with a member of the Norwegian board of inquiry. We will bring the relevant section
    here: "In 1954 when I wrote to a member of the Norwegian Board of Inquiry which had investigated the Spitsbergen
    case. I received, after four months, a cryptic reply: 'I regret that it is impossible for me to respond to your
    questions at this time.' Could he, then, answer my questions at some other time? To that inquiry I received no
    reply. I am recovering from the shock."</p>
  <p>This alleged contact can not be regarded as anything but an attempt to make the story "better". He does not name
    his alleged contact, and copies of the letters, which would have been natural to include in his book, never
    surfaced.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>New twists to the story</h2>
  <p>In 1968, Arthur Shuttlewood's book Warnings From Flying Friends (15) was published. here he recounts an article by
    Bruce Sandham, "Invasion from Space" (16). Sandham says that a Catalina flying boat, not six jets, discovered the
    object, and he gives May 1952 and not June 1952 as the date. Where he got his information from we don't know.
    Obviously it is yet another "twist" to the story.</p>
  <p>Through the years the Spitsbergen story has featured in a number of books and magazine articles - so many that in
    this article we can only deal with the most important ones - the ones that added new info, or confusion...</p>
  <p>Oh yes, confusion. More of that is added in 1986 by William Steinman in his book UFO Crash At Aztec (17). First of
    all he gets the Spitsbergen and Helgoland stories mixed up. He says that seven dead beings were found near the
    Spitsbergen saucer. He also gives us new "data" in that the pilot who first discovered the saucer, and reported his
    find, never came back.</p>
  <p>The latest article I will discuss here is "New Information on The Spitsbergen Saucer Crash" by William L. Moore, in
    Focus 5 (18), dated Dec 31, 1990. In this article, Moore includes a translation of a French newspaper article which
    appeared in the Oct 15, 1954 edition of Le Lorrain (19).</p>
  <p>It tells of a Swiss report published by the D.A.T. (Territorial Air Defense) on flying saucers, describing WW2
    Schriver/Habermohl/Miethe nazi saucer experiments. Claiming the Spitsbergen wreckage was one such saucer, it was
    "recovered by Canadian commandos". William L. Moore has quite clearly not done his homework, stating that "this
    account remains the best and most authoritative explanation I've heard so far for the Spitzbergen saucer crash
    rumours".</p>
  <p>This is, basically, the Spitsbergen UFO crash/retrieval story as of today. Now we can either let it keep wandering
    from magazine to magazine as endless rehashes, or we can do a little basic research to check the story out. What I
    will do now, is to tell you what investigation others have done, what investigation I have done, and finally we will
    concentrate our attention on the Norwegian air force jets around the Winter of 1951/Spring 1952 period.</p>
  <p>If we look at page 118 of Robert G. Girard's An Early U.F.O. Scrap Book (20), we find an undated newspaper clipping
    which is very interesting. It tells what the "Der Flieger" article said about the incident, and included that
    "Norwegian Air Force headquarters denied all knowledge of the report and said it never had heard of 'Dr. Norsel'".
    This clipping is probably dated around August-September 1952.</p>
  <p>In 1954, the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang made inquiries, in Oslo, about the name of Hans Larsen Løberg (as we
    remember, involved with the Helgoland story), but everyone asked, who ought to know about such a man, stated that
    the name was completely unknown.</p>

  <h2>American inquiries</h2>
  <p>According to the book The UFO Evidence (21), NICAP wrote to the Norwegian Embassy in 1958, receiving this reply:
    "Our Air Force's UFO material is mainly of security graded nature and cannot be put to the disposal of NICAP". I
    have not seen the letter myself. This letter has been used as evidence of a secret classification of the Spitsbergen
    incident report and analyses, but the letter does in fact not mention that case specifically, but UFO-related
    documents generally. And UFO-related material being classified at that time, ties in with my own research.</p>
  <p>According to the Condon report, Scientific study of Unidentified Flying Objects (22), "it seems well established
    that this story has no basis in fact".</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Further inquiries in Norway</h2>
  <p>A Norwegian researcher, Arne Børcke, visited the Ministry of Defence in late 1973. There, he was able to sift
    through all the material they had about this case. Ever since the story surfaced in 1952, they had received numerous
    letters from interested persons of all categories. but the Ministry had no knowledge of such an incident having
    taken place (23).</p>
  <p>Another Norwegian, Jon-Ingar Haltuff, determined in 1978 that the original story was an impossibility, physically
    as well as politicaly (24). Kevin D. Randle, a very eminent researcher, was of the opinion that the story is a hoax
    (25). Margaret Sachs, in her book The UFO Encyclopedia (26), writes that "although rumours continue to circle about
    the alleged Spitsbergen crash, no conclusive evidence has been presented to support the story".</p>
  <p>My own research consists of sifting through the entire 1952 edition of Svalbardposten, the local newspaper for
    Svalbard/Spitsbergen. There was no mention at all of any saucer crash! Neither were there any such story in any of
    Norway's main newspapers: Aftenposten, Morgenbladet, Morgenposten, or Verdens Gang, in 1952. I also checked all
    editions of Hvem Er Hvem (27) for the period 1912-1984, the Norwegian equivalent of Who's Who. None of the names
    mentioned in connection with our story figured in any of these editions.</p>
  <p>In correspondence with the Defence Museum in Oslo (28, 29, 30) during 1990-91, I determined that they have no
    knowledge of any of the names involved. They do not consider it likely that norwegian jets could have operated
    around Svalbard in 1952.</p>
  <p>The Press and Information Division of the Norwegian High Command do not have any papers on the Norwegian pilots and
    military personell allegedly involved in the story. They do, however, have data on all those officers who did
    exist.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Norwegian jet fighters</h2>
  <p>Then we come to the aircraft. According to all the versions, except the one by Bruce Sandham, the wreckage was
    discovered by jet pilots. The only jet fighters in the Norwegian Air Force in 1951-52 were De Havilland DH 100
    Vampire (in three versions: FMK3, FBMK52, and TMK55), and Republic F-84 Thunderjet (in two versions: F-84E and
    F84G).</p>
  <p>According to my correspondence with the Defense Museum (30) as well as the available literature (for instance, 31),
    the Vampire jets were stationed at Gardermoen AFB (about 50 km north of Oslo). With an action radius of only 980 km,
    we can definitely rule these out.</p>
  <p>Our last, and only (!), alternative is then the F-84. Six F-84E's were delivered on September 10, 1951, and were
    included in Squadron 334 at Sola (outside Stavanger). These were the only F-84E's delivered to the Norwegian Air
    Force. During the spring and summer of 1952 Norway received twentyfive F-84G's. 200 were deliverd, in all, with
    deliveries completed in 1955. F-84G had an action radius of 1610 km, so this looks promising. But it still fails to
    fulfill our wishes. Why?</p>
  <p>Because, according to research done in part by the author and by Anders Liljegren, the airfields in northern Norway
    were either too short, or going through extensive upgrading to meet the new NATO standard. All F-84 aircraft were
    stationed in the southern part of Norway at the time, and then said that the aircraft circled around the saucer
    wreckage for almost an hour, so anyone can see the hopelessness in this.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The conclusion therefore has to be that the Spitsbergen story (and the Helgoland story too, for that matter) is
    nothing but a classic H-O-A-X! The original authors, mainly J.M.M. and Sven Thygesen (if that was their real names),
    had a cursory knowledge of Norwegian military aircraft, but far from good enough.</p>
  <p>Even if this case does not hold any water, I will venture my way with a little prophecy: This story will, with
    great certainty, continue to be the subject of books as well as magazines during the 1990s. There will always be
    "researchers" who think this story deserves their enthusiastic attention, and cannot settle down with factual
    arguments which clearly show the story to lack any basis in reality.</p>

    away from our fondest hopes and dreams". Jenny Randles, in "Mind Monsters", 1990.</p>
