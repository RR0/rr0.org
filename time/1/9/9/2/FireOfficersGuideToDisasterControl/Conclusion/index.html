<title>Conclusion (Enemy Attack and UFO Potential)</title>
<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<p>Some fire chiefs have little confidence in disaster plans, especially those dealing with UFOs or enemy attack. If you
  develop a plan that sets forth your responsibilities, resources, organizations, supplies information, telephone
  numbers, and special data that will be useful in obtaining help and fulfilling your role in disaster control, commit
  it to an electronic medium, a computer with a capability for continuous updating through modern word processing. Bring
  it forth when the need requires. With a good plan, good leadership, and adequate resources, you may save many lives in
  any disaster, including attack from possible enemies. </p>
