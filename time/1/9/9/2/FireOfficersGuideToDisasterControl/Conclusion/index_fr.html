<title>Conclusion (Attaque ennemie et potentiel ovni)</title>
<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<p>Certains chefs pompiers ont peu confiance dans les disaster plans, especially those dealing with UFOs or enemy
  attack. If you develop a plan that sets forth your responsibilities, resources, organizations, supplies information,
  telephone numbers, and special data that will be useful in obtaining help and fulfilling your role in disaster
  control, commit it to an electronic medium, a computer with a capability for continuous updating through modern word
  processing. Bring it forth when the need requires. With a good plan, good leadership, and adequate resources, you may
  save many lives in any disaster, including attack from possible enemies. </p>
