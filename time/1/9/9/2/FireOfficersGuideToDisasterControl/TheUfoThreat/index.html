<title>The UFO Threat―A Fact</title>
<link href=".." rel="start" title="Enemy Attack and UFO Potential"/>
<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<p>In this chapter we will now turn our attention to the very real threat posed by Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs),
  whether they exist or not. The well-documented and highly publicized War of the Worlds radio drama by Orson Welles
  shows how even a perceived existence to alien creatures can cause very real disaster-like conditions and panic among a
  given populace.
</p>
<p>In addition, if the apparent visits by alien beings and their space vehicles should pose any type of threat, it will,
  as always, be the fire service that is called upon to provide the first line of life-saving defense and disaster
  mitigation.
</p>
<p>On April 25, 1991, radio station KSHE in St. Louis, Missouri was fined $25,000 by the Federal Communications
  Commission for broadcasting a mock warning of a nuclear attack during the Persian Gulf War. The seriousness with which
  the FCC treated this case is indicative of the very real panic that can be created from even illusionary or fictional
  phenomena. Certainly if these unexplainable events become more prevalent, the possibility of panic could be even
  greater; and again, the fire department will be the agency called upon to handle the situation <span class="source"> Radio Broadcast on station KSHE, St. Louis, MO, reported on           April 25, 1991</span>.
</p>
<p>Hence, as we near the year 2000 and move beyond, any comprehensive disaster plan should address the potential for
  panic and other deleterious effects that might befall a populated area when unexplainable phenomena occur. We will
  see, as we continue our discussion in this chapter, that widespread blackouts, communication disruptions, and other
  potentially disastrous conditions have been linked directly to UFO sightings. Hence, fire service leaders who want to
  ensure that their disaster planning is complete will not neglect an appendix to outline those things that could be
  done in preparation for the occurrence of such phenomena.
</p>
<p>Throughout this book, many of the references to actual events are based on the experiences of both of the authors.
  However, in this area of UFOs and their potential, we are relying largely on the research and experiences of Charles
  Bahme. Chuck has made a considerable study of this subject and is acquiring many publications and VCR tapes to augment
  his library on this and related phenomena. His interest in UFOs was greatly heightened when Congress in 1969 adopted a
  law (14 CFR Ch. V Part 1211--Extraterrestrial Exposure) which gave the NASA Administrator the arbitrary discretion to
  quarantine under armed guard any object, person, or other form of life which has been extraterrestrially exposed. The
  very fact that our congressmen believed there was a necessity for such drastic authority made Chuck wonder if they had
  only our astronauts in mind when they adopted it.
</p>
<p>Could it be applied to anyone who has had a UFO encounter? Whether it has or not is not likely to be a topic for
  public dissemination.
</p>
<h2> UFO Discussion—Why Now?</h2>
<p>The subject of UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) was not included in previous editions of this book. The first
  edition was the Handbook of Disaster Control which Chuck personally published in 1952 following his release from
  active naval duty in the Korean War. Although his services in the conflict as Security Coordinator for the Chief of
  Naval Operations involved the creation of a worldwide disaster control organization for the protection of the physical
  properties of the Navy, it must be admitted that the directives approved for this new organization did not reflect any
  significant concern for a flying saucer threat to its shore establishment.
</p>
<p>That was in the 1950s. Now that we are in the 1990s it is doubtful that the UFO potential would be brushed off so
  lightly by our military security forces.
</p>
<p>This change of attitude was evidenced as far back as December 24, 1959, when the Inspector General of the Air Force
  issued the following Operations and Training Order: "Unidentified Flying Objects-- sometimes treated lightly by the
  press and referred to as 'Flying Saucers'--must be rapidly and accurately identified as serious Air Force
  business...." <span class="source">Edwards, F.: <em>Flying Saucers-Serious Business</em>,           NY: Lyle Stuart, 965. p. 315</span>.
</p>
<p>There is no uncertainty about the reality of the war between nations on our planet and the disastrous effects of
  military actions. The 200 sorties flown every hour against Iraq in the Persian Gulf provided ample evidence of global
  war's destructive power. On the other hand, there are many persons who may believe that a discussion of the
  theoretical harm that could be caused by a real or imaginary invasion of UFOs would be 'far out!" But this is not so
  for the thousands of witnesses of unexplained aerial phenomena. To them it is also serious business.
</p>
<p>Chuck's interest in UFOs commenced during the early morning hours of August 26,1942, while he was roller skating
  from his house to the nearest fire station a few blocks away; the wail of sirens had signaled his recall to fire duty,
  and with the stringent blackout orders in effect. driving was not wise; besides, it was much more exciting to be out
  in the open where he could see the spectacular aerial "fireworks" that filled the heavens all around him. Few
  residents of the U.S. had ever experienced a real or imaginary invasion of UFOs like that which occurred in what has
  become known as "The Los Angeles Air Raid of 1942." The Army announced the approach of hostile aircraft and the city's
  air raid warning system went into effect for the first time in World War II. The defense to this "attack" is described
  in dramatic terms in the opening paragraph of this chapter.
</p>
<p>But what enemy had been routed? No one ever knew. All the fire fighters saw in the sky were the 15 or 20 moving
  "things" which seemed to change course at great speed apparently unaffected by the flak from bursting shells all
  around them. Rumors that one had been shot down were never verified, nor was the explanation that these zig- zagging
  invaders were weather balloons ever taken seriously. In any event, for Chuck, that unforgettable episode aroused a
  continuing interest in UFOs, rivalling his professional fields of law and fire protection. The fact that he
  subsequently was a member of a group whose sighting of a flight of UFOs was authenticated by airport radar helped to
  sustain that interest.
</p>
<h2>UFO Background Information</h2>
<p>With no intention of trying to prove or disprove the authenticity of the numerous UFO encounters often related by
  very credible witnesses including airline and military pilots, astronauts, police officers, fire fighters, members of
  Congress, and even a U.S. President, the balance of this chapter will present a brief history and nature of UFOs and
  their alleged occupants; their widespread sightings over the globe since ancient times; their appearance, propulsion
  origin, and possible motives for continuing reconnaissance.
</p>
<p>A quick look at some of the classic accounts of encounters documented in numerous foreign and U.S. publications might
  help us judge the magnitude of their threat, if any, to social stability, and, if deemed desirable, propose a fire
  service plan for coping with some of the conceivable catastrophic effects that UFOs could produce on cities and
  densely populated areas.
</p>
<p>For readers who already have made up their minds that there is no such thing as a UFO notwithstanding the
  overwhelming evidence to the contrary, it should be pointed out that there is circumstantial evidence that disastrous
  effects have already been attributed to UFO activity in more than one nation, including the United States.
</p>
<h2> UFOs—What Are They?</h2>
<p>William Shakespeare put a fitting observation in the mouth of Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark, that went like this:
  "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamed of in your philosophy." Whether Hamlet was
  referring to those strange lights or objects that appear in the sky or near the ground and have no known cause, we
  will never know, but the World Book Encyclopedia defines such things as UFOs <span class="source">World Book Encyclopedia, World Book Inc.,           1988, Vol. 20, p. 19</span>.
</p>
<p>Several theories have been propounded as to what they might be. Some scientists believe that they are of
  extraterrestrial origin-- coming from other planets. Military officers conjecture that they might be alien aircraft.
  Some attribute them all to natural causes, such as meteors, comets, sun dogs, light reflections, marsh gas, ball
  lightning, even though they must admit that scientists cannot explain all UFO reports in that manner. Still others are
  inclined to believe that they may be forms from other dimensions which can materialize and dematerialize at will
  perhaps by making a wavelength or frequency transition so as to become invisible to humans. Some believe they are time
  travelers from the future.
</p>
<h2>UFO Classification System</h2>
<p>Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Northern University Professor Emeritus of Astronomy and an advisor to the Air Force's Blue Book
  Project adopted a very simple classification system based solely upon the manner of observation:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Nocturnal lights</li>
  <li>Daylight disks</li>
  <li>Close encounters (day or night)</li>
  <li>Radar readings.</li>
</ol>
<p>He concluded that this system tells us nothing about the nature of the UFOs, but can suggest a means for gathering
  data <span class="source"> Sagan, C. E. &amp; Page, T.: <em>UFOs-A Scientific Debate</em>, Cornell Univ., 1972, p. 44</span>.
  He found that while a large number of such reports were readily identifiable by trained investigators as
  misconceptions of known objects or events, a small residue (about 1.000) were not. These came from credible witnesses
  from such widely separated places as Canada. Australia. South America, and Antarctica. He concludes with: "Although I
  know of no hypothesis that adequately covers the mountainous evidence, this should not and must not deter us from
  following the advice of Schroedinger: to be curious, capable of being astonished, and eager to find out" <span
      class="source"> Ibid. p. 51</span>. Dr. Hynek has an excellent, well-illustrated article on UFOs in a 1982 book
  which gives a detailed history of the UFO sightings, together with the reports of some well-known people who made
  them, including President Jimmy Carter while governor of Georgia <span class="source">Readers Digest.           Mysteries Of The Unexplained, p. 219</span>.
</p>
<h2> Shapes Of UFOs</h2>
<p>Witnesses have described the shapes of UFOs as anything varying from a sphere to a boomerang. Some have resembled
  flying saucers with a lid; others a glowing tube; some as semi-spherical with colored apertures; some with
  reddish-orange glows, or fire-like or sparking discharges. Incredible speed and maneuverabilities not attainable by
  aircraft of any kind are commonly observed. Many of the books and articles in Appendix H have excellent photographs of
  these unexplained visitors--photos that have been checked by experts for their authenticity.
</p>
<h2>History Of UFOS</h2>
<p>For hundreds of years mysterious objects in the sky and strange moving lights have been reported by many people,
  including the military pilots in World War II who called them foo fighters, ("Where there's Foo, there's Fire"). In
  the middle of the 1900s flying saucers were increasingly observed in the United States and other countries.
</p>
<p>Scientists at the University of Colorado hired by the Air Force from 1966 to 1968 to study this type of aerial
  phenomena could explain most of the UFO reports as a star (Venus), meteor, planet, balloon, rocket, artificial
  satellite, etc. Sometimes atmospheric conditions, aircraft exhaust trails, or unusual lighting conditions may produce
  optical illusions that observers thought were UFOs. After investigating more than 12,000 reports, the U.S. Air Force
  was unable to explain where the unexplained UFOs come from, but apparently concluded that the national security was
  not threatened by them <span class="source">Steiger, B.: Editor. <em>Project Blue Book</em>. NY: Ballantine Books, 1976, p. 170</span>.
  The emphasis of the university's team, headed by Edward U. Condon, seemed to be more concerned with the establishment
  of the emotional stability or instability of those who reported the sightings than with other evidence.
</p>
<p>Psychiatrists have examined the witnesses who claimed to have encountered UFOs and even been taken aboard their
  craft, such as the two shipyard workers in Mississippi, and found that they are not unbalanced people <span
      class="source">Uphoff, Walter &amp; Mary lo, <em>New Psychic
    Frontiers</em>, Colin Smyth Ltd., 1975. p. 152</span>. "They're not crackpots. There was definitely something here
  that was not terrestrial" <span
      class="source">Ibid.,           quoting Dr. James Harder, University of California</span>.
</p>
<p>Dr. J. Allen Hynek agreed, and added. "Where they are coming from and why they are here is a matter of conjecture.
  but the fact that they were here on this planet is beyond a reasonable doubt" <span class="source">Ibid. p. 152</span>.
</p>
<p>The Air Force. after 20 years of being deluged with UFO sightings and spending millions of dollars on their
  investigation, decided to drop the inquiry business and turned the project over to a Kensington, Maryland, group
  called NICAP (National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena). This left NASA (National Aeronautics and Space
  Administration) with part of the task of trying to run UFO sighting reports, including many by its own Apollo and
  Skylab astronauts. By 1974 over a score of astronauts saw and photographed UFOs during their flights beyond the
  earth's atmosphere.
</p>
<p>Early in the Apollo 11 mission, which culminated in the moon walk, astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin, and
  Michael Collins reported sightings of what seemed to be a UFO during the first half of their flight to the lunar
  surface. There were many more sightings by U.S. and Soviet Astronauts. On November 11,1966, Gemini XII astronauts Jim
  Lovell and Edwin Aldrin said that they saw four UFOs linked together, and on October 12, 1964, three Russian
  astronauts aboard Voskod reported that they were surrounded by a "formation of fast-moving disc-shaped objects" <span
      class="source">Macomber, Frank: "UFOs Spotted by Astronauts Still Haven't Been Identified,"           <em>Santa
    Cruz Sentinel</em>, April 17, 1974, p. 30</span>.
</p>
<h2>UFO Organizations</h2>
<p>In addition to NICAP, some of the other organizations that study UFO phenomena are MUFON (Mutual UFO Networks), CAUS
  (Citizens Against UFO Secrecy), GSW (Ground Saucer Watch), CUFOS (the Center for UFO Studies), and APRO (Aerial
  Phenomena Research Organization), an Arizona nonprofit scientific and educational organization, founded in 1952 <span
      class="source">APRO's address was given           as 3910 E. Kleindale Rd.. Tucson, Arizona, 85716</span>.
</p>
<h2>Why The Secrecy?</h2>
<p>In their book UFOs Over America, authors Jim and Carol Lorenzo charge that the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) has
  been closely involved in the collection and suppression of UFO information. "Witnesses to the phenomena have been
  bribed, coerced, and threatened by the CIA, who wanted valuable evidence given to them alone" <span class="source">Lorenzen, Jim &amp; Coral. <em>UFOs Over America</em>, NY: Signet. 1968, pp. 182 et seq</span>.
  One reason given is that military intelligence may view the UFOs as a tool of either a known or unknown potential
  enemy. "If these vehicles prove evasive and surreptitious, all the more reason to suspect them.... the probability
  looms large that the minds behind these vehicles may well be gathering intelligence of their own" <span
      class="source">Ibid.           p. 186</span>.
</p>
<p>Another reason for secrecy may lie in the hope of obtaining knowledge relating to advanced propulsion methods and
  anti-gravity systems before other potential enemies on earth may acquire it. Hence, though many nations are secretly
  investigating UFOs, they are reluctant to share their findings. Robert Lofton, in his book Identified Flying Saucers,
  claims that the Air Force became the "goat" in the effort of the CIA to debunk many sightings by pilots, radar
  technicians and reliable civilian observers. He thinks that the suppression of information about how dangerous UFOs
  can be is wrong. After citing a case where a child was burned over 50 to 60 percent of her body by a low flying UFO
  and then taken to an Air Force hospital, no one would explain why her clothes were not burned at the same time. He
  also describes another burn case in New Mexico and another man who recently received a sledge-hammer like blow that
  knocked him unconscious by the force field of a 100-foot diameter UFO. "The public ought to be told the danger! . . .
  Nothing helps rumors and panic more than ignorance" <span class="source">Lofton, Robert: <em>ldentified Flying
    Saucers</em>, NY: David McKay           Co., 1968, p. 86</span>.
</p>
<p>Major Donald Keyhoe describes in his book "Aliens from Space: The Real Story of Unidentified Flying Objects", the
  difficulties he had in 1957 in trying to get the truth from government agencies after he was director of NICAP, the
  world's largest UFO research organization with over 30 subcommittees in the U.S. and abroad <span class="source">Kehoe, D. (Major): <em>Aliens
    From Space, The Real Story of the UFOs</em>, New York: Doubleday, 1972</span>.
</p>
<p>According to some UFOlogists the attempts at cover-up by the CIA extend to destruction of evidence that it could not
  confiscate. Apparently some of our nation's important leaders have been denied access to some UFO secrets in the
  possession of an agency of the United States, the very existence of which is classified above top secret <span
      class="source">Friedman, S. T.: <em>Cosmic Watergate, New Realities</em>, 1979</span> <span class="source">Hynek, J. A.: "UFOs", <em>This
    World</em>, Aug.           30, 1981, p. 13</span>. Senator Barry Goldwater, a retired Air Force Reserve Brigadier
  General and pilot with many decades of flying experience, was quoted as saying "I certainly believe in aliens in
  space. They may not look like us, but I have very strong feelings that they have advanced beyond our mental
  capabilities." He said he was refused permission to check the Air Force files on UFOs and added, "I think some highly
  secret government UFO investigations are going on that we don't know about--and probably never will unless the Air
  Force discloses them" <span class="source">Zullo, Allan A. "I Believe That Earth Has Been Visited           By Creatures From Outer Space", <em>National
    Enquirer</em>, December 1973</span>. He said that he put faith in the reports of the Air Force, Navy, and commercial
  pilots who reported instances where a UFO would fly near them--right off their plane's wing--and then just zoom away
  at incredible speeds. "I remember the case in Georgia in the 1950s of a National Guard plane going after a UFO and
  never returning. And I recall the case in Franklin. Kentucky, when four military planes investigated a UFO. One of
  them exploded in midair and no one knows why" <span class="source">Ibid. p. 2</span>.
</p>
<p>Unleashed by the policy of Glasnost (greater openness) the Soviet media felt free to include accounts of UFO
  sightings. A Tuss report of October 10, 1989, reported a large shiny ball or disk hovering over a Voronezh park;
  residents saw the UFO land and three creatures similar to human beings emerged, accompanied by a robot <span
      class="source"><em>Press Democrat</em>, October 10, 1989, p. A-5; also reported           in weekly news magazines; see <em>original
    edition's notes</em> #22 and #23</span>.
</p>
<p>Apparently the Russians felt no need to suppress this report which was poked fun at in Newsweek and Time magazines
  <span class="source"><em>Time</em>, October 23,1989;           Newsweek, October 30, 1989</span> <span class="source">UFO update, Omni, January 1990</span>
  but not in U.S. News and World Report: "A scant few decades ago, both the U.S. government and the media treated flying
  objects as no laughing matter--which even Congress looked into. In 1966, Representative Ford responded to a rash of
  sightings in his home state of Michigan by calling for, and getting, a House hearing on UFOs" <span class="source">U.S. News           ~ World Report, "UFOs in Uncle Sam's Closet," October 23, 1989, p.19</span>.
</p>
<h2>UFO Missions</h2>
<p>Many reasons have been advanced for the purpose of the UFOs visits to our planet. Although some of the persons who
  apparently have been the subjects of genetic investigation, such as the family of Whitley Streiber may not agree, the
  majority of those who have studied possible UFO visitors feel that they are friendly. Mr. Streiber described his
  experience as terrifying, and believes that these "little figures with eyes that seem to stare into the deepest core
  of being are asking for something. Whatever it is, it is more than simple information. The goal does not seem to be a
  sort of clear and open exchange that we might expect; whatever may be surfacing, it wants far more than that. It seems
  to me that it seeks the very depth of soul; it seeks communion" <span class="source">Streiber, W.: <em>Communion</em>, NY: William Morrow, 1987, p. 15</span>.
</p>
<p>From the thousands of reports he has studied. William Spaulding, aerospace engineer and head of the Arizona-based
  Ground Saucer Watch, believes that a pattern indicates that UFOs are here on a surveillance mission: the fact that a
  majority of sightings occur around our military installations, research and development areas leads to the conclusion
  that a methodical study is being made of the earth and its defensive and offensive capabilities. "The phenomena is not
  unlike our own space explorations: scout ship survey: soil samples; landing" <span class="source">Adamski, G.: <em>lnside the Flying
    Saucers</em>, NY: Paperback Library, 1967.           p. 11</span>.
</p>
<p>In his book Incident at Exeter, John Fuller discusses the seeming affinity of UFOs for electrical power lines in the
  northeastern part of the United States. In a later section of this chapter dealing with the effects of UFOs on our
  terrestrial activities, we will see how this affinity may have been responsible for causing 36 million people to lose
  power over an area of 8,000 square miles <span class="source">Fuller, J.: <em>lncident at Exeter</em>, cited in UFO Update, in New           Realities, 1978. p. 52</span>.
</p>
<p>Because of our recent adventures into space, there are some who speculate that UFOs are more concerned with what we
  will do there than in settling here. In any event, the Air Force's official publication (issued by the Government
  Printing Office 1968) called Flying Objects says that 'No UFO has been determined to represent a threat to our
  national security.' That conclusion, however, should not rule out less disastrous consequences than the overthrow of
  our government.
