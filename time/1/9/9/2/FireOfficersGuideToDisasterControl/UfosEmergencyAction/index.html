<p> In view of the fact that many UFOlogists believe that we are fast approaching a time when overt landings of UFOs
  will become less remarkable, and in the absence of our knowing whether their visits are friendly or hostile, it would
  not be remiss to give some thought to the part that fire departments might play in the event of the unexpected arrival
  of UFOs in their communities. For example, what would be your course of action as an incident commander at the scene
  of a school ground where a UFO has crashed into the boiler room, rupturing a fuel line, and ignition has occurred in
  the spilling oil, endangering the occupants of the craft who are trapped in the wreckage? If your rescue attempts are
  successful, and two of the five small alien creatures are injured but still alive, how do you dispose of the dead and
  treat the survivors? How would the presence of children on the school grounds affect your actions? What persons and
  agencies would be notified?</p>
<p> The authors have never read any advice on these matters. The following admonition was printed on the inside front
  jacket of Frank Edward's book on flying saucers: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>WARNING </p>
  <p>"Near approaches of UFOs can be harmful to human beings. Do not stand under a UFO that is hovering at low altitude.
    Do not touch or attempt to touch a UFO that has landed. In either case the safe thing to do is to get away from
    there very quickly and let the military take over. There is a possibility of radiation danger and there are known
    cases where persons have been burned by rays emanating from UFOs. Don't take chances with UFOs! </p>

<p>In view of the federal law (cited earlier) empowering NASA's administrator to impound, without a hearing, anyone who
  touches a UFO or its occupants. it would be inadvisable to make personal contact unless you are willing to submit to
  NASA's quarantine requirements, should the law be invoked. </p>
<p>Besides the possible physical effects of approaching a UFO, e.g.. burns, radiation, etc., there may be psychological
  effects produced by force fields that could induce a hypnotic state in the viewer, loss of consciousness, memory
  relapse, and submission to the occupants. Jacques Vallee, author of "The Invisible College" cautions that we should
  consider psychic effects, such as space-time distortions experienced by percipients of craft-like devices which appear
  to fade away—dematerialize—and then reappear; of alien, strange voices or thoughts that may effect
  involuntary changes in the manner in which witnesses may react in such circumstances <span class="source">Vallée. J.: <em>The Invisible College</em>, NY: E. P. Dutton, 1975 p.           6.</span>

<p>Perhaps the above warnings of Edwards and Vallee are a little too cautious and apprehensive to adopt as a general
  pattern of conduct in every situation. In the absence of overt acts indicating hostility, there may be no danger in
  approaching a landing (or landed) UFO with a positive, solicitous attitude of wanting to be of service. This
  nonaggressive mental state may be telepathically sensed by those aboard or emerging from the craft; a form of nonvocal
  communication is a possibility. It goes without saying that any display of firearms or other weapons on your part
  could be construed as unfriendly and likely to thwart your intention of conveying a helpful attitude. </p>
<p>In a best case scenario, you may be able to obtain guidance as to the appropriate actions to take, whether of a
  life-saving nature, e.g., in quelling a fire, abating a spill, and of preservation of property, or even in the
  reduction of apprehension on the part of your response team and the spectators. </p>
<p>In a less optimistic scenario, you may have engine trouble upon approaching the scene, and radio contact could be
  lost with your dispatcher. If at night, your headlights could go out, the city could be blacked out, and your portable
  generators may malfunction when you attempt to use them for fans and portable lights. It would certainly be an
  inopportune time for your comrades to announce that they had decided to take their pensions, effective
  immediately. </p>
<p>In any event, the incident could provide invaluable experience for further training in coping with rare and difficult
  emergencies. Whatever "inside" information you are able to pass along to your fellow officers and citizens of the
  world might help to alleviate unreasonable fear, so that there would be less likelihood that we would ever again
  experience the panic and hysteria that was created by War of the Worlds a half century ago. Truth is the best cure for
  the unknown. A list of some of the available books on Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) is found in Appendix H.</p>
