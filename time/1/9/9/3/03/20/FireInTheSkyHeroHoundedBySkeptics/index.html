<p>PHOENIX (AP) - Travis Walton, whose UFO abduction story is told in the movie Fire in the Sky, says he's hounded by
  people who doubt him and seven fellow loggers. </p>
<p>Walton, 40, was a logger in northeastern Arizona when he said he was lifted into the sky by an extraterrestrial beam
  of light on Nov. 5, 1975. He said he reappeared five days later. </p>
<p>The movie has prompted a new attack on Walton's claim by the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the
  Paranormal, which debunks supernatural claims.</p>
