<p>Whenever old-time UFO buffs gather to "hoist a few" and ponder the latest perplexing developments in the field, there
  is one name that seems to pop up more frequently than any other, and the sparks begin to fly. Was he on the level, or
  a classical charlatan? Did he knowingly set out to mislead a host of faithful followers, or was he simply reporting
  the truth about a series of events so patently unbelievable that the average person simply could not accept them.</p>
<p>The center of all this controversy was, of course, the late <span class="people">George Adamski</span>. Today, more
  that 25 years after his death in <span class="place">Washington, D.C.</span>, the question still hangs high in the
  ufological atmospheres: what is the real story and how does it reflect on the many twists and turns of the great
  flying saucer saga?</p>
<p>At the start, one fact must be faced: <span class="people">George Adamski</span>, more than any other single
  individual, brought to public awareness the realizations that flying saucers (a/k/a UFOs) do indeed exist, that they
  have landed on this planet, and that they are piloted by benevolent, human-type beings from points farther out in our
  <a href="/place/systeme/solaire">solar system</a>, our galaxy, or perhaps the remotest reaches of our known universe.
</p>
<p>For the benefit of the younger readers, who may not be familiar with the colorful details of this man's career,
  perhaps we should do a cinema-style flashback to view the more important scenes in the panorama which was his life
  .</p>
<p>Born in Poland in <time>1891</time>, <span class="people">George Adamski</span> was raised in a town near <span
    class="place">Buffalo, N. Y.</span> His formal education was limited to grade school, but his mind was extremely
  active and he would delve into such subjects as <a href="/science/discipline/hard/nat/univ/astro">astronomy </a>
  and oriental philosophy, devouring books from the public library, reading magazines and holding long discussions with
  anyone he could find who was familiar with these fields.</p>
<p>After several years of service in the army, on the Mexican border, he settled in Southern California, which even in
  those early years were becoming a haven for seekers after the Greter Truth - probers into the frontiers of
  reality.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before <span class="people">Adamski</span> began attracting a following. He made a good appearance
being of rugged stature, tall, charismatic, with flashing dark eyes and an intensity of speech that would override
  any Doubting Thomases in the crowd. His main theme was that man is not alone in the universe, that the age-gold
  question of how Planet Earth relates to the rest of the cosmos could be answered if approached properly.</p>
<p>His reputation grew and he began holding regular lectures, with the result that he was given the title of "Professor"
  by his students (though he made no claims of a college degree). He wrote articles that were published in area
  magazines and his circle of influence kept expanding.</p>
<p>Early in <time>1944</time>, <span class="people">Adamski</span> purchased 20 acres of land halfway up the slope of
  <span class="place">Mt. Palomar</span>, directly below the location of the giant 200-inch telescope operated by the <a
      href="/org/us/state/ca/Caltech">California Institute of Technology</a>. He set up his own telescope, a 16-inch
  one, and began scanning the skies in search of objects that he had already seen with the naked eye. With a camera
  attachment he was able to take pictures of several disc-shaped craft moving in our atmosphere.</p>
<p>One evening he was studying the surface of the moon through his lens, when he spied a long, dark cigar-shaped object
  silhouetted against the lunar orb. As he stared in amazement, first one, then two-three-four smaller silvery obbjects
  emerged from the larger craft. He was fortunate enough to capture the group on film, the first definitive photographic
  evidence that UFOs were not a figment of the imagination.</p>
