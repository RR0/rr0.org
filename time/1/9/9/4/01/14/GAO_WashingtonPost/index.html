</figure><p>Where television's <i>Unsolved Mysteries</i> has tried and failed, the <a href="/org/us/GAO.html">General
  Accounting Office</a> is unafraid to venture.</p><p>At the request of Rep. <span class="people">Steven Schiff</span>
  (R-N.M), Congress's investigative branch has launched a study to determine whether the government covered up a story
  alleging that the bodies of alien space voyagers were removed from a crashed flying saucer found near <a
    href="/org/us/region/nm/roswell/index.html">Roswell</a>, N.M., in <time>1947</time>.</p><p>After the purported
  crash of the spacecraft, the bodies of the extraterrestrial visitors were said by a local undertaker and other
  conspiracy theorists to have been autopsied and secretly flown to an Air Force base in Ohio.</p><p>Even though the "<a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/index.html">Roswell Incident</a>" has been repeatedly dismissed by
  the <a href="/org/us/dod/index.html">Defense Department</a> as nothing more than UFO fantasizing triggered by the
  discovery of a downed weather balloon, the <a href="/org/us/GAO.html">GAO</a> has begun searching for documents to
  prove allegations that the Air Force "suppressed" information sought by Schiff.</p>
<p>Schiff is a member of the House Government Operations Committee, which oversees the <a
    href="/org/us/GAO.html">GAO</a>.</p><p><a href="/org/us/GAO.html">GAO</a> spokeswoman Laura A. Kopelson said the
  office's investigation, first reported in the <em>Albuquerque Journal</em> yesterday, stemmed from a meeting in
  October between Schiff and <a href="/org/us/GAO.html">GAO</a> Controller General Charles A. Bowsher. Schiff complained
  then that the <a href="/org/us/dod/index.html">Defense Department</a> had been "unresponsive" to his inquiries about
  the 1947 incident.</p><p>Kopelson said <q>as far as I know only one investigator had been assigned</q> to the case,
  and that not enough work had been done to report any results to Schiff. At another point, Kopelson said <q>the people
    doing it are either on sick leave or are unavailable.</q></p><p>She said there was no way of estimating how much
  the investigation would cost, and that the <a href="/org/us/GAO.html">GAO</a> does not release such information
  anyway.</p><p><a href="/org/us/GAO.html">GAO</a> conducted 1,380 inquiries into government operations in 1992. Its
  budget has risen from $46.9 million in 1965 to $490 million last year. The agency has been criticized, especially by
  Republicans, as the <q>lap dog of the requester</q>, producing reports that tend to support whatever conclusions the
  requesting member of Congress suggests.</p><p>Kopelson said Schiff had asked the <a href="/org/us/GAO.html">GAO</a>
  <q>to see if there is any evidence that information regarding UFOs had been suppressed</q> following the <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/index.html">Roswell incident</a>.</p>
<p>Schiff, however, said that at a routine October meeting he had merely complained about the <a
    href="/org/us/dod/index.html">Defense Department</a>'s lack of responsiveness but a <a
    href="/org/us/GAO.html">GAO</a> official said <q>We're willing to take a stab at it.</q></p><p>Schiff, in a
  telephone interview from Albuquerque, said that last March, after receiving inquiries from "UFO believers" and some <a
    href="/org/us/region/nm/roswell/index.html">Roswell</a> residents who were in the military in 1947, he wrote
  Defense Secretary Les Aspin asking for more information about the reported spacecraft crash and the alleged
  disappearance of the aliens' bodies.</p><p>The crash of a mysterious object 75 miles northwest of <a
  href="/org/us/region/nm/roswell/index.html">Roswell</a>, which the <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a> later claimed was a weather balloon equipped with a radar-reflecting
  device, was the subject of several books and remains many UFO buffs greatest riddle.</p><p>A privately owned museum in
  <a href="/org/us/region/nm/roswell/index.html">Roswell</a> contains a number of documents and photographs purporting
  to
  prove existence of the aliens. It also displays a re-creation of the spacecraft surrounded by figures portraying the
  dead extraterrestrials.</p><p>UFO buffs contend the incident marked the beginning of a government conspiracy to
  suppress evidence of alien life.</p><p>Much of the speculation stems from claims by <span
    class="people" title="Walter G. Haut">William Haut</span>, a former Air Force public affairs officer, who said that
  on July 2, 1947, he was told to prepare a news release reporting the Air Force had recovered parts of a flying saucer
  and then was told to change the story to report a weather balloon.</p><p>Also, a nurse reportedly told a local
  funeral home director that she witnessed the autopsies of the spacemen, whom she described as having oversize heads
  and beetle-like features. The nurse subsequently died in a plane crash.</p><p>After the autopsies, conspiracy
  theorists said the bodies were flown to <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/CarswellAFB.html">Fort Worth</a> and then to what
  is now <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</a> in Ohio.</p><p>In 1989,
  NBC's <em>Unsolved Mysteries</em> investigated the controversy, which the host, Robert Stack, concluded remained
  unsolved.</p><p>Schiff said that after calling Aspin last March to request a <a href="/org/us/dod/index.html">Defense
  Department</a> briefing on the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/index.html">Roswell incident</a>,
  he received a call from an Air Force lieutenant colonel, who brusquely told him the documents had been turned over to
  the National Archives.</p><p>However, Schiff said, the Archives officials told him they did not have the records on
  Roswell, even though they did have records of "Project Blue Book," a 1969 Air Force study of reported UFO sightings.
  That study, Schiff said, did not deal with the <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/index.html">Roswell case</a>.</p><p><q>I was getting pretty
  upset at all the running around</q>, Schiff said, adding that at his meeting with <a href="/org/us/GAO.html">GAO</a>
  officials, <q>they made an offer to help.</q></p><p><q>Generally, I'm a skeptic on UFOs and alien beings, but there
  are indications from the run-around that I got that whatever it was, it wasn't a balloon. Apparently, it's another
  government coverup</q>, Schiff said.</p>
<p>He called the <a href="/org/us/dod/index.html">Defense Department</a>'s lack of response <q>astounding</q>, and said
  government accountability was an issue <q>even larger than UFOs.</q></p><p>Asked if the <a
    href="/org/us/GAO.html">GAO</a> might not be extending itself, Schiff acknowledged that the agency <q>usually does
  fiscal investigations and at present I can't find a fiscal impact</q> in the Roswell incident.</p><p>Had the agency
  said, <q>"This is beyond our realm of expertise,"</q> Schiff said, <q>I wouldn't insist on it.</q> He added,<q> If the
    <a href="/org/us/dod/index.html">Defense Department</a> had been responsive, it wouldn't have come to this.</q>
