<p>Air Force involvement in the alleged UFO-related incident popularly known as the "Roswell Incident" began as the
  result of a January 14, 1994, Washington Post article (Atch 1) which announced Congressman Steven Schiff's intent to
  initiate a General Accounting Office (GAO) effort to resolve this controversial matter. Having previously been
  involved in numerous Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Congressional requests on "unusual aircraft," to include
  Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), The Director, Security and Special Program Oversight, Office of the Secretary of
  the Air Force, (SAF/AAZ) believed the Air Force would become involved in any GAO effort involving this subject. </p>
<p>Thus, in late January, 1994, SAF/AAZ directed its research/declassification team, SAF/AAZD, to attempt to locate any
  official records relative to this matter. These initial research efforts focused on records at the Air Force
  Historical Research Agency (AFHRA), Maxwell AFB, AL, the Air Force Safety Agency (AFSA) at Kirtland AFB, NM, and the
  National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). </p>
<p>On February 15, 1994, the GAO officially notified Secretary of Defense William J. Perry that, it was initiating an
  audit of the Department of Defense (DoD) policies and procedures for acquiring, classifying, retaining, and disposing
  of official government documents dealing with weather balloon, aircraft, and similar crash incidents (Atch 2). This
  notification was sub- sequently passed to the Department of Defense Inspector General who in turn officially notified
  the Secretaries of the Services and other affected parties of the audit in a February 23, 1994, memo (Atch 3). This
  memorandum indicated that the "GAO is anxious to respond to Representative Schiff's request and to dispel any concerns
  that the DoD is being unresponsive." These were the first official us Government documents that indicated that the
  purpose of the GAO was to review •crash incidents involving weather balloons and unknown aircraft, such as UFOs and
  foreign aircraft, and (2) the facts involving the reported crash of an UFO in 1949 (sic, 1947) at Roswell, New Mexico
  .•. (and an) alleged DoD cover-up." </p>
<p>An entrance meeting of potentially concerned parties was held in the offices of the DoD Inspector General on February
  28, 1994. During this meeting it was learned that, while the audit officially would be reviewing the records of a
  number of DoD (and possibly other Executive Branch entities), the bulk of the effort would be focused on Air Force
  records and systems. The audit was officially given the GAO code 701034, and entitled "Records Management Procedures
  Dealing With Weather Balloon, Unknown Aircraft, and Similar Crash Incidents." Although this official title appeared
  rather broad, there was no misunderstanding that the real purpose was to attempt to locate records and/or information
  on the "Roswell Incident." This incident, explained later in more detail, generally dealt with the claim that in July
  of 1947, the us Army Air Forces (USAAF) recovered a flying saucer and /or its alien occupants which supposedly crashed
  near Roswell, New Mexico. When the USAAF ultimately became the United States Air Force (USAF) in September, 1947, the
  USAF inherited equipment, personnel, records, policies, and procedures from the AAF. In this particular case, the Air
  Force also inherited the allegation that it had "covered up" the "Roswell Incident" and has continued to do so for the
  next 47 years. </p>
<p>Within the Air Force, the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/AA) is
  responsible both for information management procedures (SAF/AAI) and security policy and oversight (SAF/AAZ). Because
  of this organization, SAF/AA was the logical entity to assist the GAO in its audit and SAF/AAZ was officially named as
  the Central Point of Contact for this endeavor (Atch 4). Subsequently, the then Administrative Assistant, Mr. Robert
  J. McCormick, issued a tasking memorandum dated March 1, 199~ (Atch 5), to a number of current Air Staff and
  Secretariat offices that might possibly have records related to such an incident if, indeed, something had actually
  occurred. This search for records was purposely limited to Air Force records and systems since: </p>
<ol>
  <li>The Air Force had no authority to compel other agencies to review their records; </li>
  <li>The Air Force would have no way to monitor the completeness of their efforts if they did; and </li>
  <li>the overall effort was the task and responsibility of the GAO--not the Air Force. </li>
</ol>
<p>During the in-briefing process with GAO, it was learned that this audit was, indeed, generated at the specific
  request of Congressman Steven Schiff of New Mexico. Earlier, Congressman Schiff had written to the Department of
  Defense Legislative Liaison Office for information on the "Roswell Incident" and had been advised that it was part of
  the former UFO "Project Bluebook" that had previously been turned over to NARA by the Air Force. Congressman Schiff
  subsequently learned from NARA that, although they did, indeed, have the "Bluebook" materials, the "Roswell Incident"
  was not part of that report. Congressman Schiff, apparently perceiving that he had been "stonewalled" by the DoD, then
  generated the request for the aforementioned audit. </p>
<p>It is within this context that the following research and assistance efforts were conducted in support of the GAO.
  This report is intended to stand as the final official Air Force response regarding this matter. </p>
