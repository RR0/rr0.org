<p class="abstract"> Traditional analyses of the curve fitting problem maintain that the data do not indicate what form
  the fitted curve should take. Rather, this issue is said to be settled by prior probabilities, by simplicity, or by a
  background theory. In this paper, we describe a result due to Akaike [1973], which shows how the data can underwrite
  an inference concerning the curve&#146;s form based on an estimate of how predictively accurate it will be. We argue
  that this approach throws light on the theoretical virtues of parsimoniousness, unification, and non ad hocness, on
  the dispute about Bayesianism, and on empiricism and scientific realism.</p>

<h2> Introduction</h2>
<p> Curve fitting is a two-step process. First one selects a family of curves (or the form that the fitted curve must
  take). Then one finds the curve in that family (or the curve of the required form) that most accurately fits the data.
  These two steps are universally supposed to answer to different standards. The second step requires some measure of
  goodness-of-fit. The first is the context in which simplicity is said to play a role. Intrinsic to this two-step
  picture is the idea that these different standards can come into conflict. Maximizing simplicity usually requires
  sacrifice in goodness-of-fit. And perfect goodness-of-fit can usually be achieved only by selecting a complex
  curve.</p>
<p> This view of the curve fitting problem engenders two puzzles. The first concerns the nature and justification of
  simplicity. What makes one curve simpler than another and why should the simplicity of a curve have any relevance to
  our opinions about which curves are true? The second concerns the relation of simplicity and goodness-of-fit. When
  these two desiderata conflict, how is a trade-off to be effected? A host of serious and inventive philosophical
  proposals notwithstanding, both these questions remain unanswered.</p>
<p> If it could be shown that a single criterion for selecting a curve gives due weight to both simplicity and
  goodness-of-fit, then the two problems mentioned above for traditional analyses of the curve fitting problem would
  fall into place. It would become clear why simplicity matters (and how it should be measured). In addition, simplicity
  and goodness-of-fit would be rendered commensurable by representing each in a common currency. In what follows we
  describe a result in statistics, stemming from the work of Akaike [1973], [1974], which provides this sort of unified
  treatment of the problem, in which simplicity and goodness-of-fit are both shown to contribute to a curve&#146;s
  expected accuracy in making predictions.1</p>
<h2> Akaike wihtout tears</h2>
<p> In this section, we present the basic concepts that are needed to formulate the curve-fitting problem and to solve
  it. To begin with, we need to describe the kinds of hypotheses that curves represent and the relationship of those
  curves to the data we have available. A &#145;deterministic&#146; curve is a line in the X/Y plane; it represents a
  function, which maps values of X (the independent variable) onto unique values of Y (the dependent variable).2 For
  example, Figure 1 depicts two such curves; each says that Y is a linear function of X. Each of these curves may 1
  There is a growing technical literature on the subject. Linhart & Zucchini [1986] surveys the earlier work of
  statisticians. Researchers in computer science have used the concept of&#145;shortest data descriptions&#146; to
  warrant the trade-off between simplicity and goodness of fit.<br> See Rissanen [1978], [1989], or more recently,
  Wallace and Freeman [1992]. While there are criteria in the literature that are quantitatively different from Akaike&#146;s,
  there is a measure of agreement in the way they define simplicity and goodness-of-fit. We have focused on Akaike&#146;s
  seminal work because he motivates his criterion in a general and perspicuous manner.</p>
<p> 2 The idea that there is just one independent variable is a simplifying assumption adopted for ease of exposition.
  The results we will describe generalize to any number of independent<br> variables.</p>
<p> be obtained by fixing the values of the parameters &alpha;0 and &alpha;1 in the following<br> equation:</p>
<p> Y = &alpha;0 + &alpha;1 X .</p>
<p> The two curves in Figure 1 are equally simple, we might say, because each is a straight line and each is obtained
  from a functional form in which there are just two adjustable parameters. These two curves belong to a family of
  curves? namely, the set of all straight lines. We will be talking about both specific curves and families of curves in
  what follows, so it will be important to keep the distinction between them in mind. In fact, it will turn out that
  there is no need to define the simplicity of a specific curve; all that is needed is the notion of the simplicity of a
  family of curves, and this Akaike&#146;s approach provides.</p>

  Y<br> Curve 1&#146;s prediction of Y<br> FIGURE 1</p>
<p> Suppose the true specific curve determined the outcomes of the observations we make. Then, if Curve 1 were true, the
  set of data points we obtain would have to fall on a straight line (i.e., on the straight line depicted by Curve 1
  itself). But we will suppose that the observation process involves error. Even if Curve 1 were true, it is nonetheless
  quite possible that the data we obtain will not fall exactly on that curve. It may be impossible to say when any
  particular data point will fall above or below the true curve - only that it should &#145;tend&#146; to be close. To
  represent this possibility of error, we associate a probability distribution with each curve. This distribution tells
  us how probable it is that the Y-value we observe for a given X-value will be &#145;close&#146; to the curve. The most
  probable outcome is to obtain a Y-value that falls exactly on the true curve. Locations that are further off the curve
  have lower probabilities (symmetrically above and below) of being what we observe.</p>
<p> To make this idea concrete, suppose that we are interested in plotting the location of a planet as it moves across
  the sky. In this case, the X-axis represents time and the Y-axis represents location. The true curve is the actual,
  unique trajectory of the planet. But our observation of the planet&#146;s motion is subject to error. Even if Curve 1
  in Figure 1 describes the planet&#146;s true trajectory, it nonetheless is possible that we should obtain data that
  fail to fall exactly on that<br> curve.</p>
<p> So there are two factors that influence the observations we make. There is the planet&#146;s actual trajectory; and
  there is the process of observation, which is subject to error. If the planet&#146;s trajectory is a straight line, we
  can combine these two influences into a single expression:</p>
<p> (LIN) Y = &alpha;0 + &alpha;1 X + &sigma; U.</p>
<p> The last addend represents the influence of error. Here, of course, Y doesn&#146;t represent the planet&#146;s
  actual location, but represents its apparent location.3<br> Now consider the data points depicted in Figure 1. If
  Curve 1 were true, it is possible that we should obtain the data before us. But the same is true of Curve 2; if it
  were true, it also could have generated the data at hand. Although this is a similarity between the two curves, there
  nonetheless is a difference: the probability of obtaining the data, if Curve 1 is true, exceeds the probability of
  obtaining the data, if Curve 2 were true: p(Data/Curve 1) &gt; p(Data/Curve 2).4<br> Statisticians use the technical
  term likelihood to describe this difference; they would say that Curve 1 is more likely than Curve 2, given the data
  displayed. It is important to note that the likelihood of a hypothesis is not the same thing as its probability; don&#146;t
  confuse p(Data/Curve 1) with p(Curve 1/Data).<br> In a sense, Curve 1 fits the data better than Curve 2 does. The
  standard way to measure this goodness-of-fit is by a curve&#146;s sum of squares (SOS). As depicted in Figure 1, we
  compute the difference between the Y-value of a data point and the Y-value on the curve directly above or below it. We
  square this difference and then sum the same squared differences for each data point. Curve 1 has a lower SOS value
  than Curve 2, relative to the data in Figure 1. Comparing SOS values is a way to compare likelihoods. Notice that if
  we were to increase the number of data points, the SOS values for both curves would almost certainly go up.5<br> We
  can use the concept of SOS to reformulate the curve-fitting problem.<br> Given a set of data, how are we to decide
  which curve is most plausible? If minimizing the SOS value were our sole criterion, we would almost always prefer
  bumpier curves over smoother ones. Even though Curve 1 is rather close to the data depicted in Figure 1, we could draw
  a more complex curve that 3 Alternatively, the error term can be given a physical, instead of an epistemological,
  interpretation, if one wishes to represent the idea that nature itself is stochastic. In that case, Y would represent
  the planet&#146;s &#145;mean&#146; position. This difference in interpretation will not affect our subsequent
  discussion.</p>
<p> 4 When random variables are continuous, the likelihood is defined in terms of probability densities rather than
  probabilities. A lower case p is a probability density, while the upper case<br> P is reserved for probabilities.</p>
<p> 5 The SOS value for a curve can&#146;t go down as the data set is enlarged; it would stay the same, if, improbably
  enough, the new data points fell exactly on the curve. Also note that a curve&#146;s likelihood will decline as the
  data set is enlarged, even if the new points fall exactly on the curve.</p>
<p>passes exactly through those data points. The practice of science is to not do this. Even though a hypothesis with
  more adjustable parameters would fit the data better, scientists seem to be willing to sacrifice goodness-of-fit if
  there is a compensating gain in simplicity. The problem is to understand the rationale behind this behavior.
  Aesthetics to one side, the fundamental issue is to understand what simplicity has to do with truth.<br> The universal
  reaction to this problem among philosophers has been to think that the only thing the data tell you about the problem
  at hand is given by the SOS values. The universal refrain is that &#145;if we proceed just on the basis of the data,
  we will choose a curve that passes exactly through the data points.&#146; This interpretation means that giving weight
  to simplicity involves an extraempirical consideration. We thereby permit considerations to influence us other than
  the data at hand. Giving weight to simplicity thus seems to embody a kind of rationalism; a consistent empiricist must
  always opt for bumpy curves over smooth ones.<br> The elementary framework developed so far allows us to show that
  this standard reaction is misguided. Let us suppose that the curve in Figure 2 is true.<br> Now consider the data that
  this true curve will generate. Since we assume that observation is subject to error, it is overwhelmingly probable
  that the data we obtain will not fall exactly on that true curve. An example of such a data set, obtained from the
  true curve, also is depicted in Figure 2. Now suppose we draw a curve that passes exactly through those data points.
  Since the data points do not fall exactly on the true curve, such a best-fitting curve will be false. If we think of
  the true curve as the &#145;signal&#146; and the deviation from the true curve generated by errors of observation as
  &#145;noise,&#146; then fitting the data perfectly involves confusing the noise with the signal. It is overwhelmingly
  probable that any curve that fits the data perfectly is false.<br> Of course, this negative remark does not provide a
  recipe for disentangling signal from noise. We know that any curve with perfect fit is probably false, but this does
  not tell us which curve we should regard as true. What we would like is a method for separating the &#145;trends&#146;
  in the data from the random deviations from those trends generated by error. A solution to the curve fitting problem
  will provide a method of this sort.</p>
<p> X<br> Y<br> H<br> FIGURE 2</p>
<p>To explain Akaike&#146;s proposal, we need to introduce a precise definition of how successful a curve is in
  identifying the trend behind the data. In addition to talking about a curve&#146;s distance from a particular data
  set, we need a way to measure a curve&#146;s distance from the true curve. A constraint on this new concept is already
  before us: a curve that is maximally close to the data (because it passes exactly through all the data points) is
  probably not going to be maximally close to the truth. Closeness to the truth is different from closeness to the data.
  How should the concept of closeness to the truth be defined?<br> Let us suppose that Curve 1 in Figure 1 is true. We
  want a way to measure how close Curve 2 is to this true curve. Curve 1 has generated the data set displayed in the
  figure, and we can use the SOS measure to describe how close Curve 2 is to these data points. The idea is to define
  the distance of Curve 2 from Curve 1 in terms of the average distance of Curve 2 from the data generated by Curve 1.
  So, imagine that Curve 1 generates new data sets, and each time we measure the distance of Curve 2 from the generated
  data set. We repeat this procedure indefinitely, and we compute the average distance that Curve 2 has with respect to
  data sets generated by the true Curve 1. Remember that this average is computed over the space of possible data sets,
  rather than actual data sets.6 This allows us to define distance from the truth as follows:<br> Distance from the true
  curve (T) of curve C = df<br> Average[SOS of C, relative to data set D generated by T] &minus;<br> Average[SOS of T,
  relative to data set D generated by T].<br> First, note that the distance from the true curve is relative to the
  process of data generation; it depends on the method of generating the array of X-values whose associated Y-values the
  curves are asked to predict.7 Second, note that the true curve, T, is the curve that is closest to the truth (its
  distance from the truth is 0) according to this definition. However, the average SOS value of the true curve T,
  relative to the data sets that T generates, is nonzero. This is because of the role of error; on average, even the
  true curve won&#146;t fit the data perfectly.<br> We now define the concept of distance from the truth for families of
  curves.<br> The above definition defines what it means for Curve 2 to be a certain distance from the true curve. But
  what would it mean to describe how close to the true curve the family of straight lines (LIN) is? Here&#146;s the
  idea: Let&#146;s think of two data sets, D1 and D2, each generated by the true curve T. First, we find the specific
  curve within the family that fits D1 best. Then we compute the SOS of that curve relative to the second data set D2.
  Imagine carrying out this procedure</p>
<p> 6 Statisticians mark this distinction by using the term &#145;expected value&#146; rather than &#145;average value.&#146;
  We have chosen not to do this because the psychological connotations of the word &#145;expected&#146; may mislead some
  readers.</p>
<p> 7 The X-arrays for the predicted data do not have to be the same as the X-array for the actual data, but both must
  be generated by the same stochastic process.</p>
<p>again and again for different pairs of data sets. The average SOS obtained in this way is the family&#146;s distance
  from the truth:<br> Distance from the true curve (T) of family F = df<br> Average[SOS of L1(F), relative to data set
  D2 generated by T] &minus;<br> Average[SOS of T, relative to data set D2 generated by T].<br> Here L1(F) is the best
  fitting (&#145;likeliest&#146;) member of the family F, relative to data set D1.8<br> Our definition of a family&#146;s
  distance from the truth is intended to measure how accurate the predictions will be that the best fitting curve in a
  family generates.<br> Consider the family of straight lines (LIN) and the data displayed in Figure 1.<br> How close is
  the family (LIN) to the truth? We can imagine finding the straight line that best fits the data at hand. The question
  we&#146;d like to answer is how accurately that particular straight line will predict new data. The average distance
  from the truth of best fitting curves selected from that family is the distance of the family from the truth:<br>
  Distance from the true curve (T) of family F = Average[Distance of best fitting curves in F from the truth T].<br> Our
  interest in the distance of families from the truth stems from this equality.<br> Families are of interest because
  they are instruments of prediction; they make predictions by providing us with a specific curve&#150;viz. the curve in
  the family that best fits the data.9<br> If the true curve is in fact a straight line, (LIN) will of course be very
  close to the truth (though the distance will be nonzero).10 But if the truth is highly nonlinear, (LIN) will perform
  poorly as a device for predicting new data from old data. Let us move to a more complicated family of curves and ask
  the same questions. Consider (PAR), the family of parabolic equations:<br> (PAR) Y = &beta;0 + &beta;1 X + &beta;2 X 2
  + &sigma; U.<br> Specific parabolas will be c-shaped or 1-shaped curves. Notice that (LIN) is a subset of (PAR). If
  the true specific curve is in (LIN), it also will be in (PAR).<br> However, the converse relation does not hold.<br>
  So if (LIN) is true, so is (PAR) (but not conversely). This may lead one to 8 The definition of distance from the
  truth of a specific curve C is a special case of the definition for a family of curves F. A family is a set of curves;
  when a family contains just one curve, its best fitting member is just that curve itself.</p>
<p> 9 In the kinds of example we consider, there will be a unique curve in a family that fits the data best when the
  number of data points exceeds the number of adjustable parameters.</p>
<p>10 A family can be literally true (by including the true curve) and still have a non-zero distance from the truth
  because other curves in the family (including L(F)) will be closer than the true curve to the actual data.</p>
<p>expect that PAR must be at least as close to the truth as (LIN) is. However, this is not so! Let&#146;s suppose that
  the true curve is, in fact, a straight line. This will generate sets of data points that mostly fail to fall on a
  straight line. Fitting a straight line to one set of data points will provide more accurate predictions about new data
  than will fitting a parabolic curve to that set. To be sure, for each data set, the best fitting parabola will be
  closer to the data than the best fitting straight line. But this leaves open how well these two curves will predict
  new data. (LIN) will be closer to the truth (in the sense defined) than (PAR) is, if the truth is a straight line.<br>
  Curves that fit a given data set perfectly will usually be false; they will perform poorly when they are asked to make
  predictions about new data sets.<br> Perfectly fitting curves are said to &#145;overfit&#146; the data. This fact
  about specific curves is reflected in our definition of what it means for a family to be close to the truth. If (LIN)
  is closer to the truth than (PAR) is, then a straight line hypothesis fitted to one data set will do a better job of
  predicting new data than a parabolic curve fitted to the same data, at least on average. In this case, the more
  complex family is disadvantaged by the greater tendency of its best fitting case, L(PAR), to overfit the data.<br> The
  definitions just given of closeness to the truth do not show how that quantity is epistemologically accessible. To
  apply these definitions and compute how close to the truth a curve C (or a family F) is, one must know what the truth
  (T) is. Nonetheless we can use the concept of closeness to the truth to reformulate the curve-fitting problem and to
  provide it with a solution.<br> All families with at least one free parameter are able to reduce their least SOS by
  fitting to random fluctuations in the data. This is true of low dimensional families as well, though to a lesser
  degree. For example, the data in Figure 1 were generated by a straight line, but random fluctuations in the data
  enable a parabola to fit it better than any straight line. This shows that the phenomenon of overfitting is
  ubiquitous.11 Thus, there are two reasons why the least SOS goes down as we move from lower to higher dimensional
  families: (a) Larger families generally contain curves closer to the truth than smaller families. (b) Overfitting: The
  higher the number of adjustable parameters, the more prone the family is to fit to noise in the data. Our promised
  reformulation of the curve fitting problem is this: We want to favour larger families if the least SOS goes down
  because of factor (a), but not if its decline is largely due to (b). If only we could correct the SOS value for
  overfitting, then the corrected SOS value would be an unbiased indication of what we are interested in?viz. the
  distance from the true curve.</p>
<p> 11 This is the same overfitting problem that plagues general purpose learning devices like neural networks. Moody
  [1992] and Murata et al. [1992] are working on generalizing the Akaike<br> framework to apply to artificial neural
  networks. See Forster [1992b] for further details. It is interesting that there is such a fundamental connection
  between neural learning and the philosophy of science (Churchland [1989]).</p>
<p> At this point, we will simply state Akaike&#146;s theorem, without attempting to work through the mathematical
  argument that establishes its correctness. (See the Appendix A for a non-technical explanation of the assumptions
  needed, and Appendix B for the proof of the theorem in a special case. The most thorough, and accessible, technical
  treatment is found in Sakamoto et al.[1986].) Akaike [1973] discovered a way of estimating the size of the overfitting
  factor. The procedure is fallible, of course, but it has the mathematical property of providing an unbiased estimate12
  of the comparative distances of different families from the truth under favourable conditions (see Appendix A). The
  amazing thing about Akaike&#146;s result is that it renders closeness to the truth epistemologically accessible; the
  estimate turns on facts that we can readily ascertain from the family itself and from the single data set we have
  before us:<br> Estimated[(Distance from the truth of family F) = SOS[L(F)] + 2k &sigma;2 + Constant.<br> L(F) is the
  member of the family that fits the data best, k is the number of adjustable parameters that the family contains, and
  &sigma;2 is the variance (degree of spread) of the distribution of errors around the true curve. The last term on the
  right hand side is common to all families, and so it drops out in comparative judgments.<br> The first term on the
  right hand side, SOS[L(F)], is what we have been calling the least SOS for the family. It represents what empiricists
  have traditionally taken to exhaust the testimony of evidence. The second term corrects for the average degree of
  overfitting for the family. Since overfitting has the effect of reducing the SOS, any correction should be positive.
  That this correction is proportional to k, the number of adjustable parameters,13 reflects the intuition that
  overfitting will increase as we include more curves that are able to mould themselves to noise in the data. That the
  expected degree of overfitting also is proportional to &sigma;2 is plausible as well - the bigger the error deviations
  from the true curve, the greater the potential for misleading fluctuations in the data. Also note that if there is no
  error (&sigma;2 = 0), then the estimate for the distance from the truth reduces to the least SOS value. The
  postulation of error is essential if 12 &#145;Unbiased&#146; means that its average performance will center on the
  true value of the quantity being estimated. Note that an unbiased estimator can have a wide or narrow variance, which
  measures how much the estimate &#145;bounces around&#146; on average. Unbiasedness is only one desideratum for &#145;good&#146;
  estimators.</p>
<p> 13 In our running example, (LIN) contains two adjustable parameters and (PAR) contains three.<br> The number of
  adjustable parameters is not a merely linguistic feature of the way a family is represented. For example, Y = &alpha;
  + &beta; X + &gamma; X is one way of representing (LIN), but k is still 2, because there is a reparameterization (viz.
  &alpha;&prime; = &alpha;, &beta; &prime; = (&beta; + &gamma;), and &gamma; &prime; = (&beta; &minus; &gamma;)) such
  that Y = &alpha; &prime; + &beta; &prime; X. In contrast, the dimension of the family Y = &alpha; + &beta; X + &gamma;
  Z is 3 because there is no such reparameterization.</p>
<p>simplicity (as measured by k) is to be relevant to our estimates concerning what is true.14<br> We will use the term
  &#145;predictive accuracy&#146; to describe how close to the truth a curve or family is. &#145;Accuracy&#146; is a
  synonym for &#145;closeness to the truth&#146;, while the term &#145;predictive&#146; serves to remind the reader that
  the concept is relativized to the process by which the true curve generates new data. Instead of using SOS as a
  measure of distance, we use the log of the likelihood to measure closeness to the data (the greater the
  log-likelihood, the smaller the distance from the data).<br> Thus, we define the predictive accuracy of a curve C,
  denoted by A(curve C), as the average log-likelihood of C per datum. The predictive accuracy of a family F is the
  average predictive accuracy of its best fitting curves.15 This leads to a more general statement of Akaike&#146;s
  Theorem, since the log-likelihood applies to cases, like coin tossing examples, in which the SOS value is not defined.<br>
  Recalling the connection between the low SOS value of a specific curve and its high likelihood, the general statement
  of Akaike&#146;s theorem is as follows:<br> Akaike&#146;s Theorem: Estimated[A(family F)] = (1/N)
  [log-likelihood(L(F)) &minus; k], where N is the number of data points.16 We no longer need to assume that the error
  variance, &sigma;2, is known, for the error variance may be treated as another adjustable parameter.17<br> 14 We
  regard the total absence of error as radically implausible. Even if nature were completely deterministic, there still
  would be observational errors. And even then, there still would be lawless deviations from any &#145;curve&#146; that
  limits itself to an impoverished stock of independent variables. For example, it may be that the temperature at a
  particular place and time is determined. A curve that truly captures the dependence of temperature on the time of day
  and time of year will not predict the temperature exactly because there are other relevant factors.<br> The data will
  behave as randomly as if the world were indeterministic. From an epistemological point of view, this is all that
  matters. Forster [1988b] and Harper [1989] examine the role of this third kind of error (arising from the action of
  other variables) in the &#145;exact&#146; science of astronomy.</p>
<p> 15 This average is computed as follows: Take a data set D1 generated by the true curve T, and note the predictive
  accuracy of the best curve L1(F) in F relative to D1. Imagine that this procedure is repeated with new data sets D2,
  D3, ..., each time noting the predictive values of<br> the curves L2(F), L3(F), ... Now take the average of all these
  values.</p>
<p> 16 The factor (1/N) arises from the fact that we prefer to define accuracy as the average per datum log-likelihood,
  so that the accuracy of a hypothesis does not change when we consider the prediction of data sets of different
  sizes.</p>
<p> 17 When &sigma;2 is treated as unknown, a curve (by itself) no longer confers a probability on the data.</p>
<p> Literally speaking, a curve is a family of probability distributions?one for each numerical value of &sigma;2. From
  now on we will understand a &#145;curve&#146; to be associated with some specific numerical value of &sigma;2. Also
  note that Akaike&#146;s estimate of predictive accuracy of a family of&#145;curves&#146; in which &sigma;2 is a free
  parameter is related to the least SOS value for the family by a different formula (Sakamoto et al. [1986], p.170):<br>
  Estimate[A(Family FN)] = &minus; (1/2)log[SOS(B(F))/N] &minus; kN/N + constant, where FN is the higher dimensional
  family obtained from F by making &sigma;2 adjustable. Here, SOS(B(F)) is the least SOS for the original family F, and
  kN is the dimension of the final family. For LIN and PAR, kN = k + 1.</p>
<p>This theorem, we believe, provides a solution to the curve-fitting problem. It explains why fitting the data at hand
  is not the only consideration that should affect our judgment about what is true. The quantity k is also relevant; it
  represents the bearing of simplicity. A family F with a large number of adjustable parameters will have a best member
  L(F) whose likelihood is high; however, such a family will also have a high value for k. Symmetrically, a simpler
  family will have a lower likelihood associated with its best case, but will have a low value for k. Akaike&#146;s
  theorem shows the relevance of goodness-of-fit and simplicity to our estimate of what is true. But of equal
  importance, it states a precise rate-of-exchange between these two conflicting considerations; it shows how the one
  quantity should be traded off against the other. We emphasize that Akaike&#146;s theorem solves the curve-fitting
  problem without attributing simplicity to specific curves; the quantity k, in the first instance, is a property of
  families.18</p>
<p> A special case of Akaike&#146;s result is worth considering. Suppose one has a set of data that falls fairly evenly
  around a straight line. In this case the best fitting straight line will be very close to the best fitting parabola.
  So L(LIN) and L(PAR) will have almost the same SOS values. In this circumstance, Akaike&#146;s theorem says that the
  family with the smaller number of adjustable parameters is the one we should estimate to be closer to the truth. A
  simpler family is preferable if it fits the data about as well as a more complex family. Akaike&#146;s theorem
  describes how much of an improvement in goodness-of-fit the move to a more complicated family must provide for it to
  make sense to prefer the more complex family. A slight improvement in goodness-of-fit will not be enough to justify
  the move to a more complex family. The improvement must be large enough to overcome the penalty for complexity
  (represented by k).</p>
<p> Another feature of Akaike&#146;s theorem is that the relative weight we give to simplicity declines as the number of
  data points increases. Suppose that there is a slight parabolic bend in the data, reflected in the fact that the SOS
  value of L(PAR) is slightly lower than the SOS value of L(LIN). Recall that the absolute value of these quantities
  depends on the number of data points. With a large amount of data our estimate of how close a family is to the truth
  will be determined largely by goodness-of-fit and only slightly by simplicity. But with smaller amounts of data,
  simplicity plays a more determining role. Only when a nonlinear trend in the data is &#145;statistically significant&#146;
  should that regularity be taken seriously. This is an intuitively plausible idea that Akaike&#146;s result
  explains.</p>
<h2> 3 UNIFICATION AS A SCIENTIFIC GOAL</h2>
<p> It is not at all standard to think that the curve fitting problem is related intimately</p>
<p>18 Thus, the problems of defining the simplicity of curves described by Priest [1976] do not undermine Akaike&#146;s
  proposal.</p>
<p> to the problem of explaining why unified theories are preferable to disunified ones. The former problem usually is
  associated with &#145;inductive&#146; inference, the latter with &#145;inference to the best explanation.&#146; We are
  inclined to doubt that there really are such fundamentally different kinds of nondeductive inference (Forster [1986],
  [1988a], [1988b]; Sober [1988b], [1990a], [1990b]).19 In any case, Akaike&#146;s approach to curve fitting provides a
  ready characterization of the circumstances in which a unified model is preferable to two disunified models that cover
  the same domain.20</p>
<p> It is always a substantive scientific question whether two data sets should be encompassed by a single theory or
  different theories should be constructed for each. Should celestial and terrestrial motion be given a unified
  treatment or do the two sets of phenomena obey different laws? In retrospect, it may seem obvious that these two kinds
  of motion should receive the same theoretical treatment. But this is the wisdom of hindsight; individual phenomena do
  not<br> have written on their sleeves the other phenomena with which they should be coalesced.<br> Traditional
  approaches to this problem make the allure of unification something of a mystery.21 Given two data sets D1 and D1, a
  unified model Mu</p>
<p> 19 William Whewell [1840] described the process of curve fitting as a special case of a process of conceptualization
  called the &#145;colligation of facts&#146; (Forster [1988b]). He then referred to the process that leads to the
  unification of disparate curve fitting solutions as the &#145;consilience of inductions.&#146; On our view, both of
  these processes are seen as aspects of a single kind of inferential procedure. Bogen and Woodward [1988] argue that
  the inferential relationship of observation to theory has two parts: of observation to phenomena and of phenomena to
  theory.</p>
<p> Again, it is not clear to us that these relationships are fundamentally different in kind.</p>
<p> 20 We will follow statistical practice and reserve the term &#145;model&#146; for a family of hypotheses, in which
  each hypothesis includes a specific statement about the distribution of errors (so that likelihoods are well defined).
  A model leaves the values of some parameters unspecified. In applying the term to astronomy, we need only assume that
  some assumption about the form of the error distribution is included (e. g. that the distribution is Gaussian, as was
  assumed in Gauss&#146;s own application of the method of least squares to astronomy?see Porter [1986]). The variance
  of the distribution may be left as an adjustable parameter. The important point to notice is that distinguishing
  models from curves, or from abstract &#145;theories&#146;, is now critical to the philosophy of science, since Akaike&#146;s
  framework only provides a way of defining the simplicity of models.</p>
<p> 21 Friedman [1983], like some of the authors he cites (p. 242), describes unification as the process of reducing the
  number of independent theoretical assumptions. Of course, a model that assumes principles A, B, and C is made more
  probable if these assumptions are whittled down to just A and B. However, as Friedman realizes, head counting will not
  deliver this verdict when the postulates of one model fail to be a subset of the postulates of the other.<br> Friedman
  suggests (e.g., pp. 259-60) that a unified model receives more &#145;boosts&#146; in confirmation than a model of
  narrower scope. If model Mu covers domains D1 and D2, whereas model M1 covers only domain D1, then Mu can receive a
  confirmational boost from both data sets, whereas M1 can receive a boost only from D1. Two points need to be made
  about this proposal. First, although Mu receives two boosts whereas M1 receives only one, the conjunction M1 and M2
  receives two boosts as well. Here M2 is a model that aims to explain only the data in D2. The conjunction M1&M2 is
  a disunified model. If one wishes to explain the virtues of unification, one should compare Mu with this conjunction,
  not Mu with M1. The second point is that &#145;boosts&#146; in probability are increases in probability, not the
  absolute values</p>
<p>might be constructed that seeks to explain them both. Alternatively, a disunified pair of models M1 and M2 also might
  be constructed, each theory addressing a different part of the total data. If M1 fits D1 at least as well as Mu does,
  and if M2 fits D2 at least as well as Mu does, what reason could there be to prefer Mu over the conjunction of M1 and
  M2? The temptation is to answer this question by invoking some consideration that lies outside of what the evidence
  says. One might appeal to the allegedly irreducible scientific goal of unification or to the connection of unification
  with simplicity.<br> The problem posed by the question of goodness-of-fit is a real one, since the combined data set
  D1 and D2 often will be more heterogeneous than either subpart is on its own. This engenders a conflict between
  unification and goodness-of-fit; a unified theory that encompasses both data sets will fit the data less well than a
  conjunction of two separate theories, each tailor-made to fit only a single data set. However, just as in the curve
  fitting problem, this conflict can be resolved. Once again, the key is to correct for the fact that disunified
  theories are more inclined to overfit the data than their unified counterparts are.<br> For example, consider the two
  data sets represented in Figure 3 and the following three models:<br> (Mu) The X and Y values in D1 and D2 are related
  by the function<br> Y = &alpha;0 + &alpha;1X + &alpha;2X2 + &sigma; U.<br> (M1) The X and Y values in D1 are related
  by the function<br> Y = &beta;0 + &beta;1X + &sigma; U.<br> (M2) The X and Y values in D2 are related by the
  function<br> Y = &gamma;0 + &gamma;1X + &sigma; U.<br> Since each data set is close to collinear, M1 will be more
  likely than Mu with respect to D1 and M2 will be more likely than Mu with respect to D2. However, what happens when we
  use Akaike&#146;s Theorem to compare Mu with the conjunction M1 and M2, relative to the combined data? Notice that Mu
  has four free parameters, whereas the conjunction M1 and M2 has five. If its assumptions apply (see Appendix A),
  Akaike&#146;s Theorem entails that Mu may be more thus attained. The fact that Mu receives two boosts while M1
  receives only one is quite consistent with Mu&#146;s remaining less probable than M1. Friedman (pp. 143-4) recognizes
  this problem. His solution is to argue that deriving M1 from a unified theory Mu renders M1 more plausible than it
  would be if M1 were not so derivable. We note that this claim, even if it could be sustained, does not show why Mu is
  more plausible than M1 and M2, where the unified model and its disunified competitor are incompatible. In addition,
  the fact that M1 is more plausible in one scenario than it is in another does not bear on the question of how
  plausible Mu is.<br> In addition to these specific problems with Friedman&#146;s proposal, we also wish to note that
  its basic motivation is contrary to what we learn from Akaike&#146;s framework. Friedman seeks to connect unification
  with paucity of assumptions; as we will see in what follows, unified models<br> impose more constraints than their
  disunified counterparts.</p>
<p>X<br> Y<br> D1<br> D2<br> FIGURE 3<br> predictively accurate even though its best case is less likely than the best
  case of<br> M1 and M2. The best fitting case of the disunified theory would have to have a<br> log-likelihood at least
  1 unit greater than the best fitting case of the unified<br> model if the disunified model were to be judged
  predictively superior. This is<br> not true for the data in Figure 3. We conclude that estimated accuracy explains<br>
  why a unified model is (sometimes) preferable to its disunified competitor. At<br> least for cases that can be
  analyzed in the way just described, it is gratuitous to<br> invoke &#145;unification&#146; as a sui generis constraint
  on theorizing.<br> The history of astronomy provides one of the earliest examples of the problem<br> at hand. In
  Ptolemy&#146;s geocentric astronomy, the relative motion of the earth and<br> the sun is independently replicated
  within the model for each planet, thereby<br> unnecessarily adding to the number of adjustable parameters in his
  system.<br> Copernicus&#146;s major innovation was to decompose the apparent motion of the<br> planets into their
  individual motions around the sun together with a common<br> sun-earth component, thereby reducing the number of
  adjustable parameters. At<br> the end of the non-technical exposition of his programme in De Revolutionibus,<br>
  Copernicus repeatedly traces the weakness of Ptolemy&#146;s astronomy back to its<br> failure to impose any principled
  constraints on the separate planetary models.<br> In a now famous passage, Kuhn ([1957], p.181) claims that the
  unification or<br>
  &#145;harmony&#146; of Copernicus&#146; system appeals to an &#145;aesthetic sense, and that alone&#146;.<br> Many
  philosophers of science have resisted Kuhn&#146;s analysis, but none has made<br> a convincing reply. We present the
  maximization of estimated predictive<br> accuracy as the rationale for accepting the Copernican model over its
  Ptolemaic<br> rival. For example, if each additional epicycle is characterized by 4 adjustable<br> parameters, then
  the likelihood of the best basic Ptolemaic model, with just<br> twelve circles, would have to be e20 (or more than 485
  million) times the<br> likelihood of its Copernican counterpart with just seven circles for the evidence<br> to favour
  the Ptolemaic proposal.22 Yet it is generally agreed that these basic<br> 22 If the log-likelihood is penalized by
  subtracting k, then the likelihood is penalized by<br> multiplying it by a &#145;decay factor&#146; e&minus;k.<br> How
  to Tell when Simpler Theories will Provide More Accurate Predictions 15<br> models had about the same degree of fit
  with the data known at the time. The<br> advantage of the Copernican model can hardly be characterized as merely<br>
  aesthetic; it is observation, not a prioristic preference, that drives our choice of<br> theory in this
  instance.23<br> 4. CAUSAL MODELING<br> Newton&#146;s first Rule of Reasoning in Philosophy in Principia was that
  &#145;we are to<br> admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient<br> to explain
  their appearances.&#146; Here Newton gives voice to a version of<br> Ockham&#146;s razor -- explanations that
  postulate fewer causes should be preferred<br> over explanations that postulate more. Although this injunction is
  often thought<br> to be quite separate from the criterion of evidential support, some everyday<br> applications of the
  rule can be given a simple representation in Akaike&#146;s<br> framework.<br> The entries in the following table
  represent the probabilities that an event C<br> has, given the four combinations of the putative causes A and B:<br>
  P(C / &minus; )<br> A &minus;A<br> B w + a + b + i w + b<br>
  &minus;B w + a w<br> Next we define a characteristic function &chi;A:<br>
  &chi;A = 1 if A occurs<br>
  &chi;A = 0 if A does not occur.<br> Ditto for the definition of &chi;B.<br> We now can formulate three hypotheses
  about the probability that C has in<br> these four possible circumstances:<br> (INT) P(C / &chi;A = xA , &chi;B = xB)
  = w + axA + bxB + ixAxB<br> (ADD) P(C / &chi;A = xA , &chi;B = xB) = w + axA + bxB<br> (SING) P(C / &chi;A = xA ,
  &chi;B = xB) = w + axA.<br> (SING) says that only a single cause (namely A) makes a difference in whether C<br>
  occurs. (ADD) says that two causes play a role and that their relationship is<br> additive. (INT) says that there are
  two causes whose contributions are<br> interactive (i.e., nonlinear or nonadditive). The hypotheses are listed in
  order of<br> increasing parsimoniousness?one cause is simpler than two, and an additive<br> 23 Forster (1988b) and
  Harper (1989) argue that the subsequent impact of Kepler and Newton<br> may be understood in the same terms.<br> 16
  Malcolm Forster and Elliott Sober<br> model with two causes is simpler than an interactive model for those two causes.<br>
  As in the curve fitting problem, it is standard to understand causal modeling as<br> a problem with two parts. First
  one selects a hypothesis about the form the<br> causal relationship is to take; then one finds the best hypothesis of
  that form by<br> estimating parameter values. Rather than solving the first problem by appeal to<br> simplicity, our
  approach shows how estimated predictive accuracy can be<br> brought to bear from the beginning. Suppose one has a
  large and equal number<br> of observations for each of the four treatment cells. Let the empirical<br> frequencies of
  C in those four cells be:<br> P(C / &minus; )<br> A &minus;A<br> B 0.5 0.2<br>
  &minus;B 0.5 0.2<br> The three hypotheses now have the same best case, namely one in which w =<br> 0.2, a = 0.3, b =
  0, and i = 0. Recall that the estimated predictive accuracy of<br> each model is 1/N times its maximum log-likelihood
  minus k/N. This means<br> that when one model is a special case of another and they have the same best<br> case, the
  model of lower dimensionality has greater estimated predictive<br> accuracy. It follows that (SING) has greater
  estimated predictive accuracy than<br> (ADD) and (ADD) has greater estimated predictive accuracy than (INT). For
  the<br> data just given, predictive accuracy explains why it is vain to postulate more<br> causes when fewer
  suffice.24 And as in our discussion of unification, it is<br> possible to adjust the data set so as to provide a
  rationale for favouring a<br> hypothesis of greater complexity.<br> 5 THE PROBLEM OF AD HOCNESS<br> The bugbear of ad
  hoc hypotheses has traditionally been raised within the<br> framework of a hypothetico-deductive philosophy of
  science. Predictions can be<br> deduced from theories only with the help of auxiliary hypotheses. On this view,<br> we
  test a theory by observing whether its predictions are true. However, the<br> Quine-Duhem thesis states that the core
  theory may always be shielded from<br> refutation by making after-the-fact adjustments in the auxiliary hypotheses, so<br>
  that correct predictions are deduced. The classic example of this is Ptolemaic<br> astronomy, where the model may
  always be amended in the face of potential<br> refutation by adding another circle?so much so that the expression
  &#145;adding<br> 24 In this example, it isn&#146;t just that fewer causes are preferable to more; in addition, we have<br>
  shown why an additive model for two causes is preferable to an interactive model of those two<br> causes. Counting
  causes is a special case of the more general consideration of dimensionality.<br> Forster [1988b] argues that Newton
  was sensitive to this wider conception.<br> How to Tell when Simpler Theories will Provide More Accurate Predictions
  17<br> epicycles to epicycles&#146; has become synonymous with &#145;ad hocness&#146;. Although we<br> reject the
  hypothetico-deductive picture of science, we do accept the usual<br> conclusion that there is an important distinction
  to be drawn between reasonable<br> revision and ad hoc evasion.<br> Philosophers of science have recognized that
  protection of the core theories by<br> post hoc revision is not always bad. The example usually cited is Leverrier&#146;s<br>
  postulation of Neptune&#146;s existence to protect Newtonian mechanics from the<br> anomalous wiggles in Uranus&#146;
  orbit. The problem is to understand the<br> epistemological grounds for distinguishing good from bad revisions of
  auxiliary<br> hypotheses (which Lakatos [1970] refers to as the protective belt). As is<br> customary, we reserve the
  term &#145;ad hoc&#146; for revisions of the bad kind, but reject<br> the ad hominem or historicist construal of the
  term. Ad hocness, if it is relevant<br> to questions of evidence, has nothing to do with the motives of the person<br>
  advocating the hypothesis, or with historical sequences of theories and their<br> evidence.25<br> Lakatos [1970]
  notes, with approval, that Leverrier&#146;s amendment of the prior<br> Newtonian planetary model produced novel
  predictions; he introduces the<br> derogatory term &#145;degenerating&#146; for research programmes that fail to do
  this. But<br> there are at least two problems with this approach. Musgrave [1974] warns that<br> a careless reading of
  the term &#145;novel&#146; may tempt us into a view of confirmation<br> in which historical contingencies are given
  undue emphasis. The second defect<br> in Lakatos&#146;s idea is that it fails to distinguish estimated predictive
  success from<br> predictive power. It is obvious that predictive power is important, for without it<br> there can be
  no predictive success. But predictive power is not enough to<br> indicate that model revisions are of the good kind.
  For example, the continued<br> addition of epicycles in Ptolemy&#146;s astronomy is not degenerate in
  Lakatos&#146;s<br> sense. Each addition leads to novel predictions about the future positions of the<br> planets. What
  we need is a measure of the predictive success that these<br> additions can be expected to bring, and this is what
  Akaike&#146;s idea of estimated<br> predictive accuracy provides.<br> Our proposal is that a research programme is
  degenerative just in case loss in<br> simplicity is not compensated by a sufficient gain in fit with data. Of course,
  the<br> fit will always improve, but the improvement may not be enough to increase the<br> estimated predictive value.<br>
  Established research programmes often achieve considerable predictive<br> success, so why do some researchers put
  their money on an undeveloped<br> programme? First note that on our proposal there is no impediment for new<br>
  programmes to take over the predictive successes of old ones. There is no<br>
  &#145;problem of old evidence&#146; (Glymour [1980], Eells [1985]), since estimated<br> 25 We do not rule out the
  possibility that historical or psychological circumstances may<br> sometimes be a reliable indication of ad hocness.
  Our only point is that these circumstances<br> do not make a theory ad hoc, anymore than a barometer makes it
  rain.<br> 18 Malcolm Forster and Elliott Sober<br> predictive accuracy does not depend on the historical sequence of
  discovery.<br> But further, it is perfectly understandable that researchers may decide where to<br> invest their
  energy by formulating a judgment about projected predictive<br> success, and the degree to which current programmes
  are degenerating is thus a<br> relevant consideration.26<br> 6 THE SUB-FAMILY PROBLEM<br> While this explication of
  Lakatos&#146; notion is a point in favour of our approach,<br> there is another type of ad hocness that is a threat to
  Akaike&#146;s programme. A<br> literal reading of Akaike&#146;s Theorem is that we should use the best fitting
  curve<br> from the family with the highest estimated predictive value. However, for any<br> such family, it is
  possible to construct an ad hoc family of curves with the same<br> best fitting curve, with yet higher estimated
  predictive accuracy: Fix one or<br> more of the adjustable parameters at their maximum likelihood values. Each<br>
  subfamily, so constructed, will have the same best case. At the end of the<br> procedure, we obtain a zero dimensional
  family whose only member is the best<br> fitting curve of the original family. The Akaike estimate of the
  predictive<br> accuracy of this singleton family is just the log-likelihood of the curve. If this is<br> allowed, then
  we are pushed back towards selecting complicated curves that fit<br> the data exactly. We call this the sub-family
  problem.27<br> Our resolution of this problem returns us to an idea described in Section 2: If a<br> curve fits the
  data so well that it looks &#145;too good to be true&#146;, then it probably is.<br> In order to spell this out, we
  now describe a theorem (stronger than Akaike&#146;s)<br> that characterizes the behaviour of the error in estimating
  the predictive<br> accuracy of families. The error of the estimated predictive accuracy of family F,<br> or
  Error[Estimated(A(F))], is defined as the difference between Akaike&#146;s<br> estimate of the predictive accuracy of
  family F and the true predictive accuracy<br> of that family. Notice that the true predictive accuracy is constant?it
  does not<br> depend on which hypothetical data set generated by the truth happens to be the<br> actual data set. On
  the other hand, the estimated predictive accuracy of F does<br> depend on the actual data?it is what statisticians
  call a random variable. So<br> Error[Estimated(A(F))] also depends on the data, and the following theorem<br>
  describes this dependence by decomposing it into the sum of three errors:28<br> 26 The Akaike approach also finesses
  the problem of &#145;Kuhn loss&#146;: Superceding theories do not<br> always carry over all the successes of their
  predecessor. For example, Cartesian vortex theory<br>
  &#145;explains&#146; why all planets revolve around the sun in the same direction, whereas Newton&#146;s<br> theory
  dismisses this as a mere coincidence. Within Akaike&#146;s framework, the losses are<br> weighed against the gains in
  the common currency of likelihoods.<br> 27 The reader should not be misled into thinking that the subfamily problem is
  a problem for<br> Akaike&#146;s criterion alone; it arises for any proposal that measures simplicity by the paucity of<br>
  parameters.<br> 28 The result we are about to describe is close to, but not identical with, equation (4.55) in<br>
  Sakamoto et al. ([1986], p.77). Similar formulae were originally proven in Akaike [1973].<br> See Forster [1992a] for
  further explanation.<br> How to Tell when Simpler Theories will Provide More Accurate Predictions 19<br> The Error
  Theorem:<br> Error[Estimated(A(F))] =<br> Residual Fitting Error + Common Error + Sub-family Error.<br> It is
  important to remember that these errors are not errors of prediction - they<br> are errors in the estimation of
  predictive accuracy. This is why the Error<br> Theorem might be called a &#145;meta-theorem&#146; - it is a theorem
  about the &#145;meaning&#146;<br> of Akaike&#146;s Theorem. However, it rests on the same assumptions as Akaike&#146;s<br>
  Theorem (see Appendix A).<br> Akaike&#146;s Theorem states that the average of Error[Estimated(A(F))] over all<br>
  possible data sets generated by the truth is zero, which is to say Akaike&#146;s<br> estimate of predictive accuracy
  is statistically unbiased.29 &#145;Statistically unbiased&#146;<br> means that its average performance will center on
  the true value of the quantity<br> being estimated; it is a minimal requirement for &#145;good&#146; estimators.
  Akaike&#146;s<br> estimate conforms to this standard, but sometimes fails to meet another<br> desideratum, which we
  will refer to as epistemic unbiasedness. We shall now<br> explain the distinction in terms of an example.<br> First,
  consider a standard example of a statistically unbiased estimate: the<br> measurement of the mass of an object. For
  this measurement, the deviation from<br> the true mass value is determined by a symmetrical error distribution centred
  on<br> the true mass value, so that it is just as probable that the measured value is below<br> the true value as it
  is above the true value. The measured value of mass is a<br> statistically unbiased estimate of the true mass. But now
  suppose that we modify<br> this estimate by adding +10 or &minus;10 depending on whether a fair coin lands heads<br>
  or tails, respectively. Supposed that the measured value of mass was 7 kg, and<br> the fair coin lands heads. Then the
  new estimate is 17 kg. Surprisingly, this new<br> estimate is also a statistically unbiased estimate of the true mass!
  The reason is<br> that in an imagined series of repeated instances, the +10 will be subtracted as<br> often as it is
  added, so that the value of the average value of the modified<br> estimate will still be equal to the true mass value.
  However, we know that the<br> modified estimate is an overestimate in this instance, because we know that the<br> coin
  landed heads. If the coin had landed tails, then the estimate would have<br> been &minus;3 kg, and would have been
  known to be an underestimate. In either case,<br> we say that the modified estimate is epistemically biased. In sum,
  the<br> unmodified measurement value is a statistically and epistemically unbiased<br> estimate of the mass, while the
  modified estimate is statistically unbiased, but<br> epistemically biased. Other things being equal, we prefer an
  estimate that is<br> epistemically unbiased.<br> With this distinction in hand, the Error Theorem is able to explain
  the<br> limitations of Akaike&#146;s method. Here is a brief overview of our analysis:<br> 29 Statistical unbiasedness
  is really a property of the formula for obtaining the estimate, rather<br> than the particular value of the estimator.<br>
  20 Malcolm Forster and Elliott Sober<br> First, the common error is the same for all families (hence its name); it
  cancels<br> out when we make comparisons, and has no effect on model selection. It will<br> not be mentioned again.
  Second, the Residual Fitting Error is statistically and<br> epistemically unbiased. But the Subfamily Error has a
  peculiar property. It is<br> statistically unbiased (as is required by Akaike&#146;s Theorem); however, it is not<br>
  always free of epistemic bias. Sometimes Akaike&#146;s estimate displays an<br> epistemic bias, and this bias is
  highlighted by the subfamily problem. A careful<br> analysis of the Subfamily Error will reveal the source and nature
  of the problem.<br> We begin by filling in some background. One of the assumptions of these<br> theorems is that there
  is some complex K-dimensional family of hypotheses<br> (curves) that includes the true hypothesis, and that every
  family F that we may<br> wish to consider is a subfamily of this superfamily (which we will call K).<br> Every
  hypothesis under consideration may be represented as a point in the<br> parameter space of K. This space may be
  treated as a K-dimensional vector<br> space. So, if we imagine that our coordinate frame is centered on the Truth<br>
  (where else?), then various hypotheses may be located in different directions, as<br> shown in Figure 4. The two
  vectors shown are particularly important because<br> the subfamily error is equal to the dot product, or scalar
  product, of these two<br> vectors. The first vector is the one to L(K), the best fitting curve in K. Clearly<br> this
  vector will move around when we consider different data sets generated by<br> the truth. In fact, its tip falls just
  as probably on one point as on any other on the<br> circle shown, although its length will vary as well. The other
  vector is fixed. It<br> is the vector from the truth, T, to the hypothesis in the family F that is closest to<br> T
  (viz. the most predictively accurate hypothesis in F). Now, the dot product is<br> the product of the lengths of these
  two vectors times the cosine of the angle<br> between them. The cosine factor is +1 if the vectors are parallel, 0 if
  they are<br> orthogonal, &minus;1 if they are anti-parallel, and in between for in between angles.<br> The Akaike
  estimate for a low dimensional family whose best fitting case is<br> close to the data (and such families are the

  closest to T <br> L(K), representing the data<br> in parameter space<br> FIGURE 4<br> How to Tell when Simpler
  Theories will Provide More Accurate Predictions 21<br> exhibits an epistemic bias, as we now explain. The most
  predictively accurate<br> hypothesis in such small families will also be close to the data, and therefore<br> close to
  L(K). The danger is that the tips of the two vectors (whose dot product<br> is equal to the subfamily error) will be
  close together. Then the cosine factor is<br> close to +1 and the subfamily error is large and positive. To illustrate
  this aspect<br> of the relationship of Akaike&#146;s Theorem and the Error Theorem, consider the<br> following
  example. Suppose we have a very large data set that exhibits strong<br> linearity. We wish to estimate the predictive
  accuracies of L(LIN) and<br> L(POLY-n), where POLY-n is the family of n-degree polynomials with n<br> parameters free,
  and L(F) is obtained by using the data to single out the best<br> fitting curve in family F.30 We may apply Akaike&#146;s
  Theorem to (LIN) and<br> (POLY-n) directly, or we can apply it to the singleton families containing just<br> L(LIN)
  and L(POLY-n), respectively. The surprising fact - that the ad hoc<br> Akaike estimate for L(POLY-n) is surely an
  overestimate of the predictive<br> accuracy of L(POLY-n) - may have been anticipated from the fact that unreliable<br>
  ad hoc comparisons of L(POLY-n) and L(LIN) will always favour L(POLY-n),<br> because it is always closer to the data.
  In sum, both the direct and the ad hoc<br> method of accuracy estimation are statistically unbiased (as required by
  Akaike&#146;s<br> Theorem), but the ad hoc application of Akaike&#146;s method yields an estimate that<br> we know is
  too high. The ad hoc application yields an estimate that is<br> epistemically biased.31<br> We have now unpacked our
  slogan about a curve&#146;s looking &#145;too good to be<br> true&#146; to provide deeper insights into the source and
  solution of the subfamily<br> problem: The Akaike estimates of the predictive accuracy of L(F) obtained by<br> viewing
  L(F) as the best fitting case in the ad hoc hierarchy of subfamilies of F<br> tend to be too high. Indeed, that is
  exactly what we observe?the Akaike<br> estimate of L(F) increases steadily as we move down the hierarchy towards
  the<br> singleton subfamily. In sum: We have good reason not to trust the Akaike<br> accuracy estimates for ad hoc
  subfamilies constructed by fixing adjustable<br> parameters at their maximum likelihood values. We emphasize that this
  has<br> nothing to do with when subfamilies are constructed, or who constructs them.<br> Our analysis of the Error
  Theorem has been brief and necessarily incomplete.<br> Much more research is needed on the management of errors in
  Akaike&#146;s method<br> of model selection. Our aim has been to give the reader a taste for the heuristic<br> power
  of Akaike&#146;s framework in addressing such foundational questions. We<br> close by pointing out that the resolution
  we have sketched depends (like<br> Akaike&#146;s Theorem) on the existence of prediction errors, for otherwise the
  vector<br> 30 Remember (from Section 2) that we are interested in estimating the predictive accuracy of a<br> family
  only because it also provides an estimate of the predictive accuracy of its best fitting<br> curve.<br> 31 Although
  the estimate is known to be too high, given the data at hand, the Akaike estimate of<br> the predictive accuracy of
  that same singleton family relative to other data sets generated by<br> the true &#145;curve&#146; will be too low. On
  average, of course, the estimate will be centred on the true<br> value.<br> 22 Malcolm Forster and Elliott Sober<br>
  to L(F) would be 0 and there would no subfamily errors for any family.<br> 7. THE BEARING ON BAYESIANISM<br> The
  fundamental principle behind Akaike&#146;s method is that we should aim to<br> select hypotheses that have the
  greatest predictive accuracy. Since the truth has<br> the maximum possible predictive accuracy and accuracy is a
  measure of<br>
  &#145;closeness&#146;, Akaike&#146;s recipe aims to move us towards the truth. In contrast, the<br> central thesis of
  the kind of Bayesianism we will criticize here is that hypotheses<br> should be compared as to their probability of
  truth.32<br> In this section, we examine the possibility that Akaike&#146;s method might be<br> recast in a Bayesian
  framework. Since our argument is many-faceted, we<br> provide a brief summary here. We criticize two different
  Bayesian proposals<br> that promise to yield a solution to the curve fitting problem. The first Bayesian<br> strategy
  is to focus on families?show that the best families by Akaike&#146;s<br> standards are the most probable families, and
  then give a Bayesian justification<br> for selecting the best fitting case. The second approach is to bypass families,<br>
  and show how the most accurate individual hypotheses end up with higher<br> posterior probabilities. After criticizing
  these suggestions, we end the section by<br> suggesting that Bayesian methods may be useful for assessing the risks in<br>
  applying Akaike&#146;s criterion.<br> The key element of any Bayesian approach is the use of Bayes&#146; Theorem,<br>
  which says that the probability of any hypothesis H given any data is<br> proportional to its prior probability times
  its likelihood: p(H/Data) &prop; p(H) &times;<br> p(Data/H). However, it is an unalterable fact about probabilities
  that (PAR) is<br> more probable than (LIN), relative to any data you care to describe. No matter<br> what the
  likelihoods are, there is no assignment of priors consistent with<br> probability theory that can alter the fact that
  p(PAR/Data) &ge; p(LIN/Data). The<br> reason is that (LIN) is a special case of (PAR). How, then, can Bayesians<br>
  explain the fact that scientists sometimes prefer (LIN) over (PAR)?33<br> Bayesians might propose to address this
  problem as follows. Instead of (LIN)<br> 32 The problems we will enumerate for Bayesianism in what follows apply with
  equal force to<br> what might be called incremental Bayesianism. This doctrine has no interest in assigning<br>
  absolute values to prior and posterior probabilities, but seeks only to make sense of differences<br> or ratios that
  obtain between these quantities. If H1 and H2 are both confirmed by the data,<br> both P(H1/Data)/P(H1) and
  P(H2/Data)/P(H2) are greater than unity. To compare these ratios<br> to find out which hypothesis received the larger
  boost, we need to evaluate the likelihood ratio<br> P(Data/H1)/P(Data/H2). When the hypotheses are single curves, the
  better fitting hypothesis<br> automatically receives the higher boost. When the hypotheses are families, evaluating
  this<br> ratio leads to the problems we will describe in connection with Bayesian approaches to<br> defining the
  likelihood of families.<br> 33 One might seek to evade this conclusion by saying that (LIN) and (PAR) are embedded
  in<br> different theoretical contexts, that this difference gives rise to differences in meaning between<br> their
  respective theoretical parameters, and that it follows from this that (PAR) is not entailed<br> by (LIN). Although we
  are prepared to grant that this might be plausible in certain special<br> cases, we doubt that this is an adequate
  response in general.<br> How to Tell when Simpler Theories will Provide More Accurate Predictions 23<br> and (PAR),
  let us consider (LIN) and (PAR*), where (PAR*) is some subset of<br> (PAR) from which (LIN) has been removed. Since
  (LIN) and (PAR*) are<br> disjoint, nothing prevents us from ordering their prior probabilities as we see fit.<br> In
  response, we note that this ad hoc maneuver does not address the problem of<br> comparing (LIN) versus (PAR), but
  merely changes the subject. In addition, it<br> remains to be seen how Bayesians can justify an ordering of priors for
  the<br> hypotheses thus constructed and how they are able to make sense of the idea that<br> families of curves (as
  opposed to single curves) possess well defined likelihoods.<br> Rosenkrantz [1977] and Schwarz [1978] independently
  argued for a proposal<br> of the first kind?ignoring the problems of logical entailment, they seek to<br> compare the
  likelihoods of families of curves.34 So consider some family of<br> curves F with dimension k. The idea is to define
  the average likelihood of the<br> family in terms of some prior weighting of the members of the family,<br>
  p(Curve/F).35<br> If p(Curve/F) is strictly informationless, then it is easy to see that p(Data/F) =<br> 0. Almost
  every curve in the family will be very far from the data. This means<br> that if we accord equal weight to every curve
  in F, the average likelihood of F<br> will be zero. What if we let p(Curve/F) be &#145;almost&#146; informationless?
  This<br> means that we divide the curves in the family into two subsets -- within one<br> subset (which includes
  curves close to the data points), we let the weights be<br> equal and nonzero; outside this volume, we let the weights
  be zero. We<br> illustrate this proposal by returning to the examples of (LIN) and (PAR), where<br> the error variance
  &sigma;2 is known. For (LIN), we specify a volume V1 of parameter<br> values for &alpha;0 and &alpha;1 within which
  the likelihoods are non-negligible. For PAR,<br> we specify a volume V2 of parameter values for &beta;0, &beta;1, and
  &beta;3 with the same<br> characteristic. If we let boldface &alpha; and &beta; range over curves in (LIN) and
  (PAR)<br> respectively, the average likelihoods of those families then may be expressed<br> approximately as
  follows:<br> p(Data/LIN) = (1/V1) I&sdot;&sdot;&sdot;I p(Data/&alpha;,LIN) d&alpha; <br> p(Data/PAR) = (1/V2) I&sdot;&sdot;&sdot;I
  p(Data/&beta;,PAR) d&beta;,<br> where the integration is restricted to the subsets of curves with non-zero
  weights.<br> Note that as larger and larger volumes are taken into account, the average<br> likelihoods approach zero
  (as the weighting become more strictly<br> informationless).<br> How are these two likelihoods to be compared? The
  volume V1 has two<br> dimensions in parameter space; the volume V2 has three. Although Rosenkrantz<br> 34 They ignore
  the entailment problem by comparing only the likelihoods of families; they<br> bracket the Bayesian comparison of
  posterior probabilities.<br> 35 Here, the &#145;average likelihood&#146; is an average over the members of a family of
  curves, and the<br> Data are fixed. In contrast, the &#145;average log-likelihoods&#146; we discussed in previous
  sections<br> were averages of the log-likelihood of a single curve with respect to many (hypothetical) data<br>
  sets.<br> 24 Malcolm Forster and Elliott Sober<br> [1977] and Schwarz [1978] do not formulate their analysis in terms
  of the<br> volumes V1 and V2, their proposal is equivalent to setting V1 = V2. This is one<br> way to render
  commensurable the volumes of different dimensionality that<br> appear in the likelihood expressions.36<br> The trouble
  is that the proposal is not invariant under reparameterization.<br> Consider the following pair of equations:<br>
  (LIN) Y = &alpha;0 + &alpha;1 X + &sigma; U<br> (LIN&prime;) Y = (&alpha;0&prime;)/3 + (&alpha;1&prime;/2) X + &sigma;
  U.<br> These equations define exactly the same family of straight lines. Yet, the<br> proposal entails that the latter
  has 6 times the average likelihood of the former.37<br> Let us now turn to another strategy that Bayesians might
  pursue in finding a<br> solution to the weighting problem. This is to let p(&alpha;/LIN) be equal to some<br>
  informative probability p(&alpha;/LIN,E0). Here the weighting scheme is a posterior<br> probability, constructed on
  the basis of some evidence E0 that was acquired<br> before the Data. The difficulty with this proposal is that it only
  pushes the<br> problem back a step. One still has to make sense of the average likelihood<br> p(E0/LIN). This requires
  us to evaluate quantities of the form p(&alpha;/LIN).<br> Eventually, this must lead the Bayesian back to the quest
  for informationless (or<br> almost informationless) priors, which we have discussed already.38 In light of<br> these
  considerations, we think it is highly questionable that this first Bayesian<br> 36 The ad hocness of any such
  assumption is noted by Aitkin [1991], who refers his readers to<br> Lindley [1957].<br> 37 The reader can most easily
  grasp this result by considering the problem of integrating a<br> function f(x), where f(x) = 1 between the limits 0
  and 1, and f(x) = 0 elsewhere. Clearly,<br> f (x)dx 1<br>
  &infin;<br>
  &minus;&infin;<br>
  &int; = .<br> Yet if we transform coordinates such that xN = 6x, while equating g(xN) and f(x) for<br> corresponding
  values of x and xN, we obtain<br> g(x)dx 6<br>
  &infin;<br>
  &minus;&infin;<br>
  &int; &prime; &prime;= .<br> 38 Nevertheless, Schwarz [1978] has pressed ahead and derived an interesting
  asymptotic<br> expression for the average likelihood (with the V term omitted). Under conditions similar to<br> those
  for Akaike&#146;s Theorem,<br> Log(Average Likelihood of F) = log p(Data/L(F)) &minus; (logN) k/2 + other terms ,<br>
  where L(F) is the maximum likelihood hypothesis in F, N is the number of data, and k is the<br> dimension of F. The
  &#145;other terms&#146; are negligible for large N. The resulting recipe for model<br> selection is often referred to
  as the Bayesian Information Criterion, or BIC for short. We will<br> not evaluate the criterion here. But we deny that
  it is securely grounded in the Bayesian<br> framework, for the reasons we have given. In that regard, it is
  interesting to note that the same<br> criterion has been independently derived from quite different principles by
  Akaike [1977] and<br> Rissanen [1978], [1989].<br> How to Tell when Simpler Theories will Provide More Accurate
  Predictions 25<br> approach?in which families of curves are the objects of investigation?can<br> provide a
  satisfactory treatment of the curve fitting problem.39<br> So let us consider a Bayesian who compares the
  probabilities of particular<br> curves. The problem here is that there seems to be no principled way for<br> estimated
  predictive accuracies to affect the estimated probability of their truth.<br> For such a Bayesian is bound by Bayes&#146;
  Theorem, which says that the posterior<br> probability of such a particular hypothesis is proportional to the prior
  probability<br> times the likelihood relative to the total evidence:<br> p(Curve/Data) = p(Curve) p(Data/Curve)
  /p(Data) .<br> The likelihood term, p(Data/Curve), simply measures the goodness-of-fit, so the<br> only vehicle for
  including any estimate of the predictive value of the curve is in<br> the prior probability, p(Curve). In order to
  replicate the Akaike result, we would<br> need<br> p(Curve) = p(Data) e&minus;k ,<br> where p(Data) is merely a
  normalization factor. But we do not see how a<br> Bayesian can justify assigning priors in accordance with this
  scheme.<br> The problem is not avoided by adopting a subjectivist approach that eschews<br> the need for objective
  justification. The problem is deeper than that. The<br> trouble is that a particular curve, as opposed to a family of
  curves, cannot be<br> assigned a value of k on a priori grounds. After all, any curve is a member of<br> many families
  of different dimensions. While this problem for Akaike arises in<br> the guise of the subfamily problem, the proposed
  solution was to distrust<br> subfamilies that have a special relationship with the data. However, no<br> comparable
  solution is available to the Bayesians because the determination of k<br> must be made independently of the data.
  Thus, Bayesians must find an entirely<br> different kind of solution to the subfamily problem,<br> 39 However, Aitkin
  [1991] has a different &#145;average likelihood&#146; proposal, which allegedly solves<br> the curve fitting problem.
  He computes the average by weighing each curve in the family by<br> its posterior probability p(Curve/Data), given all
  the available data. A theorem based on the<br> same assumptions as Akaike&#146;s Theorem shows that:<br> Log(Aitkin
  Average Likelihood of F) = Log-likelihood(L(F)) &minus; (k/2)log2 .<br> Since log2 is less than 1 (the logarithms are
  to base e), Aitkin imposes less than 1/2 of<br> Akaike&#146;s penalty for complexity. This is already an uncomfortable
  consequence because the<br> Error Theorem shows that (PAR) will be chosen over (LIN) by Aitkin&#146;s criterion more
  often<br> than not even when (LIN) is true. But the real problem is that the criterion is just &#145;pulled out of<br>
  a hat.&#146; What will families of greater average posterior likelihood provide for us? Will they<br> tend to bring us
  closer to the truth, or give us more accurate predictions, or what? Aitkin<br> provides no answers to these questions.
  Given that Aitkin&#146;s proposal does not have more<br> fundamental principles to fall back on, how does he cope with
  the subfamily problem? There<br> is no analogue to the Error Theorem for Aitkin because there is no sense in which
  average<br> likelihood is in error if it is not estimating anything. Also see the commentaries immediately<br>
  following Aitkin&#146;s paper, including one by Akaike.<br> 26 Malcolm Forster and Elliott Sober<br> and we fail to
  see how this can be done.40<br> Our diagnosis of the problem is that Bayesianism is unable to capture the<br> proper
  significance of considering families of curves. We work with families<br> because they deliver the most reliable
  estimates of the predictive accuracy of a<br> few curves; namely their best fitting cases. There is no reason to
  suspect that<br> such an enterprise can be construed as maximizing the probability that these best<br> fitting cases
  are true. Why should we be interested in the probability of these<br> curves&#146; being true, when it is intuitively
  clear that no curve fitting procedure will<br> ever deliver curves that are exactly true? If we have to live with
  false<br> hypotheses, then it may be wise to lower our sights, and aim at hypotheses that<br> have the highest
  possible predictive accuracy. Thus, the brand of Bayesianism<br> most popular amongst philosophers is founded on too
  narrow a conception of the<br> scientific enterprise.41<br> Having said all that, we do not draw the rash conclusion
  that Bayesian<br> methodology is irrelevant to Akaike&#146;s new predictive paradigm. There are many<br> Bayesian
  solutions to practical statistical problems. However, Akaike&#146;s<br> reconceptualization of statistics does
  recommend that the foundations of<br> Bayesian statistics require rethinking.42 A positive suggestion may be that<br>
  Bayesian methods can help determine the probability that one hypothesis is more<br> predictively accurate than
  another. In that way, Bayesian methods might be<br> usefully brought to bear on the problem of assessing the
  reliability of estimated<br> accuracies, for that appears to be an important and open area of research.<br> 8.
  EMPIRICISM AND REALISM<br> One virtue of our approach is that it makes clear what the simplicity of a curve<br> has to
  do with the reasons one might have for believing it. Popper [1959] argued<br> that simpler curves are more
  falsifiable; Sober [1975] suggested that simpler<br> curves are more informative. These proposals, and others like
  them,43 make it<br> 40 In this respect, we think it is instructive to consider the recent attempt by Jefferys and
  Berger<br> [1992] to provide a Bayesian rationale for Ockham&#146;s razor. We criticize their proposal in<br> Sober
  and Forster [1992].<br> 41 It is easy to construct examples which show that maximizing probability of truth is
  different<br> from maximizing closeness to the truth. A common example is the use of averages to estimate<br> a
  discrete number, say the number of children in an American family. An estimate of 1.9<br> children has less
  probability of being true in any case than an estimate of 2, but may be<br> predictively more accurate
  nevertheless.<br> 42 Akaike [1985] shows how the rule of Bayesian conditionalization, as a method of updating<br>
  probabilities, may be understood in terms of maximizing expected predictive accuracy.<br> 43 Turney [1990]
  demonstrates that simpler families of curves are more stable. Roughly, the<br> instability of a family of curves,
  relative to the data, is the expected &#145;distance&#146; (measured by<br> the SOS) of a new best fitting curve from
  the old best fitting curve when the data are perturbed<br> in accordance with the known error distribution. Turney&#146;s
  measure of instability takes one step<br> How to Tell when Simpler Theories will Provide More Accurate Predictions
  27<br> difficult to say why one ought to believe simpler curves rather than their more<br> complex competitors. In
  contrast, the analysis we have proposed greatly<br> simplifies the task of justification. When a simpler curve is more
  plausible than<br> its more complex alternatives, this is because it has a higher estimated predictive<br>
  accuracy.<br> We believe that our account of curve fitting is good news for empiricism,<br> although it does not
  accord with what has been said by many empiricists. The<br> idea that some sui generis criterion of simplicity is
  relevant to judging the<br> plausibility of hypotheses is deeply inimical to empiricism. For empiricism,<br>
  hypothesis evaluation should be driven by data, not by a priori assumptions<br> about what a &#145;good&#146;
  hypothesis should be like. Empiricists often take this point<br> to heart and conclude that simplicity is a merely
  pragmatic virtue, one having to<br> do with the usefulness of hypotheses, but not with their plausibility (cf. e.g.,
  Van<br> Fraassen [1980], pp. 87-89). The embarrassing thing about this dismissal of<br> simplicity is that it applies
  not just to highly theoretical hypotheses, but to quite<br> mundane empirical generalizations of the sort that figure
  in some curve fitting<br> problems. In these contexts, skepticism about simplicity threatens to lead the<br>
  empiricist down the garden path to skepticism about induction (Sober [1990a]).<br> Empiricists therefore should
  welcome the idea that curve fitting does not require<br> a sui generis criterion of simplicity. This does not show
  that some form of<br> radical empiricism is true. Rather, we draw the more modest conclusion that the<br> data tell
  you more than you may have thought.44<br> Although our goal has been to show how the simplicity of a curve can reflect<br>
  important facts about its predictive accuracy, we do not claim that all uses of<br> simplicity and parsimony in
  science reduce to purely evidential considerations.<br> We do not deny that scientists often have pragmatic reasons
  for using simpler<br> curves instead of more complex ones. However, we would insist that these<br> pragmatic
  considerations not be confused with evidential ones. Monolithic<br> theories about simplicity and parsimony?which
  claim that these considerations<br> are never evidential or that they are never merely pragmatic?should be
  replaced<br> by a more pluralistic approach. At least in the context of the curve fitting<br> problem, Akaike&#146;s
  technical result provides a benchmark that identifies the<br> degree to which simplicity has evidential significance.
  Any further weight<br> accorded to simplicity, we suspect, derives from pragmatic considerations.<br> Our analysis
  supports the idea that the simplicity of a family of curves is an<br> towards estimating the degree of overfitting, as
  we have characterized it. However, in our<br> opinion, his paper does not show why stability should be relevant to the
  question of what to<br> believe. We also note that Turney leaves open the justification for trade offs between<br>
  simplicity and goodness-of-fit. Akaike&#146;s Theorem is more general than Turney&#146;s theorem in<br> any case?it is
  not restricted to the standard curve fitting situation, and does not assume a<br> known error variance.<br> 44 For the
  bearing of this thesis on traditional arguments against the existence of component<br> forces in Newtonian physics,
  see Forster [1988b].<br> 28 Malcolm Forster and Elliott Sober<br> epistemic epiphenomenon.45 Sometimes simpler curves
  are to be preferred over<br> more complicated ones, but the reason for this is not that simplicity is an<br> epistemic
  end-in-itself. At other times, more complex curves are to be preferred<br> over simpler alternatives, but this is not
  because the irreducible demands of<br> simplicity are overwhelmed by more weighty considerations of some other
  sort.<br> Whether a simpler curve is preferable to some more complex alternative, or the<br> reverse is true, has
  nothing to do with simplicity and everything to do with<br> predictive accuracy.<br> Our brand of empiricism is not
  antithetical to the realist view that science aims<br> at the truth,46 in the same sense that archers aim at the bull&#146;s-eye
  even when<br> they have no hope of hitting it. In the past, the curve fitting problem has posed a<br> dilemma: Either
  accept a realist interpretation of science at the price of viewing<br> simplicity as an irreducible and a prioristic
  sign of truth and thereby eschew<br> empiricism, or embrace some form of anti-realism. Akaike&#146;s solution to
  the<br> curve fitting problem dismantles the dilemma. It now is possible to be a realist<br> and an empiricist at the
  same time.<br> Popper [1968] initiated a realist program that takes the &#145;disastrous metainduction<br>
  &#146; (Laudan [1984]) seriously - all of our scientific theories in the past<br> have been false, so it is likely
  that all of our theories in the future will also be<br> false. Even granting this prediction of failure, it may make
  sense to claim that<br> our theories aim at the truth if we could (1) define a measure of<br> closeness-to-the-truth,
  and (2) show how theory choice could be viewed as<br> implementing some method that would, more often than not, take
  us closer to<br> the truth. Proposed solutions to the problem of defining verisimilitude have<br> never gained wide
  acceptance,47 and the second part of the programme is seldom<br> discussed.<br> We have already described predictive
  accuracy as a measure of closeness to<br> 45 This thesis complements the view of parsimony developed in Sober [1988b],
  [1990b]. It also<br> might be formulated in terms of the idea of screening off: Simplicity is correlated with<br>
  plausibility, but only because simplicity also is correlated with predictive accuracy. Once the<br> estimated
  predictive accuracy of a hypothesis is held fixed, its simplicity has nothing further to<br> contribute to an
  assessment of its plausibility.<br> 46 We do not claim that this is the only aim of science. We agree with
  sociologists of science<br> that a complete account of the practice of science must include an account of pragmatic
  and<br> social values. Modern theories of decision making are well equipped to model scientific<br> practice in terms
  of pragmatic, social, and evidential considerations, in a way that is<br> compatible with realism (Hooker [1987]).
  However, we do oppose those extremists who<br> believe that internal evidential considerations play no role in the
  social dynamics of science.<br> 47 Popper&#146;s original definition of verisimilitude was formulated in terms of the
  deductive<br> consequences of theories; fatal flaws were detected independently by Tich&yacute; [1974] and by<br>
  Miller [1974]. Tich&yacute; [1974] presents an alternative definition of his own, which Miller [1974]<br> shows to be
  language dependent. Miller [1975] also argues that the intuitive notion of<br> accuracy of prediction is also subject
  to the same kind of language variance. Good&#146;s [1975]<br> reply to Miller&#146;s paper contains a brief
  explanation of why a probabilistic definition of<br> accuracy, like Akaike&#146;s, is not susceptible to Miller&#146;s
  objection. See Forster [1992a] for<br> further discussion.<br> How to Tell when Simpler Theories will Provide More
  Accurate Predictions 29<br> the truth. To that extent, Akaike&#146;s approach revitalizes Popper&#146;s
  programme.48<br> However, we suspect that those neo-Popperians who seek some grand<br> metaphysical definition of
  closeness to the truth will be disappointed with a<br> notion of predictive accuracy defined by reference to a
  specified domain of<br> inquiry.49 Nonetheless, we are convinced that any definition of verisimilitude<br> must be
  limited in this way if we are primarily interested in epistemological<br> questions. In any event, the important point
  is that Akaike&#146;s Theorem lays the<br> epistemological foundation for our progress towards the truth in this
  domainrelative<br> sense.<br> In spite of our sympathy for Popper&#146;s quest for a concept of verisimilitude, we<br>
  nonetheless reject hypothetico-deductivism, on which the Popperian programme<br> is founded.50 The
  hypothetico-deductivist strategy has been to adopt an<br> idealized model of science in which there are no
  probabilistic errors in the data,<br> to use this error-free idealization to solve various philosophical problems, and<br>
  then to add an account of error as an afterthought.51 Our analysis suggests that<br> many central problems in the
  philosophy of science are not decomposable in this<br> way. Simplicity and unification are relevant to our judgments
  about what is<br> truth-like only to the extent that observing and inferring are subject to error.<br> 9. APPENDIX A:
  THE ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND AKAIKE&#146;S THEOREM<br> There are three kinds of assumption behind the proof of Akaike&#146;s
  Theorem.<br> First, there is a &#145;uniformity of nature&#146; assumption that says that the true curve,<br> whatever
  it is, remains the same for both the old and the new data sets<br> considered in the definition of predictive
  accuracy. The second kind of<br> assumption consists of mathematically formulated conditions that ensure the<br>
  &#145;asymptotic normality&#146; of the likelihood function (viz. the likelihood viewed as a<br> function of parameter
  values). These assumptions contribute to proving various<br> central limit theorems in mathematical statistics. The
  final assumption is that<br> the sample size (the amount of data) is large enough to ensure that the likelihood<br>
  function will approximate its asymptotic properties. It is the second assumption<br> that requires the most
  explaining. We first say what the &#145;normality&#146; assumption<br> 48 This perspective also is relevant to
  Cartwright&#146;s [1983] argument that the proliferation of<br> mutually incompatible models in physics is a reason to
  reject realism. This is an<br> embarrassment to a realist who interprets all (viable) models as true. On the other
  hand, our<br> brand of realist is only interested in interpreting hypotheses as being more or less<br>
  close-to-the-truth. A plurality of models is conducive to a more modest realist programme.<br> 49 We note in this
  connection that there are philosophical issues raised by the concept of<br> prediction that are not addressed by
  Akaike&#146;s notion of predictive accuracy.<br> 50 Note that hypothetico-deductivism, as we understand it, is not
  rescued by the fact that<br> probabilistic assertions about future data are deduced from scientific hypotheses.
  For<br> hypothetico-deductivism demands that at least some of the deductive consequences of our<br> theories are
  observations, but we do not observe probabilities.<br> 51 See Forster [1994] for a discussion of how this bears on
  Hempel&#146;s raven paradox.<br> 30 Malcolm Forster and Elliott Sober<br> is, and describe the pivotal role it has
  played in statistics.<br> The normal, or Gaussian, probability distribution is easily recognized in its<br> one
  dimensional form by its characteristic bell shape. In its more general<br> multivariate form, the normal distribution
  has come to play a pivotal role in<br> experimental and theoretical statistics. In experimental statistics, error<br>
  distributions (in the estimation of parameter values) are found to be<br> approximately normal, especially for large
  data sets. According to Cramér<br> ([1946], p.231), &#145;Such is the case, e.g., with the distributions of errors
  of<br> physical and astronomical measurements, a great number of demographical and<br> biological distributions, etc.&#146;
  In fact, the assumption that measurement errors are<br> normally distributed around a mean value is so widespread in
  science that it is<br> often referred to as the law of errors. On the theoretical side, &#145;the central limit<br>
  theorem affords a theoretical explanation of these empirical facts.&#146; In a<br> somewhat humorous tone, Cramér
  ([1946], p.232) sums up by quoting Lippman<br> as saying: &#145;everyone believes in the law of errors, the
  experimenters because<br> they think it is a mathematical theorem, the mathematicians because they think it<br> is an
  experimental fact,&#146; and adds that &#145;both parties are perfectly right, provided<br> that their belief is not
  too absolute.&#146;<br> Mathematically, these assumptions are difficult to state explicitly, not just<br> because they
  are mathematically esoteric, but also because there are various<br> ways in which the assumptions may be weakened (see
  Cramér [1946]). For this<br> reason, mathematical statisticians almost always vaguely refer to the<br> assumptions as
  &#145;certain regularity conditions.&#146; They would certainly not make<br> the brazen claim that these conditions
  hold for all real scientific models, and we<br> follow their lead here. However, we do wish to say that the conditions
  are not<br> unduly restrictive. There is no need to assume that the error distributions<br> associated with the
  observational data are themselves approximately bell-shaped.<br> The standard coin tossing example illustrates the
  point. The assumed &#145;error&#146;<br> distribution is the binomial distribution (the probability getting the high
  value is<br> p, while the probability of the low value is (1&minus;p)), yet the distribution for the<br> p-estimates
  is asymptotically normal. The second point is that asymptotic<br> normality is not restricted to models that are
  linear in their parameters. For<br> example, suppose that the product &alpha; &beta; occurs in one of the equations of
  the<br> model. If &#136; &alpha; and &#136;&beta; are their maximum likelihood estimates and the values of &alpha;<br>
  and &beta; are sufficiently close to these estimates, then we may write: &alpha; &beta; = (&alpha;&#136; +<br>
  &Delta;&alpha;)( &#136;&beta;+ &Delta;&beta;) &asymp; &#136; &alpha; &#136;&beta; + &#136; &alpha; &Delta;&beta; +
  &#136;&beta; &Delta;&alpha;. Here, &#136; &alpha; and &#136;&beta; are constants, and the<br> nonlinear product is now
  linear in the new, transformed, parameters &Delta;&alpha; and &Delta;&beta;.<br> This approximation will be valid
  because the region of non-negligible<br> likelihoods becomes more narrowly concentrated around the best estimates
  as<br> the sample size increases. The same argument applies to other sufficiently<br> smooth nonlinear equations, such
  as Y = sin(&alpha;X + &beta;), and so on.<br> Perhaps the most restrictive assumption is that the sample size be
  large. This<br> How to Tell when Simpler Theories will Provide More Accurate Predictions 31<br> does not mean merely
  that the total data set is large, but that there is enough data<br> within the domain of each parameter. For example,
  the approximate normality<br> of the model M1 and M2 in Section 3 requires that both of the data sets D1 and D2<br>
  are sufficiently large.<br> 10 APPENDIX B: A PROOF OF A SPECIAL CASE OF AKAIKE&#146;S<br> THEOREM<br> Suppose that we
  are sampling from a target population of values of a random<br> variable X (e.g. the population of possible
  measurements of the mass of an<br> object) with mean &mu;* (the true mass) and variance &sigma;2 (the error of
  measurement),<br> where the true probability distribution p for the values x of the random variable<br> X is normal,
  or Gaussian. That is,<br> ( ) ( )2<br> 2 2<br> 1 exp 1 *<br> 2 2<br> p x x &mu;<br>
  &pi;&sigma; &sigma;<br> = &#63726;&minus; &minus; &#63737; &#63727;&#63728; &#63738;&#63739;<br> .<br> Now consider a
  hypothesis (&#145;curve&#146;) that (falsely) asserts that the mean is &mu;. The<br> hypothesis in question asserts
  that the probability distribution for measured<br> values of X is<br> ( ) ( )2<br> 2 2<br> 1 exp 1<br> 2 2<br> q x x
  &mu;<br>
  &pi;&sigma; &sigma;<br> = &#63726;&minus; &minus; &#63737; &#63727;&#63728; &#63738;&#63739;<br> .<br> Hypotheses like
  q(x) form a family of hypotheses, each of which corresponds to<br> a particular value of the parameter &mu;. Thus, it
  is notationally convenient to<br> denote the hypothesis itself by &mu;. (It will be clear from the context when &mu;
  is the<br> parameter, the parameter value, or the hypothesis in the family corresponding to<br> a parameter value.)
  The simplicity of a family of hypotheses (referred to by<br> statisticians as a model) is measured by the number of
  adjustable parameters; in<br> this case there is only one (&mu;).<br> If we accept this family of hypotheses, the next
  step is to find the best fitting<br> hypothesis, and this is the hypothesis that confers the highest probability<br>
  (density) on the data (i.e. has the maximum likelihood out of all the members of<br> the family). We denote the
  maximum likelihood hypothesis (which is also<br>
  &mu;* &mu; x<br> p (x) q (x)<br> FIGURE 5<br> 32 Malcolm Forster and Elliott Sober<br> the maximum log-likelihood
  hypothesis) by&mu;&#136; . How will&mu;&#136; , obtained from past<br> data, fare in the prediction of new data drawn
  from the same population? For<br> any particular datum x, we might measure the accuracy with which it is<br> predicted
  by its goodness-of-fit; viz. the log-likelihood, log p(x). But we are<br> really interested in the &#145;average datum&#146;
  drawn from the population, so we define<br> the predictive accuracy (A for &#145;accuracy&#146;) of an arbitrary
  hypothesis &mu; to be:<br> A(&mu;) = df E*(log q(x)),<br> where q(x) is the probability distribution in the family
  corresponding to the<br> parameter value &mu;, and E* is the expected value calculated with respect to the<br> true
  hypothesis (&mu;*). That is,<br> A(&mu;) p(x)logq(x)dx<br>
  &infin;<br>
  &minus;&infin;<br> = &int; .<br> Note that A(&mu;) is the expected log-likelihood per datum for a data set of
  arbitrary<br> size N. From the diagram, it is intuitively clear that a distribution q(x) with<br> central point &mu;
  that is far from the true value &mu;* is not going to do so well in<br> predicting data randomly sampled from the true
  population. By the same token,<br> p(x) is going to do the best job of fitting the data it generates. The
  following<br> result gives this intuitive fact a quantitative representation:<br> A(&mu;) = A(&mu;*) &minus; &frac12;
  (&mu; &minus;&mu;*)2/&sigma; 2. (1)<br> Proof: The log of<br> ( )2<br> 2<br> exp 1<br> 2<br> x &mu;<br>
  &sigma;<br>
  &#63726;&minus; &minus; &#63737; &#63727;&#63728; &#63738;&#63739;<br> is clearly equal to<br>
  &minus; &frac12; (&mu; &minus;&mu;*)2/&sigma; 2.<br> But,<br> (x &minus; &mu;)2 = (x &minus; &mu;* &minus; (&mu;
  &minus;&mu;*))2 = (x &minus;&mu;*)2 - 2(x &minus; &mu;)(&mu; &minus;&mu;*) + (&mu; &minus;&mu;*)2.<br> When we take
  expectations and simplify the result follows. This completes the<br> proof.<br> Since (1) holds for any hypothesis in
  the family, it surely holds for the<br> hypothesis that best fits the past data. Thus,<br> ( ) ( ) ( )1 2 2<br> 2 A&mu;&#136;=A&mu;*&minus;
  &mu;&minus;&mu;* &sigma; .<br> While interesting, this result is still epistemologically unhelpful because we<br> don&#146;t
  know A(&mu;*) and we don&#146;t know the value of &mu;*. The second problem is<br> surmounted in the following way. We
  may estimate A(&mu;&#136;) by the expected value<br> of the right hand side, where the expected value is taken over
  the maximum<br> likelihood estimate&mu;&#136; . That is,<br> Estimate of ( ) ( ) ( )1 2 2<br> 2 A&mu;&#136;=E*&#63726;&#63728;A&mu;&minus;
  &mu;&#136;&minus;&mu;* &sigma;&#63737;&#63739;.<br> How to Tell when Simpler Theories will Provide More Accurate
  Predictions 33<br> But the central limit theorem tells us that the expected sum of squared deviations<br> of an
  estimate of &mu; from its true value is just &sigma;2/N, where N is the number of data<br> in the sample from which
  the estimate is taken (the number of &#145;past data&#146;).<br> Thus, we have<br> Estimate of A(&mu;&#136; ) = A(&mu;*)
  &minus; &frac12; /N. (2)<br> The only remaining problem is to estimate A(&mu;*). Again the qualitative facts are<br>
  clear. If&mu;&#136; is the best fitting hypothesis relative to past data, then it fits the past<br> data better than
  any other hypothesis (by definition), and therefore it fits better<br> than &mu;*. Thus, if l(&mu;&#136;)is the
  log-likelihood of the best fitting hypothesis, then<br> l(&mu;&#136;)&gt; l(&mu;*) andE*(l(&mu;&#136; ) N) &gt;E*(l(&mu;*)
  N) = df A(&mu;*). The question as to how<br> much greater is answered by the following result (without proof):<br> A(&mu;*)
  = 1<br> 2 E*(l(&mu;&#136; ) N) &minus; N. (3)<br> If we now combine (2) and (3) we get:<br> Estimate of A(&mu;&#136;)=E*(l(&mu;&#136;)&minus;1)N.<br>
  Since l(&mu;&#136;)&minus;1 is clearly an unbiased estimate of E*( l(&mu;&#136;)&minus;1), we finally arrive at<br>
  the main result, as it applies to this example:<br> Akaike [1973]: Estimate of A(&mu;&#136; ) = (1/N )[ l(&mu;&#136;)
  &minus;1].<br> That is, if we are interested in the predictive accuracy of the best fitting<br> hypothesis from the
  family, we should not judge its accuracy by its<br> goodness-of-fit, for that estimate is usually biased towards being
  too high. An<br> unbiased estimate is obtained by using a corrected measure of goodness-of-fit.<br> The important fact
  is that this result generalizes (surprisingly well) to a variety<br> of conditions, and to examples of models with
  many adjustable parameters. If k<br> is the number of adjustable parameters in a model, then we may state Akaike&#146;s<br>
  theorem in its general form:<br> Akaike [1973]: Estimate of A(&mu;&#136; ) = (1/N )[ l(&mu;&#136;) &minus;k].<br> This
  is the formula that quantifies the trade-off between simplicity (the number<br> of adjustable parameters) and
  goodness-of-fit (the maximum log-likelihood).<br> Department of Philosophy<br> University of Wisconsin, Madison
