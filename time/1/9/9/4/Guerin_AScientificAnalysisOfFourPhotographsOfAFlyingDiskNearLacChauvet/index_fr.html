<section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Il existe de nombreuses <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/indice/photo">photographies</a> d'ovnis supposés, mais
    même les <a href="/people/ufologues.html">ufologues</a> les plus convaincus disent qu'aucune d'entre elles ne
    fournit une <a href="/science/Preuve.html">preuve</a> absolue de l'existence de ces objets.</p>
  <p>De fait, même si un cliché n'a pas été truqué et représente donc un objet réellement photographié, cet objet
    pourrait bien ne pas être un <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/OVNI.html">ovni</a>, mais une maquette placée dans le
    paysage. Parfois, l'image photographique pourrait se révéler totalement inexploitable pour récolter des informations
    comme, par exemple, l'image surexposée d'un grand point brillant observé de nuit sans aucun point de référence dans
    le paysage. Une telle image pourrait être causée par n'importe quoi : la <a
      href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/lune">Lune</a>, un lampadaire, un phare de voiture, etc. L'objet
    produit un dessin de zigzag sur la photographie, souvent à cause des mouvements du photographe qui tient
    généralement son appareil à la main et utilise des temps d'exposition longs, et non du mouvement de l'objet
    lui-même.</p>
  <p>Il existe des photographies d'ovnis bien connues, dont l'authenticité n'a pas été remise en cause après des
    enquêtes sérieuses. Pour commencer, nous discutons des fameuses <a
      class="canular" href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/McMinnville">photographes de McMinnville </a> (prise
    dans l'Oregon <time>1950</time>), qui furent étudiées en premier par l'<a
      href="/people/astronomes.html">astronome</a> <span
      class="people">William K. Hartmann</span> dans le Rapport Condon <span
      class="source">Condon (Edward U.) : <a href="/org/us/university/colorado/projet/condon">Scientific Study of
      Unidentified Flying Objects</a>. Bantam Books, 1969, pp.
      396-407.</span> <span class="source">Maccabee (Bruce S.): "On the Possibility that the McMinnville Photos show a
      Distant Unidentified Object". Dans les Actes de la Conférence du CUFOS de 1976, pp. 152-163.</span>. Partant d'une
    analyse microdensitométrique des négatifs, <span class="people">Hartmann</span> en tire la conclusion que:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Il s'agit d'un des rares signalements d'ovnis où tous les facteurs examinés, géométriques, psychologiques et
      physiques, semblent être cohérents avec l'assertion qu'un objet volant extraordinaire, argenté, métallique, en
      forme de disque, de dizaines de mètres de diamètres, et à l'évidence artificiel, a volé devant les yeux de deux <a
        href="/people/witness/index.html">témoins</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Cependant, <time>1977</time>, l'ingénieur <span class="people">Claude Poher</span>, qui fut le premier Directeur du
    <a href="/org/eu/fr/cnes/gepan">GEPAN</a>, étudia ces photographies. Une analyse géométrique de la position
    apparente de l'objet par rapport aux fils électriques au premier plan sur les 2 images consécutives convainquit
    <span class="people">Poher</span> que, en fait, une petite maquette suspendue depuis l'un de ces fils <span
      class="source">Poher, C: Les photos de McMinnville sont probablement celles d'une maquette suspendue.

      phénomènes aériens non identifiés", CNES, 1977-12</span>.
  </p>
  <p>Ensuite, nous discutons des <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Ummo/SanJoseDeValderas">photographies de
    San Jose de Valderas</a> (prises en Espagne <time>1967</time>) et liées à <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Ummo">l'affaire Ummo</a>. Concernant ces images, il ne fait pas de doute
    qu'il s'agit d'une petite maquette suspendue avec un fil très fin. Il existe 2 ensembles d'images, prétendument pris
    avec 2 appareils différents (de tailles 24 x 36 et 6 x 6) par 2 photographes ne se connaissant pas et qui auraient
    pris les photographies juste quand l'objet serait apparu. Mais l'analyse du premier plan dans les 2 ensembles montre
    ne fait qu'ils furent pris depuis pratiquement le même endroit, les 2 appareils étant côte à côte, fixés sur des
    tripodes à 1,15 m du sol, probablement par le même photographe ! Une telle "spontanéité" suggère fortement une
    fraude organisée. De plus, l'étude photométrique des négatifs par <span class="people">Poher</span> prouva que
    l'objet était translucide <span class="source">Poher, Claude : Les observations
      d'Aluche et de San Jose de Valderas [...] : une supercherie de taille (ibid.)</span>.</p>
  <p>En troisième est la photographie d'un enjoliveur d'une voiture Peugeot lancé en l'air dans un bois de pin Corse par
    un petit groupe voulant apparemment gagner de l'argent en publiant un poster (une fabrication à l'évidence moins
    sophistiquée). Un membre de ce groupe a par la suite admis le canular <span class="source">Dufour, J.-C. :
      Communication privée</span>. Près de 60 tentatives (deux rouleaux de pellicule couleur 35 mm) ont été nécessaires
    pour obtenir une image correcte de la "soucoupe." Elle a été publiée dans la revue française <i>Ouranos</i>, et
    récupérée des années plus tard par un technicien de l'Observatoire de Haute-Provence, qui déclara en présence de
    Charles Fehrenbach (alors Directeur de l'observatoire) avoir pris cette photographie lui-même à l'observatoire. Il
    n'y a pas de pire méthode de convaincre Fehrenbach de l'existence des ovnis ; la végétation à l'observatoire est
    constituée de petits chênes rabougris !</p>
  <p>Finalement, je mentionnerai ma propre expérience, which was a lesson for me. In <time>1970</time>, <span
    class="people">Charles Bowen</span>, Director of the <a href="/org/uk/media/press/FSR.html"><i lang="en">Flying
    Saucer Review</i></a> at that time, asked me to assess two photographs taken by night at Warminster, England on
    black and white 35 mm film. They showed a dimly luminous UFO seen by its side slightly above the horizon, with a row
    of street lamps in the background <span
      class="source">Flying Saucer Review, July-Aug. 1970, (Vol. 16, n 4).</span> . Analysis of the film convinced me
    that it had not been faked and that this was actually the photographic image of a real object taken through the
    camera lens. I should not have continued but, since Bowen had sworn to me that the photographers were honest and had
    seen the UFO, I did not question this and tried to explain some discrepancies between what the photographs showed
    and what the photographers said <span class="source">Flying Saucer Review,
      Nov.-Dec. 1970, (Vol. 16, n 6).</span>. Indeed, it was a trap produced by English "<a
      href="/science/methode/Rationalisme.html">rationalists</a>" who aimed to discredit ufologists. In reality, the UFO
    was a model slightly lighted and the image of which was superimposed on the landscape by means of a two-way mirror
    placed in front of the camera. The perpetrators had a good laugh over my "credulity," and made a great to-do about
    the case thinking that they had demonstrated the deception of UFO photographs. Actually, they had only shown their
    intellectual dishonesty by deceiving Bowen's trust.</p>
  <p>One could deduce from these examples that a UFO photograph, even if not faked, has a persuasive value only if one
    is confident in the witness's intellectual honesty. This means that no photograph is intrinsically convincing.
    However, such a judgment is too harsh. First, there do exist photographs which we know were not faked, such as those
    taken by the military. Unfortunately, few photographs of this kind have been made public, even if some photographs
    or film (e.g., during rocket launches) have been reported. However, there also exist photographs taken by amateurs,
    for which intrinsic analysis is sufficient to prove their authenticity without having to believe the witness's
    testimony. I think the Lac Chauvet French photographs are a good example of such evidence.</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>The Lac Chauvet Photographs</h2>
  <p>Like many other early ufologists, I discovered the Lac Chauvet UFO photographs in Aimé Michel's first book, "Lueurs
    Sur les Soucoupes Volantes" (published by Mame), which I bought in <time>1954-08</time> when it was published <span
      class="source">Michel (Aimé),The Truth About Flying Saucers, Criterion Books, New York, 1956.</span> <span
      class="note">This book has been published in America under the title "The truth about flying saucers." It seems FrCgnale did not
  want his photographs published without copyright. Thus, he had left copies of them to an agency which was in charge of
  distributing them. The standard of living of retired engineers during years just after the Liberation was not as it is
  now, so I think <span class="people">Frégnale</span>'s behavior does not argue against the authenticity of the photographs.</span>.
    These photographs had been taken two years before by an engineer named <span class="people">Andre Frégnale</span>.
    Two of them were included in the book with a short comment, in fact incorrect, relative to the order of the shots
    and to the direction of the object's movement. These photographs displayed a disk viewed obliquely like an ellipse
    flattening with distance, in a very clear summer sky. The horizon was not visible on these images, but it was
    obviously very near to the lower limit of the photographed field. Stratified cumulus in the background, such as one
    can observe near the horizon, appeared at the bottom of one image; a little grassy hillock was visible in the
    foreground of another one. These details permitted a first evaluation of the object's angular height, provided the
    focal distance of the lens was known. The lower part of the UFO was dark, and no detail was visible on the published
    images. The upper right edge of the ellipse looked bright, as if sunlight had been reflected by the object.</p>
  <p>These photographs were interesting to me because of their clarity and of the qualifications of the witness, who had
    very precisely observed the object and did not believe in flying saucers. At the end of his observation, as the
    object flew away towards the horizon, <span class="people">Frégnale</span>, who had taken his binoculars, saw it
    "disintegrate" and disappear on the spot. For that reason, he assumed that it was "agglomerated cosmic dusts" (which
    is complete nonsense for any astronomer or meteorologist).</p>
  <p>Some years later, I obtained the original negatives. There were actually four 24 X 36 images, taken successively on
    a black and white negative film. They were preceded and followed by images having no relation with the UFO
    photographs. Therefore, there were no successive attempts to get "good" photographs of the object, nor "failures."
    For me this was a strong argument against a forgery, although it was not yet a proof. I critically analyzed the four
    negatives with a microscope, which made me certain of the absence of any alteration or natural photographic artifact
    like a reflection, development marks, etc. These were images of an outside object formed on the film through the
    camera lens. Moreover, these images <em>could not result from intentional superposition</em> (by use of a two-way
    mirror or other means), because such a trick would not leave on the negatives dark details of the foreground trees
    completely underexposed and the lower side of the UFO partially underexposed. Hence, the photographs actually showed
    an object in the sky, but what kind of an object?</p>
  <p>With great care, I made enlarged copies of the four images in my laboratory of the Institut d'Astrophysique,
    including the margins of the 35 mm negative film, using an excellent magnification lens. This lens gave very sharp
    images with no geometric distortions, such that all the details contained in the original negatives were on the
    copies. However, the photometric data were necessarily altered due to the non-linearity of the photographic curves.
    (However, since the original negatives were not calibrated before development, quantitative luminance measurements
    were impossible, even with the original negatives.) <span class="note">Once this work was finished, I returned the original negative roll of film to the person who had lent it to me and who
then gave it back to <span class="people">Frégnale</span>. Recently, I learned that the roll of film stayed in his hands until he died about ten
years ago. <span class="people">Frégnale</span> was single and lived with his sister who was single also. I was able to get the present address
of this woman, who is now very old. It seems she still has the material left by her late brother, but says she is too tired to search for them in the box where they have been placed. The original negatives of the Lac Chauvet UFO will probably be thrown away when the old woman dies, even if heirs are defined. So I had to be content with working on my copies of these negatives, which on my honor as a scientist, have not been altered.

So I had to be content with working on my copies of these negatives, which on my honor as a scientist, have not been altered.</span>
  </p>
  <p>In <time>1972</time> I used these images to illustrate a paper on UFOs, which was published the same year in the
    September issue of the French magazine <i lang="fr">Science et Avenir</i>. At that time I drew the reader's
    attention to the presence of an oblong black spot on the lower dark side of the disk. At first glance, this spot
    seemed pointed in a direction opposite to the alleged movement of the object on the four images, changing
    progressively with the perspective effect from a horizontal position to an inclined one towards the top right, as
    the object "went down" towards the horizon at the left. But it is only recently, at Joel Mesnard's suggestion, that
    I undertook to mathematically test this apparent property. Study of the images convinced me that a detailed analysis
    would reveal much more information than a brief examination could <span class="note">A French ufologist, editor of the French journal of ufology Lumières dans la Nuit.
  </span>. One then only has to compare the numeric data obtained from the images to a geometric model of the trajectory
    based on the witness's statements. The deductions drawn from this modeling appeared to be predictive, in agreement
    with the computations made from the measurements done on the shots. This procedure has provided the proof of the
    authenticity of the photographs; the UFO geometrically behaves like a distant flying object traveling on a straight
    horizontal trajectory, always keeping some inclination to the ground, and not like a model oscillating at the end of
    a wire or thrown into the air four consecutive times.</p>

        south. The witness immediately took two photographs when the object was near this largest angular height
        (Photographs I and 2), and then took two other photographs when the object was moving away to the left, going
        down towards the horizon due to the perspective effect (Photographs 3 and 4). As the object's angular dimensions
        became smaller and smaller, the witness used his binoculars to view it and, shortly after, saw it disappear
        mysteriously, as if it had vanished on the spot. The observation only lasted about fifty seconds, and the
        witness thought that the object's azimuth covered about 100 degrees during this time. The trajectory was
        "horizontal and straight," the linear speed was apparently "constant," the movement uniformity was "impressive,
        without any swinging or sinuosity in the trajectory," and there was a "total" silence.

        eccentric spot was visible under the disk, like (under the hypothesis of a driven machine) a slightly swollen
        "nacelle" or "cockpit." The witness saw, with his binoculars, a "cut" in front of this "cockpit," and another
        one at its rear.

      <td colspan="2"><b>The photographs</b>: <p>according to the witness, 25 seconds were taken to shoot the
        photographs, with about 8 seconds between consecutive shots. (One can suppose that this time interval should
        have been shorter for the two first shots than for the last two, since the object's angular speed decreased with
        distance under the hypothesis of a constant linear speed.) The film: Kodak Panatomic- X 35 mm. The developer
        type: modified Kodak D-25 (with genol-sulfite boric acid). The bath was old, so the development was prolonged.
        The camera: Zeiss Ikonta with an excellent Tessar lens (with a 45 mm focal distance) and with a central shutter
        of Compur or Prontor type. A slightly yellow filter Wratten 15 was used (to darken blue sky on black and white
        photographs). The diaphragm was likely set at 1 :5.6. The displayed exposure time was 11250 s (but likely
        1/200s, since central shutters are always too "slow" at high shutter speeds). Considering the average
        photographic density which varied on the negatives, the diaphragm (or the speed?) was changed between the first
        and second shots.</p>
        <p>The four images, taken successively, are numbered 3-3a, 4-4a, 5-5a and 6-6a on the film margins. We shall
          label them 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Images 1 and 2 were taken with the camera raised towards the sky and
          held "horizontally," images 3 and 4(which show clouds near the horizon and a little grassy hillock in the
          foreground, respectively) with the camera held "vertically."</p>
        <p>On each image the oblong black spot under the object is clearly visible, but it does not resemble a
          "cockpit," even a flattened one <span class="note">However,we note that this spot is more complicated than a simple dark strip: we can distinguish a central round spot extended to the right by an oblong, slightly curved tail. Hereafter, when we refer to the axis of the spot, we mean the axis of the strip made with the central spot and the tail.
</span>. On the other hand, no slit is visible, either in front of or at the rear of the spot. The shape of this
          structure is identical on the four photographs and obeys the laws of perspective. This contradicts an
          interpretation involving a shadow cast by something under the object. Moreover, the lower side of the disk
          cannot be illuminated by sunlight, because of its slight inclination towards the north (see below) and of the
          altitude of the sun above the western horizon. For these reasons, the oblong black spot under the disk appears
          to be a permanent structure located on its surface.</p>
        <p>In addition, we can clearly observe a shiny edge which is on the upper and right part of the disk. This
          apparently results from the reflection of sunlight on the side of the object, considering the alleged position
          of the sun with respect to the images.</p>

<section>
  <h2>A First Analysis of the Images</h2>
  <p>We are fortunate to have four successive photographic images on a very fine-grained emulsion taken by means of an
    excellent optical system, which should contain considerable information. Unfortunately, the photographic situation
    was not ideal for photographs that are to be scientifically investigated. First, there is the question of the
    ellipse inclination to the horizon on the four images, since the horizon is not visible on them- it is true that the
    field of view of the lens is not sufficient to include the horizon, at least for the three first shots. Next, images
    1 and 2 are not sharp because of motion, particularly the first; the oval image of the UFO is stretched along its
    major axis, as if the object moved from right to left during an overly long exposure time. Actually, this lack of
    sharpness is due to the photographer's motion, not to that of the object; according to <span
      class="people">Frégnale</span>, the disk was moving rather slowly, and the exposure time selected should have
    frozen the image on the film. Moreover, we note that the stretching of the image is not exactly parallel to the
    major axis of the ellipse on shot 2. Most importantly, we can see that the same image stretching is also visible in
    the details of the tree at the right of the field. It seems that the photographer, trying to do his best, tried to
    "follow" the object along its trajectory when he opened the shutter, and did so in a jerky way. The result of this
    awkwardness is that the ellipse major axis length is difficult to measure with great accuracy on shot 2 and almost
    impossible on shot 1.
  </p>
  <p><b>Minimum distance of the object</b>: On the other hand, images 3 and 4 are perfectly in focus. The saucer stands
    out against the sky, the lack of sharpness of the image edges (visible at very high magnification) is about 11100
    mm, which approximately corresponds to the resolution limit of Panatomic-X film for contrasted details. The focus on
    the object was thus perfect, and as the contours of the clouds visible at the bottom of shot 3 are also very sharp,
    we can deduce that the camera was focused on infinity. An independent test confirms this fact: on Photograph 4,
    details of the tree branch which "directs" towards the UFO are a little less sharp than for the UFO and the grass of
    the foreground little hillock is "smoothed" by an evident defocus. We can trust the photographer when he declares
    that the diaphragm he used was 1:5.6 because, for a focal distance as small as 45 mm, all the details of the
    landscape would have been equally sharp if the diaphragm opening had been smaller.</p>
  <p>This fact allows us to estimate, by a simple computation of the depth of focus, the minimum distance to the object,
    under which a slight alteration of the sharpness of its contour will be visible. We find this distance to be about
    sixty meters! Since the object subtends an angle on the sky of about 1" on average, in the case of a hung model this
    implies a disk at least 1 m in diameter hanging at the end of an invisible wire from a crane (out of the field of
    view) at least 50 m high. I will let the reader judge this possibility. In fact, the object was much further than
    this minimum distance. Its contrast with respect to the sky on the copy of the original negative film is
    qualitatively less on image 4 than on image 2 (these images being equally exposed to the sky). This suggests that a
    light atmospheric mist or fog was present. However, the weather was dry and nice, and for such a mist to be
    noticeable, the distance should have been at least about one kilometer rather than 100 meters. Another argument in
    favor of a large distance to the object is that the witness viewed it with binoculars which he did not have to focus
    nearer than infinity to see the UFO distinctly.</p>
  <p><b>Direction of the horizon</b>: Although the horizon is not visible on all the images, one of them allows
    measurement of the horizon line direction with great accuracy (about 0.5"). This is Photograph 3, where one sees
    cumulus clouds at the lower part, the bases of which appear, with the perspective effect, like parallel horizontal
    lines. (The horizon cannot be lower.) The angle made by these lines with the minor side of the 24 X 36 rectangle is
    3". This figure is not surprising since most amateur photographers do not hold their camera in the "right" position,
    especially without a reflex system.</p>
  <figure class="right side">
    <img alt="Figure 1" src="Figure1.png">
    <figcaption>Figure 1</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>On Photograph 4, the horizon is apparently hidden by the little grassy hillock in the foreground, the ridge of
    which is inclined at an angle of about 5" to the minor side of the 24 X 36 rectangle. The inclination has the same
    direction as on Photograph 3 and may demonstrate a systematic tendency of the photographer to tilt his camera in the
    same way. However, it is obviously risky to choose the value of 5" rather than another close value, since there is
    no reason for the ridge of the little hillock to be perfectly horizontal. (Nevertheless a value of 5" is consistent
    with the angle at which the image should be rotated for the grass blades on the little hillock to be vertical on
    average). For now we will use this value, subject to modification later if it leads to obvious
    incompatibilities.</p>
  <p>Although it is impossible to determine where the horizon is on images 1 and 2 without some assumption, a method
    does exist to resolve the ambiguity. At first it seemed that the photographer stayed almost exactly at the same
    place when taking the two photographs, because of the details of the tree at the right, which are seen at nearly the
    same angles. On the other hand, it is clear that the photographer did not hold his camera in the same manner. Even
    if one takes into account the converging of the vertical lines upwards when the camera is directed towards the sky,
    it is obvious that the tree is not inclined in the same way on the two images. But it is known that straight lines
    should remain straight on the photographs <span class="note">At least with a constant focal length lens like a Tessar. This
    property is not rigorously verified with a zoom, which almost always produces a geometric distortion like a pincushion or a barrel, depending on the focal length.
</span>. If one draws a line between the axis of the eccentric spot on the UFO and the tree on each of the two
    photographs, one observes that these two lines will strike the tree at almost the same place. These two lines in
    fact almost merge and apparently represent part of the object's trajectory, which is directed along the axis of the
    eccentric spot as is clearly seen on the composite photograph of images 1 and 2. However, according to the witness,
    the object was moving along a straight horizontal trajectory, from right to left; thus, the part of the trajectory
    just drawn can be considered to be approximately parallel to the horizon, the camera being directed southward.</p>
  <p>As one can see, we took the photographer at his word, allowing us to use the model based on his statements to
    reveal inconsistencies and to discover if the model would be invalidated by the measurements.</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>The Measurements</h2>
  <p>On the four images, the disk is seen like a flattened ellipse (Fig. I), of which the major axis 2a and the minor
    axis 2b can be measured (The flatness is the ratio `b/a`). On images 2 and 3, it is also possible to measure the
    angle u that the eccentric spot makes with the major axis, and the angle v that the minor side of the 24 X 36
    rectangle makes with the major axis. If the inclination w of the horizon to this minor side is known, one can derive
    the angle o of the major axis, and also the angle y of the eccentric spot, made with the horizon by:</p>
  <p>ω = v + w</p>
  <p>γ = u + ω</p>
  <p>For ω and y we will need to compute the object's angular height α above the horizon, as will be shown later.</p>
  <p>On photograph 2, one can notice the angle u is not zero, although it is small. It can be estimated at about 4", but
    it is impossible to estimate the weight ofo and y in this spot inclination to the major axis. The camera is
    approximately directed southward and not towards the object, the apparent trajectory being thus horizontal. It would
    cease to be such and would begin to tilt slightly downwards to the left (like on the following photographs) if the
    camera were to have been directed eastward so as to bring the object exactly at the field tenter, allowing
    measurements of this apparent inclination. However, it is not possible here.</p>
  <p>Similar comments can be made concerning Photograph I, on which the lack of sharpness due to motion is such that the
    two ends of the major axis are "clipped" on light prints. But if measurements are made on dark prints, which show
    the complete spreading of the lack of sharpness (including the shiny edge at the right which is greatly widened),
    one can well define the major axis direction, thus demonstrating that the angle u it makes with the eccentric spot
    is reversed, its value being between about 13" and 17".</p>
  <p>The evaluation of the major and minor axis lengths can be made with good accuracy on images 3 and 4, but one must
    take into account the small deformation of the ellipse by the shiny edge, at the top right, whose light overlaps
    onto its contour due to photographic diffusion. On the other hand, lack of sharpness due to motion on photographs 1
    and 2 makes the major axis measurement difficult on Photograph 2 and uncertain on Photograph 1. However, despite
    these uncertainties, the major axis seems a bit smaller on Photograph 1 than on Photograph 2 (this appears on all
    the prints, the dark ones and the light ones). Thus, the object's position when closest to the witness should be
    between positions l and 2, and closer from position 2 than from position l. However, the minor axis, which can be
    measured on both images, is slightly greater on position 1 than on position 2, implying that the ellipse is more
    "opened" (the disk is inclined with a greater angle towards the witness).</p>
  <p>The raw data (done on magnifications, all at the same sca1e)have then been corrected for the geometric deformation
    inherent in the photographic process; i.e., if d is the angular distance of the object from the photographic field
    center, the image is lengthened in the transverse direction by the factor l/cos<sup>2</sup> d, and in the radial
    direction by the factor l/cos d. This effect is particularly sensitive with large-angle lenses. In the present case,
    d being about only 10°,the deformation is small but not negligible.</p>
  <p>The inclinations of the ellipse and of the eccentric spot are more difficult to measure exactly, particularly the
    angle w on Photograph 4 (because of the small length of the eccentric spot on this image) and even more on
    Photograph 2 (because of the lack of sharpness). Corrections to raw data are useless here, considering the relative
    inaccuracy of the measurements.</p>
  <p>The values used for the data processing are given in the Table below. The lengths 2a and 2b are in mm and
    correspond to their values on the original negatives, after computation of the measured values on the enlarged
    prints. The errors given correspond to the maximum errors in the measurements.</p>

  <h2>Modeling</h2>
  <p>The witness described a disk which was moving with steady speed from west to east on a horizontal trajectory, which
    made it appear to lower towards the horizon to the east due to the perspective effect. This disk was seen as an
    ellipse, the analysis of the photographs showing this ellipse inclined to the horizon at an angle o which increased
    as the object moved away. This fact can be simply explained in the following way, which is suggested by the alleged
    absence of any swinging of the object: <em>the plane defined by the lower side of the disk (the visible side) is
      inclined northwards to the horizontal plane at an angle Ω,around an axis which is the trajectory</em>. When the
    disk is exactly due south, at its smallest distance from the witness, its lower side is rotated towards him at the
    angle Ω, and the ellipse appears more "opened" than if the disk were flying "flat." But the witness had no way of
    noticing this, because the UFO did not tilt to the left or to the right. Then, as the disk moved away westward
    (Photographs 3 and 4), its lower side, still rotated northward at the angle Ω (i.e. towards the left), appeared more
    and more inclined, the apparent inclination remaining less than Ω (except if the disk were seen at infinity by its
    side).</p>
  <figure class="right side">
    <img alt="Figure 2" src="Figure2.png">
    <figcaption>Figure 2</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The eccentric spot is aligned with the trajectory on Photographs 1 and 2, and we will assume this is still true on
    Photographs 3 and 4. This assumption is supported by the fact that it rises towards the right along with the
    apparent trajectory tilts downwards to the left. <em>The axis qf this spot, which makes the angle y with the horizon
      on the photographs, thus gives, under this hypothesis, the apparent trajectory direction on each image.</em></p>
  <p>This is the simple model which will be used and tested numerically.</p>
  <p>We first find the equations which express that the trajectory is horizontal.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><i>Relation between the angular height and the object apparent diameter</i>. One has (Fig. 2) :
      <p>`h =` Constant `= OS_i sin alpha_i = OS, sin alpha_j`</p>
      <p>and thus :</p>
      <p>`sin a_i = (OS_i)/(OS_j) sin alpha_i`</p>
      <p>However, the ratio `(OS_i)/(OS_j)` of two distances from the object to the witness equals the inverse ratio
        `a_j/a_i` of the two respective apparent dimensions of the ellipse major axis, those subtending small angles
        (about 1 °). Thus: </p>
      <p>`sin a_j = a_j/a_i sin alpha_i` &nbsp;&nbsp;(1)</p>
    </li>
    <li><i>Formula giving the azimuth and the angular height depending on the maximum angular height at the closest
      position.</i> This azimuth `beta_i` is measured from the direction `Os`, of the closest position. Fig. 2 gives:
      <p>`Os_o =`hltan `alpha_0, Os_i =`hltan `alpha_i, cos beta_i = (Os_0)/(Os_i)`</p>
      <p>and thus :</p>
      <p>`cos beta_i = (tan alpha_i)/(tan alpha_0)` &nbsp;&nbsp;(2)</p></li>
    <li><i>Formula giving the apparent inclination y of the trajectory to the horizon.</i>
      <figure class="right side">
        <img alt="Figure 3" src="Figure3.png">
        <figcaption>Figure 3</figcaption>
      </figure>
      The witness looks at the object in S (Fig. 3). The apparent trajectory, parallel to the speed vector V, is
      inclined at the angle y to the horizon, due to the perspective effect. This inclination will be measured with
      respect to the line SX parallel to the horizon in an orthonormal axis system SXY perpendicular to the sight
      direction line OS. We undergo the translation SO to this system and to the vector V. One sees then that V makes
      with OX (in the horizontal plane) an angle n- b, its projection `V_X` on OX (and thus on SX) is thus- V cos b.
      Moreover, V makes with `Os` (still in the horizontal plane) an angle `pi/2-b` ,its projection on 0 s is thus
      `Vsinb`, and since `Os` is inclined (in the vertical plane) at an angle `pi/2+a`to OY, the projection `V_Y` of V
      on OY (and thus on SY) is finally :
      <p>`-Vsin beta sina`.</p>
      <p>For the witness who looks at the point S, the tangent of the trajectory apparent inclination y is given by
        `V_Y/V_X`, that is to say:</p>
      <p>`tan gamma = tan beta sin a`. &nbsp;&nbsp;(3)</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>We now find the equations which take into account the disk inclination to the horizontal plane.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Angular height of the disk depending on a,`beta`, `omega` and `gamma`. If the disk were flying "flat" (`Omega=
      0`), the ellipse axis ratio `(b')/a` observed would be the cosine of the angle between the disk plane and the
      plane perpendicular to the sight line. The complement of this angle would give the object angular height a. But
      the disk is not flying "flat" and the angle `Omega` it makes with the horizontal plane is not known. However, one
      is able to compute `(b')/a` from the observed ellipse axis ratio `b/a`, in the following way :<p>Since the disk is
        inclined about the axis AB (Fig. 4), the "straightened" ellipse to be seen if it were flying "flat" passes also
        through A and B. In the axis system Sxy, the point A is on the line SA, the equation of which is :</p>
      <p>`y=tan(omega+y)*x`.</p>
      <figure class="right side">
        <img alt="Figure 4" src="Figure4.png">
        <figcaption>Figure 4</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It is also on the observed ellipse, the equation of which is :</p>
      <p>`x^2/a^2+y^2/b^2=1`</p>
      <p>The coordinates `(x_A,y_A)` of the point A are thus given by :</p>
      <p>`x_A= (1/a^2+(tan^2(omega+gamma))/b^2)^(1/2)`,</p>
      <p>`y_A= tan(omega+gamma)*x_A`,</p>
      <p>In the straightened axis system SXY, the point A has the coordinates :</p>
      <p>`X_A= x_a cos omega + y_A sin omega`,</p>
      <p>`Y_A= y_a cos omega - x_A sin omega`.</p>
      <p>But A belongs also to the straightened ellipse, the equation of which is :</p>
      <p>`X^2/a^2+Y^2/(b')^2=1` (a is not changed)</p>
      <p>from which we deduce :</p>
      <p>`(b')/a=Y_A/(sqrt(a^2-X_A^2))`</p>
      <p>and `alpha=pi/2-cos^-1((b')/a)` (or `a=sin^-1((b')/a)`)</p>
      <p>It is easy to program these computations, but it is also possible to get the relation which directly gives a.
        Let `r = b/a` be the flatness. One finds, from the previous relations, that :</p>
      `tan alpha = r/sqrt(1-r^2)*siny/(sin(omega+y)')` &nbsp;&nbsp;(4)
    </li>
    <li><i>Formula giving the inclination 0 of the disk plane to the horizontal plane depending on `omega` and
      `beta`</i>. After some algebraic manipulations, it is possible to show that :
      <p>`sin Omega = sqrt(1-r^2)*sin omega/sin beta` &nbsp;&nbsp;(5)</p></li>
  </ol>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Numerical Application</h2>
  <p>The model can now be tested. Photographs 3 and 4 are the sharpest ones and `omega` and `gamma` can be measured
    separately on them, and also a and b, with a rather good accuracy. By putting the derived values (see the Table) in
    Eq. (4), one finds <span class="note">The given error bounds are estimates of standard deviations.</span> :</p>
  <p>`a_3 = 40.3°pm1.1°`,</p>
  <p>`a_4 = 27.3°pm1.1°`,</p>
  <p>These results are thus compatible with the supposed position of the horizon on Photographs 3 and 4.</p>
  <p>We first verify if the trajectory is horizontal between positions 3 and 4. By the use of Eq. (I), one can compute
    `alpha_4` from `alpha_3` (which is the angular height measured with the greatest relative accuracy), giving:</p>
  <p>`sina = 0.535/0.743 sin 40.4°=0.466`</p>
  <p>`alpha_4 = 27.8°`.</p>
  <p>The agreement is excellent, <em>the trajectory remains thus horizontal between positions 3 and 4</em>. This
    encourages to compute `alpha_2`, with Eq. (1). One finds :</p>
  <p>`a_2 = 47.05°`.</p>
  <p>One can verify whether this value a,, computed by assuming the trajectory is horizontal, is compatible with the
    value of `u` on image 2, which is estimated to be about 4". Since `u = omega + y`, and since o is always less than
    y, we will make, as a trial, the hypothesis : `omega_2 = 1°, gamma_2 = 3`". We compute a, from these values. One
    finds :</p>
  <p>`a_2=47.1°`</p>
  <p>The excellent agreement is somewhat illusory, as the exact values of `omega_2`, and `gamma_2`, are not known, and
    the standard deviation is at least 3" for `alpha_2`. It can only be assumed that the estimate of the angle `u` made
    on image 2 is <em>compatible with the hypothesis the trajectory is horizontal between positions 2 and 3.</em></p>
  <p>The determination of the angle `a`, still remains. It can be deduced from Eq. ( I ) as done for a,,, and one
    finds: </p>
  <p>`alpha_1=46.15°`</p>
  <p>This value is compatible with the estimation done of u,, if `omega_1=6`" and `gamma_1=10°`, in which case
    computations which make the disk to be "flat" give a,= 46.3".</p>
  <p>Computations of the disk azimuth and of its inclination to the horizontal plane. The complement of the angle
    `alpha_2`, computed above in two independent ways, is 42.95"; it is the angle that the disk would make with the
    plane perpendicular to the sight line if the saucer were flying "flat." The observed ratio r, is 0.820, which
    corresponds to an actual inclination of 34.9" .The difference between the two angles gives an estimate of `Omega_2`,
    since the object at position 2 is not far from its closest position. Thus:</p>
  <p>`Omega_2~~8°`</p>
  <p>By means of Eq. (5), we compute the azimuth `beta_2`, with `Omega_2`, just determined, and with `omega_2`,
    evaluated to be 1°.One finds:</p>
  <p>`sin beta_2 = sqrt(1-0.82^2)sin(1°)/sin(8°)=0.72`<br/> `beta_2=4.1~~4°`</p>
  <p>This result shows that the object had just passed through the closest position when it arrived at position 2, thus
    explaining why the angle of the ellipse major axis with the trajectory seems to be the opposite on image 1. As an
    example, it is possible to measure the trajectory arc between positions 1 and 2 on the composite photograph; it is
    about 12". This corresponds to an azimuth variation at ground level of 12"`/cos alpha`, a being the object's average
    angular height (47°). In this way we find an azimuth variation of about 20 degrees, which proves that the object, at
    position 1, was at a west azimuth of about 16°.</p>
  <p>One can now compute the angular height a , of the object when it is at the closest position, along with the
    object's azimuths at positions 1, 3 and 4. Eq. (2) may be written: `tan alpha_0 = tan alpha_i/cos beta_i`.Taking
    `alpha_2` = 47.1° and `beta_2 = 4.1°`, one finds: `tan alpha_0 = 1.079` and thus `alpha_0= 47.17°`. This value of
    `tan alpha_0` will permit the computation of the azimuths `beta_1, beta_3` and `beta_4` from a , , a, and a, by
    means of Eq. (2):</p>
  <p>`cos beta_1 = tan alpha_1/(tan alpha_0) = (tan 46.15°)/1.079 = 0.965`,<br/> `beta_1 ~~ 15°` (to the west),</p>
  <p>which confirms the value found above from the angle measured between positions 1 and 2. One then finds:</p>
  <p>`cos beta_3= tan alpha_3/(tan alpha_0) = (tan 40.3")/1.079 = 0.786`,<br/> `beta_3~~38°`</p>
  <p>`cos beta_4= tan alpha_4/(tan alpha_0) = (tan 27.3')/1.079 = 0.478`,<br/> `beta_4~~61.5°`</p>
  <p>Putting these values of `beta_1, beta_3` and `beta_4`, in Eq. (5), one gets</p>
  <p>`Omega_1~~12°,Omega_3~~5°,Omega_4~~9°`.</p>
  <p>This value of `Omega_4` is compatible with the measured value of `omega`, the error bounds being taken into
    account. The disk inclination to the horizontal plane has thus not been kept constant along the trajectory, its
    value being between 5° and 12°, a difference which the witness (who had not observed the object swinging) obviously
    would not have noticed.</p>
  <p><i>Computation of the apparent trajectory inclination to the horizon.</i> The values of the azimuth b we have just
    computed will allow us to find the angle y of the apparent trajectory to the horizon on images 1, 3 and 4, by the
    use of Eq. (3). One finds in this way `gamma_1 = 11` (instead of the supposed value of 10" for the eccentric spot
    inclination), `gamma_3 = 26.9°` (instead of the measured value of 26°), and finally `gamma_4 = 40.1°` (instead of
    the measured value of 41"). The agreement is still excellent between the results deduced from the model and the
    measurements on the photographs. The alignment of the eccentric spot with the trajectory is thus confirmed, which
    validates <em>a posteriori</em> the value `alpha_0`, which is used in the azimuth computation.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>These extraordinary photographs of the Lac Chauvet "saucer" are used for measurements and a detailed analysis which
    suggests a simple trajectory model that is compatible with the witness's testimony. We have demonstrated that the
    photographs showed a disk-shaped object located at a large distance in the sky and, thus, having large dimensions.
    This model is validated by good agreement between the numerical results one can deduce from it, and the mea-
    surements on the images. The disk was flying along a straight and horizontal trajectory, keeping an inclination to
    the horizontal plane, about the axis trajectory and at an angle which remained between about 5" and 12". The
    eccentric spot remained aligned along this axis during the observation, which makes unlikely the possibility of a
    forgery by means of a model hung at the end of a wire or thrown into the air.</p>
  <p>A single UFO photograph is almost impossible to authenticate without relying on the testimony of the person who has
    taken it. We may thank the witness for having taken four shots consecutively. In addition, the high quality of the
    Tessar lens, the landmarks given by the trees and the clouds, and the uniform and easily analyzable trajectory
    without zigzagging motion have aided the analysis. This series of photographs by themselves are sufficient to prove
    their authenticity. Such a proof might be more difficult to achieve for photographs obtained with modem methods. But
    in 1952 there was no possibility of forgery with computer technologies and digitization of images.</p>
  <p>Finally, if the disk were about 15 meters in diameter, a common dimension for the "flying saucers" of that time
    according to the estimates of numerous observers, the reader can easily compute, with the data given in this paper,
    the trajectory height above the ground (assumed to be horizontal) would be - 590 m; the smallest distance of the
    saucer to the witness - 800 m; the trajectory length, covered in 25 s, between shots 1 and 4, - 1160 m; and the
    average speed - 170 kmlh.</p>
  <p>Finally, if the object had the dimensions just calculated-even if it were only 9 or 10 m in diameter-its speed
    would then significantly exceed the wind speed (60 km/h) which was blowing from the west at this altitude. <em>It
      was thus necessarily self-propelled</em>, and was not pushed by the wind as a balloon would have been.</p>
