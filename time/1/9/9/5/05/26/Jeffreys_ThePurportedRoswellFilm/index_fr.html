<h1><a href="index.html">Le prétendu film de Roswell en 1947</a></h1>
<p class="Author">Jeffreys, K.: <em>IRI</em>, bulletin n° 2 , 26 mai 1995</p>
<p>Ces derniers 18 mois ont été plutôt animés concernant <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/index.html">Roswell</a>. En <span class="mois">janvier</span> de
  l'année dernière, le membre du Congrès Steven Schiff, d'Albuquerque (Nouveau Mexique), a annoncé à la presse demander
  à la Cour des Comptes <span class="note">NDT: <em>General Accounting Office </em>(GAO)</span> d'examiner le cas de <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/index.html">Roswell</a>. 9 mois plus tard, l'Armée de l'Air,
  peut-être dans une tentative pour précéder le GAO, et dans ce que le magazine <em>Newsweek</em> appelle une <q>frappe
    préventive</q>, a publié son propre rapport sur <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/index.html">l'incident
    de Roswell</a>. Le rapport de l'Armée de l'Air constitua la première parole officielle sur le sujet de <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/index.html">Roswell</a> en 47 ans et soutenait basiquement (bien
  que sans en avoir aucune preuve) le "récit de couverture" d'origine de <a
      href="../../../../../4/7/index.html">1947</a> que les officiers du 509<sup>ème</sup> Groupe de Bombardiers
  Atomiques avaient été abusés par les restes d'un ballon retombé et un reflecteur radar ML-307. </p>
<p>Maintenant, un nouveau facteur est entré en scène. Un film a ressurgi en Angleterre, supposé être un film
  documentaire top-secret pris à Roswell en <a href="../../../../../4/7/index.html">1947</a> par un photographe
  militaire des USA. L'existence du film fut d'abord annoncée en <span class="mois">janvier</span> dernier ; cependant,
  le film aurait été acheté aux Etats-Unis il y a presque 2 ans. Nul besoin de dire que le film a généré moult intérêt
  et controverse, ainsi qu'une diversité d'opinions chez les ufologues et membres des media quant à son authenticité.
</p>
<p> En tant qu'auteur de la <em>Roswell Declaration</em> et coordinateur de l'<em>International Roswell Initiative</em>,
  j'ai tenté when possible to maintain neutrality on controversial issues within the UFO research community and to avoid
  the infighting that, unfortunately, has so often characterized this field. I have felt that maintaining a neutral
  stance was important and appropriate, especially in view of the fact that the Roswell Declaration and the grassroots
  effort behind it has had the unified support of the three largest and most respected UFO organizations in the United
  States, the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), and the Fund for UFO
  Research (FUFOR). Furthermore, over 17,000 people, from varying backgrounds, including hundreds of scientists and
  engineers, have signed and submitted copies of the Roswell Declaration. </p>
<p>While I have primarily concentrated my efforts on achieving the objective of the Roswell Declaration -- an Executive
  Order to declassify any existing U.S. government-held information concerning UFOs or extraterrestrial intelligence --
  I have also become involved with researching the Roswell case. In the past two years, I have made five trips to
  Roswell, visited the debris site at the Foster (Brazel) ranch, and interviewed many of the surviving Roswell
  witnesses. I believe such experience gives me a definite advantage in evaluating any alleged Roswell film
  footage. </p>
<p>The film in question is presently in the possession of a company in London, Merlin Productions, owned by a Mr. Ray
  Santilli. On Friday, May 5, 1995, there was a special showing at the Museum of London. There were approximately one
  hundred people present: members of the media (including the BBC), potential buyers of the film, and UFO researchers
  from the United Kingdom and other countries. Despite the fact that the film is totally unauthenticated, it has
  received extensive publicity in Europe. For example, the film has been featured in full-length feature articles in
  London's "Sunday People" and Berlin's "Morgen Post." </p>
<p>Because of the dubious nature of the film and the questionable way in which it is being handled by those in
  possession of it, there is a tremendous potential for damage to the entire Roswell effort. Because I was the only
  Roswell researcher at the May 5th showing, I feel a responsibility to put neutrality aside and speak out. </p>
<p>Before going into specific details about the viewing, I would like to state up front and unequivocally that there is
  no (zero!!!) doubt in my mind that this film is a fraud. I might add, however, that if, against all odds, what I
  consider the impossible did occur, and this film actually turned out to be genuine, I would be one of the first to
  celebrate, as researchers would finally have in their possession the Holy Grail of evidence necessary to break the
  Roswell case wide open.</p>
<p> The actual showing of the film took place just after 1:00 p.m. in a small auditorium that is part of the Museum of
  London complex. A handout was distributed at the sign-in table consisting of a copy of the alleged MJ-12 briefing
  papers and a yellow cover sheet referencing the 1947 Roswell crash and the 509th Bomb Group (at Roswell Army Air
  Field). Merlin Productions was apparently very concerned about pictures being taken because everyone was physically
  searched (frisked) for cameras upon entering the auditorium. There was no speaker or announcement to formally welcome
  those present or to introduce the film. This seemed somewhat bizarre and discourteous, as people had come from all
  over the world for this showing. Also conspicuously absent was a person on stage afterward to publicly answer
  questions pertaining to the film. After having viewed what was presented, however, it was not hard to understand why
  this was the case. </p>
<p>Prior to the showing, anticipation was high. In the previous three months, Ray Santilli had put out the word through
  those in close contact with him that the film consisted of 15 10-minute reels (in their original canisters) of
  16-millimeter black-and-white film, for a total of 150 minutes. He reported that it was dated as 1947 vintage film
  stock and that it had been acquired from a former army photographer, Jack Barnett, who claims to have shot the footage
  and then, incredibly, to have stolen 15 canisters of film, without the theft having been detected. Word was also put
  out that there was 45 minutes of footage taken at the actual recovery site showing a number of soldiers in uniform and
  a large crane lifting the crashed craft onto a truck. Additionally, Santilli claimed that one of the scenes showed
  President Truman behind a glass partition with such clarity that someone capable of lip reading would be able to
  determine his words when he spoke. At the showing, we would see none of this -- no debris site, no soldiers, no crane,
  no crashed saucer, no President Truman. Instead, we saw just 20 to 25 minutes of one single scene -- an autopsy of a
  supposed alien body in a small white room.</p>
<p> At about 1:05 p.m., the lights dimmed and the film started rolling. Before the actual picture began, a few short
  statements scrolled by on the screen with reference to the film having been "acquired from the cameraman who
  originally shot the footage" and to the copyright being "exclusively owned by Merlin Communications." Interestingly,
  one would think that if the film were genuine, the copyright would be "exclusively owned" by the United States
  government. </p>
<p>Also, contrary to what had been said previously about "10-minute reels," there was now a statement on the screen that
  the film was recorded on "three-minute" reels. I recently learned from a good friend in the film industry that 1947
  vintage 16-millimeter film came on reels of 100 feet, which at 16 frames per second would be about three minutes each.
  Perhaps this information was also "recently learned" by Merlin Productions and that is why we are now seeing
  references to "three-minute" reels instead of the originally reported "10-minute" reels.</p>
<p> The film opened abruptly with its single scene of a small operating or autopsy room with plain white walls and a
  table in the middle containing an unclad body lying face up. Two individuals in white anti-contamination suits,
  complete with hoods and narrow, rectangular glass faceplates, were the only figures visible in the room. A third
  person, dressed in white hospital-type garb, was visible through a large glass partition, or window. Although he was
  outside the sealed room standing behind solid glass, he was wearing a surgical mask that covered his entire face.
  Perhaps there was concern that he might later be recognized?</p>
<p> The features of the body lying on the autopsy table in this film do not even come close to what was described by the
  1947 Roswell witnesses. What was visible on the screen was apparently a slightly doctored human corpse. While in
  theory it could have been an elaborate dummy, the chances of that are remote. I, along with others with whom I've
  spoken who were also at the viewing, have little doubt that the body was a doctored human corpse. If such is the case,
  it would make this one of the most despicable and deplorable hoaxes ever perpetrated. It would mean that those who put
  this atrocity together butchered the body of a once-living human being (a woman in this case) solely out of greed. If
  this is determined to be the case, a criminal investigation might well be in order, as using a human body for such
  unscrupulous purposes is not only highly unethical, but also illegal in most places.</p>
<p> Although the exact height of the body was difficult to determine, it was definitely shorter than normal, probably
  somewhere around four and a half to five feet. The head was somewhat large relative to the torso, but not
  extraordinarily so. The body was also barrel chested and apparently bowlegged, and had an overall stocky
  appearance. </p>
<p>Other anomalous features included no visible body hair, small and somewhat odd-shaped ears, a small (slightly
  abnormal-shaped) nose, slightly large eyes covered by black membranes (which were later removed), a distended or
  bloated abdomen (ascites), six digits on the feet (polydactylism), apparently six digits on the hands, and legs so
  badly swollen that the definition of the knee was hardly recognizable. According to medical people with whom I spoke,
  none of these features would have been too difficult to produce artificially. The black membranes covering the eyes,
  for example, could have been placed over the eyeballs with the same apparent ease with which they were removed during
  the alleged autopsy. The sixth digit could have been added using the techniques of plastic surgery, although
  polydactylism itself is not that uncommon a condition. It was also pointed out that some of the abnormalities of the
  body could have been attributable to a genetic defect or even a physical ailment prior to death. For example,
  congestive heart failure could explain the swelling (edema) of the legs and the bloated appearance of the abdomen
  (ascites).</p>
<p> Despite the above-noted anomalies, the body essentially had the appearance of a human being. It had what was
  basically a human head, a human torso, human skin, human legs, human arms, human shoulders, human hands, and human
  feet -- all in basically the right proportions. The ratio of the length of the upper arms to the lower arms, as well
  as the ratio of the upper legs to the lower legs, was exactly what would be expected for a human being. The
  musculature of the arms and legs appeared the same as the musculature of human arms and legs. The relative positions
  of the forehead, eyes, nose, ears, mouth, and chin were very close to what would be expected on a human head. Although
  the eyeballs appeared larger than normal, the size of the eye sockets did not appear that abnormal. </p>
<p>Other distinctly human features included the mouth, lips, teeth (the front-lower teeth were momentarily visible in
  one shot), jowls, noticeable protrusions of underlying bones in just the right places, including the jaw, shin, and
  clavicle, a brief glimpse of what appeared to resemble a flattened nipple area (although no protrusion of the breast),
  female genitalia, fingers, a thumb, toes, and even a brief glimpse of a toenail (a human vestigial remain!). </p>
<p>During the supposed autopsy procedure, the body cavity was cut open lengthwise from the throat to the groin and
  various internal organs were removed and placed in metal pans. The focus, or resolution, was so poor, however, that
  whatever was removed appeared simply as dark blobs, with detail being almost impossible to discern. There did appear
  at times to be a small amount of dark fluid oozing from the body cavity.</p>
<p> Basically, the body shown in this film appeared to be that of a short, adult, human, Caucasian female, with the age
  being difficult to determine. The swollen legs and other minor "modifications," such as an extra digit on the hands
  and feet, and the "doctoring up" of the eyes and ears, resulted in an overall slightly freakish appearance. </p>
<p>Professor Jared Diamond of the UCLA Medical School, in his book "The Third Chimpanzee," states that there is a "98.4
  percent" similarity in the genes of humans and chimpanzees (our closest primate relative). The resemblance between a
  chimpanzee and a human being is slight compared with the resemblance between the body in this film and a normal human
  being. The body in the film was extremely human, albeit somewhat abnormal in appearance. It does not take a scientific
  mind or much imagination to realize that it would require a genetic similarity far greater than the 98.4 percent
  between man and chimp to produce a being as close in appearance to a normal human as was the body on the autopsy table
  in this film. </p>
<p>It is common knowledge that the human organism, like all other life forms on earth, is the product of approximately
  three billion years of evolution, involving untold numbers of mutations and trillions of chance combinations of genes.
  Exobiologists tell us that the chances of billions of years of evolution on another planet resulting in "the fine
  structural details" of a human being are all but zero. While differences would be vast, there would, however, likely
  be some basic similarities between us and any other species that became technologically advanced. Such features as two
  legs (bipedal), two arms, a high level of dexterity, two eyes (binocular vision for depth perception), and a large
  brain would almost surely be required for any species to evolve as a tool user and maker.</p>
<p> I recently discussed this matter with an acquaintance who is a science professor at a Midwestern university and who
  has a background in biochemistry, human biology, human genetics, and exobiology. He agreed that parallel evolutionary
  development in another world over billions of years leading to an advanced organism so nearly identical to a human
  being would never happen. The laws of probability rule it out. It can therefore be stated definitively that the body
  in this film is not of extraterrestrial origin. The film is a fraud. </p>
<p>In addition to the "fatal flaw" of anthropomorphism -- probably the result of scientific illiteracy as well as sheer
  ignorance on the part of its producers -- the film has other problems, most of which are of a more circumstantial
  nature. For example, the photography did not seem consistent with what one would expect for the documentation of an
  historic medical event. There was excessive panning and poor focus with the majority of closeups. Also, most of the
  closeup shots were too fleeting, allowing no time for serious study or observation. The gestures of the two
  "physicians" seemed exaggerated and even staged at times. Although it is purely speculative, one would think that for
  such a monumental event, there would have been a large team of specialists directly participating, along with a number
  of additional specialists observing from behind the glass partition. </p>
<p>Establishing this film as a hoax is much easier than determining the source of the hoax. It is possible that Ray
  Santilli and Merlin Productions are themselves victims of a scam. However, it must be said that their actions in the
  last few months do not seem consistent with those of an organization confident that it is in possession of the
  "genuine article." Among other things, Mr. Santilli has mentioned a secret viewing for church officials, a private
  viewing for the counter-intelligence wing of the FBI, verification of the film by Kodak as 1947 vintage, and, most
  recently, an offer from an undisclosed client represented by a Washington, DC, law firm for $1.8 million to purchase
  the film "as is." None of these claims has been verified. Furthermore, no one has seen any of the alleged footage of
  the debris site or that showing President Truman. </p>
<p>Even more significantly, no one has been able to verify the existence of the photographer, Jack Barnett. If this film
  were genuine and such a photographer actually existed, the government would undoubtedly know his identity. Since he
  reportedly stole and subsequently sold 15 canisters of top-secret U.S. government film, he would be in serious
  trouble. His best protection would be to go public immediately. The government would then be in a catch-22 situation
  because if they so much as raised a finger against him, they would be instantly validating the entire Roswell
  event. </p>
<p>On January 19, 1995, I wrote a letter that was passed on to Mr. Santilli in which I mentioned the prestigious
  Washington, DC, law firm I retained two years ago for the purpose of providing legal counsel for Roswell witnesses. I
  pointed out the importance of the photographer in validating the film and offered the services of the law firm to
  represent the photographer. That offer was never accepted. After having viewed the May 5, 1995, showing of the film, I
  now know why. Either the supposed photographer is one of those behind this hoax, or else he does not exist. </p>
<p>Over the last years, the three major nonprofit UFO research organizations in the United States, along with a number
  of private individuals operating on their own time and at their own expense, have put a lot of resources and effort
  into the admirable cause of getting to the truth of what could well be the "story of the millennium." Although it is
  still very much an uphill struggle, much progress has been made in bringing to the Roswell case serious and credible
  attention on the part of the media, the public, and a number of politicians. It is unfortunate that there are now
  those who would unscrupulously exploit the Roswell Event for their own financial gain. </p>
<p>It is important that the UFO community make every effort to get to the bottom of this matter as soon as possible,
  including calling for a criminal investigation if it is determined appropriate. Standing by and doing nothing could be
  a serious mistake. Unfortunately, although they may be in the minority, there are journalists and television producers
  out there who are far more interested in the possible sensationalistic appeal of this kind of film, than in bringing
  people the truth. As the hype and publicity surrounding this film continue, there is a real danger that people will
  start to connect the reality of the Roswell event with the authenticity of this film. Then, once the film is publicly
  exposed as a hoax, which it inevitably will be, there is a real danger that people will tend to assume that the whole
  Roswell event is a hoax. </p>
<p>Fortunately, however, as experts obtain more information about the true nature of this purported Roswell footage, the
  entire matter of this film should be nipped at the bud and put to rest. Attention and resources can again be
  concentrated on the actual Roswell event, the best documented case in the history of the UFO phenomenon.</p>
