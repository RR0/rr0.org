<p>Research on psychic functioning, conducted over a two decade period, is examined to determine whether or not the
  phenomenon has been scientifically established. A secondary question is whether or not it is useful for government
  purposes. The primary work examined in this report was government sponsored research conducted at Stanford Research
  Institute, later known as SRI International, and at Science Applications International Corporation, known as SAIC.</p>
<p>Using the standards applied to any other area of science, it is concluded that psychic functioning has been well
  established. The statistical results of the studies examined are far beyond what is expected by chance. Arguments that
  these results could be due to methodological flaws in the experiments are soundly refuted. Effects of similar
  magnitude to those found in government-sponsored research at SRI and SAIC have been replicated at a number of
  laboratories across the world. Such consistency cannot be readily explained by claims of flaws or fraud.</p>
<p>The magnitude of psychic functioning exhibited appears to be in the range between what social scientists call a small
  and medium effect. That means that it is reliable enough to be replicated in properly conducted experiments, with
  sufficient trials to achieve the long-run statistical results needed for replicability.</p>
<p>A number of other patterns have been found, suggestive of how to conduct more productive experiments and applied
  psychic functioning. For instance, it doesn't appear that a sender is needed. Precognition, in which the answer is
  known to no one until a future time, appears to work quite well. Recent experiments suggest that if there is a psychic
  sense then it works much like our other five senses, by detecting change. Given that physicists are currently
  grappling with an understanding of time, it may be that a psychic sense exists that scans the future for major change,
  much as our eyes scan the environment for visual change or our ears allow us to respond to sudden changes in
  sound.</p>
<p>It is recommended that future experiments focus on understanding how this phenomenon works, and on how to make it as
  useful as possible. There is little benefit to continuing experiments designed to offer proof, since there is little
  more to be offered to anyone who does not accept the current collection of data.</p>
