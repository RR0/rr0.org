<p>The purpose of this report is to examine a body of evidence collected over the past few decades in an attempt to
  determine whether or not psychic functioning is possible. Secondary questions include whether or not such functioning
  can be used productively for government purposes, and whether or not the research to date provides any explanation for
  how it works.</p>
<p>There is no reason to treat this area differently from any other area of science that relies on statistical methods.
  Any discussion based on belief should be limited to questions that are not data-driven, such as whether or not there
  are any methodological problems that could substantially alter the results. It is too often the case that people on
  both sides of the question debate the existence of psychic functioning on the basis of their personal belief systems
  rather than on an examination of the scientific data.</p>
<p>One objective of this report is to provide a brief overview of recent data as well as the scientific tools necessary
  for a careful reader to reach his or her own conclusions based on that data. The tools consist of a rudimentary
  overview of how statistical evidence is typically evaluated, and a listing of methodological concerns particular to
  experiments of this type.</p>
<p>Government-sponsored research in psychic functioning dates back to the early 1970s when a program was initiated at
  what was then the <a href="/org/us/university/stanford/sri">Stanford Research Institute</a>, now called SRI
  International. That program was in existence until <time>1989</time>. The following year, government sponsorship moved
  to a program at Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) under the direction of Dr. <span class="people">Edwin May</span>,
  who had been employed in the SRI program since the mid 1970s and had been Project Director from <time>1986</time>
  until the close of the program.</p>
<p>This report will focus most closely on the most recent work, done by SAIC. <a href="../02">Section 2</a> describes
  the basic statistical and methodological issues required to understand this work; Section 3 discusses the program at
  SRI; Section 4 covers the SAIC work (with some of the details in an Appendix); Section 5 is concerned with external
  validation by exploring related results from other laboratories; Section 6 includes a discussion of the usefulness of
  this capability for government purposes and Section 7 provides conclusions and recommendations.</p>
