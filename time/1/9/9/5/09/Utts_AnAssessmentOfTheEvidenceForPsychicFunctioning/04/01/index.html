<p>The review team decided to focus more intensively on the experiments conducted at <abbr title="Science Applications
    International Corporation">SAIC</abbr>, because they provide a manageable yet varied set to examine in detail. They
  were guided by a Scientific Oversight Committee consisting of experts in a variety of disciplines, including a winner
  of the Nobel Prize in Physics, internationally known professors of statistics, psychology, neuroscience and astronomy
  and a medical doctor who is a retired U.S. Army Major General. Further, we have access to the details for the full set
  of SAIC experiments, unlike for the set conducted at SRI. Whatever details may be missing from the written reports are
  obtainable from the principal investigator, Dr. <span class="people">Edwin May</span>, to whom we have been given
  unlimited access.</p>
<p>In a memorandum dated <time>1995-07-25</time>, Dr. <span class="people">Edwin May</span> listed the set of
  experiments conducted by SAIC. There were ten experiments, all designed to answer questions about psychic functioning,
  raised by the work at SRI and other laboratories, rather than just to provide additional proof of its existence. Some
  of the experiments were of a similar format to the remote viewing experiments conducted at SRI and we can examine
  those to see whether or not they replicated the SRI results. We will also examine what new knowledge can be gained
  from the results of the SAIC work.
