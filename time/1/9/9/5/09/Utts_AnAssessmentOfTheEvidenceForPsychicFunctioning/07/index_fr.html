<p>Il est clair pour l'auteur que la cognition anomale est possible et a été démontrée. Cette conclusion n'est pas basée
  sur la <a href="/croyance">croyance</a>, but rather on commonly accepted scientific criteria. The phenomenon has been
  replicated in a number of forms across laboratories and cultures. The various experiments in which it has been
  observed have been different enough that if some subtle methodological problems can explain the results, then there
  would have to be a different explanation for each type of experiment, yet the impact would have to be similar across
  experiments and laboratories. If fraud were responsible, similarly, it would require an equivalent amount of fraud on
  the part of a large number of experimenters or an even larger number of subjects.</p>
<p>What is not so clear is that we have progressed very far in understanding the mechanism for anomalous cognition.
  Senders do not appear to be necessary at all; feedback of the correct answer may or may not be necessary. Distance in
  time and space do not seem to be an impediment. Beyond those conclusions, we know very little.</p>
<p>I believe that it would be wasteful of valuable resources to continue to look for proof. No one who has examined all
  of the data across laboratories, taken as a collective whole, has been able to suggest methodological or statistical
  problems to explain the ever-increasing and consistent results to date. Resources should be directed to the pertinent
  questions about how this ability works. I am confident that the questions are no more elusive than any other questions
  in science dealing with small to medium sized effects, and that if appropriate resources are targeted to appropriate
  questions, we can have answers within the next decade.</p>
