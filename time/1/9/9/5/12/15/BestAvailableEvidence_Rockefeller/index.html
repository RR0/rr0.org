<h2><a id="Endorsement"></a>LETTER OF ENDORSEMENT for the BRIEFING DOCUMENT on UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS </h2>
<p>December 15, 1995</p>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>We believe that this Briefing Document on Unidentified Flying Objects presents the best available evidence for the
  existence of UFOs. Although just a brief sample of the scientific and military evidence available worldwide is given,
  it represents some of the most _carefully _documented incidents.
</p>
<p>While several governments of the world have dealt with this problem, as you can see in the enclosed report we think
  that these governments should make available now all the UFO evidence they have collected, for a thorough and open
  inquiry by the scientific community.
</p>
<p>The political constraints that imposed the rule of secrecy during the Cold War are no longer justified and the
  solution to the UFO mystery may represent both a scientific and social breakthrough.
</p>
<p>We, the undersigned, endorse the information contained in this Briefing Document as the best available evidence from
  open sources.
</p>
<p>CUFOS (Center for UFO Studies): President [signature] Dr. Mark Rodeghier</p>
<p>FUFOR (Fund for UFO Research): Chairman [signature] Mr. Richard H. Hall</p>
<p>MUFON (Mutual UFO Network): International Director [signature] and President Mr. Walter H. Andrus</p>
<h2><a id="Acknowledgement"></a>Acknowledgments </h2>

</p>
<h2><a id="Overview"></a>Part 1. Overview </h2>
<h3><a id="GovSecrecy"></a>GOVERNMENT SECRECY </h3>
<p>In a democracy, the decision where to draw the line between a citizen's right to know and the government's right to
  secrecy for national security reasons must be made by appropriate members of the society. This issue has become the
  focus of much attention today and is especially relevant to an ongoing discussion, both inside and outside Congress,
  regarding UFO phenomena.
</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, military services and the intelligence agencies must maintain a certain amount of secrecy.
  However, in recent decades, and especially since the end of the Cold War, many observers believe that the use of
  government secrecy has become excessive.
</p>
<p>The power of government employees to restrict access to reports which they write by classifying them "confidential,"
  "secret" or even "top secret" is often absolute. Once these reports are classified, they can only be declassified by
  the originator or by a special procedure that moves along at a glacial pace. Nor does the
  <a href="/org/FOIA.html">Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</a> help very much. It does not apply to
  most classified material. Meanwhile, our criminal statutes protect against the unauthorized revelation of classified
  materials.
</p>
<p>Secrecy, like power, lends itself to abuse. Behind the shield of secrecy, it is possible for an agency or service to
  avoid scrutiny and essentially to operate outside of the law. Accountability to the taxpayers and to the Congress can
  be conveniently avoided.
</p>
<p>The vast majority of people employed by the U.S. government do not have access to classified information. Even those
  with secret and top secret clearances will not have access to all highly classified information. Furthermore, it is
  doubtful whether any member of Congress can have access to all such information. Given the size of the government
  bureaucracy and high degree of compartmentalization that exists within it, it is conceivable that even the President
  himself is not fully briefed on matters classified as "above top secret." Such information, allowing access only on
  the strictest "need-to-know" basis, is not necessarily given to senior elected officials who come and go and can
  therefore be regarded as temporary, political and unreliable.
</p>
<p>Such is the case for top secret UFO information. In 1980, for example, researchers requesting information through the
  FOIA learned of the existence of 156 top secret UFO-related documents held by the
  <a href="/org/us/ic/nsa/index.html">National Security Agency (NSA)</a>. This lead was not found
  through the NSA itself, but through internal references in UFO-related documents held by other government agencies.
  When the researchers filed a <a href="/org/FOIA.html">FOIA</a> request for the 156
  <a href="/org/us/ic/nsa/index.html">NSA</a> UFO documents, they were denied access to all of them.
  They appealed, but Judge Gerhard Gesell of the First Federal Court, District of Columbia, after reviewing the 21-page
  written argument submitted by the <a href="/org/us/ic/nsa/index.html">NSA</a>, denied their appeal.
  The 21-page summary was later released, but even in this summary most of the information was blacked out.
</p>
<p> (1) Judge Gesell Ruling re National Security Agency, November 14, 1980.</p>
<p>Such action seems inconsistent with a government that officially downplays the existence of true UFOs, and officially
  states that there is no threat to national security.
</p>
<p>In the case of UFO phenomena, the question must be asked: what would give an un-elected government official the right
  to keep this information to himself, thereby depriving the rest of the world of possible knowledge of almost
  inconceivable magnitude and consequence? Such elitism by the officials of any government, much less a government based
  on the principles of democracy and individual rights, is a gross injustice not only to its ovn people, but to all
  people.
</p>
<p>At issue, in this case, is access to knowledge perhaps so profound that it affects not only our very perspective on
  man's place in the universe, but also perhaps his continued presence on this planet. If the UFO phenomenon is real, we
  have clear evidence that an unknown technology is at work, whose potential could be enormous for the good of mankind -
  a potential source, for example, for useful energy benign to the environment.
</p>
<p>To acknowledge the enormous gap between our present understanding of science and what is being evidenced, would
  provide the urgently needed challenge to the scientific establishment to examine where some of its basic assumptions
  might be faulty and to move berond them.
</p>
<p>Is it possible that a few privileged individuals have access to this information while denying it to the electorate
  for "national security" reasons, so that it can be privately studied? In a democracy, should not this decision be made
  by our _elected officials and be based upon an informed discussion?
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"UFO research is leading us kicking and screaming into the science of the twenty-first century.</p>
  <p>"I have begun to feel that there is a tendency in 20th Century science to forget that there will be a 21st Century
    science, and indeed a 30th Century science from which vantage points our knowledge of the universe may appear quite
    different than it does to us. We suffer, perhaps, from temporal provincialism, a form of arrogance that has always
    irritated posterity." (From a letter by Dr. J. Allen Hynek to Science magazine, August 1. 1966.)
  </p>
  <p>Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Northwestern University astronomer; scientific consultant on UFOs to the U.S. Air Force from
    1948 until 1969. Founder of the private Center for UFO Studies in 1973.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a id="CaseForReality"></a>THE CASE FOR UFO REALITY </h3>
<p>As long as men and women have talked about strange sights in the skies, two primary questions have been asked about
  what has come to be called Unidentified Flying Objects:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Are they real, or are they just honest mistakes?</li>
  <li> If they are real, could they be ships from some other world?</li>
</ol>
<p>In this century, it started with the "foo fighters" of World War II: glowing balls that flew in formation or "played
  tag" with military airplanes over Europe and the Pacific. Suspected of being prototype enemy weapons, they never
  displayed hostility and when the war was over, they were all-but-forgotten.
</p>
<p>In 1946, the Scandinavian countries reported many hundreds of "ghost rockets" which flew low and silently, and often
  slowly. Efforts to blame them on nearby Soviet tests of captured German missiles failed when it was learned that no
  such tests had taken place.
</p>
<p>The first major American wave of sightings of "flying discs" began in the early summer of 1947. Within two weeks, at
  least 1,000 sightings were recorded of fast silvery discs seen in the daytime. The first military studies concluded
  they were real and of unknown nature and origin <span class="source">[Memo from Lt. Gen. Nathan Twining, Commanding General of the Air Materiel Command, Wright Field, to Gen. Spaatz, Commanding General of the U.S. Army Air Forces, September 23, 1947]</span>.
</p>
<p>From then on, UFOs seemed to fly at will over all parts of the world: fast and exotic, untouchable and and unproven.
  By the 1990s, there had been over 100,000 reported sightings, many by airline pilots and military pilots and other
  qualified witnesses.
</p>
<p>Despite the steady accumulation of a vast quantity of information about the appearance and behavior of UFOs, little
  light has been shed on the two questions posed at the beginning. The armed services and universities, as well as
  private groups and individuals, have devoted a great amount of time to investigating UFOs, yet there is no consensus
  about their nature, origins or purpose.
</p>
<p>Still, if a close look is taken at the best available evidence, it is possible to deal with what is known about UFOs,
  and what may reasonably be assumed. The point we will make is that the evidence to support the conclusion that UFOs
  are unknown aircraft/spacecraft seems to be overwhelming.
</p>
<h4><a id="VisualEvidence"></a>Visual Evidence </h4>
<p>Most of what is "known" about UFOs comes from individuals' descriptions of what they say they saw. If the individuals
  are reliable and knowledgeable about the sky, the information stands a good chance of being useful. This is the source
  of the case's "credibility," one of the two primary criteria recognized by the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, long a
  consultant on UFOs to the U.S. Air Force, and later the founder of the private Center for UFO Studies.
</p>
<p>Dr. Hynek's other criterion is "strangeness," meaning the extent to which a reported observation differs from normal
  airplanes, satellites, meteors, etc. A large aluminum-looking sphere which maneuvers violently and changes speed
  abruptly, rates higher for "strangeness" than a somewhat peculiar light seen in the night sky.
</p>
<p>It is the reports which rate highest in both "credibility" and "strangeness" that form the heart of the UFO mystery.
  Are they indeed convincing observations of unknown aircraft/spacecraft, or are they merely strangely shaped clouds or
  balloons seen under unusual lighting conditions, or some other natural or manmade phenomena?
</p>
<h4><a id="RadarEvidence"></a>Radar Evidence </h4>
<p>Radar has played a major role in UFO sightings, repeatedly confirming the presence of something unidentified which
  responds to radar much as an airplane does. Clouds and other weather phenomena show up on radar, but any experienced
  operator can tell the difference between weather and something solid.
</p>
<p>On popular explanation for radar/visual reports is temperature inversion. This was first brought to public attention
  following two nights of UFO sightings over Washington D.C., in 1952. Inversions, the cause of mirages, probably never
  caused these or any other UFO reports. According to a 1969 study by the Air Force Environmental Technical Applications
  Center, the conditions needed to produce the UFO-like effects attributed to inversions cannot exist in the Earth's
  atmosphere <span class="source">[Menkello, F.V., "Quantitative Aspects of Mirages," USAF Environmental Technical Applications Center, 1969</span>].
</p>
<p>The most thoroughly investigated recent radar/visual UFO sightings occurred in Belgium and Russia. Military jet
  interceptors were launched following observations from the ground. Ground-based and airborne radars then confirmed
  what was being seen visually, including high speeds and violent maneuvers far beyond the capability of the best modern
  warplanes. In both countries, high government officials admitted they were baffled.
</p>
<p>While the human eye can be fooled, and radar can be fooled, it is considered extremely unlikely that both can be
  fooled, in exactly the same way, at exactly the same time. Thus radar/visual reports rate among the most convincing of
  all types of UFO sightings.
</p>
<h4><a id="PhysicalEvidence"></a>Physical Evidence </h4>
<p>UFOs have been seen high in the sky, near to the ground, on the ground, and even rising from water. If some UFOs have
  landed, it is reasonable to suspect that some of them may have left traces behind, and indeed that is the case.
  Imprints, residues, charred and broken tree branches and rocks are among the bits of evidence claimed for UFO
  landings. Furthermore, under microscopic examination, some residues exhibit strange and unusual characteristics.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the most well known example of a physical trace case in the United States occurred in 1964 near Socorro, New
  Mexico, where a policeman reported seeing an egg-shaped craft sitting on slender legs in an open field. When it had
  flown away, he and a second policeman inspected the area where it had been parked and found depressions in the dirt,
  as well as still smoldering, blackened shrubs. The sighting was investigated within two hours by men from U.S. Army
  Intelligence and the FBI, followed a day later by the chief civilian scientific consultant to Project Blue Book (the
  official Air Force investigation of UFO sightings). All agreed that the primary witness was highly reliable. Later,
  the final director of Blue Book called this case the most puzzling of the approximately 12,500 in his files.
</p>
<p>The best documented example of a physical trace case in Europe occurred in Trans-en-Provence, France, where a farmer
  reported seeing a saucer-shaped craft land on his property and then fly away after a short while. Physical traces left
  on the ground were collected by the police within 2 hours and later analyzed in several French government
  laboratories. Microscopic analyses revealed anomalous biochemical and electromagnetic effects on the soil and
  vegetation. The diector of the Service d'Expertise des Phenomenes de Rentrees Atmospheriques (SEPRA, formerly called
  GEPAN) at the National Center for Space Studies (CNES) describes this case as the most puzzling UFO case in the French
  government files <span class="source">[GEPAN, Note Technique No. 16 Enquete 81/01, _Analyse d'une Trace, Toulouse, March 1, 1983. (English translation published in the MUFON UFO Journal, March 1984]</span>.
</p>
<h4>Government Statements</h4>
<p>The involvement of the American government in the UFO mystery has long offered its own set of questions. Known
  investigations have produced ambiguous results, and explanations offered for specific cases have frequently been at
  odds with scientific reasoning. Sometimes, little-publicized official statements have supported the position that UFOs
  are real and unexplained.
</p>
<p>(4) Steiger Brad, ed. _Project Blue Book, Ballantine Books, 196.</p>
<p>Sometimes statements not intended for the public have been brought to the surface by UFO researchers:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>July 30, 1947: "This Flying saucer" situation is not all imaginary or seeing too much in some natural phenomena.
    Something is really flying around <span class="source">[Air Force Base Intelligence Report, "Flying Discs," AFBIR-CO, July 30, 1947]</span>.
  </p>
  <p>Sept. 23, 1947: "The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious."
    <span class="source">[Twining, ibid]</span>.
  </p>
  <p>Oct. 28, 1947. "It is the considered opinion of some elements that the object [sic may in fact represent an
    interplanetary craft of some kind." <span class="source">[Draft Intelligence Collections Memorandum issued by Brig. Gen. George Shulgen, Chief of the Air Intelligence Requirements Division of the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, October 28, 1947]</span>.
  </p>
  <p>Dec. 10, 1948: "It must be accepted that some type of flying objects have been observed, although their
    identification and origin are not discernible." <span class="source">[U.S. Air Intelligence Report 100-203-79, "Analysis of Flying Objects in the U.S.," December 10, 1948]</span>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> In 1948, the U.S. Air Force opened a publicly-known UFO investigation called Project Sign. Later, it became Project
  Grudge and finally Project Blue Book. In 1955, the U.S. Air Force released a study of 3,200 UFO reports it had
  received between 1947 and 1952. The private Battelle Memorial Institute used the Air Force data to arrive at its own
  conclusions: of the cases for which there was some conclusion, almost 50% were either unexplained, or doubtfully
  explained. Moreover, it was determined that the higher the qualifications of the witnesses, the harder it was to
  explain the reports in terms of common phenomena <span class="source">[Air Force Project Blue Book, "Special Report No. 14 (Analysis of Reports of Unidentified Aerial Objects)," May 5, 1955]</span>.
</p>
<p>In 1967, as Project Blue Book was coming under increasing attack from the press and the public, the Air Force
  contracted with the University of Colorado to make a final study of UFOs. In contrast to the totally negative
  statements of the study director, Dr. Edward U. Condon, the body of the f1nal report showed that about 30% of the
  cases studied were left without explanation. Comments on individual cases by University of Colorado scientists
  included:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"This is the most puzzling case in the radar/visual files. The apparently rational, intelligent behavior of the UFO
    suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation.
  </p>
  <p>"All factors investigated - geometric, psychological and physical - appear to be consistent with the assertion that
    an extraordinary flying object, silvery, metallic, disc-shaped, tens of meters in diameter, and evidently
    artificial, flew within sight of two witnesses." <span class="source">[Gillmor, Daniel S., ed., _Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects, New York Times Books, 1969]</span>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the recommendation of the University of Colorado, Project Blue Book was ended in late 1969, after almost 22
  years of Air Force official investigations. It left behind approximately 12,500 case files, of which 585 were
  officially declared "Unknown." This means that the project staff felt it had sufficient information about a case, but
  were unable to supply a full explanation of it.
</p>
<p>Cases lacking sufficient information for meaningful analysis were kept separate. Furthermore, an official memo was
  released years later, under the Freedom of Information Act, that made it clear that "reports of unidentified flying
  objects _which could affect national security... are not part of the Blue Book system." [emphasis added]. Such reports
  "would continue to be handled through the standard Air Force procedures designed for this purpose."
  <span class="source">[Bolender, Brig. Gen. C.H., USAF, Memo re Project Blue Book, October 20, 1969</span>].
</p>
<p>In summary, it is apparent that the evidence - visual, radar and physical - strongly suggests that more than mistaken
  observations of conventional phenomena are involved in many UFO sightings. Witness testimony, backed up by official
  U.S. government documents, point toward the presence in the Earths atmosphere of apparently manufactured craft that
  cannot be explained as mistaken observations of acknowledged aircraft, spacecraft, atmospheric or astronomical
  phenomena.
</p>
<h4>The Case For Extraterrestrial UFOs</h4>
<p>If UFOs are not anything known, then they must be unknown. What says "unknown" more powerfully than
  extraterrestrial?" In the absence of any specific knowledge of even a single extraterrestrial civilization, there are
  no constraints on theorizing about the nature, technology and behavior of one or more hypothesized alien cultures. But
  are UFOs extraterrestrial? Lacking proof, we must deal very carefully with any answers. It remains a possibility that
  some or all of the otherwise unexplained UFO reports will some day be explained in terms of as-yet-unknown natural
  phenomena, or secret highly advanced man-made aircraft and/or spacecraft.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are impressive reasons for speculating about the extraterrestrial origin for some UFOs, namely
  their shapes and their performance.
</p>
<h4>Shapes of UFOs </h4>
<p>Most UFOs observed in daylight, when shapes and details can be seen, have been described as having simple geometric
  shapes: discs, spheres, cylinders and more recently, triangles.
</p>
<p>Disc-shaped airplanes have been flown, but none is known to have exceeded 150 mph, nor to have other capabilities
  displayed by UFOs. Difficulties in stability and control have so far prevented any disc-shaped aircraft from getting
  beyond the stage of low-performance prototypes.
</p>
<p>Spherical aircraft have so far been limited to gas-filled balloons, whose performance is at the bottom of the speed
  and maneuverability scales. Balloons can fly only as the wind blows and can be overtaken quickly by airplanes.
</p>
<p>Cylindrical aircraft are unknown, as the lack of wings poses huge problems when it comes to such functions as taking
  off and flying level. Rockets and missiles are cylindrical and certainly are able to fly, but only as the result of
  great power in relation to their size. They cn only fly upwards up at launch, and on a ballistic curve on their way to
  a target.
</p>
<p>Triangle is the shape of delta-winged airplanes, though the flight characteristics of triangular UFOs removes them
  from this category.
</p>
<p>It is entirely possible that some radical military aircraft having one or more of these shapes are flying from
  super-secret test facilities. But this would have to be a recent development unable to explain sightings of such craft
  during most of the past 50 years.
</p>
<h4>Performance of UFOs </h4>
<p>Even more striking than the shapes of UFOs is their performance: speed, acceleration, maneuverability, silence.</p>
<p>Speed. UFOs have been tracked on military radar travelling silently at several thousand miles per hour well within
  the Earth's atmosphere. An airplane attempting this would create an inescapable sonic boom before melting from
  friction with the air.
</p>
<p>Extreme Acceleration. Airplanes do not visibly accelerate in the air, though they show generally impressive
  acceleration during take-off. Drag-racing cars and motorcycles accelerate in a manner obvious to even the least
  experienced observer. In the case of UFOs, airline and military pilots have reported that they fly at the same speed
  as an airplane, and then display acceleration common only to anti-missile missiles. Veteran pilots describe their
  observations with words like "astounding" and "unbelievable."
</p>
<p>Extreme Maneuverability. While airplanes can perform abrupt maneuvers, these are generally seen only in air shows.
  Even then, such flying is more often described by the outside observer as "graceful" rather than "violent," though the
  pilot may use the latter term. Impossibilities for airplanes (but not, apparently, for UFOs) include right-angle turns
  at high speed, and zig-zag flight.
</p>
<p>Silent Hovering. While helicopters and VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) airplanes can hover, they produce noises
  whose quality and volume positively identify them. UFOs, on the other hand, appear able to hover with little or no
  motion for long periods without any sound. This remains well beyond the state of known science, let alone technology.
</p>
<h4>Summary </h4>
<p>The U.S. Government, and many other governments, claim that although not all UFO reports can be explained, there is
  no evidence that Earth has been visited by aliens. Most scientists and leading journalists agree with this position.
  However, these same scientists believe that there must be many advanced civilizations on planets orbiting the billions
  of stars they estimate to exist in the universe. The gap between these two positions is generally explained by the
  assumed inability of even the most advanced society to travel the enormous distances separating the Earth from even
  the nearest stars.
</p>
<p>Yet there are thousands of sightings of novel, high-performance craft in our skies, reported by highly skilled and
  experienced observers. There are also hundreds of other reports of craft seen on the ground, and sometimes of humanoid
  beings in their vicinity.
</p>
<p>The great conflict between official positions and trustworthy observations constitutes the mystery of Unidentified
  Flying Objects. A possible solution to this mystery is the suggestion that the official position is based on an
  elaborate cover-up. If it is a cover-up, what then is being protected, and by whom?
</p>
<p>The answers to these questions generally focus on the issue of national security as well as fear of the public
  reaction to an official disclosure of UFO reality and its extraterrestrial origin. The question of extraterrestrial
  intention and the frightening aspects of the alleged abduction phenomena could be extremely disturbing. However, many
  researchers believe that it is the science and technology behind the national security veil which lies at the heart of
  the secrecy, and that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> fallen discs are being reverse engineered, repaired and/or copied, and being tested;</li>
  <li>the technology is so advanced that we can barely imagine the science behind it (which could be based on a
    fundamentally different understanding of gravity and electromagnetic fields); - whichever nation masters this
    extraordinary technology will certainly be the most powerful nation on earth;
  </li>
  <li>in the opinion of those in control, the guarding of this technology for defense purposes, far outweighs its
    potential value for other purposes - i.e. a non-polluting, cost efficient solution to our present energy and
    environmental crisis.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="CoverUp"></a>THE UFO COVER-UP </h3>
<p>There are two major elements to the UFO mystery: the UFOs themselves and the intensive efforts by the governments of
  the world to withhold information about them. Neither the nature nor the purpose of the governments' actions are
  clearly understood. But this policy dates back to the latter part of World War II when UFO-like "foo fighters" were
  being reported by combat pilots.
</p>
<p>A report about "foo-fighters" is said to have been prepared in 1945 by the United States Eighth Air Force, but no
  copy has been seen by the public, despite the passing of a half century. A year later, when "ghost rockets" were seen
  over Scandinavia, the Swedish Government invoked secrecy and only began to release information 40 years later. When
  "flying saucers" appeared over the USA in the summer of 1947, only the most general information was made public, while
  reports and analyses were kept under wraps, as was the fact that the government was taking the saucers seriously. (13,

<p>The U.S. Air Force ongoing UFO investigation (Project Sign, Project Grudge, and Project Blue Book), collected more
  than 12,000 reports, most of which were "explained." It was official policy to refuse to comment on "unexplained"
  cases. By keeping case details secret, the public was kept from learning that many of the allegedly-explained cases
  had not been analyzed by generally accepted scientific standards. (15)
</p>
<p>In 1976, with the amendment of the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act by the U.S. Congress, a mechanism was
  created for unearthing government UFO information whose very existence had long been denied. Formal requests, followed
  by appeals and sometimes legal action, produced thousands of pages of previously-classified documents from the Air
  Force, Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation and other intelligence-oriented agencies.
</p>
<p>It appears, however, that the released information was the least sensitive material in the official files. Almost all
  the released documents had been classified merely "Confidential" or "Secret," with just a few having been "Top
  Secret". Many pages of these documents showed the black marks of censorship. In fact, many pages of the voluminous
  case files of the official U.S. Air Force investigation contained black marks hiding information. (16)

<p>The rapid flow of UFO documents in the 1970s dropped to a slow trickle in the 1980s, but will probably pick up again
  with the Administration's recent declassification measures. However, since every government agency has at its disposal

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>When studied as a group, these case histories exhibit clear patterns which strongly suggest that they belong to a
  distinct new class of phenomena, rather than being a formless collection of disparate observational errors... It is
  this large quantity of evidence of the existence of something completely baffling which motivates many of us to urge
  the governments of the world to release all they know about UFOs so that the people of the world, and especially
  scientists, can begin to come to grips with a mystery that has far too long been subjected to secrecy and ridicule.

<p>"I can assure you that flying saucers, given that they exist, are not constructed by any power on earth," Harry S.
