<p>Since a time apparently in the 1970s, a number of individuals with extremely high security clearances, who were
  working on various aspects of the UFO phenomenon, began to interact with each other on a regular basis to pool the
  information each had from their highly-compartmented assignments. The objective was to coordinate data, see the big
  picture about UFOs and extraterrestrial contacts with Earth, and to use this privileged information pool to gain
  access to additional secret data, to understand the policies of the elite, hypersecret <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/Majestic12.html">Majestic-12</a> (MJ-12) UFO information-control
  and policy group, and to gain special influence through having this highly-privileged information.</p>
<p>This elite group of perhaps 14 individuals working in National Security assignments eventually gave themselves
  code-names, using mostly bird names. Collectively, they came to be called The Aviary (bird enclosure). A reader
  warning is in order: This affiliative network may exist as reported, or the accounts of this grouping may include
  disinformation generated by The Aviary themselves to obscure their membership.</p>
<p>The relationship of The Aviary to the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a>
  (ultimate UFO information control and policy) Group is murky. It is the estimate of more than one UFO researcher that
  there is some overlap in membership; meaning that <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a>
  has quietly infiltrated The Aviary to keep tabs on it and to keep it under control.</p>
<p>It has been reported by Dr. <span class="people" title="Steven M. Greer">Steven Greer</span>, Director of the Center
  for the Study of Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (<a href="/org/us/asso/cseti">CSETI</a>), that the MJ-12 Group is now
  designated as PI-40 <span class="source">Personal communication, January, 1995</span>. This hyper-classified group
  deals with the most sensitive compartmented information regarding extraterrestrials, and is so covert a Special Access
  Program, that reportedly the President and Congress do not exercise control over PI-40, and only know of its existence
  through rumor.</p>
<p>Dick D'Amato, National and International Security Specialist for Senator Robert Byrd, and a member of the <a
    href="/org/us/NSC.html">National Security Council (NSC)</a>, in <time>1991</time>, stated that UFO information
  should be released, but that an incredibly powerful black arm of the government has been keeping it secret, and
  spending enormous sums of money illegally in this operation. D'Amato said that the NSC is trying to find out who these
  people are. [Personal communication with <a href="/people/m/MarcelJesseJunior">Jesse Marcel, Jr.</a>, M.D.,
  Washington, D.C., 1991; as reported in eUFOria, the Black Hills UFO Network Publication, 2:2, May, 1995.]</p>
<p>Ironically, the answer may be right under their noses. It is quite possible that PI-40 exists within a
  hyper-compartmented Special Access Program, yet with informal informational links to the National Security Council's
  5240 [Black Projects] Committee. <span class="source">Timothy Good, Above Top Secret, 1983; L. Fletcher Prouty, The Secret Team,
    1973.</span></p>
<p>While there may be some overlap between The Aviary and the PI-40 group, they remain two separate entities. PI-40 is
  clearly at the top; for PI-40 is the policy and decision group who have orchestrated the UFO Cover-Up since 1947,
  while simultaneously releasing little fragments of UFO/Star Visitor information, to gradually condition the American
  public to the slowly-dawning realization of UFO reality.</p>
<p>The Aviary is the group of individuals with histories of working in UFO-related National Security projects who have
  obtained more complete information (and thus power) by closely coordinating the data, informants, and efforts each is
  involved with. Now, leaked reports from sources close to some Aviary members suggest that there is a split within the
  Aviary, (which may well mirror a split within the PI-40 group.)</p>
<p>On one side are those members of The Aviary who feel that the time has come when information about UFO reality and ET
  contacts should be broadly disclosed to the public. These Good Guys feel that the public is ready for this
  information, and generally can handle it. Others within the Aviary, on the Dark Side , resist such disclosure. The
  Dark Side members do not want to lose the power which a UFO/ET-information monoploy has given them. From their
  behavior, it appears that they do not welcome close public scrutiny of their role in the UFO Cover-Up. Additionally,
  one or two among them have reportedly engaged in not-properly-authorized, illegal, and sometimes injurious projects
  and operations. The split over disclosure versus maintaining the Cover-Up is creating a climate where there are
  increasing leaks, as the Good Guys try to force disclosure, and establish for themselves a track record of belated
  candor with the American public. It is important not to demonize all the reported members of The Aviary. Most are
  presumably well-intentioned scientists or (former) military or intelligence officers, with careers spanning the Cold
  War, and who no doubt sincerely believed that UFO secrecy was vital to maintain. Any crimes committed by those few of
  the Dark Side will have to be determined in a proper military or civilian court of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The following is a list of reported members of The Aviary.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>BLUEJAY</b>: Dr. <span class="people" title="Kit Green">Christopher Kit Green</span>, MD, Ph.D., Chief,
    Biomedical Sciences Department, General Motors; former custodian of the CIA's UFO files at the Weird Desk ; received
    the National Intelligence Medal for his work on a classified project during the period of <time>1979/1983</time>;
    recently reported to be White House UFO liason.</li>
  <li><b>PELICAN</b>: <span class="people">Ron Pandolfi</span>, CIA Deputy Director for the Division of Science and
    Technology, and current custodian of UFO files at the Weird Desk ; involved in the White House Initiative, as UFO
    liaison, to expedite (at Laurence Rockefeller's behest) the release of UFO information to the public; and has been
    quietly leaking UFO information the past few years.</li>
  <li><b>OWL</b>: <span class="people">Hal Puthoff</span>, physicist with the Institute for Advanced research in Austin,
    TX who specializes in Zero-Point Energy, a quantum/resonance physics phenomenon with reported potential for
    above-unity ( free ) energy; formerly a Stanford Research Institute (SRI) and reported DIA researcher, (along with
    psi guru and fellow Scientologist Ingo Swann,) into parapsychological, psychotronic, remote-viewing, and
    mind-control projects, and reportedly involved in classified ET-technology studies.</li>
  <li><b>RAVEN</b>: (Identity not yet determined.) RAVEN appears to be a kingpin in The Aviary, and a Washington
    insiders' guessing game has sprung up, as devotees of UFO intelligence data argue for the probable identity of their
    favorite candidate . [Possible candidates: <span class="people">Henry Kissinger</span>, Ph.D., <span class="people">Edward Teller</span>,
    Ph.D.; General Brent Scowcroft.]</li>
  <li>PENGUIN: <span class="people">John B. Alexander</span>, Ph.D. in Death Sciences [Thanatology], Col., ( Ret. ),
    U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), which is undoubtedly his military cover for the National
    Security Agency (NSA). Colonel Alexander is director of the Non-Lethal (sic) Weapons Department, Los Alamos National
    Laboratory [LANL], and has been reportedly involved in counter-intelligence remote-viewing, psychic-warfare,
    psychotronic and mind-control projects with military/security applications, while maintaining the cover of nonlethal
    military/crowd control physical-countermeasures research. Dr. Alexander is a Board Member, (along with INSCOM
    General Al Stubblebine and INSCOM Major Ed Dames), of PSI-Tech Corporation, involved in proprietary remote-viewing
    projects. 2003 Update Note: Colonel John Penguin Alexander was spotted last year by this author at a retired
    intelligence officers dinner function at Sixth Army Headquarters, The Presidio, San Francisco. Alexander had become
    bloated, and was accompanied by his life-partner, Victoria Lacas, dressed as always in faux-Goth all-black, (which
    does nothing to dispel rumors circulating in the ufological community about reported interest in sorcery.) This
    author has been informed that Alexander is head of the Aviary, and that the Aviary is headquartered at LANL. This
    author has heard from a source that one or more members of the Aviary are believed to have been a party to MILABS
    operations, (rogue military-intelligence units kidnapping, interrogation, terrorizing, drugging, and hypnotic
    mind-control programming of innocent civilians, and implanting of a false post-hypnotic memory that the episode was
    an alien abduction .) This author has also learned that one or more members of the Aviary are thought to have
    engaged in seeking to control the souls of Holocaust victims to gain power by manipulating these souls at the time
    they reincarnate into a new human body. It is thought that Satanic rites (Ã  la Aleister Crowley) may factor into
    such soul-capture-and-control procedures. </li>
  <li><b>HAWK</b>: Ernie Kellerstraus, security-cleared for UFO information, worked at Wright-Patterson AFB in the
    1970's, and is reported to have lived with a Star Visitor for a while; reported to have worked with Dale Graff
    (*HARRIER*?) and Captain Bob Collins (CONDOR), Air Force Intelligence, to supply UFO information to USAF/AFOSI
    disinformation operative/ UFOlogist William Moore.</li>
  <li>(Bird name unknown, [PARTRIDGE?]): <span class="people">Jacques Vallee</span>, Ph.D., formerly an astrophysicist
    with GEPAN, the French Goverrnment's UFO investigative agency, later moved to U.S. as principal investigator with
    Defense Department computer network projects; worked with famed astronomer Dr. J. Allen Hynek who left and denounced
    the military's Project Blue Book as a disinformational smokescreen; prolific author on UFO subject, lately turning
    to metaphysical explanations for the phenomenon.</li>
  <li><b>SEAGULL</b>: <span class="people">Bruce Maccabee</span>, Ph.D., research scientist in optical physics and laser
    weapons applications at the U.S. Naval Surface Weapons Lab, MD; MUFON physics/photo-interpretive consultant, and
    prolific author and consultant expert on selected leaked or disinformational UFO cases/topics, such as the Gulf
    Breeze-Ed Walters alleged UFO photos, the Canadian Carp UFO hoaxed incident , and the documented repeat UFO landings
    at the hyper-secure Manzano Canyon Facility at Kirtland AFB/Sandia National Laboratories-Military Reservation.</li>

    and other Agencies; with 30 years service in U.S. Intelligence overseas; involved in government research and
    development projects for the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Defense Advanced
    Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) and other organizations;
    former Senate aide to Sen. Claiborne Pell, who has had a long-standing interest in UFOs and the paranormal, *and has
    tried to get Congressional Hearings held on UFOs; President, Human Potential Foundation; and point-man for Laurence
    Rockefeller on UFO matters, currently tasked to contact world leaders concerning upcoming public announcements of
    UFO/ET reality; recently convened the <time>May</time> 1995 Washington, D.C. <i>When Cosmic Cultures Meet</i>
    International Conference .

  <li><b>CONDOR</b>: Capt. <span class="people" title="Robert M. Collins">Bob Collins</span>, USAF (Ret.), Special
    Agent, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, engaged in UFO-related intelligence operations; reportedly
    appeared clandestinely on 1988 Kodak-produced network television (dis-)information program UFO Cover-Up Live , where
    Collins, *reportedly* along with former CIA contract employee and current UFO-conferences disinformation lecturer,
    John Lear, presented accounts of alien autopsies, UFO retrievals, and the government's awareness about UFOs and ET
    presence.</li>
  <li><b>FALCON</b>: Sgt. <span class="people" title="Richard C. Doty">Richard Dick Doty</span>, USAF (Ret.), Special
    Agent, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, reported to have engaged in UFO disinformation projects,
    including reportedly hoaxing TV producer Linda Moulton Howe concerning availability of a tape showing a UFO landing
    at Holloman Air Force Base, NM; and of allegedly waging psychological warfare on Albuquerque defense electronics
    contractor Paul Bennewitz, concerning Bennewitz's electronic monitoring of UFO activity around Kirtland AFB/Sandia
    National Laboratories, Albuquerque, reportedly causing/exacerbating a mental breakdown in Mr. Bennewitz. Reportedly,

    MUFON Conference to being an Air Force Intelligence operative involved in UFO-related disinformation projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>AVIARY AFFILIATES AUXILIARY:</p>
<p>Besides the main members of The Aviary, ancillary helpers *reportedly* exist who are more or less witting of the
  purposes and membership of The Aviary, and choose to participate in a variety of supporting roles.</p>
<ul>
  <li> (Bird name unknown [HERON?]) Dale Graff, UFO-related technology specialist reported by Dan Smith (cf. infra) to
    be head of the military UFO Working Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory; rumored to be involved in psychotronic
    and ESP programs at Los Alamos; formerly was contracts overseer for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) at
    Wright-Patterson Air Force Base; then was chief of the DIA's Defense Technology/Special Programs department, before
    reportedly being fired by the DIA. Currently, Graff is reported to be in contact with the human designate who
    communicates with an extraterrestrial residing near Washington, DC in a subterranean facility (Andrews AFB/Naval
    Reservation?).</li>
  <li>(bird-name unknown [NIGHTINGALE(?)]): Jack Verona, shadowy liaison between Capitol Hill and Los Alamos National
    Laboratory, before<br> having recently disappeared ; reportedly Dale Graff's supervisor: formerly involved in
    Project Sleeping Beauty, which researched ways to disable enemy target personnel using directed precise-frequency
    radiated electromagnetic-energy fields. (According to Dan Smith, NIGHTINGALE is not Jack Verona, but rather may be
    George Wingfield, a British UFO researcher, who has established a reputation as a careful reporter of crop
    circle<br> formations and UFO information. NIGHTINGALE is not British UFOlogist Anthony Dodd, who has revealed the
    disappearance in 1993 of a U.S. carrier destroyer during NATO sea exercises, during which a number of member
    countries' ships patrolled to find reported huge carrier-sized Unidentified Submerged Objects (USOs), which raced
    underwater at astounding speeds. Arguing against Mr. Dodd being NIGHTINGALE is the fact that after Dodd disclosed
    the U.S. destroyer's disappearance at a Nevada UFO Congress in <time>1994-12</time>, he was beat up outside the
    conference hall by two enforcer goons and told to shut his mouth up.)</li>
  <li>(Bird name unknown, [BUZZARD?]): Gordon Novell, reportedly a free-lance enforcer involved in Zero Point Energy
    programs, and tied to Bob Bigelow, a shadowy Las Vegas casinos operator, who reportedly is investigating alleged ET
    energy technology and titanium aluminide mettalurgy for their investment potential. Bigelow has created a National
    Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS) to direct a group of UFO technology-insider scientists. He has also
    reportedly acquired land south of Fort Duschene, Utah to operate a cattle ranch and study alleged cattle mutilations
    clustered there.</li>
  <li>(Bird name unknown, [WOODPECKER?]: <span class="people">Jaime Shandera</span>, a small-time Hollywood film
    producer, who reportedly is associated with William Moore. Shandera alleged that he had mysteriously received film
    containing the MJ-12 documents at his door one day from source(s) unknown. (Moore is considered by some to be the
    author of the MJ-12 disinformation papers.) Shandera was featured on the 1989 Kodak Television UFO documentary, UFO
    Cover-Up Live . Shandera is reported to be, along with Scott Jones and Dan Smith, one of the theologically-oriented
    and pro-UFO-disclosure progressives among the Aviary.</li>
  <li>CHICKEN LITTLE: <span class="people">Dan Smith</span>, civilian UFO researcher/volunteer interlocutor between
    source(s) within the Central Intelligence Agency, the Congressional Intelligence Committees and the civilian UFO
    researchers. Smith continually exchanges information with and networks the key UFO researchers, serves as their
    interlocutor, and shares their and his own findings with his source(s) at CIA and Capitol Hill.</li>
  <li>Undoubtedly, other assets and low-profile intermediaries of The Aviary are operating in the UFO-interest and
    general public communities, as its surrogate ears and mouthpieces. Whatever the Aviary's role, we the public have a
    right to full information about extraterrestrial contact and communications. In a democracy, no elite group has the
    right to bottle up for itself information that affects the lives and futures of us all.</li>
