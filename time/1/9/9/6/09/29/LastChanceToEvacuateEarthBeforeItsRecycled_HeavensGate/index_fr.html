<p>Nous sommes le 29 septembre 1996. Je suis "Do". "Do" ne signifie probablement rien pour nombre d'entre vous. Pour
  ceux qui ont entendu parler de "Do", je pourrais relier "Do" à "Ti et Do", des "2 des ovnis", ou de ce que les media
  ont qualifié de "culte ovni" qui a éclaboussé les actualités en <a href="../../../../../7/5/index.html">1975</a> et
  dispparu de la scène peu après cela. Et certains d'entre vous ont peut-être entendu parler d'efforts que nous avons
  fait pour essayer de partager un petit peu de ce que nous avons appris avec le public, périodiquement, entre <a
      href="../../../../../7/5/index.html">1975</a> et aujourd'hui. Nous avons put out a statement called `88 Update, et
  nous avons fait une série de bandes video un peu après cela, je pense que c'était en 1992, 1991-1992, appelées
  "Au-delà de l'Humain". Maintenant, aujourd'hui nous avons une urgence assez différente. C'est est urgent pour moi, et
  c'est urgent pour les étudiants qui s'asseyent devant moi. Notre raison pour vous parler est que nous ressentons le
  besoin de <strong>vous avertir</strong> de ce qui est juste au coin de la rue. </p>
<p>Je vais essayer de le dire aussi brièvement que je peux et aussi clairement que je le peux. Cette planète est sur le
  point d'être recyclée, refourbie, recommencée. Cela ne signifie pas qu'elle va être détruite, ça ne signifie pas que
  c'est la fin du monde. Mais cela signifie qu'elle va être spaded under. Maintenant, vous pouvez dire, "Eh bien, qui
  êtes-vous pour dire ça ?" Et je vais vous dire qui je suis. Quand au fait que vous croyiez ou pas qui je suis, c'est
  votre problème. Et que vous croyiez ou non que cette civilisation va être recyclée ou refourbie, c'est votre problème.
  Maintenant, l'objectif de cette bande est de vous <strong>avertir</strong> que cela va arriver, et que cela va arriver
  très bientôt. </p>
<p>Si je devais intituler cette bande, ce serait "Dernière chance d'évacuer la planète Terre avant qu'elle soit
  recyclée" - <em>dernière chance d'<strong>évacuer la Terre</strong> avant qu'elle soit <strong>recyclée</strong></em>.
  Si vous avez déjà lu un de nos enseignements - l'information dont nous disposons - vous savez que notre discipline est
  stricte, que nous enseignons "overcoming human ways," overcoming human addictions. The purpose of that is not for
  religious reasons, or for morality, or in order to become "righteous." The purpose of that is <em>to go to the
    heavens</em>. Humans have some idea, because of what the negative forces have let them believe, or have
  <strong>led</strong> them to believe - humans have the idea that through religion, if I live a good life, then I get
  to go to Heaven when I die. And they don't know what Heaven is, but they think that Heaven is where God is, and Heaven
  is where whoever the leader of their religion is, and they'll get to go be with them if they've lived a good life by
  whatever standard their religion teaches. </p>
<p>The fact is, that there is only one Kingdom Level - <em>a Kingdom Level</em>, just like there's a <em>human</em>
  kingdom - <em>there's only one Kingdom Level above the human kingdom</em>, and that Kingdom Level
  <strong>made</strong> the human kingdom, and designed the planet, designed all of its resources, designed all of its
  life forms, designed humans, and even designed humans with the potential of leaving the human kingdom in order to go
  to the Kingdom Level Above Human. </p>
<p>Now, the startling thing to many is that the Kingdom Level Above Human is <strong>physical</strong>. There's some
  idea that the Kingdom Above Human is <em>spiritual</em>, as if it is <em>limited</em> to being spiritual. It
  <em>is</em> spiritual in the sense that, if you think of "mind" as synonymous with "spirit," and you become something
  that identifies with your <strong>mind</strong> instead of the "suit of clothes" you wear, then it is spiritual,
  because that mind/spirit becomes your <em>identity</em>. Even in the human world - if humans identify with the mind
  that they have, or the spirit that they have (remember, those two are synonymous) - if they identify with that mind,
  then they don't think that they die when the body they are wearing drops. They think that they move into another
  world. When they move out of the body, whether they do, in fact, move into another <em>world</em> depends upon whether
  they're <em>connected</em> or not, or what their information is, or what they are capable of knowing or doing, what
  they've been willing to learn. </p>
<p>You know, the Next Level, or the Evolutionary Level Above Human - oops, I said that bad word: <em>Evolutionary</em>
  Level. Because religious people think, "Oh, `evolution', does this mean that you don't believe in creation?" That's
  the most ridiculous thing that someone could think - that evolution is not a part of creation. That Kingdom Level
  <strong>created</strong> everything that is, or <strong>made</strong> everything that is, and among those things it
  made, it made a number of things that <strong>advance</strong> in an <strong>evolutionary progression</strong>. So to
  speak of that Level Above Human, we shouldn't be <em>afraid</em> to use the word "Evolutionary" Level Above. It's not
  really an Evolutionary Level <em>Above</em> Human, in that creatures here can, on their own, advance into that Kingdom
  Level, because they can't. That sounds strange. Well, they can advance, but they can't do it - on their own. </p>
<p>The same Evolutionary Level that created the human kingdom has to <strong>physically incarnate into</strong> the
  human kingdom to <strong>offer life</strong> to them - to <strong>offer information</strong> to them - while incarnate
  in a human body. If a recipient is <strong>thirsty</strong> enough for that mind, that recipient recognizes that he
  has literally connected with <strong>a source from that Next Level (that incarnate Representative)</strong> who is
  <strong>in their physical presence</strong>. Don't forget, the Next Level is not a spiritual Kingdom. Its members <em>identify</em>
  as the mind or spirit/soul, but wear <em>physical bodies</em>. Do you look at the heavens at night? Why do you see
  physical bodies in the heavens? If it was a spiritual heaven, you wouldn't see any of those bodies. They would all be
  etheric. But you see those Heavenly bodies. You see only a tiny, tiny fraction of those physical bodies in the Kingdom
  of Heaven. There are also many physical Heavenly bodies that cannot be seen by the human eye. </p>
<p>That doesn't mean that our Heavenly Father's Kingdom, or the Kingdom of God, or the Evolutionary Level Above Human,
  is anything <em>less</em> because it has physical characteristics. It has <em>all</em> characteristics - everything
  that you can talk about came from them - including "evil" - including the design of everything that can lead you to go
  astray if you listen to the wrong sources. You could say, "That couldn't possibly be true." There is <em>nothing
    that</em> is that was not created by the Kingdom Level Above Human. And the reason they created everything that
  there is, including negative options, is so that you could <em>become exactly what you choose to become</em> when you
  have the opportunity to become it. </p>
<p>Now, the only time we have an opportunity to leave the human kingdom and go to the Kingdom Level Above Human, is
  when there is <strong>a Member from that Kingdom Level, incarnate in human form</strong>, saying to you, "I'll tell
  you about a Kingdom Level beyond here, and if you want to go there then you have to follow me, because I am the guy
  who's got the key at the moment." Whatever Representative is sent from that Kingdom Level and comes into the human
  kingdom, then that's the Representative who has that key to that Kingdom, for that period of time. And it requires, if
  you move into that Evolutionary Kingdom, that you <strong>leave behind everything of human ways - human behavior,
    human ignorance, human misinformation</strong>. </p>
<p>A long time ago, long before this civilization began (and I don't know how many subsequent times this occurred),
  that Kingdom Level had a Representative in a human civilization, and members of a classroom who were in the process of
  overcoming their human characteristics. Some of those members who began to serve in elementary ways for that Kingdom
  Level Above Human decided that they didn't want to listen to that Representative any more, that they could do the
  things they wanted to do, and they weren't sure they wanted to get rid of human ways. And so they began to find fault
  in the Representative who was offering them a way out of the human kingdom. Well, you know the story from there - <em>fallen
    angels, Lucifer, Satan, a third of the Heavens</em> following a renegade who decided, "This world is not for me. I
  can be my own `god.' I don't need that Kingdom Level. I resent that I cannot be my own individual - that I can't lead
  my own flock." </p>
<p>Well, that Kingdom Level Above Human let that individual and his following lead their flock - <em>let</em> them do
  what they wanted to do - and used it for means that could serve a purpose in the design of the Next Level progression.
  And that very evil presence is <strong>thick</strong> on this planet because it's the End of an Age. It's so thick
  that it would <em>have you <strong>not</strong> believe a word I say</em>, and <em>have you <strong>not</strong>
    accept anything that I tell you</em> so that you will not be a recipient of the Kingdom they left (that they got
  booted out of and want no one else to go there). They are resentful - and are <em>in opposition</em> to the real
  Kingdom Level Above Human.don't forget, the Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Heaven. </p>
<p>Now, the <strong>End of the Age</strong>, the <strong>End of the civilization</strong>, is the <strong>worst
  time</strong> for presences of that renegade level (those who were students of that Level and went renegade). When you
  read in historical data that there was also a Hell (and there <em>is</em> a Hell) and the Hell is where those evil
  forces are - you can imagine that part of that Hell is planet Earth. When those "evil" individuals (those followers of
  Lucifer, of Satan) chose to go awry, they were then booted out of the Kingdom Level Above Human. They were confined to
  not only planet Earth, but any other planet with this type of gravity or environment that could serve as a natural
  environment for a human level. They <em>need</em> a human civilization. They <em>use bodies</em> from human
  civilizations. They make hybrid bodies because they have to continue to live. </p>
<p>Don't forget, they had learned what "spirit" was. They had learned to separate their mind - their spirit - from a
  human body, and knew that their identity was not lost if they lost a body. They learned to move out of that body
  without losing their consciousness, and even invade and take over another body that was "prepared" for them. They
  could sustain the life of it. For the most part, they are taking advantage of the <em>human "plants"</em> - the
  creatures of this civilization - using them for their own means. Those aliens - I call them <em>aliens</em> because
  one way you could speak of them is as "space aliens," evil space aliens - but they aren't really "space aliens"
  because they can only circulate in a very <em>limited</em> part of space. They are confined to environments (such as
  this Earth civilization) where there are mammalian human- equivalent or human civilizations existing. So they are not
  really "broad" space aliens. But the common term is "space alien." And I don't mind calling them space aliens. </p>
<p>When the Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Heaven, the Evolutionary Level Above Human, is <em>in close</em>, assisting
  us, because of our <em>presence</em> here, <em>they</em> certainly wouldn't be called "aliens" because this is <em>their</em>
  garden. <strong>They made it. We are their experiments, we are their creatures, we are their cre-ations. They made us
    - everything that we are</strong>. </p>
<p>Now, I've got to go back to the beginning of this tape, because I don't want you to listen to my philosophy, my
  ideology, the knowledge that I have. I want you to be aware that the focus is on the fact that <strong>this is the End
    of the Age</strong>. At the End of the Age the planet is <strong>wiped clean - refurbished - rejuvenated</strong>.
  The mess that the humans have made of it during this civilization is cleaned up. It is healed. It is probably done on
  "fast forward." It probably wouldn't take very long to do it by standards of human time. But even if it took a
  thousand years to do it, that's a very brief time according to Next Level time. We don't know how long it's going to
  take to do it. We can't estimate that because we're talking two different times anyhow. I mean, I'm trying to relate
  to you in human time and yet I am more at home in relating to the time of the Next Level. </p>
<p>If this planet is about to be recycled - spaded under - refurbished - the only ones that get to <em>leave it</em>
  are the ones who <em>want to leave</em>. The only ones who <em>survive the recycling</em> are the ones who <em>want to
    leave</em> - have found a teacher, someone who can give them the information they need <em>to leave</em>, or give
  them the information that will eventually <em>lead them</em> to leaving. Now, what I mean by that is <strong>that
    information is available only during the time that we're here</strong>. And <strong>here I am</strong>, I'm Do, Do
  of Ti and Do, of the little religious "UFO cult," (because that's what the media dubbed us). <strong>And yet Ti, who
    is my Father, who is my "Older Member," who gave me birth in the Kingdom of Heaven long before this civilization
    began, Ti was here with me on this particular mission</strong>. </p>
<p>Now, let me describe this mission for a moment. Ti left, in Earth time, 1985, because Ti had assisted enough that it
  was time to turn responsibility over to Do, and for me then to begin a more serious communication with my Older
  Member, and to be <em>dependent upon it</em> and <em>reliant upon it</em>. When Ti and I were awakening, we entered
  this environment (to any significant degree) in the early `70's. You're looking at the body I'm wearing, and you're
  saying, "You entered in the early `70's? You're certainly more than 20 something years old." The body I'm wearing is,
  wow!, 65 years old. "I" (the mind/soul of the Next Level) entered at the same time my Older Member entered, which was
  in the early `70's. You could think, "Well, that doesn't make any sense." If you're "new age" - or whatever your
  belief is regarding reincarnation - you could think, "Well, I don't understand, I thought reincarnation occurs at the
  beginning of an infant's life." No, I'm sorry to say, that's not accurate. A <em>mind</em> begins when that infant is
  born, and that infant's genetic package begins to express itself as that mind develops. And it is a mind, it is a
  spirit. But then a spirit or a mind that had previously occupied another human plant, but has gone into the spirit
  world (or is outside of a body because it lost its body from death or whatever, but is still in the environment), can
  <strong>move in</strong> and <strong>take over</strong> that vehicle and <strong>be stronger</strong> than the mind
  that is the mind <strong>of</strong> that vehicle. In other words, it can <strong>invade</strong> that vehicle. It can
  take it over. It can pretty much keep the mind of that vehicle quiet and do what it wants to do with that vehicle.
</p>
<p>Now, the lower forces know this. They teach spirits to do this after they leave their bodies. They let them know
  that they're capable of doing that. You can say, "You mean that you and Ti came into bodies in `72, so you're `body
  snatchers,' in a sense." Well, the Level Above Human <em>made</em> this garden and its design, <em>made</em> the human
  plants for their purposes, and my Grandfather (Ti's Father) sent us into this environment with a crew that had work to
  do. Now, we did come in and prep the "vehicles." We actually set aside this "plant" that I'm wearing (this "vehicle"
  that I'm wearing) and the plants of the crew (the classroom), and the plant that Ti chose to wear. A "deposit" of a
  little bit of information was put in those plants that set them aside for the time when the mind was to <strong>significantly</strong>
  come in. And therefore, the mind that is now in my vehicle (body) cannot relate to that plant's history, prior to the
  time that my mind came in significantly. So, who the plant was that I'm now wearing, prior to the early `70's is just
  a fuzzy, dismal memory, because it is just like putting on a suit of clothes that had a history to it. And if I tried,
  I could invade some of that history and dredge it up, but it is so unattractive to me and it's such a low vibration to
  me (if I can use that word without sounding "new age" to some) - it's repulsive to me because it's certainly very
  human. This vehicle certainly indulged in human behavior, human addictions, human ways, as every other human does.
</p>
<p>When Ti and I were brought into this environment in the early `70's, a spacecraft brought us in - remember, it's a
  physical world. And actually we came in earlier and made deposits, or little "information deposits," in our vehicles
  when they were infants. So, that means we had to come in during the late `20's and early `30's. We also had to come in
  and make deposits in the vehicles of all the classroom that are sitting here in front of me at the various times when
  those vehicles were infants. </p>
<p>Now, it's difficult to accept the information that I am telling you. If you knew how to interpret some of the
  religious documents that have been left for you, you would interpret them exactly as I am telling you. But it's not
  popular to do that - the lower forces would have you interpret that information, those documents, entirely
  differently. Because the lower forces (Satan, Lucifer, the fallen angels - all of those who are
  <strong>against</strong> the real Kingdom of God) <em>would have you not reach that Kingdom</em>. They are delighted
  to serve as your "god." They will give you the things that will make you happy <em>in this world</em>. If you want to,
  you can praise their name and ask for riches, or ask for anything that you want. They will give you the things that
  you want and make you feel good about it. It's even so popular today in religions to preach that, "God wants you to
  live an abundant life, so ask Him for what your needs are. He doesn't want you to be raggedy and poor." And of course,
  that's true, He doesn't. But that doesn't justify <strong>seeking a kingdom here, instead of seeking His Kingdom. You
    don't seek His Kingdom unless you seek to get out of this kingdom</strong>. You can't have both. His Kingdom is
  never going to coexist with the human kingdom. That's impossible. That would be like the humans getting down on their
  all-fours and existing with the dog kingdom, staying restricted to dog houses, and restricted to dog food, and
  restricted to dog behavior. It doesn't make any sense. Why would the Kingdom that <strong>made</strong> the human
  kingdom find fulfillment <em>in</em> the human kingdom? </p>
<p>Now, a remarkable thing exists - the most remarkable thing that you can possibly imagine, and that is - their design
  enabled them to make small "mental deposits" in human plants. We'll call those "deposits," for sake of understanding,
  the "<strong>soul</strong>." And those deposits are really like a small bit of Next Level "hardware" with capacity for
  Next Level information. That deposit/soul is not only a storehouse but a <strong>separator</strong> for information.
  And that deposit/soul comes with an initial bit of Next Level mind. And wherever the Next Level makes those <em>deposits
    of souls</em> in human plants, they contain a little bit of information that permits the recipient to actually <em>recognize</em>
  the kind of information that I am passing on to you. It even has the capacity to recognize the bearer (the
  Representative) of Next Level mind or information. </p>
<p>Even as you listen to me you might recognize me and that information, but the lower forces and your genetic
  programming says, "Oh, don't listen to that. Don't listen to that. That's horrible. That's the Anti-Christ. That's not
  God as I know it. That's something altogether different." I'm afraid that what you have been listening to - I'm not
  blaming you for listening to it, you hardly stood a chance - are the lower forces. These lower forces are so strong,
  that they have <em>brainwashed</em> and kept humans totally <em>intoxicated</em> at every level around the globe, so
  much so that they are totally preoccupied with: make money, put it in the bank, have more children, have more
  grandchildren, send them to college, leave plenty of "security" so that they can have a future, and their children can
  have a future. What does that yield? - <em>extending</em> the human kingdom, and <em>extending</em> the human kingdom,
  and <em>extending</em> the human kingdom, with no idea of the possibilities that exist beyond that. You say, "Oh yes,
  we go to church once in a while and we talk about Heaven, talk about the Kingdom of Heaven." But most people don't
  even want to touch the topic of the Kingdom of Heaven, because they don't really know what it is. They just have to
  have the faith that, "that's what I go to if I've been good, and I just have to trust that that's where I go." That
  doesn't make any sense. Well, you can say, "Why are you telling me it doesn't make any sense? That's where my trust
  is. That's where my faith is." <strong>I know that it is. It's not your fault</strong>. <em>I know</em> that's where
  your trust is, I know that's where your faith is. And <strong>I am desperate to give you help</strong> so that you can
  <strong>leave</strong> this place. </p>
<p>Now, three kinds of individuals can have a possible future with the Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Heaven. Oh, a few
  minutes ago I started to tell you about this remarkable design, and I've got to go back to it. This remarkable design
  is <em>what a soul can become</em>, and <em>how a soul can be deposited in a human vehicle</em>. Those deposits are
  made just prior to a Representative of the Kingdom Level Above Human coming into the human kingdom, taking a human
  body, and telling the truth about what the human kingdom really is, what the Kingdom Level Above Human really is, and
  giving that information a chance to build in those souls. Now, if a human plant has a soul, then that human plant has
  to <strong>find</strong> and <strong>connect with</strong> someone who is from that Kingdom Level. And since that
  Representative is here to try to help those get the information that can <em>lead them out</em> of the human kingdom,
  that individual is going to say, "<strong>I'm from the Kingdom of Heaven</strong>." Oh my goodness, how blasphemous
  can someone be to say, "I am from the Kingdom of Heaven." How else can a Representative offer anything if He doesn't
  identify who He is? He's saying, <em>"Do you want to go to Heaven? I'm here! I was <strong>sent here</strong> for the
    express purpose of helping you get to the Kingdom of Heaven."</em></p>
<p>Now, the remarkable little process that happens - if an individual who has that little deposit of soul hears that
  voice that says, "I'm from the Kingdom of Heaven, I can help you <strong>go</strong> to the Kingdom of Heaven," - then
  that individual experiences severe pain, and <strong>begins to break away from the world</strong>, and begins to go
  to, <strong>physically go to and be with that Representative from that Kingdom of Heaven</strong>. Knowing quite well
  that they are questioning all the time, "Is this really someone from the Kingdom of Heaven or from the Level Above
  Human? Because if it isn't, you know, I don't want to get caught up in some `cult.' I don't want to listen to somebody
  who could lead me astray. But if it is somebody from the Kingdom of Heaven, and if I've got that little bit of
  information in my head, then I'm going to have some awareness that there could be <em>some truth</em> in what that
  individual is saying, <em>who says</em> He is from the Kingdom of Heaven." </p>
<p>Don't forget, a couple of thousand years ago, there was a Representative from the Kingdom of Heaven or the
  Evolutionary Level Above Human, present, and He said, <em>`I am from the Kingdom of Heaven. Go and tell the Good
    News.'</em> He told His followers, <em>`Go tell the Good News that the Kingdom of Heaven is here.'</em> Meaning,
  `This is your chance, I'm here. I can take you out of here. I can lead you into that Kingdom Level Above Human.' But
  He also said, `That can't happen unless you leave the human world that you are in and come and follow Me. <strong>Come
    and follow Me</strong>.' That didn't mean on Sundays, it didn't mean part-time. It meant totally - `<strong>Leave
    everything and come and follow Me</strong>.' And you can say, "Well, my information says that's terrible." Well,
  check it out. Go read your New Testament. Go read the red letters in the New Testament. See what that Representative
  actually said, `<strong>Unless you leave everything and follow Me, unless you <em>hate</em> everything of this world
    and come and follow Me, you will not know My Father nor His Kingdom</strong>.' Go read it. It's long. It's thorough.
  It's remarkable that it's still there. I'm sure that the Level Above Human had to intercede because I'm sure that the
  lower forces would have, long ago, had that eliminated from documents that people would call religious documents or
  religious literature. </p>
<p>Every religion is <strong>less than</strong> the "Truth." <strong>It becomes a religion when it is less than the
  Truth</strong>. Now, every religion can prepare an individual to <strong>be more prepared</strong> for the time when a
  Representative from the Level Above Human comes in. So it's not like the Level Above Human is available only to
  whites, or blacks, or Jews, or Christians, or Muslims, or whatever the case might be. It's open to anyone who, when a
  Representative is present, <strong>chooses to leave all behind, follow that Representative, and "graft" to that
    Representative</strong>; and that graft grows as they take in more mind. Now, they're not really taking in the <em>mind
    of the Representative</em>, because the mind that is <em>in</em> the Representative is not <em>His</em> mind. The
  mind that comes <em>through</em> me is not my mind, it is the mind of my Older Member - we're in bad shape if it's
  <strong>my</strong> mind. It is mine because it was <strong>given</strong> to me by my Older Member, and by the
  Kingdom Level Above me - but it is not <strong>of</strong> me. I do not care for glory. I know that is the last thing
  that anyone would give to me on this planet, and I do not care for it. But I <strong>do</strong> care to glorify the
  Level Above Human. <strong>I care to glorify my Father who gave me life</strong>. It is hard for me to speak of that
  without weakening, as you can observe. </p>
<p>Okay, here's an individual who says, "I will break away from the world." Now breaking away from the world is not
  easy. It's difficult. It's tough. And breaking away doesn't mean that, I'm going to go live in some place with this
  little cult, and I'll spend time on weekends or at least on holidays with the family that I left, because they're my
  family. <em>No, it means that you leave that world behind. You even become another individual.</em> It means that even
  the "mind" that you had as a human is "aborted," and the soul that was given to you is filled with Next Level
  information - Next Level mind - and <em>a new creature is born</em>, one that is not human. Now, the mind that is
  filling that soul <strong>came from</strong> the Kingdom Level Above Human - the Kingdom of God. So that means that
  even what fills that soul came from that Kingdom. And therefore that new creature becomes something that is of, or
  even <strong>from</strong>, that Kingdom. It's the most interesting way that a creature comes into being. It's like
  how babies are made in the Kingdom Level Above Human - certainly not in mammalian ways, certainly not in acts that are
  abhorrent to them. </p>
<p>Now, that doesn't mean that it's "evil" to have an act of reproduction in the human kingdom - it's "evil" if I'm
  leaving the human kingdom, certainly. It is "evil" because it's barbaric, it's primitive, it's beneath me. The members
  in the Kingdom Level Above Human are not mammals - there are no males, there are no females. They don't need to
  consume things that require fangs or teeth. They can receive nourishment from a pill or a simple wave or vibration
  that they would walk through. The environment that they are in determines what the vehicle (or "suit of clothes") they
  are wearing for that task requires. Now don't forget, they identify as the mind - synonymous with spirit - they are
  not the "suit of clothes." But they wear physical "suits of clothes," and those physical suits of clothes look very
  much like - well I started to say like "extraterrestrials." However, most renditions by human artists of
  extraterrestrials are the most grotesque things that you can possibly imagine. They make them look like some praying
  mantis or some insect that has some crazy shape or form. And that's ridiculous. Next Level bodies are perfectly
  beautiful "suits of clothes." They are perfectly beautiful bodies - neither male nor female. They don't have hair that
  needs to be cut, they don't need to have curlers. They don't need to use makeup. It's a body that exists for the most
  part, in a non-destructive environment, except when it has to go to a place like planet Earth. So, it's potentially an
  <em>eternal body - an everlasting body</em>. </p>
<p>Now, I don't like to use terms like "everlasting," because, bingo, it sounds like I'm talking spiritual talk, or
  religious talk. Don't forget, religion is less than Truth. Spiritual talk is less than Truth. It is an <strong>abuse
    of Truth</strong> - it is a <strong>replacement for Truth</strong> that the lower forces have brought in. <strong>The
    more religious you are, the more you become dependent upon artificial information that would lead you away from the
    Truth</strong>. It's just like the rituals, and the prayers, and the trappings that go with religion - they can be
  so addictive, they can be so soothing, they can be so calming that they feel so wonderful. And to drop those things
  for a reality that is a Kingdom Level Above Human, <em>that does not need those things,</em> is a difficult thing to
  do. It is as difficult to drop religious trappings as it is to drop attachments that the plant that you are wearing
  had - those attachments to offspring or to spouse or to the parents of those plants. </p>
<p>The funny thing is, that in reality, those human parents do not <strong>possess</strong> the offspring they have. It
  is a very "evil" thing for them to think that their offspring are <em>theirs</em>, that they are products of theirs,
  property of theirs. Rather than wanting for that spirit, that mind (that is in that body that they supplied for that
  mind or spirit) to become what it wants to become, the humans are programmed by the alien forces, or the space aliens,
  or the negative creatures, to have you believe that children owe their parents or that parents possess their children.
  That is not true. It is cruel to even think that way. The more Next Level way of thinking is to want that individual
  to have their life, and not to be selfish and say, "Well, I brought you into this world. I want to <em>cling</em> to
  you. You <em>owe</em> me." That doesn't hold up. They didn't ask you to bring them in to the world. Is there some
  document that says that child owes its parent? Now the parent <em>is responsible</em> for the child, because the
  parent made the choice of creating (reproducing or replicating) another plant. And since they made that choice, or
  they took an action - oh, yes, we get down to that don't we - reproduction, human reproduction. </p>
<p>Boy, the worst thing you can imagine is for humans to be taught by these space aliens - even using their religions
  and their government morality to teach them - that the act of reproduction is a God-given, wonderful thing. It's
  God-given in the sense that dogs and horses came from God. Everything came from the Kingdom of Heaven, including
  humans and human reproductive systems. But what the Kingdom Above Human, the Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Heaven
  <em>wants</em> is to <em>offer you their Kingdom</em>, which they very systematically do, periodically. But it
  requires that when they do, you <em>listen</em> to them, and that you <em>do</em> what they require if you want to get
  out of the human kingdom. And to get out of the human kingdom requires that you <em>leave</em> the human kingdom, and
  go and <em>follow someone who can lead you to the Kingdom Level Above Human</em>. </p>
<p>Now, I told you a little while ago, that there are pretty much three types of individuals that can avoid the spading
  under at the end of an Age. <em>One would, of course, be those souls that were deposited, and those souls were
    awakened, and those souls received nourishment, and left everything behind, and became attached to - grafted to - a
    Representative from the Level Above Human, and separated from everything</em>. Now, I've got a bunch of these
  individuals sitting in front of me who, I may be mistaken, but I don't believe that any of them had the beginning of
  their Next Level life in <em>this</em> time period - in this generation. I know that every one of them were <em>in the
    keeping</em> of the Kingdom Level Above Human <em>before</em> they came into this time period. This time period was
  a chance for them to learn a lot of things that they didn't learn very well, or didn't get a chance to complete, or
  needed to work on more, as far as <em>separating</em> from the human kingdom. They are having an opportunity to
  develop that more, so that they don't have to be planted back in a human garden in another time - so that they can
  move into the Kingdom Level Above Human, take on costumes, or suits of clothes, or bodies that belong to that Kingdom,
  and serve and do their work in that Kingdom Level Above Human. </p>
<p>You know, I can hear some of those humans who are watching this tape now saying, "Oh my goodness, if I did what you
  would do, I would not even be a humanitarian. I would be forsaking my responsibility to the human kingdom." <strong>You
    have to forsake the human kingdom if you expect to ever know service in the Kingdom Level Above Human</strong>. You
  can't do both. You can't say, you know, "12 hours a day I'll work for the human kingdom, and the other 12 hours I'll
  work for the Kingdom Level Above Human." No, <em>to leave the human kingdom requires everything you have</em>. </p>
<p>A second type is one who <em>recognizes the Representative, recognizes the information</em> of the Next Level that
  is coming through the Representative, <em>knows it is true</em>, and has not yet had the strength to complete it. This
  type still <em>trusts</em> the Next Level, still <em>believes</em> that that is the only Truth, and <em>whatever faith
    they have and trust they have, that's where it is</em>. And they will be kept in the keeping of the Kingdom Level
  Above Human, and <em>replanted</em> at another time, and given another chance. </p>
<p>However, even though that Kingdom Level is fair, just because someone with a deposit of soul comes to them, is no
  guarantee they will get to the Kingdom Level Above Human. When they come, they can apply their effort toward change to
  the best of their (big question mark on this next word) ability or capability. It takes a lot of effort. And even <em>your
    effort</em> cannot get you there. You have to please your Older Member. <strong>I also had to, and have to, please
    my Older Member</strong>. When I first took <em>my</em> birth into that Kingdom Level, it was because I pleased my
  Teacher - my Older Member - the one who gave me birth into that Kingdom. No matter how hard I work, that work is of no
  value if it doesn't <em>please</em> my Older Member, the one who took me into that Kingdom. That is still true. In
  other words, this classroom here not only has to <em>please me</em>, they have to <em>please my Older Member</em>. So,
  just because they're sitting here, having left their world behind, does not mean that they will receive a body or suit
  of clothes belonging to that Next Level. </p>
<p>Okay, let's say they try to the best of their ability, and according to the Next Level's judgment they're not quite
  ready for a body of service, belonging to that Kingdom Level. If they did the best that they could, and they still
  pleased their teacher and pleased their teacher's Teacher, then they will have a future. They'll be replanted, have
  another time for a Representative to come into the human kingdom, and have that nourishment. Now that's the second
  type. So one is the type of soul that becomes a new creature, is ready to go into the Kingdom Level Above Human,
  receive a body, begin service. Two, is one who is in the process of that but doesn't quite make "quartermaster" - not
  quite ready to have a body because of more work that needs to happen as far as separating from human. We'll talk later
  about some of the work that is required in separating. </p>
<p>There is a side issue to the Next Level's presence that is a very interesting phenomena. During the time that the
  Next Level is close to a planet because they have a Representative there, and they are communicating continually with
  that Representative, then there is <strong>mind</strong> of the Next Level present that even the lower forces can tap
  and take advantage of, and increase a broad scope of their knowledge and their technical advancement, etc. Now, how
  long has the Next Level been here with me and my Older Member? Since the early `20's. Well, think of the advancement
  that has taken place on the planet, as far as technical advancement and scientific development since the early `20's,
  because that presence was here that <em>all</em> creatures could draw upon and use, including lower creatures who are
  here who don't believe that they want to go to my Father's Kingdom at all. They want to remain human. </p>
<p>Okay, back to the three types: One, those ready for quartermaster; two, those not quite ready, and <em>the third
  type: those who recognize the information of the Next Level and are attempting, even without knowing of the
  Representative's presence, to break away in their own way</em>. Now, when they attempt to break away in their own way,
  not even aware that I'm here or that my Older Member has been here at this particular time, they somehow or another
  find themselves drawn to others who are breaking away. They are also finding themselves surrounded with an opposite
  type of people who say, "What's wrong with you guys? Are you crazy? You're leaving your career? You're not paying
  attention to your children?" This is happening a lot. Many people are going into what the mainstream likes to call
  "cults" - they are <strong>breaking away</strong>. People who love their God so, in their own way, that they end up
  like what happened with Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, what happened at Waco, what happens in nations that, even in their
  government, want to honor God - listen to God - entirely, instead of taking man's laws, man's requirements, man's
  rules. <em>They are <strong>breaking away</strong>. They are conscious that there is some presence of God here and are
    saying, "I want to go in that direction. I'll even put my life on the line in order to get closer to God at this
    time."</em></p>
<p>I am not qualified to specifically tell you who all these various types are. But I've given you some illustrations.
  It's like even in patriot movements, or in militia movements, or in "cults," or in this type of religious radical or
  another who know that this world is rotten, they are saying, "I would rather die in service to my interpretation of
  what God is than stay here." <em>Those young souls, those young spirits, those minds will be saved. They will be set
    aside - "put on ice," so to speak - and have a <strong>future</strong>, have another planting in the next
    civilization for further nourishment.</em></p>
<p>What does this add up to? This adds up to that the ones who love this world and love the human kingdom, say to me
  and all those like me (or all those I just discussed - all those various categories) that, "They're nuts, they're
  crazy. They're radicals. They're against the world. They are not human - they're inhumane. They're tyrannical or their
  terrorists." Now, don't misunderstand me. I'm not advocating violence. I'm not advocating going out and trying to
  create some war. The war that is a <em>natural phenomenon</em> that comes with the End of an Age, is <em>forced
    upon</em> those who want to leave this place. It's not anything that we have to do or we have to create. And some,
  aware that that will happen - even some who want to get to the Kingdom Level Above Human - mistakenly feel responsible
  for creating those wars. They don't have all the pieces right. But if they are doing it for the right reasons, not me,
  but my Father and my Father's Father, and the Kingdom Level Above Human says, "They love me more than they love the
  world. And they love me more than they love the world during the time that I have a Representative present. And I will
  honor that. I will extract them. I will put them aside. I will give them a planting at another time." </p>
<p>Well, you know, one of the things that disturbs me the most is that those who are very religious, by whatever name,
  are usually those who had been <strong>recipients of souls</strong>, recipients of a little bit of Next Level
  information, a little deposit from the Kingdom Level Above Human. And the lower forces were aware of that. And so the
  lower forces do <em>everything they can</em> to keep those individuals from ever knowing the Kingdom of God. So they
  come in and offer those recipients their version of the "Kingdom of God" through their religion, but it's totally
  <strong>counterfeit</strong>. It's totally <strong>false</strong>. It's concerned with healing your cancer, healing
  this that's wrong, fixing your pocketbook, or making your business right, or doing all the things <strong>to extend
    your life here</strong> - and above all, tend to that family, tend to that "future," tend to all the things that
  will leave a future for our children. If that's your preoccupation, you cannot know the Kingdom of Heaven and you will
  have <strong>no</strong> future. If you love the Kingdom of Heaven, or the Kingdom of God, or the Level Above Human,
  by whatever terms are in your head, and you hate this world and want to leave it, you <strong>will</strong> have a
  future with and in the very Kingdom Level that created you. </p>
<p>Don't forget we are at a very unusual time - we're at the End of an Age. You can say, "Boy, you're really trying to
  fill me with fear, aren't you?" If it would work, I would. I would do anything that I could to wake you up, if you
  have that potential to know that Kingdom, to be saved from this spading under, from this recycling. I mean, I don't
  care for any of the fame or glory of the human world. It's absolutely worthless to me. I can't wait to get out of
  here. There's nothing this planet, or this civilization, or this kingdom level has to offer me. I am away from my
  Father to be here. <em>Anything that I could sacrifice in this world is no sacrifice at all compared to what I
    sacrificed in leaving there to come here, to try to help those who were given to me as a task.</em> I apologize for
  being so emotional but that happens to be the Truth. I want to leave here. Now, I'm in a vehicle that is already
  falling apart on me, and I'm desperate to try to help you have a last chance to go. </p>
<p>Let's go back to title of tape. Title of tape is "Last Chance to Evacuate Planet Earth"- to get <strong>out</strong>
  of the human kingdom, get <strong>off</strong> of the planet, <strong>leave it literally</strong>. Now, "leave it
  literally" means - well, what is literal - that leaving requires that you start <em>identifying with the mind</em>
  that can connect with this information, and not identify with the body that you are wearing. And that you take
  advantage of everything that you can to learn more of this information, become more connected with it, and to follow
  it like sheep would follow a shepherd, in an attempt to leave this place. </p>
<p>So, I hate the lower forces who have taken the very Truths that were <em>initially the Truths</em>, and have reduced
  them to "religion," and they made the religions more attractive and more human, so that those who had deposits and
  were seeking the presence of a Representative of the Kingdom Level Above Human, would, when He came, be looking for
  the wrong one - the one who would bring "peace on Earth." Here we are at the End of the Age, and you've got a whole
  world full of many, many types who say, "We're coming to the End of an Age, we're coming to the Second Coming, we're
  coming to the time that Jesus is coming back, or that the Kingdom of Heaven is coming - and His Son is going to set up
  His Kingdom here on Earth, and Earth will then be <em>Heaven</em>." This will never happen. You wouldn't have it even
  if it happened. Once you knew what it was, you couldn't stand it. You cannot cling to being a mammal, connected with
  other mammals, and expect to get into a level of life that is beyond mammal. Now, you can search the documents of your
  religions right now and they clearly tell you that in Heaven there are - there will be - no males and no females (it
  is genderless). It is not a mammalian existence, it is not a human existence. And those documents also clearly tell
  you that you have to leave everything of the human world in order to know that Next World or ever see that Kingdom of
  Heaven. </p>
<p>Well, once more, the awful thing that happens, from your perspective, when the Level Above Human comes into the
  human kingdom and incarnates into a human body, is that the Representative whom they send has to say - in order to
  find followers - "I'm here. I'm from the Kingdom Level Above Human." What does that yield? That yields, immediately,
  that the vast majority say, "cult, some religious radical, some blasphemous individual that wants to take advantage of
  people - you know, has some big bank account somewhere that they're taking whatever possessions that followers might
  bring with them or have access to." I wish you'd show me where that bank account is so that we could use it to get
  this information out. </p>
<p>I don't mean to make fun of this. I am desperate - for your sakes. Within the past 24 hours I have been clearly
  informed by my Older Member of how short the remaining time is; how clearly we cannot concentrate on anything except
  the perspective that says: <strong>the end of this civilization is very close</strong>. The end of a civilization is
  accompanied by spading under, refurbishing the planet in preparation for another civilization. And the only ones who
  can survive that experience have to be those who are taken into the keeping of the Evolutionary Level Above Human.
</p>
<p>Now, there are some strange possibilities that could happen that I have not touched upon. How is this end of
  civilization going to occur? Well, I don't know all the particulars. Talk to the people who talk about earthquakes,
  and talk about weather phenomena, and talk about ozone layers. And talk to environmental people and they'll say,
  "Well, the planet is in trouble in that area." Talk about the way that people no longer are restrained nor do they
  have respect for their neighbors. They're so unrestrained that if you just say something that makes them unhappy, they
  start throwing rocks at you, and the next thing you know you've got a neighborhood war, you've got a little ethnic war
  in this nation or that. And there's so little restraint that these little groups, these little ethnic groups, these
  little religious groups, these little governments that are in conflict - they seem to be doing a significant amount of
  the <em>spading under</em> themselves. They seem to, by choice, be so quick to condemn others. Well, what is it that's
  in the history books about the Truth? It says: be careful not to condemn someone else or you will be condemned. That
  doesn't mean anything anymore - everyone is quick to condemn. I mean they don't even "look-see" anymore. They just see
  a tiny little aspect of someone else and they quickly determine that they are so brilliant that they can judge it as
  being not what they are looking for - worthless, some radical movement, some movement that certainly is beneath them.
  Well, that is making hasty judgments - that kind of quick-to-condemn-others attitude, that kind of violence that wants
  to destroy others. </p>
<p>You know, the world and its majority have created laws that try to keep individuals like us non-existent, because we
  threaten the system that the major systems exist on. You could say, "What if everybody in the world left their
  families and came and followed Do?" Well, you don't have to worry about that - that's not going to happen. You know,
  only a tiny, tiny little fraction of the plants that are on the planet would ever be able to make that transition from
  the human kingdom to the Kingdom of Heaven. It's the same in regard to giving up human ways. You could say, "Well,
  what if everyone gave up their human and mammalian reproductive activity - there wouldn't be any humans left." Oh,
  then you don't believe that the Kingdom Level Above Human is capable of producing individuals? That they can't
  <strong>create or make them</strong>? That they are dependent upon the human reproductive activity? You sure don't
  give them credit for much. They made the very first ones here. They even designed them with a capacity to reproduce.
  If humans didn't reproduce, the Next Level could make as many as they want to. They always have been able to do that.
  They're not dependent upon humans for anything. </p>
<p>Well, I know this could sound strange, but I wish you could believe me. Why do I wish that you could believe me?
  Because if you really <strong>believed me</strong>, you would <strong>look at</strong> what we have to say. You know,
  this little classroom of students who are about to move into the Level Above Human, following me out of here - and
  we're going to leave quickly - are doing everything they can do to be non-human. That doesn't mean that they are
  uncaring. They are more sensitive than you can imagine. They are more caring than you can imagine. The qualities that
  they have exceed anything of your imagination - because they have listened to and taken in information of the Next
  Level enough that they believe it and it has become a part of them. <strong>And it means everything to them</strong>.
  They know that by separating from the world that the vehicles that they are wearing - the plants that they are wearing
  - caused grief for individuals. There's another aspect to that: the Kingdom Level Above Human also sees to it that
  none of those lives that were touched by that separation were damaged. They may be temporarily hurt. That doesn't mean
  they are damaged. A lot of times - or all of the time - that kind of hurt <em>can</em> lead to a greater positive for
  the individual who experiences the pain of that separation. </p>
<p>Well, I started to tell you a minute or two ago, that we created recently a website on Internet - one called
  "Heavensgate." We have put into Heavensgate just about everything we have to say, as far as we are capable. The time
  I'm sitting with you is a tiny little fragment of time. I couldn't tell you all the things I know if we sat for days
  and days and days. But if you want to know more about us, if you can believe what I am telling you and you want to
  know more about it, you can go to Heavensgate on the Internet. You can pull down all kinds of stuff that we have
  written, things that we have done, things about our history. We even have a book that is available to you - I'm not
  going to spend time now trying to sell you some book. But there is a book available that you can find on the
  Heavensgate website. </p>
<p>I don't want to take away from the seriousness of the moment, because I am concerned that time is short. Again, the
  topic of this tape is: Last chance to evacuate the human kingdom - planet Earth - to get out of this space so that
  this garden can be recycled. I hope for your sake that you have a degree of curiosity about what I have said on this
  tape, so that you will look a little deeper. If you condemn me thoroughly and call me the Anti- Christ or whatever you
  want to call me, it's not going to hurt me. It's going to hurt you. If you condemn us, you will be condemned. Nothing
  can hurt us. The thing that we could experience here that would be the most horrible thing, from your point of view,
  would serve to help us get back to the Kingdom Level Above Human more quickly, and that's what we desire to do. </p>
<p>I know that the presentation of this little tape is not what I would call skilled or polished. It doesn't have the
  things that humans like to see in their presentations. But I know that it has the Truth. And <em>that any of you who
    have a <strong>fragment of Truth in you can connect with that Truth</strong></em>. And if you <em>pursue</em> that
  Truth, you don't have to worry about what is going to happen, for you will have a future. <em>You will be in the
    keeping of the Kingdom Level Above Human.</em> This I desperately, for your sake, hope you take advantage of. And
  what happens to those who respond to us - one way or the other - is all a part of the spading under, even what may
  happen to us as a result of this little tape, or whatever subsequent things that we do in relationship to you between
  now and our departure. </p>
<p>I hope that you take advantage of this. I hope that I have been a servant of the Next Level, and that you might
  somehow come to know the Next Level through this meager effort.</p>
