<a><u>DEFINING THE PROTOCOL</u></a><p>

  <a>The MUFON Medical Committee defined a simplified set of instructions for field investigators to use when they are
    involved in a UFO investigation involving effects on or injuries to the witness. These instructions are contained in
    Chapter XVII of the <u>MUFON Field Investigator's Manual</u>, Fourth Edition, published February 1995, where they
    serve as a guide to help investigators secure vital medical information promptly in cases where injuries of any kind
    may have been caused by a UFO close encounter, including abductions. In every case, the medical help provided to the
    victim, patient, or client should be foremost in priority in the investigator's mind.</a></p><p>

  <a name="obtaining"> <u>Obtaining Medical Consultant Assistance</u><br> The medical evidence is an extremely important
    part of the UFO investigation. For this reason it is necessary to assure this valuable information is not lost or
    tainted. Immediately upon finding evidence of medical injury, no matter how insignificant it may seem, the field
    investigator should contact the MUFON headquarters in Seguin, Texas for assistance by the nearest MUFON Medical
    Consultant.</a></p><p>

  <a name="evidence"> <u>Handling of Medical Evidence</u><br> Proper handling of the witness (victim) is of utmost
    importance. The field investigator must note the exact condition of the witness, documenting the first and
    subsequent meetings with audio recording, photographs, and video recording if -possible. If there is any doubt about
    the extent of the injuries, the witness should be advised to seek medical help immediately. Once the MUFON Medical
    Consultant is involved, he/she can discuss the case with the on-site medical specialist.</a></p><p>

  <a name="injuries"> <u>Medical Injuries Defined</u><br> Medical injuries may or may not be readily noticeable. In
    addition, the injuries may range from minor, which are difficult to detect, to extreme and easy to detect. When
    defining what constitutes a medical injury, it is important to consider anything that affects the physiological or
    psychological well-being of the witness.</a></p><p>

  <a name="injuries">A listing of the more obvious effects of interest to UFO Medical researchers includes: feeling of
    heat, field effects (hair stands on end), disorientation, time loss, pain, headache, paralysis, marks on skin, burns
    (first, second and third degree), lumps, bumps, growths, sores, loss of appetite, diarrhea, lethargy, eye problems,
    hair loss/gain, tooth damage/decay, psychological problems, and paranormal effects.</a></p><p>

  <a name="injuries">There are often hidden effects as well. The witness may not even consider that the hidden effects
    are related to the incident. Therefore, without leading the witness, the investigator should determine whether or
    not hidden evidence such as unusual feelings, strange dreams, development of possibly related problems such as
    cancer or heart trouble develop in the days, weeks, or months following the incident. At times the hidden evidence
    is so devastating that the witness focuses on the medical problem without ever thinking of the UFO incident
    again.</a></p><p>

  <a name="injuries">Medical effects may result from abduction events as well as close encounter events. The
    investigator should be alert to medical evidence caused by the abductors, including but not limited to, medical
    examinations, insertion of needles or other devices into the body, implants, and reactions to the technological
    devices used by the abductors. In the case of abductions, MUFON headquarters will also alert MUFON Abduction
    Consultants.</a></p><p>

  <a name="reporting"> <u>Reporting the Evidence</u><br> Every step in the medical investigation should be thoroughly
    documented. No information is considered inconsequential. The exact description of the injury or condition should be
    recorded without interruption or interpretation. Often the witness is confused or frightened, making it difficult to
    understand exactly what has happened. This condition is often worsened by their having to talk to a UFO
    investigator. Nevertheless, it is important to capture the exact feelings and words of the witness.</a></p><p>

  <a name="reporting">The investigator may want to add a separate section of the report giving his/her feelings about
    the extent of the medical problem. Unless the investigator has medical training, however, it is possible that these
    observations may be biased or totally incorrect.</a></p><p>

  <a name="reporting">Visible injuries such as burns, rashes, cuts, bruises, needle marks, discolorations, hair loss, or
    eye problems should be documented on videotape and film. Still photographs should be taken using a close up lens as
    well as panoramic views.</a></p><p>

  <a name="reporting">If obvious injuries are present, the investigator should recommend prompt medical attention. If
    the witness has already seen a physician, obtain the name, address and telephone number of the physician. Report
    that information to the MUFON Medical Consultant. The investigator should not attempt to gain access to private
    medical records until assisted by a medical expert. The MUFON Medical Consultant assigned to the case will provide
    information on how to obtain the appropriate medical records and the proper use of release forms. A minimal set of
    records would include admitting records, all treatments and tests with results, nursing notes, and specialists
    records.</a></p><p>

  <a name="categories"> <u>Categories of Injuries</u><br> Injuries as defined by the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual
    are placed in one of four categories:<br> CATEGORY 1: Those injuries of a temporary nature, dealing with paralysis,
    dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headache, tingling sensations, electrical shocks, feeling of heat, temporary blindness,
    mild burns, perception of odors, and perception of sounds.<br> CATEGORY 2: Those dealing with the more chronic
    effects usually associated with skin lesions, which may represent pathology through unknown mechanisms. Lesions may
    appear as severe burns, scarring, open sores, etc. Effects of radiation exposure may result in the development of
    cancers, anemia or the like.<br> CATEGORY 3: Those involving female abductees and the missing fetus syndrome and
    those involving implants.<br> CATEGORY 4: Those involving psychological or paranormal evidence as noted by the
    witness.</a></p><p>

  <a name="evaluation"> <u>Evaluation of Injuries</u><br> The extent of the injuries will determine the extent of the
    testing necessary in any given case. However, in cases of extreme medical injury, the MUFON Medical Consultant would
    like to see the results of the following tests. Where it has been determined that the witness was exposed to some
    type of radiation, it may be necessary to repeat a number of the tests at specific intervals.</a></p><p>

</p>
<ul>
  <li><a name="evaluation">WEIGHT: The witness should be weighed at the beginning of the medical investigation and at
    specific intervals until full recovery. Comparisons with documented weight evaluations prior to the UFO event should
    be made also.<br> </a></li><li><a name="evaluation">VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration and
  temperature. In many cases an Electrocardiogram would be helpful.<br> </a></li><li><a name="evaluation">BLOOD-FORMING
  FUNCTION: Specimen: Whole blood. Tests: Complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelet evaluation including
  white cell count (WBC), red cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (HBC), packed cell volume or hematocrit (HCT), and other
  desired erythrocyte indices. Reticulocyte count may be appropriate if there is a likelihood of exposure to hemolytic
  agents. The blood smear should be saved for possible future study. A sample of serum should be frozen for future study
  and comparison. This can be especially important when trying to determine exposure to infectious agents that may be
  ascertained sometimes only by measuring changes in antibody titers compared to an earlier specimen.<br> </a></li><li>
  <a name="evaluation">KIDNEY FUNCTION: Specimen: Blood serum. Tests: Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and uric
    acid.<br> </a></li>
  <li><a name="evaluation">LIVER FUNCTION:<br> </a>
    <ol><li type="a"><a name="evaluation">General Function - Specimen: Blood serum. Tests: Albumin, bilirubin, globulin,
      and total protein.<br> </a></li><li><a name="evaluation">Obstruction - Specimen: Blood enzyme. Test: Alkaline
      phosphatase.<br> </a></li><li><a name="evaluation">Cell Injury - Specimen: Blood enzyme. Tests: Gamma glutamyl
      transpeptidase (GGDP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), and serum
      glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT).</a></li></ol>
  </li>
  <li><a name="evaluation">MULTIPLE SYSTEMS AND ORGANS: Specimen: Urine. Tests: Analysis including color, appearance,
    specific gravity, pH, qualitative glucose, protein, bile, keytone bodies, and microscopic examination of centrifuged
    sediment. Specimen: Stool. Test: Occult blood.<br> </a></li><li><a name="evaluation">SKIN LESIONS: Document
  erythema, swelling, redness, and blister formation. Test: Skin biopsy. Search for and collect specimens of any
  possible contaminants. Specimen: Skin scraping. Scrape into collecting bottle.<br> </a></li><li><a name="evaluation">HAIR
  LOSS: Test for heavy metals: Lead, arsenic and mercury. Look for dissolution of intercellular bridges.<br> </a></li>
  <li><a name="evaluation">FINGERNAIL SHEDDING: Document loss of fingernails (Onychomadesis).<br> </a></li><li><a
    name="evaluation">CHEST X-RAY: A standard chest x-ray should be taken.<br> </a></li>
  <li><a name="evaluation">OB-GYN: Ob-Gyn history, including: <br> </a>
    <ol><li type="a"><a name="evaluation"> Number of full-term deliveries <br> </a></li><li><a name="evaluation"> Number
      of pre-term deliveries <br> </a></li><li><a name="evaluation"> Number of spontaneous or elective abortions <br>
    </a></li><li><a name="evaluation"> Number of living children.</a></li></ol>
    <a name="evaluation">Also important: Date of last menstrual period, any method of birth control being used, and a
      serum pregnancy test. Physical symptoms of pelvic bloating or cramping could be present if some type of
      laparascopic procedure was performed. </a></li>
