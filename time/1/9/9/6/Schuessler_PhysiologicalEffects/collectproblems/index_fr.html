<p>Until recently, the collection of information
related to human physiological effects in UFO cases was of secondary
interest to investigators. The primary focus of investigations was on
information about when and where the event occurred and a description
of the UFO itself. This was generally true except in cases where
extreme medical effects were evident.</p>
<p> For many years the medical practitioners having a
  UFO interest desired to work only as an "invisible college;" therefore,
  they were not accessible to UFO investigators in general. As a result,
  the only time a significant amount of medical data was collected was
  when the injury left the witness incapacitated, demanding medical
  treatment and the investigator was aware of it.</p>
<p> Usually the witnesses requiring medical treatment
  were treated in a text-book fashion for their malady (i.e. eye
  injuries, burned skin, skin lesions, etc.) by their family doctor or
  local hospital staff. These practitioneers usually were unaware that
  the patient was harmed during a UFO encounter and would not have
  believed it they had been told.</p>
<p> It was common for victims of UFO encounters to
  suffer alone. The press seldom took these cases seriously and the
  public giggle-factor made the risk of speaking out more difficult than
  most people could stomach.</p>
<p> To make matters worse, a protocol for UFO
  investigators to follow was not well defined or generally available. A
  lack of cooperation between the various UFO organizations left the data
  stranded in private files everywhere, inaccessible to other
  researchers. As a result, most cases involving physiological effects
  were insufficiently investigated and poorly monitored following the
  basic investigation.</p>
