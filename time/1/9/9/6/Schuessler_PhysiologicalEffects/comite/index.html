<p>The rapidly growing list of MUFON volunteers includes several hundred consultants and research specialists holding
  doctorates and masters degrees in their educational fields of expertise which are applicable to UFO research. Included
  in this list are individuals qualified to handle the medical issues; which includes the fields of Anesthesiology,
  Dentistry, Dental Surgery, Endocrinology, Gynecology, Hematology, Medical Microbiology, Medicine, Orthodontics,
  Pathology, Pediatrics, Pharmacy, Physiology, Plastic Surgery, Psychiatry, Radiation, and Veterinary Medicine.</p>
<p>In <time>1991</time>, MUFON formed a Medical Committee and I served as the MUFON administrator for the group. The
  purpose of the committee was to draw researchers in all of the above fields into an ad hoc group to establish an
  operating protocol, collect and evaluate case data, deal with the medical evidence, and provide an information
  exchange for the organization. Diagnosis and treatment are not a part of this Committee's charter.</p>
