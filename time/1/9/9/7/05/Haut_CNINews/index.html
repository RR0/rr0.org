<p class="abstract">But Eyewitness Jesse Marcel Says Debris Was Not Balloon</p>
<p><span class="people">Kent Jeffrey</span>, an airline pilot who wrote and energetically promoted the Roswell
  Declaration, an international petition calling for an end to government secrecy on UFOs, has decided that the <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/index.html">Roswell UFO case</a> does not involve an alien
  spacecraft as he once assumed. </p>
<p>In an interview on <em>KTVU-TV news</em> (<em>FOX Channel 2</em> in Oakland, California) on April 23, 1997, <span
    class="people">Jeffrey</span> said that after four years of investigation, his conclusions about the Roswell case
  are "a major disappointment for me.</p>
<p><q>I started out here in a quest for the truth</q>, he said. <q>Unfortunately, that truth ended up to be different
  than I thought it might be and hoped that it would be</q>. </p>
<p><span class="people">Jeffrey</span> was instrumental in getting Roswell witness <a
    href="/people/m/MarcelJesseJunior/index.html">Jesse Marcel, Jr.</a>, a Montana-based physician, to undergo some six
  hours of hypnotic regression recently in an effort to reconstruct exactly what he saw when his father, Major <a
      href="/people/m/MarcelJesseA/index.html">Jesse Marcel Sr.</a>, showed him pieces of debris from the famous <a
      href="/people/b/BrazelWilliamWare/index.html">Brazel</a> ranch crash site in <a
      href="../../../../4/7/07/index.html">July, 1947</a>. Young Jesse was only eleven years old at the time. </p>
<p><span class="people">Jeffrey</span> told KTVU that, for him, the veracity of the flying saucer claim stands or falls
  with Marcel's testimony. <q>In a sense, you could say that the keys to the <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/index.html">Roswell event</a> lie in his [<a
      href="/people/m/MarcelJesseA/index.html">Marcel</a>'s] memory banks</q>, <span class="people">Jeffrey</span> said.
</p>
<p><q><a href="/people/m/MarcelJesseA/index.html">Marcel</a>'s</q> regression session was conducted by <a
    href="/org/us/ic/fbi/index.html">FBI</a> hypnotist Neil Hibbler in Washington, DC. Though videotapes of the sessions
  have not been released, one person to whom <span class="people">Kent Jeffrey</span> showed the videos told CNI News
  that <a href="/people/m/MarcelJesseA/index.html">Marcel</a> did not reveal anything that he has not said before.</p>
<p> But in <span class="people">Jeffrey</span>'s opinion, <a href="/people/m/MarcelJesseA/index.html">Marcel</a>'s
  hypnotically recovered testimony supports the claim that the wreckage found on <a
      href="/people/b/BrazelWilliamWare/index.html">Brazel</a>'s ranch came, not from a <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/FlyingSaucers.html">flying saucer</a>, but from a top secret <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/Mogul/index.html">Mogul</a> <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon/index.html">balloon</a>. </p>
<p>Also noted in the KTVU story is the fact that <a href="/people/h/HautWalterG/index.html">Walter Haut</a>, former
  press officer for the 509th Bomb Wing at Roswell AAF who issued the famous July 8, 1947 press release claiming
  recovery of a flying disc, now says he had learned a few days after the announcement that <q>it was a screwup</q>.
  Though widely quoted in recent years as believing an unusual craft had been recovered, the FOX news story showed <a
      href="/people/h/HautWalterG/index.html">Haut</a> saying he thinks it was just a <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon/index.html">balloon</a>. </p>
<p><a href="/people/h/HautWalterG/index.html">Haut</a> was one of the original founders of the International UFO Museum
  in Roswell, New Mexico, but has now cut all ties with the museum. Current museum director Deon Crosby told <em>CNI
    News</em> that <a href="/people/h/HautWalterG/index.html">Haut</a> has referred to the UFO claims as <q>just a bunch
    of hooey." </q></p>
<p>However, other researchers point out that <a href="/people/h/HautWalterG/index.html">Haut</a> never claimed any
  direct access to wreckage or other evidence of the crash and was only following orders when he wrote the "flying disk"
  press release. </p>
<p><a href="/people/m/MarcelJesseA/index.html">Marcel</a>, on the other hand, did see something real from the crash, and
  despite <span class="people">Kent Jeffrey</span>'s apparent change of heart, Marcel himself still thinks there was
  more to Roswell than a <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon/index.html">balloon</a>. </p>
<p>Reached by phone on April 29, <a href="/people/m/MarcelJesseA/index.html">Marcel</a> told <em>CNI News</em>, <q>The
  [hypnosis] session was interesting, but it sure didn't change my mind. My recollections are the same.</q></p>
<p><a href="/people/m/MarcelJesseA/index.html">Marcel</a> said he is aware of several clear discrepancies between the
  material he saw as a child and the material said to come from the Mogul balloon.</p>
<p><q>I was just going over some pictures of the Mogul balloon device and trying to fit that into the pattern of the
  debris I saw,</q> he told <em>CNI News</em>. Referring to controversial embossed symbols on a small <q>I-beam</q>,
  which researcher <a href="/people/p/PflockKarlT/index.html">Karl Pflock</a> identified as coming from a kind of
  adhesive tape used in <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/Mogul/index.html">Mogul</a>, <a
      href="/people/m/MarcelJesseA/index.html">Marcel</a> stated: <q>The figures that they used were on cellophane tape,
    which is about an inch wide. This is far larger than what I saw</q>.</p>
<p><a href="/people/m/MarcelJesseA/index.html">Marcel</a> also commented on the strange symbols. <q>I looked at some of
  the drawings of the letters and flower-like images [from the Mogul tape] and I just don't recall anything close to
  that</q>. What he saw <q>wasn't flower-like, it was more geometric designs</q>, he said.</p>
<p> In the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/Mogul/index.html">Mogul</a> explanation, the <q>I-beam</q> itself is described as
  stick of balsawood. But <a href="/people/m/MarcelJesseA/index.html">Marcel</a> says that's not what he saw and handled
  in 1947. </p>
<p><q>It was very light, like balsawood, but I recall metal, not wood. I've built a lot of model airplanes out of
  balsawood, and I think I would recognize the difference. I'm going to stick to my memory. I remember these beams as
  metal and not balsawood.</q></p>
<p>He also noted that <q>the foil they used on the [Mogul] radar target was paper-backed foil, and the foil I saw was
  not paper-backed.</q></p>
<p><a href="/people/m/MarcelJesseA/index.html">Marcel</a> told CNI News that he considers <span class="people">Kent Jeffrey</span>
  a close friend, and he's not sure why <span class="people">Jeffrey</span> has now done a <q>180-degree turnaround</q>
  on Roswell. Regardless, Marcel still thinks the debris he saw was stranger than anything from a Mogul balloon.</p>
