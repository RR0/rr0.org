<p>As soon as word got out that I, coordinator of the IRI and author of the Roswell Declaration, had reversed my opinion
  on Roswell, accusations such as "he is an agent for the government" or "they finally got to him" immediately appeared
  on Internet postings and elsewhere. While it is generally not prudent to risk giving such silliness even an inkling of
  respectability by publicly acknowledging it, I will address the issue here, nonetheless, because the accusations seem
  to be so widespread. </p>
<p>First of all, no individual or agency has ever attempted to influence or pressure me in any way, shape, or form --
  with regard to Roswell or anything else. Furthermore, if Roswell had really happened and if there had been any kind of
  attempt to intimidate me, such an action would have been the bigg st mistake possible. Being somewhat rebellious by
  nature, I would have then pursued the matter with a vengeance, spurred on by the knowledge that I was really on to
  something. </p>
<p>Secondly, I am not employed by the government in any capacity whatsoever. My sole occupation for the past 26 years
  has been that of airline pilot. I am employed by a major U.S. carrier and presently fly international routes,
  primarily to Europe. Although I have never seen a UFO, I have had a long-term interest in the phenomenon. My interest
  in Roswell came about in part because my father, Arthur Jeffrey, a retired Air Force colonel, knew and worked in the
  early sixties with one of the key Roswell figures, General William Blanchard. </p>
<p>While I did feel for a long time that there was a "significant" chance that Roswell involved a crashed UFO, I never
  at any time believed it to be the case with absolute certainty. However, even if I had only felt that there was a
  "slight" chance that Roswell involved the crash of an alien spaceship I still would have pursued the matter
  vigorously, because, if true, it would have been the story of the millennium. </p>
