<p>The 509th Bomb Group was based at Roswell in 1947. In September 1996, I had the privilege of attending the reunion of
  the 509th Bomb Group in Tucson, Arizona, as a guest of General Bob Scott and his wife Terry. I have known the Scotts
  for a couple of years. By coincidence, Bob's son is a pilot for he same airline for which I work. </p>
<p>At the time of the 509th reunion, I had not yet seen all the pertinent 1948 military documents and still held an
  inkling of hope that there might be something to the Roswell event. Prior to the reunion, I had sent out over 700
  mailings to members of the reunion group in the hope of finding additional witnesses to the mysterious debris. The
  result was a disappointment -- only two calls, neither of which was of any real help. Both of the men who called were
  former 509th flight engineers. One had had a very interesting UFO sighting from the ramp at Kirtland Air Force Base.
  The other recalled seeing a lot of extra activity around one of the hangers at Roswell near the time of the 1947
  incident. </p>
<p>At the reunion in Tucson, I was introduced to several of the pilots who were at Roswell in 1947 and who promptly told
  me, in no uncertain terms, that the crashed saucer event never occurred, period. I did not get the impression at the
  time, nor have I ever since, that any of these men are engaged in some kind of incredible 50-year-long massive coverup
  or that they were putting on an act or facade to throw me off track. Anyone who believes that to be the case is out of
  touch with the reality of this issue. Like every other person with whom I have ever discussed this subject, these men
  were in total agreement that anything as important and profound as the knowledge of other intelligent life in the
  universe is information that should not be censored or suppressed and to which everyone should be entitled. These men
  risked their lives in World War II to save the world from the kind of totalitarian governments that, among their many
  other crimes against humanity, unjustifiably suppressed information from their people. </p>
<p>The men who were at Roswell during July 1947 feel very strongly that absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened
  and that the whole matter is patently ridiculous. The 509th was the only atomic bomb group in the world in 1947 and
  was composed of a very elite group of individuals, most of whom still feel a definite sense of pride in their former
  outfit. To them, the crashed-saucer nonsense, along with all the hullabaloo and conspiracy theories surrounding it,
  makes a mockery of and is an insult to the 509th Bomb Group and its men. </p>
<p>One of the 509th pilots I met at the reunion, Jack Ingham, has since become a friend and has helped me considerably
  in contacting additional members of the group who were stationed at Roswell during the time of the incident. When I
  first met Jack in Tucson, he spared no punches in letting me know exactly what he thought about the crashed-flying
  saucer matter. Others at the reunion told me that if something like the crash of a UFO had really happened at Roswell,
  Jack Ingham would have known. Jack spent a total of 16 years with the 509th Bomb Group -- February 1946 to July 1962.
  He retired from he Air Force as a lieutenant colonel in January 1971. </p>
<p>Since last September, I have spoken with a total of 15 B-29 pilots and 2 B-29 navigators, all of whom were stationed
  at Roswell Army Air Field in July 1947. Most of them heard nothing about the supposed crashed-saucer incident until
  years later, after all the publicity started. The few men who did recall hearing something about the incident at the
  time of its occurrence said that the inside word was that the debris was from a downed balloon of some kind and that
  there was no more than "one wheelbarrow full." Not one single man had any direct knowledge of a crashed saucer or of
  any kind of unusual material. Even more significantly, in all of their collective years with the 509th Bomb Group, not
  one of these men had ever encountered any other individual who had such knowledge. </p>
<p>As Jack Ingham and others pointed out, the 509th was a very close-knit group and there was no way an event as
  spectacular as the recovery of a crashed-alien spaceship from another world could have happened at their base without
  their having known about it. Despite the fact that they, individually, may not have been directly involved with the
  recovery operation, and despite the pervasiveness of the "need to know" philosophy in the military, these men
  maintained that there was absolutely no way that something of such magnitude and so earthshaking would not have been
  communicated among the members of the group -- especially within the inner circle of the upper echelon of B-29 pilots
  and navigators -- all of whom had top-secret security clearances. Furthermore, unlike the atomic weapons secrets with
  which they were all entrusted, the existence of a crashed alien spaceship would have been much more of a social and
  scientific issue than a national security issue. Additionally, word was already out -- the story had been published in
  afternoon newspapers all over the Western United States. </p>
<p>Most of the men of the 509th Bomb Group were primarily WWII veterans in their mid- to late twenties. (Colonel
  Blanchard, the commander of the group, was, himself, only 31.) Military regulations notwithstanding, human nature and
  common sense have to be factored into the equation. Such an occurrence - the most significant and dramatic event in
  recorded history -- would surely have been discussed by these men, at least among themselves. </p>
