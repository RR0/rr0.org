<p>The central focus of the Roswell story has been the recovery of the unusual debris from the Foster Ranch in July,
  1947. This is where it all started. The most important living witness to that debris is Jesse Marcel, Jr., MD, the son
  of Major Jesse Marcel, Sr., the intelligence officer of the 509th omb Group. After being out at the site, Major Marcel
  stopped by his house on the way back to the base and laid the debris out on his kitchen floor to show his wife and
  son. As a result, Jesse Marcel, Jr., got a good look at the unusual material. Potentially, the key to the whole
  Roswell UFO case lies in Jesse Marcel, Jr.'s memory. He saw the debris. Either it was extraterrestrial or it was
  not.</p>
<p>Despite the recent overwhelmingly negative developments in the Roswell case, I did not want to leave any stone
  unturned. I therefore arranged to have Jesse Marcel, Jr. fly to Washington, D.C., for a thorough debriefing session to
  see if we could get a better picture of the exact nature of the unusual debris that precipitated the Roswell
  story. </p>
<p>Being fully aware of the pitfalls in the use of hypnosis for memory retrieval, I decided that it still might be an
  avenue worth pursuing. In addition to its (controversial) use in retrieving repressed subconscious memories, hypnosis
  can be an effective tool in enhancing conscious memory. Law enforcement agencies sometimes use hypnosis in this manner
  to help a witness better remember a face or a license plate number, for example. </p>
<p>Because I considered our effort such an important endeavor, I wanted to find the best in the field. I also wanted
  someone who had maximum credibility and who was not associated with the UFO community. There was a reason for this. In
  the event that anything significantly positive came out of the hypnotic session, there would be a greater chance of it
  being taken seriously by the mainstream public. </p>
<p>My search led me to Neil Hibler, PhD, a clinical psychologist with an office in the Washington, D.C., area. Dr.
  Hibler is one of the world's leading experts in the use of hypnotic regression for forensic purposes. Law enforcement
  agencies all over the world have retained him for important cases. Among the agencies that have called on him are the
  Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the intelligence
  agencies of all three armed services. Dr. Hibler has worked with subjects from all walks of life, including diplomats
  and generals. </p>
<p>On the evening of January 10, 1997, four of us met in Dr. Hibler's office for the first of three sessions. The other
  two sessions took place over the next two days. Jesse Marcel, Jr., who is one of the most honest and sincere persons I
  have ever met, cooperated completely, despite the potential controversy of any significant outcome. Dr. Hibler had
  suggested that everything be recorded on videotape. This was done by Denise Marcel, Jesse, Jr.'s 33-year-old daughter,
  who flew in from Los Angeles. Denise was especially interested in our endeavor because she has studied hypnosis
  formally and is a licensed hypnotherapist in California. A professional illustrator from the Washington, D.C., area,
  Kimberly Moeller, was also present during the second and third sessions. </p>
<p>Dr. Hibler's approach was to have Jesse go through the entire story twice, without the aid of hypnosis. Hypnosis was
  then administered for each subsequent recounting of the story. According to Denise, her father is not an easy hypnotic
  subject, but was definitely in a mild to medium trance by the end of the last session. The hypnosis did not, however,
  bring out anything new that was of significance. For that reason, confabulation (false memory syndrome) was definitely
  not a concern. In Jesse's words, the hypnosis simply helped "fine tune" his conscious memory. For example, by the end
  of the last session, he was able to recall several details about which he had previously been uncertain -- the debris'
  already having been laid out on the floor when he first saw it, the fact that his father was in uniform, and his
  accompanying his father out to the car, where he saw additional debris in the trunk. </p>
<p>The most significant thing about the sessions in Washington is not so much what came out of them, but what didn't
  come out of them. There were no descriptions or memories of any kind of exotic debris or wreckage. There is a very
  good reason for that -- there simply was no such exotic debris or wreckage for Jesse to remember. If there had been,
  in all probability, he would have remembered it consciously. Nonetheless, because of the extreme importance of the
  debris to the Roswell case, the effort was worth a try -- just in case. There was no risk of a negative effect on what
  Jesse remembered. Hypnosis can elicit memories of things that didn't happen, but it can't take away memories of things
  that did happen. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, instead of providing any renewed hope or encouragement, the outcome of the hypnosis sessions in
  Washington, D.C., was, for me, the final nail in the coffin of the Roswell crashed-saucer scenario. The sessions made
  it absolutely clear that the material recovered from the Foster ranch northwest of Roswell in 1947 was anything but
  unique or exotic. As it turned out, it was extremely mundane. </p>
<p>According to Jesse's best recollection, the material laid out on his kitchen floor, which was representative of that
  at the site, consisted primarily of pieces of metallic foil, a short beam or "stick," and a few pieces of a plastic or
  Bakelite-like substance. Certainly, such mundane debris would not constitute the wreckage from any kind of
  sophisticated vehicle or craft, much less one capable of interstellar travel. </p>
<p>There was nothing to indicate form or structure. There was nothing to indicate some kind of ultra-advanced
  technology. There were no technological artifacts of any type -- no remnants of anything resembling motors, servos,
  electronic components, instruments, a guidance system, a control system, a propulsion system, etc. -- nothing. The
  crash of a Sopwith Camel would have left more complex and sophisticated debris. Even the debris from a
  two-thousand-year-old Roman chariot would have been more interesting and varied than the debris that was laid out on
  the Marcel kitchen floor. At least with the chariot there would have been some technological remnants such as parts of
  the axles and wheels. </p>
<p>While we have no idea what the debris from a crashed spaceship would look like, it is reasonable to assume that it
  would reflect a level of complexity and technological advancement beyond imagination. Postulating that a few pieces of
  foil, plastic-like material, and short beams constitute the remains of a machine of such capability and complexity is
  more than just a quantum leap, it is completely baseless and totally illogical. </p>
