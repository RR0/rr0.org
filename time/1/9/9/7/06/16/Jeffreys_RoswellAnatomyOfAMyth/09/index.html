<p>In addition to being mundane, the material recovered from the Foster ranch is definitely reconcilable with the debris
  from an ML-307 radar reflector -- the length and cross-sectional size of the beams or sticks, the pieces of foil, and
  the plastic-like material (now thought to be part of one of the plastic ballast cases that contained sand). Even the
  color of the symbols that Jesse, Jr., remembers is almost identical to the color of the flower patterns on the balsa
  stick that Irving Newton remembers seeing in Ramey's office. </p>
<p>The crashed saucer scenario requires an implausible occurrence. A flying saucer crashes northwest of Roswell, New
  Mexico, and leaves debris in the form of small pieces of foil, short beams that have a maximum length of about three
  feet, and pieces of Bakelite-like material. Amazingly, by incredible coincidence, a balloon array that disappeared in
  the same general area four weeks earlier carried three radar reflectors constructed from reflective foil, short beams
  that have a maximum length of about three feet, and pieces of Bakelite-like material. </p>
<p>Obviously, the idea of any such coincidence ever happening is absurd. The debris recovered from the Foster ranch was
  that of an ML-307 radar reflector. </p>
<p>It is not hard to imagine how the apparent misidentification probably came about. During the previous two weeks,
  there had been a wave of sightings of flying saucers or "disks" throughout the United States and Canada. The sightings
  were something that were in the news daily and were on almost everyone's mind -- an "unknown" in the sky. At the same
  time, balloon arrays under a secret project known as "Mogul" were being launched from the Alamagordo area, just under
  100 miles to the west of Roswell. These balloon arrays carried ML-307 radar reflectors, which would have been totally
  unfamiliar to Butch Blanchard, Jesse Marcel, and the other men at Roswell AAF. The debris from one of these reflectors
  scattered over the desert would likewise have been something unfamiliar to them -- an "unknown" on the ground. </p>
<p>It is understandable that the unknown debris found northwest of Roswell would have been assumed to be related to the
  unknown objects that had been so frequently reported flying around in the sky, the flying "disks." Such a connection,
  although with the benefit of hindsight, incorrect, would have be n very logical and understandable for the men at
  Roswell to make. This is almost certainly how the Roswell story began. </p>
