<p>During the sessions in Washington, D.C., the professional illustrator who was present drew a very accurate depiction
  of what Jesse, Jr., remembered -- the "I-beam-like" member with the symbols on it. After learning what a good
  recollection of the symbols Newton had, I arranged for him to work with he same illustrator so that we might have
  side-by-side sketches from the same perspective for comparison. </p>
<p>As it turned out, the resemblance between the two sketches was remarkable. Even the artist commented that "it sure
  seemed like these two men were describing the same thing." Probably most amazing was the closeness of the color that
  the two men remembered. Other than Newton's color being more faded, the colors are nearly identical. </p>
<p>The most significant discrepancy was the way the slight ridges on the upper and lower edges gave Jesse's beam the
  appearance of an I-beam-like cross section. This was probably due to a slight error in Jesse's recollection. His
  father, for example, remembered the small members as having a rectangular cross section. In a 1979 interview with
  journalist Bob Pratt, Jesse Marcel, Sr., stated, "...it was a solid member, rectangular members, just like you get
  with a square stick." It is entirely possible, however, that the particular member that Jesse, Jr., held, could have
  had a ridge on its edges for some unknown reason. </p>
<p>The only other really significant discrepancy was in the color of the member. Jesse remembered it being about the
  same color as that of the foil-like material, while Irving Newton remembered it being almost white. Judging from the
  pictures taken in Ramey's office, however, the white that Newton recalled was probably accurate. According to Charles
  Moore, the project engineer for "Project Mogul," the sticks were covered with glue or glue-like substance. This would
  probably have given them a different color than that of raw wood, as well as a different feel or texture -- probably
  to the degree that someone who didn't know what they were, might not recognize them as wood. The only other
  discrepancies were minor, such as differences in the size and spacing of the symbols. </p>
<p>For anyone who suspects that Irving Newton is participating in a 50-year coverup and making up the story about the
  symbols or flower patterns, all he needs to do is check out the July 9, 1947, Roswell Daily Record. Rancher Mac Brazel
  is quoted as talking about sticks, foil, and tape with flower patterns on it. </p>
