<p>Le témoignage de feu Jesse Marcel, Sr., is probably the most important, as well as the most controversial, of the
  whole Roswell story. In essence, it forms the foundation around which the rest of the case is built. However, because
  the debris he recovered was not extraterrestrial, it could not have been what he said it was. That does not mean,
  however, that he did not believe it was extraterrestrial. In my opinion, it is very possible, if not highly probable,
  that he sincerely believed until the day he died that the material was something, as he once put it, "not of this
  earth." A less-than-perfect memory of events so long ago, in combination with the suspicion on his part of a coverup
  above his level of security or outside his need to know, makes such a scenario entirely plausible. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, because of minor, almost trivial, inconsistencies in some of the things Jesse Marcel, Sr., said, or is
  believed to have said, some have made caustic personal attacks against a man no longer around to defend himself ? and
  who was, in all probability, telling the truth as he recalled it. I have now spoken with a number of men from the
  509th Bomb Group who knew Major Marcel. All had nothing but the highest regard and respect for him. </p>
<p>Some of these attacks have been extended to Jesse Marcel, Jr., which I find astounding. As I have already mentioned,
  he is as sincere and honest as anyone I have ever known. Like his father before him, he served his country during time
  of war. Few people know it, but he was seriously injured during the Vietnam War when his helicopter was shot down,
  killing everyone else on board. Like all of us, Jesse might not have 100 % perfect recall of every past event, but I
  would never question his word. </p>
<p>In a way, because the debris recovered outside of Roswell in 1947 was not extraterrestrial, none of the other witness
  testimony really matters. If the story of a highly unusual and totally unprecedented event is killed at the source,
  subsequent corroborating testimony goes out the window. For example, in the summer of 1993, a man from Seattle,
  Washington, made the unprecedented claim that he had found a hypodermic syringe inside a sealed can of Pepsi Cola. The
  story was picked up by the media, and within days there were copycat claims against the Pepsi Cola Corporation all
  over the country. Unfortunately for those who jumped on the bandwagon, the original claim turned out to be false.
  Where did that leave the subsequent claimants? Out on a limb that had been cut off, and, in this particular case,
  facing up to 250 000 $ in fines and five years in jail. </p>
<p>The testimony of some of the other Roswell witnesses has been all but validated in the public eye because of repeated
  media coverage. For this reason I will address a couple of cases. </p>
<p>Former mortician <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/DennisGlenn/index.html">Glenn Dennis</a> and
  the elusive nurse, Naomi Self, who supposedly witnessed alien autopsies at the base hospital is one of the best-known
  elements of the 1947 Roswell event. Although I know and like Glenn Dennis on a personal level, I have to say that his
  story has lost all credibility. Glenn, incidentally, has been fully aware of the fact that researchers have been
  spending time and resources in an effort to locate a "Naomi Self." </p>
<p>There was already significant circumstantial evidence to indicate that no such nurse ever existed, when a diligent
  young researcher from Arizona, Vic Golubic, all but confirmed the fact. He located the records of the Cadet Nurse
  Corps, where all nurses for the military were trained during the mid-1940s. When Golubic checked with Dennis about the
  correct spelling of "Self" and informed him about the Cadet Nurse Corps records, Dennis changed his story, telling
  Golubic that Self was not really the correct last name after all. Dennis, without giving a good reason for not doing
  so, also refused to tell Golubic the "real" last name. Sorry, Glenn, end of story. </p>
<p>Mon père comme moi furent amenés à très bien connaître <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/KaufmannFrank/index.html">Frank Kaufman</a> et le considérer comme
  un ami. Cependant, comme avec <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/DennisGlenn/index.html">Dennis</a>,
  je dois dire qu'au regard de ce que je sais maintenant, en aucune manière le conte fantastique de <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/KaufmannFrank/index.html">Kaufman</a><a
      href="../../../../../../../../../KaufmannFrank.html"></a> d'un vaisseau spatial écrasé avec des corps
  extraterrestres peut avoir une quelconque base dans la réalité. D'après l'histoire de <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/KaufmannFrank/index.html">Kaufman</a><a
      href="../../../../../../../../../KaufmannFrank.html"></a>, il était un des 9 militaires à l'opération de
  récupération top-secrète à 35 miles au nord de la ville. A part <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/KaufmannFrank/index.html">Kaufman</a><a
      href="../../../../../../../../../KaufmannFrank.html"></a>, le seul autre membre vivant des "9 d'origine" était un
  certain général Robert Thomas. </p>
<p>La dernière fois que mon père et moi étions à <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/Roswell/index.html">Roswell</a>, <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/KaufmannFrank/index.html">Kaufman</a> nous montra certaines de ses
  photos, dont 1 avec lui debout à côté d'un brigadier-général. Mon père demanda à <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/KaufmannFrank/index.html">Kaufman</a> si c'était Thomas, ce à
  quoi <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/KaufmannFrank/index.html">Kaufman</a> répondit par
  l'affirmative. Malheureusement, mon père, qui passa 30 ans à l'Air Force, fut incapable de reconnaître le général. Je
  vérifiais plus tard au centre des archives de l'Air Force et appris que non seulement il n'y avait pas de général
  Robert Thomas vivant, mais qu'il n'y eut jamais de général Robert Thomas. Confronté à cela, <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/KaufmannFrank/index.html">Kaufman</a> m'informa que Thomas
  n'était en fait qu'un <q>nom de code</q>. </p>
<p>The final witness testimony that I will address is that concerning <a
    href="/people/HendersonOliverWendell/index.html">Oliver W. (Pappy) Henderson</a>. Millions have seen the "Unsolved
  Mystery" broadcast about Roswell with the scene of Pappy Henderson in his flight suit, leaning over and inspecting one
  of several alien bodies laid out on a hangar floor just prior to their being flown to Wright Patterson. <a
      href="/people/HendersonOliverWendell/index.html">Henderson</a>, qui mourru en <a
      href="/time/1986/index.html">1986</a>, on seeing a tabloid headline and story about Roswell, apparently told his
  wife that the story was true and that he had flown the wreckage and bodies to Wright Patterson. My best guess is that
  the testimony of Henderson' family years later was a case of memories of things read, or possibly seen in tabloid
  pictures, being blended or confused with memories of what Henderson may have actually said. </p>
<p>During my extensive conversations with pilots from the 509th, I spoke with several who knew Henderson and remembered
  his having discussed the incident. Apparently Henderson, a C-54 transport pilot at the time, did fly some of the
  debris out of Roswell, possibly to Wright Patterson. Jesse Mitchell, one of the 509th pilots at the time and a retired
  lieutenant colonel, told me that Henderson told him that he never saw the debris and he had no idea what it was.
  Mitchell was a good friend of Henderson's and almost decided to go into the roofing business with him in Roswell after
  Henderson left the service. Another former member of the 509th, Sam McIlhaney, also a retired lieutenant colonel who
  knew Henderson well, told me that they used to talk about the incident occasionally while sitting around in the
  hangar. According to McIlhaney, Henderson considered the whole matter a big joke and used to kid about it. </p>
