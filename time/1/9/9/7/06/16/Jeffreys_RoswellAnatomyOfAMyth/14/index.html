<p>Researching Roswell is somewhat akin to prospecting, in that most of the time you spend countless hours and come up
  with nothing. Occasionally, however, you might hit pay dirt and come up with a real find. That happened with me during
  my polling of the pilots and navigators of the 509th, when I contacted Walter Klinikowski. </p>
<p>Klinikowski is one of the most interesting individuals with whom I have spoken during this entire Roswell endeavor.
  After my first conversation with Klinikowski, I soon learned from other members of the 509th Bomb Group that his piano
  playing was almost legendary. He told me that while in high school at age 15, unbeknown to his parents, he took his
  first professional job. The musician's union set him up in the pit band of a local burlesque theater, where he soon
  became acquainted with none other than the famous Gypsy Rose Lee. </p>
<p>As if his piano talent was not enough, Klinikowski later was sponsored by the Philadelphia Athletic Club as a
  potential member of the 1940 U.S. Olympic team. The war came along, however, and the games were never held. During
  World War II, he was a navigator on a B-17 -- one of highest risk jobs in he war. Following the war, after a couple of
  years of civilian life, Klinikowski was recalled to the service, where he joined the 509th Bomb Group at Roswell in
  May 1947. He stayed with the 509th until February 1953. </p>
<p>What makes Walter Klinikowski so important to the investigation of the Roswell case is not his time with the 509th,
  but what he did afterward. For 14 years, from 1960 until 1974, when he retired from the Air Force as a colonel, Walter
  Klinikowski was with the Foreign Technology Division (FTD) of th Air Materiel Command (AMC), based out of Wright
  Patterson Air Force Base. (The FTD is now called the National Aerospace Intelligence Center.) From 1960 to 1964, he
  was "Deputy Director of Intelligence Collections," and then later, after spending some time abroad as a liaison
  officer for the FTD, he returned to Wright Patterson as "Director of Foreign Activities" from 1970 until 1974. </p>
<p>The fact that wreckage of a crashed UFO would have been taken to the Foreign Technology Division of AMC at Wright
  Patterson Air Force Base for analysis is disputed by no one, to my knowledge. If that had been the case, Klinikowski
  would have known about it, but he didn't. Walter unequivocally assured me that there was no wreckage of a crashed
  flying saucer from Roswell or anywhere else at Wright Patterson. The rumors of the secret hangar and alien bodies are
  just that -- rumors. </p>
<p>Klinikowski was kind enough to put me in touch with his former boss at the Foreign Technology Division, Walter
  Vatunac. Vatunac, who had actually been stationed at Roswell in the late 1940s, was the Director of Intelligence
  Collections at the Foreign Technology Division from 1957 until 1962. (The FTD was called the Air Technical
  Intelligence Center prior to 1961.) Like Klinikowsky, Vatunac found the matter of alien bodies and a crashed spaceship
  very humorous and was incredulous that so many people actually believe it. </p>
<p>After my conversations with Klinikowsky and Vatunac, Harry Cordes, a former 509th pilot and a retired brigadier
  general, suggested I call a former acquaintance of his, George Weinbrenner, who had also been at the FTD. I contacted
  Weinbrenner, who was more than accommodating, especially when he foun out that I knew Walter Klinikowsky. Weinbrenner
  told me pretty much what I had already learned from Klinikowsky and Vatunac, but it was interesting talking to him,
  nonetheless. With respect to the crashed UFO subject, he also found it humorous and stated that "if something like
  that had happened, I would have known about it." He certainly would have. George Weinbrenner was the commander of the
  Foreign Technology Division for six years (1968 until 1974). </p>
<p>I cannot state strongly enough that I have absolutely no doubt that these three men were telling me the truth. I
  repeat, no doubt. Those who want to rationalize away the facts by suggesting that these men are still participating in
  some super-long-term, massive coverup might give some thought to the following. </p>
<p>If there had been a crashed UFO, and for some reason it was still being kept secret, why on earth would these men
  waste inordinate amounts of their own time playing a ridiculous game of charades with me? They wouldn't. There would
  be absolutely no reason for doing so. All they would have had to do, would have been to politely tell me they didn't
  know anything, and leave it at that. </p>
<p>Klinikowsky, Vatunac, and Weinbrenner are all retired colonels. They all held important positions at the Foreign
  Technology Division at Wright Patterson. As such, they represent the ultimate source of information with regard to the
  crashed UFO question. This is the word "right from the horse's mouth," the incontrovertible, irrefutable truth, the
  final confirmation -- no alien bodies, no secret hangar, and no UFO crash at Roswell. Case closed. </p>
