<p>En essence, le cas de Roswell de 1947 s'est révélé être un red herring, diverting time and resources away from resea
  rch into the real UFO phenomenon. Despite overwhelming facts to the contrary, there are those, however, who will fight
  to keep the myth alive at all cost. Roswell is a sacred cow for some, and a cash cow for others. Inevitably, there
  will be fierce opposition to much of what has been said in this article. I would be the last, however, to discourage
  rational and thoughtful response, for healthy debate and a free exchange of ideas are part of what makes our
  democratic system work. </p>
<p>Any complete and reasonable response by those who still contend that a UFO crashed at Roswell in 1947 will need to
  directly address the points below, each of which would have to be a true statement if such a crash occurred: </p>
<ol>
  <li>A machine with unimaginable technological sophistication and consequent incredible reliability would have simply
    broken down and crashed. </li>
  <li>The only known wreckage from this sophisticated vehicle, capable of interstellar travel, would have consisted
    solely of a few short beams, pieces of foil-like material, and small pieces of thin plastic-like material. </li>
  <li> By incredible coincidence, the material from the crashed spaceship would have very closely resembled the material
    left by the radar reflectors from a balloon array that went down in the same general area a few weeks earlier. </li>
  <li>Despite the fact that this would have been the most spectacular event in recorded history, and despite the fact
    that word was already out that something had happened (because of Lt. Haut's press release), there was absolutely no
    contemporary discussion or talk about such an earthshaking event among the pilots and navigators of the close-knit
    509th Bomb Group.</li>
  <li> West Point graduate and retired général <a href="/people/d/DuboseThomasJefferson/index.html">Thomas Dubose</a>,
    would have to have lied nine times in an interview when he stated that the debris (definitely that from an ML-307
    radar reflector) shown in the pictures in Ramey's office was not substituted material and was the "real debris"
    recovered from t e ranch northwest of Roswell.</li>
  <li>Le major-général <a href="/people/CabellCharlesPearre.html">C. P. Cabell</a>, Directeur du Renseignement pour l'<a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/index.html">Air Force</a> au <a href="/org/us/state/wa/pentagone/index.html">Pentagone</a>,
    qui prépara
    un rapport sur la situation des objets volants non identifiés pour le Secrétaire à la Défense, astoundingly, would
    have been preparing the report totally ignorant of the fact that the Air Force was in possess on of a crashed flying
    saucer.</li>
  <li>Three retired Air Force colonels, all former top officials at the Foreign Technology Division at <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/index.html">Wright Patterson Air Force base</a> would have been lying to me ?
    unnecessarily wasting inordinate amounts of their own personal time in a protracted game of charades. </li>
</ol>
<p>We have now gotten to the heart of the story and established that the debris recovered from the Foster ranch and laid
  out on the Marcel kitchen floor was, except for some unusual symbols, of a very mundane nature. The following should
  then be asked of those still arguing the issue: How do you get a crashed alien spaceship out of such ordinary debris?
  What basis is there now for postulating the existence of a crashed UFO? </p>
