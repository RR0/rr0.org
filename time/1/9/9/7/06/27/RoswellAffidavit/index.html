<p>In view of recent worldwide media attention and apparent public misconception concerning the <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell">1947 Roswell Incident</a>, we have chosen to issue a joint
  statement in an effort to help set the record straight on this most controversial matter. We are taking this step
  strictly out of a sense of responsibility to the truth, and are doing so of our own volition, without any pressure ou
  encouragement from the U.S. military or government.
</p>
<p>Over the past years, innumerable documentaries, books, television shows, and movies have conveyed the impression that
  the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell">1947 Roswell event</a> is a matter of historical fact.
  Incredible-sounding but unsubstantiated claims by alleged witnesses and participants have further exacerbated the
  situation. Consequently, according to recent opinion polls, the majority of Americans now believe in the reality of an
  event that never occurred — the crash of an alien spaceship northwest of Roswell, New Mexico, in <time>1947-07</time>,
  and its subsequent recovery and transportation by the U.S. military to <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB">Wright
    Patterson Air Force Base</a> near Dayton, Ohio.
</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB">Wright Patterson </a>is indeed where the Air Force's technical and intelligence
  experts were, and still are, concentrated. It is where the recovered wreckage from a foreign craft of any kind with
  the potential for invading our skys, including an alien spaceship, would be taken and kept for technical analysis.
  Contrary to the Roswell legend, however, no such craft was taken to and stored at <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB">Wright
    Patterson Air Force Base</a>. If such an event had occurred, as ranking officials of the <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/sc/ftd/index.html">Foreign Technology Division (FTD)</a> at <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB">Wright
    Patterson</a>, we would have known about it. During our collective tenure there, which spanned a period of 17 years
  — <time>1957</time> through <time>1974</time> — there was no alien spaceship, and no <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB/Hangar18">secret hangar</a> housing it — of that we give our word.
</p>
<p>Going on record with such an unequivocal statement is not something we take lightly. As retired military officers, we
  would not dishonor ourselves, our military careers, our families, or our country by lying to the American people,
  especially about an issue of such great potential significance.
</p>
<p>Any doubters should note that if an alien spaceship were actually being kept at <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB">Wright
  Patterson Air Force Base</a> by the U.S. government, the administration in power could choose to declassify the matter
  at any time. With that uncertainty, publicly lying about such an issue, on top of all else, would be pure folly.
</p>
<p>As is surely the opinion of the vast majority of Americans, both civilians and military, we are in total agreement
  that anything as important and profound as knowledge of other intelligent life in the universe would be information
  that should not be suppressed or censored by any government. It would be information to which all humanity should be
  entitled.
