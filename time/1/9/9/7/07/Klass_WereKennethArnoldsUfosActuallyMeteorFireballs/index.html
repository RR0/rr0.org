<p>Recent research by <em>San Francisco Examiner</em> science writer Keay Davidson — sparked by a conversation with
  SUN's editor — suggests that <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MontRainier">the stream of 'Unidentified
    Flying Objects' reported 50 years ago by private pilot Kenneth Arnold</a> — which triggered the UFO era — may have
  been glowing meteor-fireball fragments. Davidson learned from a recent book on
  <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/rentree/meteore">meteors</a> (<em>Rocks from Space</em>) authored by O.
  Richard Norton, that the number of meteorite falls reaches a Peak around 3 p.m. Arnold's sighting occurred around 3
  p.m. In the northern hemisphere, the greatest number of meteorite entries reported over 160 years
  (<time>1900/1960</time>) occur during the mouth of June. Arnold's historic sighting occurred on the
  <time>1947-06-24</time>.
</p>
<p>Arnold said his attention was first attracted to the UFOs <q>when a bright flash reflected on my airplane</q>. In
  Arnold's report to the Air Force, he said that <q>two or three of them every few seconds would dip or change their
    course slightly, just enough for the sun to strike them at an angle that reflected brightly on my plane</q>.
  Understandably, Arnold assumed that the objects were metal craft reflecting the sunlight.
</p>
<p>The flight crew of <em>American Airlines</em>' eastbound night #112, flying at <span itemscope
    itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">39000</span> <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span>
    </span> on <time>1969-06-05 ~18:00</time>, had a similar encounter with a squadron of four UFOs coming out of the
  east which appeared to be on a near-collision course. The brightness of the four objects was also assumed to be a
  reflection of the sun off metal objects. This "squadron of UFOs" also was reported by the flight crew of an eastbound
  United Airlines jetliner, flying at <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">37000</span> <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span>
    </span>, <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">8</span> <span itemprop="unitCode" content="SMI">miles</span>
    </span> behind <em>American</em>, and also by an eastbound Air National Guard fighter pilot, flying at <span
      itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">41000</span> <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">ft</span>
    </span>, <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">4</span> <span itemprop="unitCode" content="SMI">miles</span>
    </span> behind <em>United</em>. The military pilot reported that the squadron of UFOs appeared to execute a climbing
  maneuver — seemingly to prevent a mid-air collision.
</p>
<p>This <time>1969</time> incident would have become a classic "unexplained multiple-pilot UFO case" but for an alert
  newspaper photographer in Peoria, Ill., named Alan Harkrader, who managed to take a picture of the UFOs. Harkrader's
  photo showed that the squadron of UFOs was really a fragmenting meteor-fireball. When a meteor enters the atmosphere
  at a speed of roughly <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">10000</span> <span itemprop="unitCode" content="HM">miles/h</span>
    </span>, it electrifies (ionizes) the air and creates a long, luminous teardrop-shaped object. Meteor fragments
  generate similar luminous tails. (Harkrader's photo shows only two objects, but he told me that while winding the film
  in the hope of getting a second shot, another fragment broke off and fell into trail. The incident occurred in broad
  daylight but Harkrader stopped-down the lens aperture to enhance contrast.) Analysis of Harkruder's photo, which
  showed a nearby electric power line, plus numerous reports from ground observers, enabled the Smithsonian Center for
  Short-Lived Phenomena to determine the approximate trajectory of the fireball. Despite the fact that two senior
  airline flight crews and a military pilot believed that they had nearly collided with the squadron of UFOs near St.
  Louis, the Smithsonian scientists determined that the fireball trajectory was approximately <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">125</span> <span itemprop="unitCode" content="SMI">miles</span>
    </span> north of St. Louis.
</p>
<p>This St. Louis UFO case shows that even experienced pilots who briefly see something which is unfamiliar can have
  flawed recollections of what they observed.
</p>
<p>Numerous sightings of fireballs in late June resulting from debris from Comet Pons — Winnecke — called the "June
  Draconids" or "June Bootids" — were reported by David Swann of <span class="place">Dallas, Texas</span>, in the <time>1981-04</time>
  issue of <em>Meteor News</em>. Swann noted that the timing of <q>this meteor stream is June 27-30 with the visual
    maximum usually occurring on the morning of either June 28 or June 29. The velocity of these meteors is very slow
    .... Several intense displays have been seen, most notable those of <time>1916</time>, <time>1921</time>, and <time>1927</time>.
    The display of <time>1916-06-28</time>, produced visual rates of 50-100 meteors per hour</q>. Swann reported six of
  his own fireball sightings between <time>1964/1971</time> which had been observed in the June 26-30 period, around or
  shortly after midnight.

  <h2>Arnold's Original Report</h2>
  <p>Because Arnold subsequently embellished his story slightly in his <time>1952</time> book <em>The Coming of the
    Saucers</em>, it is important to rely on his original account, as reported to the Air Force. Arnold originally
    emphasized that the length of the objects was about 20 times their width, which would match the long luminous tail
    of a meteor-fireball. Arnold commented: <q>What kept bothering me as I watched them flip and flash in the sun right
      along their path was the fact that I couldn't make out any tail on them...</q>
  </p>
  <p>Arnold estimated that the total duration of the sighting <q>was around <time>P150S/180S</time></q> but this must be
    considered only a <q>ball-park guestimate</q>. Witnesses are notoriously unreliable in estimating the time-duration
    of unexpected events. For example, on the night of <time>1968-03-03</time>, the flaming debris from a Soviet space
    rocket reentry over the eastern part of the U.S. generated many UFO reports. Witness estimates of the duration of
    their observation ranged from less than <time>P15S</time> to more than five minutes. Arnold claimed that <q>I
      remember distinctly that my sweep second hand on my instrument panel read one minute to 3 p.m. as the first object
      of the formation passed the southern edge of Mount Rainier</q> and that he remembered to look at his cockpit clock
    when the last object passed Mount Adams. SUN questions whether Arnold — who was focusing his attention on the
    unusual objects while also occupied flying his aircraft — would have taken his eyes off the objects to carefully
    observe his cockpit clock.
  </p>
  <p>The visibility of a single meteor-fireball may be as brief as a few seconds, but a single large daylight fireball
    which passed over Rocky Mountain tourist areas on <time>1972-08-10</time>, was visible for about a minute. (One
    tourist managed to take <time>P26S</time> of "home movie" before the fireball disappeared behind a nearby mountain.)
    However, a stream of several fireballs would be visible for a longer time. For example, a stream of three fireballs
    was seen by three observers on board the <em>U.S.S. Supply</em> near San Francisco on <time>1904-02-28 ~06:10</time>.
    As reported in the <time>1904-03</time> <em>Monthly Weather Review</em>, <q>The meteors were in sight over two
      minutes and were carefully observed by three people, whose accounts agree as to details</q>.
  </p>
  <p>A very unusual meteor shower with many fireballs occurred on the night of <time>1913-02-09</time>, as reported in
    the <time>1913-05/1913-06</time> issue of the <em>Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada</em>. The
    article by C.A. Chant included a number of sketches of the stream of fireballs drawn by observers.
  </p>
  <p>Observer estimates of the number of objects <q>ranged from 15 to thousands</q>, according to Chant. Based on
    estimates from many observers, Chant concluded that the parade of tadpole-shaped fireballs lasted for <q>perhaps 3.3
      minutes</q>.
  </p>
  <p>If a similar event were to occur today it might cause some observers who had seen the <em>Independence Day</em>
    movie to panic, fearing it was a UFO/ET invasion.
