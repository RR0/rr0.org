<p>The Panel recommends that, given a new alleged UFO photograph, the decision to invest effort into its investigation
  should be taken only if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:</p>
<ol>
  <li>the original documentation (negative, slide, videotape) is available, and</li>
  <li>there is at least one other independent source of information - either witness testimony or some other physical
    record.</li>
</ol>
<p>If, after visual examination, the displayed object has not been identified (planet, balloon, cloud, etc.),
  investigation should be performed in two steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>establishing or rejecting the authenticity of the photograph (or other record), taking into account evidence for
    unintentional false operation of equipment and various spurious phenomena that may affect the recording equipment.
    However, this concept of authenticity is at best relative, since in this area of investigation only negative
    conclusions may be considered as final, so that authenticity can never be demonstrated absolutely.</li>
  <li>if warranted, extracting as much information as possible from the photograph or other record, so as to obtain as
    much information as possible about the object of interest (size, shape, distance, albedo, emitted energy, spectrum,
    etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p>When the original film is available and analysis seems justified, all technical data concerning the site, viewing
  conditions, camera, film, processing, etc., must be collected. If the camera is available (in an ideal case still
  loaded with the original film), it must be used to perform the following calibrations:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Photos of density patterns for relative photometry;</li>
  <li> Photos of sources calibrated in intensity, in various positions in the frame (for absolute photometry);</li>
  <li> Photos of spatial frequency patterns, to determine the modulation transfer function (MTF); and</li>
  <li> Photos taken at the same site as the original, eventually with models to simulate the object.</li>
</ol>
<p>The film should be processed under rigorously controlled conditions (if it has not already been processed
  commercially). If the camera is available but empty, the same operations should be conducted with a film of the same
  type as the original.</p>
<p>The investigator should visit the original site and make measurements concerning the three-dimensional geometry of
  the observed landscape or this information should be extracted from detailed maps. If the photograph has been acquired
  at nighttime, an astronomical map of the sky at the time of acquisition will be necessary. The investigator should
  determine the meteorological conditions from the official offices or air bases in the neighborhood with particular
  attention to the horizontal visibility. The investigator should also take into account all quantified or quantifiable
  elements of the witness testimony including the estimated shape, angular size, velocity, color, etc.</p>
<p>For analysis of the photograph, it is essential to work from the original negative. This should be carefully washed
  and examined under a microscope to look for possible tell-tale artifacts and scratches, and to check the regularity of
  the grain structure so as to detect multiple exposures. The negative should be analyzed by conventional photographic
  instruments (enlarger, projector, etc.), and the information on the negative should be digitized by a
  microdensitometer.</p>
<p>Once digitized, the image may be analyzed by computer analysis, using the classical tools of contrast enhancement,
  noise suppression, contour detection, restoration, etc., and more specialized techniques such as maximum-entropy
  analysis that may be used to remove the effects of target motion and/or camera motion. Such analysis will assist in
  the detection of a possible hoax. For instance, a suspension thread may be brought into evidence through standard
  differential operations. Also, one may estimate the distance (hence the size) of the object through MTF computations,
  based on an analysis of atmospheric diffusion and contour blurring. If there are black areas on the object, it is
  possible to obtain estimates of the distance by comparing the luminance of such regions with other identified black
  parts of the scenery. If the object is nearer than the minimum depth of field, one should be able to detect
  geometrical distortions in the image. If the operator had a slight movement while taking the picture, analysis of the
  corresponding blur on the object and on other elements of the landscape may allow the calculation of a possible range
  for the distance of the object.</p>
<p>In the case of a color photograph, one should carry out the above procedures in three steps using three appropriate
  color filters for scanning.</p>
<p>If an event is recorded on a cine camera, each frame may be analyzed as above. However, it is now possible to obtain
  additional information by combining and comparing the sequence of images.</p>
<p>In principle, images recorded by video cameras may be subjected to comparable analyses. However, video records suffer
  from one very important weakness: since the basic data is in electronic form, it could have been modified by the use
  of suitable electronic equipment, so that the authenticity of a video record will depend even more critically upon the
  credibility of the witness testimony.</p>
