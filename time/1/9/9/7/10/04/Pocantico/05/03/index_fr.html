<p>A recurrent theme in certain UFO reports is the concept of an apparition that flies in formation with an
  aircraft-borne observer. Without making a judgment on any such reports, we could recommend that UFO investigators
  familiarize themselves with natural phenomena that display this "flying-in-formation" characteristic. Greenler (1980)
  is a useful resource, from which the attached list was made. The precise mechanisms for the origin of most of these
  phenomena have been determined and are explained in Greenler, but quite a few have still not been deciphered
  satisfactorily. Even an experienced observer might be surprised in seeing a particularly rare example. I have studied
  certain related phenomena in my research involving electromagnetic probing of planetary atmospheres, but was quite
  astonished a few years ago when I saw a particular example of the following list. A bright white light flew for
  minutes in perfect formation between my aircraft and the ground, with the air below and above apparently being
  transparently clear. </p>
<p>Formation flying phenomena:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arcs: Kern, Lowitz, Wegener anthelic, Hastings anthelic, Tricken anthelic, Parry, alternate Parry, suncave Parry,
    sunvex Parry, upper tangent, lower tangent, supralateral, infralateral, circumzenithal, circumhorizontal, anthelic,
    subanthelic, contact.</li>
  <li>Halos: Hevel, 8 degree, 18 degree, 22 degree, 46 degree, circumscribed.</li>
  <li>Bows: fog, cloud, dew, supernumerary.</li>
  <li>Rainbows: primary and secondary; direct and reflected; raindrop and ice crystal; white, red, and red-to-blue.</li>
  <li>Pillars: sun, moon, city-light, anthelic.</li>
  <li>Rings or Circles: Bishop, Bottlinger, parhelic, subparhelic, coronal.</li>
  <li>Dogs: sun, moon, elongated, subsun.</li>
  <li>One should also consider: Nighttime: moon, Venus, Jupiter, bright stars, etc., gegenschein, zodiacal light, comet,
    in-cabin light reflected by window.</li>
  <li>Other forms: glory (specter of the Brocken), subsun, wet and dry heiligenschein, seven suns, lenticular and other
    distant small clouds, several different kinds of mirages.</li>
</ul>
<p>The phenomenon which was a special surprise to me is one in the final grouping, the subsun, due to particularly
  stably falling, flat, horizontal, hexagonal, ice crystals which were sufficiently few in number that the air appeared
  clear in every direction except the solar specular direction to the side of and below the airplane, where they
  efficiently mirrored the sun. </p>
