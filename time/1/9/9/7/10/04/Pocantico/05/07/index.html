<p>The SETI and UFO problems may or may not be related to each other. As there does not so far exist any proof
  concerning this question, it seems wise to keep those two problems apart and not to confuse them. The questions raised
  by the UFO and SETI problems are not at all comparable, and the strategies for their research are drastically
  different. The SETI problem corresponds to a one-bit theoretical question: does there exist, elsewhere in the
  universe, any form of intelligence that has reached the technological level of transmitting intelligent
  electromagnetic signals that humans could detect and identify? Although this question is undoubtedly exciting and
  justified by existing probabilistic computations about the existence of planets, the appearance of life, the duration
  of a civilization, etc., the final answer is theoretically Yes or No. However, only a Yes answer will be final, since
  a No answer may be revised in view of technical improvements of detection techniques. </p>
<p>The UFO problem arises from the verified existence of a very large and coherent set of testimonies worldwide. Its
  approach is bound to be in three steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Step 1. Try by all means to identify the stimulus that has led to the report: the report may be due to inadequate
    information, misinterpretation of a familiar phenomenon or device, an unusual astronomical or atmospheric
    phenomenon, an unusual technological device, or a hoax (perpetrated by the reporter or on the reporter). </li>
  <li>Step 2. If Step 1 has not yielded an explanation of the report, try to characterize the event that led to the
    report and compare it with other case descriptions. </li>
  <li>Step 3. For any case that is strong in testimony and rich in detail, one should try to define a model. In this
    activity, we are clearly not dealing with a simple question with a Yes /No (one-bit) answer. Different cases require
    analyses with different levels of complexity. </li>
</ol>
<p>The SETI and UFO problems also involve different approaches. Scientists may pursue the SETI project and remain in a
  very familiar environment: the relevant technological area is clearly identified and one may follow a predefined
  strategy by specifying the frequency search band, the required receiver sensitivity, the intrinsic properties of an
  intelligent signal, etc. On the other hand, research on the UFO problem is necessarily complex, multidisciplinary,
  unpredictable and must be expected to evolve as research progresses. The basic detection is usually carried out by
  unprepared human beings, and analysis may call upon a wide range of disciplines including human perception,
  psychology, astronomy, image processing, physics, chemistry, etc. Moreover, effective research in this field must be
  conducted with an open mind.</p>
<p>Although in public opinion the UFO and SETI projects are closely associated, they should be kept clearly separated as
  far as serious research is concerned. The questions being addressed are quite different in nature: the SETI project
  aims at a simple Yes/No answer to the question of the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence, whereas research
  into the UFO project must be pursued with a completely open mind as to the questions that need to be posed and
  answered. Moreover, the respective technical strategies have nothing in common: SETI research is carried out primarily
  within the established framework of radio astronomy, whereas UFO research is necessarily multidisciplinary and
  innovative.</p>
