<h2><a id="A2"></a>Annexe 2 : Procédures pour l'analyse d'indices photographiques</h2>
<p><strong><a href="/people/l/LouangeFrancois.html">F. Louange</a></strong></p>
<p>The Panel recommends that, given a new alleged UFO photograph, the decision to invest effort into its investigation
  should be taken only if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:</p>
<ol>
  <li>the original documentation (negative, slide, videotape) is available, and</li>
  <li>there is at least one other independent source of information - either witness testimony or some other physical
    record.</li>
</ol>
<p>If, after visual examination, the displayed object has not been identified (planet, balloon, cloud, etc.),
  investigation should be performed in two steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>establishing or rejecting the authenticity of the photograph (or other record), taking into account evidence for
    unintentional false operation of equipment and various spurious phenomena that may affect the recording equipment.
    However, this concept of authenticity is at best relative, since in this area of investigation only negative
    conclusions may be considered as final, so that authenticity can never be demonstrated absolutely.</li>
  <li>if warranted, extracting as much information as possible from the photograph or other record, so as to obtain as
    much information as possible about the object of interest (size, shape, distance, albedo, emitted energy, spectrum,
    etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p>When the original film is available and analysis seems justified, all technical data concerning the site, viewing
  conditions, camera, film, processing, etc., must be collected. If the camera is available (in an ideal case still
  loaded with the original film), it must be used to perform the following calibrations:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Photos of density patterns for relative photometry;</li>
  <li> Photos of sources calibrated in intensity, in various positions in the frame (for absolute photometry);</li>
  <li> Photos of spatial frequency patterns, to determine the modulation transfer function (MTF); and</li>
  <li> Photos taken at the same site as the original, eventually with models to simulate the object.</li>
</ol>
<p>The film should be processed under rigorously controlled conditions (if it has not already been processed
  commercially). If the camera is available but empty, the same operations should be conducted with a film of the same
  type as the original.</p>
<p>The investigator should visit the original site and make measurements concerning the three-dimensional geometry of
  the observed landscape or this information should be extracted from detailed maps. If the photograph has been acquired
  at nighttime, an astronomical map of the sky at the time of acquisition will be necessary. The investigator should
  determine the meteorological conditions from the official offices or air bases in the neighborhood with particular
  attention to the horizontal visibility. The investigator should also take into account all quantified or quantifiable
  elements of the witness testimony including the estimated shape, angular size, velocity, color, etc.</p>
<p>For analysis of the photograph, it is essential to work from the original negative. This should be carefully washed
  and examined under a microscope to look for possible tell-tale artifacts and scratches, and to check the regularity of
  the grain structure so as to detect multiple exposures. The negative should be analyzed by conventional photographic
  instruments (enlarger, projector, etc.), and the information on the negative should be digitized by a
  microdensitometer.</p>
<p>Once digitized, the image may be analyzed by computer analysis, using the classical tools of contrast enhancement,
  noise suppression, contour detection, restoration, etc., and more specialized techniques such as maximum-entropy
  analysis that may be used to remove the effects of target motion and/or camera motion. Such analysis will assist in
  the detection of a possible hoax. For instance, a suspension thread may be brought into evidence through standard
  differential operations. Also, one may estimate the distance (hence the size) of the object through MTF computations,
  based on an analysis of atmospheric diffusion and contour blurring. If there are black areas on the object, it is
  possible to obtain estimates of the distance by comparing the luminance of such regions with other identified black
  parts of the scenery. If the object is nearer than the minimum depth of field, one should be able to detect
  geometrical distortions in the image. If the operator had a slight movement while taking the picture, analysis of the
  corresponding blur on the object and on other elements of the landscape may allow the calculation of a possible range
  for the distance of the object.</p>
<p>In the case of a color photograph, one should carry out the above procedures in three steps using three appropriate
  color filters for scanning.</p>
<p>If an event is recorded on a cine camera, each frame may be analyzed as above. However, it is now possible to obtain
  additional information by combining and comparing the sequence of images.</p>
<p>In principle, images recorded by video cameras may be subjected to comparable analyses. However, video records suffer
  from one very important weakness: since the basic data is in electronic form, it could have been modified by the use
  of suitable electronic equipment, so that the authenticity of a video record will depend even more critically upon the
  credibility of the witness testimony.<a id="A3"> </a></p>
<h2><a id="A3"></a>Annexe 3 : Vol en formation</h2>
<p><b>V. R. Eshleman</b></p>
<p>A recurrent theme in certain UFO reports is the concept of an apparition that flies in formation with an
  aircraft-borne observer. Without making a judgment on any such reports, we could recommend that UFO investigators
  familiarize themselves with natural phenomena that display this "flying-in-formation" characteristic. Greenler (1980)
  is a useful resource, from which the attached list was made. The precise mechanisms for the origin of most of these
  phenomena have been determined and are explained in Greenler, but quite a few have still not been deciphered
  satisfactorily. Even an experienced observer might be surprised in seeing a particularly rare example. I have studied
  certain related phenomena in my research involving electromagnetic probing of planetary atmospheres, but was quite
  astonished a few years ago when I saw a particular example of the following list. A bright white light flew for
  minutes in perfect formation between my aircraft and the ground, with the air below and above apparently being
  transparently clear. </p>
<p>Formation flying phenomena:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arcs: Kern, Lowitz, Wegener anthelic, Hastings anthelic, Tricken anthelic, Parry, alternate Parry, suncave Parry,
    sunvex Parry, upper tangent, lower tangent, supralateral, infralateral, circumzenithal, circumhorizontal, anthelic,
    subanthelic, contact.</li>
  <li>Halos: Hevel, 8 degree, 18 degree, 22 degree, 46 degree, circumscribed.</li>
  <li>Bows: fog, cloud, dew, supernumerary.</li>
  <li>Rainbows: primary and secondary; direct and reflected; raindrop and ice crystal; white, red, and red-to-blue.</li>
  <li>Pillars: sun, moon, city-light, anthelic.</li>
  <li>Rings or Circles: Bishop, Bottlinger, parhelic, subparhelic, coronal.</li>
  <li>Dogs: sun, moon, elongated, subsun.</li>
  <li>One should also consider: Nighttime: moon, Venus, Jupiter, bright stars, etc., gegenschein, zodiacal light, comet,
    in-cabin light reflected by window.</li>
  <li>Other forms: glory (specter of the Brocken), subsun, wet and dry heiligenschein, seven suns, lenticular and other
    distant small clouds, several different kinds of mirages.</li>
</ul>
<p>The phenomenon which was a special surprise to me is one in the final grouping, the subsun, due to particularly
  stably falling, flat, horizontal, hexagonal, ice crystals which were sufficiently few in number that the air appeared
  clear in every direction except the solar specular direction to the side of and below the airplane, where they
  efficiently mirrored the sun.<a id="A4"> </a></p>
<h2><a id="A4"></a>Annexe 4 : Electromagnetic-Wave Ducting</h2>
<p><b>V. R. Eshleman</b></p>
<p>It is possible that some of the radar cases presented to the panel have a natural explanation. It seems likely that
  some possible natural explanations could be investigated without cooperation or assistance from the controlling
  military authorities except for a time record of unidentified traces that occur during designated test periods.</p>
<p>Some of the observations suggest that time-variable atmospheric ducting may on occasion result in echoes being
  obtained from distant ground locations as a result of refraction. Some of accounts described (a) groups or swarms of
  echoes that persist for some time in the same general location; (b) apparent trajectories of echo sources that exhibit
  sudden changes in the vertical and/or horizontal positions; and in particular (c) the tendency of apparent echo
  sources to concentrate over mountain tops. These are all characteristics to be expected of ducting conditions due to
  weather. These effects can come and go over long periods of time and they can also lead to scintillation or other
  changes over short time periods. (See, for instance, Hall &amp; Barklay 1989.) </p>
<p>An atmosphere is said to be "superrefractive" when a horizontal light or radio ray curves downward with a radius of
  curvature that is less than the distance to the center of the planet. The atmosphere of the planet Venus is at all
  times globally superrefractive below an altitude of about 30 kilometers. In principle, echoes could be obtained from
  every area of the spherical surface of Venus from a radar system located at any position on the surface. If the air of
  Venus were perfectly clear, an observer would see all areas of the surface, all areas repeating in range to indefinite
  distances. In the four giant planets also, the large gradients of refractivity (or density) in their atmospheres
  produce superrefractive conditions. </p>
<p>The Earth's atmosphere is normally not superrefractive. However, common weather effects (in particular thermal
  inversions, where the air temperature increases with altitude, and/or the water-vapor content decreases with altitude)
  can and do produce regions of superrefraction that are localized geographically and in height. As a result,
  atmospheric ducts (channels that trap and conduct radar waves) can form that carry the signals far beyond the normal
  horizon. Such ducts can bend rays down to a distant surface area or, more easily, to a distant mountain top.
  Backscattering of the radar energy from the ground or from discrete objects on the ground then results in echoes that
  appear to the radar to be due to a target that is far away and (if the angle of elevation of the returning energy is
  measured) high in the atmosphere. A similar transient ducting of sound can produce the experience of hearing the
  whistle of only one particular train out of the many that originate at difference times from a busy track in the next
  valley.</p>
<p>As is well known, atmospheric ducting is the explanation for certain optical mirages, and in particular the arctic
  illusion called "fata morgana" where distant ocean or surface ice, which is essentially flat, appears to the viewer in
  the form of vertical columns and spires, or "castles in the air."</p>
<p>People often assume that mirages occur only rarely. This may be true of optical mirages, but conditions for radar
  mirages are more common, due to the role played by water vapor which strongly affects the atmospheric refractivity in
  relation to radio waves. Since clouds are closely associated with high levels of water vapor, optical mirages due to
  water vapor are often rendered undetectable by the accompanying opaque cloud. On the other hand, radar propagation is
  essentially unaffected by the water droplets of the cloud so that changes in water vapor content with altitude are
  very effective in producing atmospheric ducting and radar mirages.</p>
<p>With regard to "impossible" flight paths that may appear to be indicated by some of the echoes obtained by military
  radars, it is important to note that the records presented to the panel are based on measured time delays and measured
  elevation and azimuth angles-of-arrival of the reflected energy from the echoing object. As presented, certain target
  positions were plotted as height versus time. But height is computed from two parameters: (1) the measured time delay,
  which is a very good indication of range; and (2) the measured vertical angle of arrival, which may not be a valid
  representation of the vertical direction to the target. In particular, when ducting occurs, reflections from distant
  and distinct surface targets (buildings, bridges, trucks, etc.) may be received at elevation angles of several
  degrees, so that a ground target at a range of 100 kilometers, for example, would appear to represent an object at a
  height of several kilometers. Atmospheric turbulence would distort the duct and could cause sudden changes in angle of
  perhaps a few tenths of a degree, which would be interpreted as a sudden change in altitude of the order of half a
  kilometer. The horizontal angle of arrival would also be affected by turbulence, adding to the chaotic character of
  the apparent flight path. </p>
<p>Ducting to and from distant mountain tops requires less refractive bending than echoes to and from lower surface
  areas, and should therefore be more common. This may explain the concentration of apparent targets over mountains. A
  test of this hypothesis would be to place a radio receiver, tuned to the radar frequency, on or near the top of a
  mountain associated with unidentified targets. It should be connected to an antenna that has its unobstructed
  receiving lobe centered in the azimuthal direction of the radar and its vertical pattern extending from zero to at
  least several degrees in elevation. If ducting does in fact occur, the occurrence of unidentified radar echoes would
  be found to be correlated with major increases in the strengths of the radar signals measured by this receiver.<a

<h2><a id="A5"></a>Annexe 5 : Sprites</h2>
<p><b>V. R. Eshleman</b></p>
<p>One of the optical displays reported by E. Strand may be of special significance as a tentative bridge across the
  wide gulf that exists between the UFO and scientific communities.</p>
<p>Two women reported an unusual, colored, intermittent light display that slowly moved over two hours of observation
  made from a remote cabin in Norway in the post-midnight hours of August 3, 1991. The sky was clear until the end of
  the observation period, when a few clouds moved in. The key point about this display is that while there was no local
  thunderstorm activity, there was an electrical storm in the direction of the display, but the storm was 120 kilometers
  away. For decades, it has been conventional scientific wisdom that all of the visible electrical activity of such
  storms is within and below the clouds, that in this case would have been below the observers' horizon.</p>
<p>Recent developments in the observations and theory of electrical activity in the high atmosphere (mesosphere and low
  ionosphere) demonstrate that this conventional wisdom is in error (see, for instance, Pasko <i>et al.</i>, 1996;
  Sentman &amp; Wescott, 1995). Some of the reports of observations in the Hessdalen area could be related to phenomena
  that occur above storms, up to an altitude of nearly 100 kilometers, well above the observers' horizon. This
  electrical activity goes by the names of "blue jets," " red sprites," and "short-lived elves." There have in fact been
  sporadic reports of these phenomena decades ago, but these reports were dismissed by the "experts." Now these events
  have been captured on film and video. </p>
<p>This example can serve to remind us of the continual development and change that occurs in all fields of scientific
  knowledge, and of the potential advantages of open communication between the purported experts and interested amateur
  observers.<a id="A6"> </a></p>
<h2><a id="A6"></a>Annexe 6: Le SETI et les investigations d'ovnis comparés</h2>
<p><b>V. R. Eshleman</b></p>
<p>My perception is that the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) and UFO studies of a decade ago shared
  positions beyond the pale of "respectable" science. They no doubt still do in the view of many scientists. However
  there have been several fundamental advances during the past few years that indirectly provide some increase in
  plausibility for both areas, and the SETI community seems to be responding with renewed vigor. It may be useful for
  our panel to consider some UFO-SETI comparisons, and the different cultures of their respective participants. These
  are my personal and incomplete thoughts on this subject. </p>
<p>There have been recent advances concerning the question of the possible existence and state of extraterrestrial life
  (ETL). Knowledge that there is such life would increase the presumptive probability of extraterrestrial intelligent
  life (ETIL). SETI investigators search for the latter mainly by examining the radio spectrum for telltale
  electromagnetic signals that may be purposely sent or inadvertently leaked from a technological society. UFO
  investigators may invoke visitation by ETIL as a fallback or default explanation of an apparition or event which they
  believe cannot be explained any other way. There are huge gaps in our knowledge that must be filled in before we can
  pretend to understand either of these subjects.</p>
<p>With regard to the first question, the existence and possible abode of ETL, three major recent developments are of
  particular note:</p>
<ol>
  <li> It is only in the last few years that we have finally obtained direct evidence of the existence a planetary-sized
    body orbiting a star other than our Sun. We now have evidence for several (of order of 10), and more are being
    discovered as the Doppler observational technique is being improved. There are billions of stars in our galaxy
    alone, and these results suggest that stars may quite generally be accompanied by planets. One may expect that
    conditions on these planets would vary over a wide range, at least as wide as the range covered by the planets of
    our solar system. (See, for instance, Cosmovici et al., 1997.)</li>
  <li> Life that is fundamentally different from nearly all near-surface life on Earth has been found deep in
    terrestrial rock and in the deep ocean, where it exists under conditions long assumed to be so hostile as to be
    sterile. It would appear that near-surface and subterranean life forms are essentially independent and that either
    could exist without the other. It is also possible that life started several different times on Earth after epochs
    of total extinction caused by asteroidal and cometary impacts. These new findings suggest that life might have
    started independently at two levels on Earth, or that life can adapt to extraordinarily different environments. The
    development of life, under conditions that are thought to be favorable and under conditions that we previously
    thought to be unfavorable, may be the rule rather than the exception for the innumerable planets that probably exist
    in our galaxy. (See, for instance, Cosmovici et al., 1997.)</li>
  <li> A meteorite found in Antarctica and known to have come from Mars (from isotopic "fingerprinting" of its elements)
    has several detailed internal characteristics (structural, chemical, and elemental) that may, it is claimed, be
    attributed to effects of ancient microscopic life indigenous to Mars. (McKay et al.,1996). This interpretation is
    controversial and research on this and other meteorites is continuing. </li>
</ol>
<p>These subjects are currently being investigated widely and were featured among the many areas discussed at an
  international meeting in July 1996 held in Capri, Italy, on the subject of Astronomical and Biochemical Origins and
  the Search for Life in the Universe (Cosmovici <i>et al.,</i>1997). About 200 astronomers, biologists, chemists,
  physicists, and other scientists from 27 countries met for this Fifth International Conference on Bioastronomy and
  Colloquium No. 161 of the International Astronomical Union. This meeting was supported by international and national
  scientific organizations including the International Astronomical Union, the International Scientific Radio Union, the
  National Aeronautical and Space Administration, the European Space Agency, the Consiglio Nazionale delle Richerche,
  and other Italian organizations; clearly, this was a mainstream scientific meeting. The SETI community was very
  visibly represented in all aspects of the conference, but the problem posed by UFO reports was never mentioned.</p>
<p>However, the UFO and SETI communities share defining attributes including a surfeit of putative evidence that remains
  unidentified, and the lack of a single example that can be unequivocally verified, repeated, understood, or captured.
  That is, both are subject areas of investigation that totally lack identified objects. Then why is one moving into the
  mainstream of acceptable science while the other is not?</p>
<p>It may not be generally realized that the several different groups of SETI observers have received and tabulated an
  appreciable number of URS, or unidentified radio signals, in the course of listening to billions of radio channels for
  hundreds of thousands of hours, looking in tens of thousands of directions. They measure signals that are noise and
  signals that range up to many times stronger than can be explained in terms of natural noise. They identify nearly all
  of the strong signals as coming from radio and TV stations, from military radars and various kinds of communications
  systems, from satellites and deep space probes launched by various national and international organizations, and from
  many kinds of equipment that leak electromagnetic energy over broad spectral bands. After very thoughtful and vigorous
  winnowing, there has been a residual number of strong signals received by every group that are, and will no doubt
  remain, unidentified. But these are not described and released to the media as something unusual or mysterious. This
  is because they could not be verified by other observers or by repeat observations at the same frequency and in the
  same direction in the sky. Improved techniques and protocols are being developed to markedly reduce the frequency of
  URS (even to the point where there may be concern that a real ETI signal could be discarded). Nevertheless, it is to
  be expected that continuing URS will persist in the SETI endeavor, and will remain unidentified and undiscussed.</p>
<p>The SETI participants include a large fraction of scientifically trained radio astronomers, and they employ complex
  and expensive equipment that includes the largest antennas and most sensitive electronic and digital systems in the
  world. The UFO community is much broader and diverse, and cannot bring to bear the instrumental firepower that is
  routine in SETI research. In fact, no equipment is involved in most UFO case studies. The nature of UFO phenomena is
  such that it would be unreasonable to demand repeat observations of the same kind of incident and independent
  confirmation of events by different observers.</p>
<p>However, the status of UFO studies may be improved if we can find a way to move in a direction where independent
  confirmation and repeatability could be realized and become routine. Where some level of repeatability exists but
  explanations are incomplete (<i>e.g.,</i> in the Hessdalen project), more investigative resources are clearly
  required. Open channels of communication between UFO investigators and a broader scientific group may lead to natural
  explanations of many observations and thereby winnow the numerous reports to a few notable examples to which intense
  cooperative efforts could be applied.<a id="A7"> </a></p>
<h2><a id="A7"></a>Annexe 7 : Autres réflexions sur le SETI et les investigations ovni</h2>
<p><b><a href="/people/l/LouangeFrancois.html">F. Louange</a></b></p>
<p>The SETI and UFO problems may or may not be related to each other. As there does not so far exist any proof
  concerning this question, it seems wise to keep those two problems apart and not to confuse them. The questions raised
  by the UFO and SETI problems are not at all comparable, and the strategies for their research are drastically
  different. The SETI problem corresponds to a one-bit theoretical question: does there exist, elsewhere in the
  universe, any form of intelligence that has reached the technological level of transmitting intelligent
  electromagnetic signals that humans could detect and identify? Although this question is undoubtedly exciting and
  justified by existing probabilistic computations about the existence of planets, the appearance of life, the duration
  of a civilization, etc., the final answer is theoretically Yes or No. However, only a Yes answer will be final, since
  a No answer may be revised in view of technical improvements of detection techniques. </p>
<p>The UFO problem arises from the verified existence of a very large and coherent set of testimonies worldwide. Its
  approach is bound to be in three steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Step 1. Try by all means to identify the stimulus that has led to the report: the report may be due to inadequate
    information, misinterpretation of a familiar phenomenon or device, an unusual astronomical or atmospheric
    phenomenon, an unusual technological device, or a hoax (perpetrated by the reporter or on the reporter). </li>
  <li>Step 2. If Step 1 has not yielded an explanation of the report, try to characterize the event that led to the
    report and compare it with other case descriptions. </li>
  <li>Step 3. For any case that is strong in testimony and rich in detail, one should try to define a model. In this
    activity, we are clearly not dealing with a simple question with a Yes /No (one-bit) answer. Different cases require
    analyses with different levels of complexity. </li>
</ol>
<p>The SETI and UFO problems also involve different approaches. Scientists may pursue the SETI project and remain in a
  very familiar environment: the relevant technological area is clearly identified and one may follow a predefined
  strategy by specifying the frequency search band, the required receiver sensitivity, the intrinsic properties of an
  intelligent signal, etc. On the other hand, research on the UFO problem is necessarily complex, multidisciplinary,
  unpredictable and must be expected to evolve as research progresses. The basic detection is usually carried out by
  unprepared human beings, and analysis may call upon a wide range of disciplines including human perception,
  psychology, astronomy, image processing, physics, chemistry, etc. Moreover, effective research in this field must be
  conducted with an open mind.</p>
<p>Although in public opinion the UFO and SETI projects are closely associated, they should be kept clearly separated as
  far as serious research is concerned. The questions being addressed are quite different in nature: the SETI project
  aims at a simple Yes/No answer to the question of the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence, whereas research
  into the UFO project must be pursued with a completely open mind as to the questions that need to be posed and
  answered. Moreover, the respective technical strategies have nothing in common: SETI research is carried out primarily
  within the established framework of radio astronomy, whereas UFO research is necessarily multidisciplinary and
  innovative.</p>
<h2><a id="A8"></a>Annexe 8 : Inférence scientifique</h2>
<p><b><a href="/people/SturrockPeterA/index.html">P. A. Sturrock</a></b></p>
<p>In attempting to resolve a complex problem such as that posed by UFO reports, one is very much in the "gray area" of
  scientific research that is not well defined: the facts are to some extent shaky; some of the hypotheses are
  speculative; and it is not clear how to evaluate the hypotheses on the basis of the facts and of other relevant
  information. Furthermore, one has the difficulty of relating the analysis of individual reports ("Is this report due
  to a hoax?") to the global questions represented by the hypotheses ("Are some reports due to hoaxes?"). In such a
  situation, it is essential to have some way to organize one's analysis of whatever research is being conducted.
  Scientific inference is the intellectual basis of science, and the procedures of scientific inference offer a
  framework for organizing such analyses. (See, for instance, Good, 1950; Jeffreys, 1973.) </p>
<p>The formalism of scientific inference involves expressing all judgments in terms of probabilities. Where there are
  definite rules for deriving probabilities from the evidence, these rules can be used; otherwise, the probabilities may
  be regarded as subjective. If each judgment is made by several investigators, this can provide both a mean or
  consensus estimate and a measure of the degree of uncertainty of that estimate. For a recent exposition of this
  formalism, see for instance Sturrock (1994d).</p>
<p>In investigating any specific case, it is necessary to work with a complete and mutually exclusive set of hypotheses.
  The following set of 8 hypotheses was used in Sturrock's survey of the members of the American Astronomical Society
  (Sturrock, 1994a; 1994b; 1994c):</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li type="a">Canular</li>
  <li type="a"> Some well established phenomenon or device, </li>
  <li type="a"> Some well established but unfamiliar natural phenomenon, </li>
  <li type="a"> Some unfamiliar terrestrial technological device, </li>
  <li type="a"> Some hitherto unknown natural phenomenon, </li>
  <li type="a"> A technological device not of terrestrial origin, </li>
  <li type="a"> Some other cause which [the investigator] can specify, and </li>
  <li type="a"> Some other cause which [the investigator] cannot specify. </li>
</ol>
<p>An investigator may begin by assigning "prior probabilities" to these hypotheses, although this is not essential. If
  so, each value must be greater than zero and less than unity, and they must sum to unity. Once these prior
  probabilities have been assigned, the investigator should then forget about his prejudices. Bayes' theorem then
  provides a mechanism for updating one's assessment of probabilities on the basis of new evidence. The new evidence may
  be a single case or an analysis of a catalog of cases. When measurements are made in terms of "log-odds" defined by
  log[(<i>p</i>/(1 - <i>p</i>)] rather than the probability <i>p</i>itself, it turns out that investigators with very
  different prejudices should assign the same weight of evidence, measured by the change in log-odds, to the same
  experimental or observational data. Hence, although they may differ in their prejudices, they should be able to agree
  in their assessments of the evidence.</p>
<p>It is even more convenient to work in terms of the quantity 10*log[<i>p</i>/(1-<i>p</i>)], since one may then use the
  familiar engineering term "db" or "decibel" to represent an assessment. For instance, if one begins with the
  assessment that the probability of an event being due to an extraterrestrial vehicle is 10<sup>-6</sup>, one could
  rephrase that as saying "my assessment is -60 db." If a certain research program made that proposition even more
  unlikely by, say, 10 db, one would then lower that assessment to -70 db. If, on the other hand, the evidence seemed to
  support that hypothesis with weight 10 db, the resulting assessment would be -50 db. If six separate and completely
  independent studies were each to yield evidence of 10 db, the investigator would end up with an assessment of 0 db,
  which represents even odds of the proposition being true. That is, the evidence would have been just sufficient to
  change the mind of the investigator from being highly skeptical about the hypothesis to considering it just as likely
  to be true as not true. </p>
<p>It is highly unlikely that any research project that is in operation for only one or two years will solve the UFO
  problem. However, it could and should provide useful relevant evidence, and that evidence should lead to a measurable
  change in the assessments of an interested scientist. In an area such as that of UFO research, that is all that can be
  expected. On the other hand, several research projects, each lasting a reasonable length of time, should provide
  sufficient evidence that an hypothesis may be effectively definitely established or definitely rejected.</p>
<p>If these suggestions are considered to have merit, they could be developed into a more specific and more useful form
  by means of a workshop that brings together UFO investigators, professional investigators (of accidents, failures,
  etc.), physical scientists, and statisticians.</p>
