<p class="question">Colonel, you retired... from the Brazilian Air Force in 1992, five years ago. Didn't it occur to you
  to talk to UFO Researchers before and Report what you are living with?</p>
<p class="answer">I have talked to UFO Researchers. I talked a lot with Bob Pratt and when he came to Brazil, he always
  contacted me. I talked to Irene Granchi and to Rafael Sempere Durá, so several UFO Researchers.</p>
<p class="answer">But I never took the initiative to speak on television and I was never asked to write about it or to
  write a book on it. I wasn't interested in doing it so this wasn't a motivation for me at the time.</p>
<p class="answer">Today, I think differently, I think something must be said.</p>
<p class="question">Do you think this subject should be spread out?</p>
<p class="answer">It must be explained, it's like I said to you, I'm turning sixty. After a while I'm seventy years old
  and then I die and it's all over.</p>
<p class="question">When you came to UFO Magazine to give your statements, did you trust the Magazine to promote what
  you're saying without distortions?</p>
<p class="answer">Look, I'll talk about Gevaerd. Many years ago, I was talking with Gevaerd. Between 1987 and 1988.
  Around that time. So, I talked with Gevaerd, we talked and I couldn't authorize any publication whatsoever. I asked
  for it and it was obeyed. So, years later, things changed. I was retired, I was able to speak without complications.
  Without any immediate problems for the Air Force and myself and knowing the seriousness of the Magazine, of Gevaerd
  and the friends who, I know, that collaborate with the Magazine. I know some of them. It gives me peace of mind to
  speak, because there's no sensationalism. There's no sensationalism to publish the story for the sole reason of sales,
  to sell the subject.</p>
<p class="question">But, publish to clarify the subject.</p>
<p class="answer">Exactly. Thank you very much. There's no monetary interest in it.</p>
<p class="question">Colonel, how did it all start for you? What was the initial spark? What was your interest in
  Ufology? Was it before Operation Prato?</p>
<p class="answer">No. See, around 1952 to 1953, I was 12 to 13 years old. I was at the window of my house in Belém, and
  a very large Object appeared, a Very Bright Light, over the city. I saw it, and then the next day, it was published on
  the journal that it was over a Federation of Juvenile Scouts in Belém called F.E.I.J. There was a swimming
  competition, and everybody saw it and I, as a kid, saw something that was on the news the next day.</p>
<p class="question">And that sparked your interest?</p>
<p class="answer">I've always believed in Extra-Terrestrial life. I always believed in the possibility that they had the
  curiosity to observe us, to investigate us. A planet with life and an Extra-Terrestrial intelligence observing.</p>
<p class="question">Even without direct contact. Did you enlist in the Air Force because of that interest?</p>
<p class="answer">No, I've always had a great passion for aviation, and for the Military life.</p>
<p class="question">And as an Air Force Aviator, you were Head of COMAR's 1st Management Department.</p>
<p class="answer">I was.</p>
<p class="question">What were your duties in that position?</p>
<p class="question">I gave administrative and financial support to the command's actions.</p>
<p class="question">What about the Information Services Operation Section Known as A2 Aeronáutica, of which you headed
  as well.</p>
<p class="answer">Yes, it was very connected to State Security. Very connected to State Security. Based on the
  subversive movements and xenophobic ideologies that arrived here and that effervescence right after the 1964
  revolution, the terrorists actions and communist parties and things like that. We had to fight that. It was about
  State Security</p>
<p class="question">You had another pretty interesting function as you were head of the Sky Special Operations Service.
  You must have many interesting experiences to tell.</p>
<p class="answer">The Brazilian Air Force had an old idea, to make a frontier collar. The idea came from a Brigadier who
  had a great knowledge of the Amazon. A very intelligent person, Brigadier Camarão. João Camarão Telles Ribeiro. He had
  that idea of a "border collar", that is, every 125 miles (200 Km) of the border, a landing field with a Religious
  Mission, Protestant or Catholic, and an Indigenous Group.</p>
<p class="answer">An assistance, with a landing field, a Religious Group to give assistance. And the Air Force
  supporting all of this. I as a Parachutist, I also had a greater ease and adaptability to this type of Mission. I’ve
  done many missions in the Jungle, many missions in the Jungle.</p>
<p class="answer">I’ve met with many Indigenous People and many tribes so I have opened many fields.</p>
<p class="question">Cultured Indigenous?</p>
<p class="answer">Cultured and uncultured. And we always worked on some missions very connected to assisting the actions
  of PARA-SAR.</p>
<p class="question">PARA-SAR?</p>
<p class="answer">Air Rescue Squadron, Search and Rescue. Rescue parachutist, Search and Rescue Service.</p>
<p class="question">Have you heard of any kind of discovery related to Archaeology or some observation by the Military
  in the Amazon that was related to this kind of subject?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes. Some colleagues, especially one, who reported seeing something while flying over the middle of
  the Jungle. He was surprised by a Pyramidal Formation covered by vegetation and it seems that there had been some
  nucleus of a very old civilization there. Due to the fact that it was abandoned, the Jungle took over. But there was a
  clear Pyramidal Formation with perfect angles of a Pyramid.</p>
<p class="question">Where was this observed? In the state of Amazonas?</p>
<p class="answer">I don't know the precise location, but if I'm not mistaken, it was in the Javari River Region. That
  was reported to me by Colonel Valério. He's still alive.</p>
<p class="question">The Mission Colonel, now that we know a lot about your activities in the Brazilian Air Force. I
  would like to get into the subject of UFO research. Was Operation Prato your first official UFO research within the
  Air Force, or was there something before?</p>
<p class="answer">No, not on my part. My activities were related to State Security. Things that compromised National
  Security. So we had actions against the so called Communist Parties, Guerrilla Formations, groups that did bank
  robberies and kidnappings.</p>
<p class="question">Did you already know about UFO cases that were happening in the Amazon?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes, we heard about it.</p>
<p class="question">Did the Brazilian Air Force show any interest or concern that it represented an External Threat to
  National Sovereignty?</p>
<p class="answer">No, not as an External Threat. It was only seen as a Phenomenon that was doubtful. Some Officers, most
  of them, saw this as a questionable thing and some even made fun of it. They made fun of it. The Operation only
  started, because the Commander at the time, was interested and believed in the subject.</p>
<p class="question">Who was the Commander?</p>
<p class="answer">Protásio Lopes de Oliveira, Brigadier Commander of the 1st Command.</p>
<p class="question">Is he still alive?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes, I think he is. He lives in Belém.</p>
<p class="question">And how did the idea of the Operation come about? Was it your idea, or the Commander's? Did it come
  from the Government?</p>
<p class="answer">No, I wasn't in Belém at that time in 1977. I was serving in Belém, but taking a course in Brasília.
  When I returned from the course, I presented myself to my 2nd Section Boss, and he asked me if I believed in Flying
  Saucers. I didn't even know that this Operation was taking place.</p>
<p class="question">And this Boss was...?</p>
<p class="answer">Colonel Camilo Ferraz de Barros. He asked me: "Do you believe in Flying Saucers?" I said: "Yes." He
  said: "Now you're in charge of this case." Then he gave me the briefcase with the beginning of the Operation, so that
  I could take care of the matter and be in charge of the case.</p>
<p class="question">Where did the idea of the name "Operation Prato" come from? Who had that idea?</p>
<p class="answer">I gave that name because Brazil is the only nation in the World, that calls Flying Saucers "Flying
  Discs".</p>
<p class="answer">The French calls it "Soucoupes Volantes". Sou-coupes is Saucer so Flying Saucers.</p>
<p class="answer">The Portuguese calls it "Prato Voador".</p>
<p class="answer">The Spanish calls it "Platillos Volantes"</p>
<p class="answer">The English calls it "Flying Saucer".</p>
<p class="answer">I don’t remember what the Russians called it, but its not Flying Discs.</p>
<p class="answer">So it's all related to Saucer. Since we named some Operations with some sort of code, and it couldn't
  be very distant from the real purpose of the Operation, it could not be named Operation Flying Disc. I also didn't
  want to name it Flying Saucer, so I named it after a distant cousin of Saucer which is a Plate.</p>
<p class="question">You said you received a briefcase from your boss, does this mean that there was already some
  investigation happening?</p>
<p class="question">When I arrived from the course, some Agents were already sent to investigate. Why?</p>
<p class="answer">Because that thing was happening a lot in the Colares Region. It's an Island that belongs to the Vigia
  County. It's a Coastal Island with salt water which is on the coast of Pará that is facing the Bay of Marajó.</p>
<p class="answer">The Colare's Mayor, Vigia's Mayor, sent a document or a letter, to the 1st COMAR's Commander because
  these things were bothering the Fishermen a lot. It is a fishing Island there and it was bothering the Fishermen a
  lot. They couldn't fish anymore because it flew around the boats. Sometimes some even dived near the side of the
  boat.</p>
<p class="answer">They spent the night beside fires and lit many fireworks. Festive fireworks, so that when it passed
  over, they would fire at it. With the population terrified, the Mayor asked for help because there was something in
  the air. He went to the 1st COMAR's Command, asking for something to be done and the Brigadier ordered an
  investigation on it.</p>
<p class="question">Was there at any point involvement from the Capital? Inquiry instructions? Did the Capital ask for
  caution?</p>
<p class="answer">I didn't participate at the time as I was a Captain. I only received orders. I didn't participate in
  that. That was between the Brigadier and the Section. The 2nd Section was his. So if there was something, it was
  between him and the Capital. I had to accomplish the Mission he gave me.</p>
<p class="question">So you received a briefcase and started running the Operation. How did you structure it? In which
  divisions, how many people and missions? How did you organize the Operation?</p>
<p class="answer">Well, I was the Boss. Captain at the time, and I had five Agents. Sometimes four, five or six Agents.
  But it was typically five Agents. Sergeants, who worked on the 2nd Section. And on site, in the field but sometimes we
  divided the team into two or three teams. For two or three observation spots. Using walkie-talkies, of course for
  radio communication.</p>
<p class="question">Were the objectives to observe, photograph and film a Flying Saucer? To prove that it exists and
  bring it to light.</p>
<p class="answer">Everybody was talking about it. They nicknamed theses things that were happening "Chupa- Chupa"and it
  was known at the time as "Chupa-Chupa" (Suck-Suck).</p>
<p class="answer">The Air Force needed to know what was really happening. What was happening in Brazilian Airspace. We
  have responsibility over the Brazilian Airspace, as the Navy has over the Territorial Sea of Brazil and the Army has
  over Land Security. Our part had to be done.</p>
<p class="question">What’s the origin of that nickname? What motivated this type of denomination by some of the
  population in relation to the Phenomenon?</p>
<p class="answer">Well, there were a number of Reports from people who were hit by a Light, and who believed that their
  blood had been sucked. So, we went to check, and they were mainly women, who had a mark on the left breast that looked
  like two needle holes.</p>
<p class="answer">They also had a brown stain around it that looked like an iodine burn. People said that some of their
  blood had been sucked. A small portion of the blood had been drawn. They started calling it "Chupa-Chupa" because of
  that fact. A Light came and fell on the person, usually on the left breast of women. In men it was on the arm or on
  the leg.</p>
<p class="question">What was the proportion? How many men to how many women?</p>
<p class="answer">For every 10 people, 8 were women.</p>
<p class="question">Did you document the Physical Effects, the marks on the people?</p>
<p class="answer">Everything was documented and it was seen and analysed by doctors.</p>
<p class="question">Were the doctors part of the Operation?</p>
<p class="answer">Some went with us. I don't recall their names.</p>
<p class="question">When you started your vigils, did you have immediate verification by filming, or something like
  that?</p>
<p class="answer">No, I'm going to tell you that, honestly, I came in as the Devil's Advocate. I went in to demystify it
  all and to say that this thing did not exist. Let's say it was like a collective hallucination. That something was
  really being seen, but it was nothing Extra-Terrestrial.</p>
<p class="question">What did you imagine it was?</p>
<p class="answer">I don't know. Birds. The plumage of an owl reflecting the moonlight. Something of that nature.</p>
<p class="question">But never Extra-Terrestrial?</p>
<p class="answer">I couldn’t even imagine what it was, but I didn't believe that I could see it either. So, I went to
  see if it really was what they said.</p>
<p class="question">After how long did you have this confirmation?</p>
<p class="answer">I spent two months saying no to my Commander. I spent the week there, and came back at the weekend to
  spend some time with the family.</p>
<p class="question">Did you spend whole weeks in the Jungle?</p>
<p class="answer">I would come back at the weekend and my answer to the Commander was no.</p>
<p class="answer">He asked: "Did you see something?"</p>
<p class="answer">No. I saw Lights. Blinking Lights that passed. But nothing, never, it was really very strange. I
  couldn't say what it was. I didn't see it. I saw Lights. But I didn't know what they were.</p>
<p class="question">And that was during the night?</p>
<p class="answer">During the night yes!</p>
<p class="question">Did you have any activities related to the Operation during the day?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes. We interviewed people. Prepare the places that we could go to at night. If we knew that the night
  before it showed up somewhere, we would have a lot of information about that place. So the probable next incidence
  would be there, and we would go there. In the place most likely for something to happen.</p>
<p class="question">Did you also monitor the facts by collecting information from witnesses?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes, always collecting the name of the person.</p>
<p class="question">Did you have your own form, a Collection Methodology?</p>
<p class="answer">We always put the person's name, the location, the time, how it went, a profile description of each
  event. If in the same location where it happened there was three cases that night then we would hear from the three
  individuals.</p>
<p class="question">What kind of description did they give? What was the most common?</p>
<p class="answer">There was some strange ones, that we would later verify that they really had happened.
  Dematerialization of entire walls and roofs.</p>
<p class="question">How so?</p>
<p class="answer">The first lady I interviewed in Colares, I had left Belém by helicopter to Colares. We landed in
  Umbituba to collect the data. It is close to Colares so we took off by helicopter to go to Colares. We arrived in
  Colares and I went to hear from a lady who had been burned by the so-called "Chupa-Chupa". I saw the mark. She showed
  me her left breast. There was a brown stain, as if it were a burn and two perforation dots. Sometimes it's just
  one.</p>
<p class="answer">When we were talking to her, she described that she was sitting on a hammock putting a child to sleep
  and the environment suddenly started to change temperature. It started to get a strange temperature. She thought that
  it was strange, but she never imagined what would happen next.</p>
<p class="answer">While lying in the hammock, she saw that the roof started to turn reddish, as if you had gotten a
  cigar close to a sheet of paper. It was getting reddish and then she could see the sky. The roof had disappeared. It
  was like glass. She could see the sky so she could see what was on the other side. She was able to see the stars.</p>
<p class="answer">Then I got even more worried and curious. These people seemed to be sincere and from that hole first
  came a green Light and she went a little numb. Then a red beam, a red beam of Light that came down and hit her on the
  breast, her left breast to be precise.</p>
<p class="question">Always on the left side?</p>
<p class="answer">Most of the time. But right when we were talking, while she was explaining it, a girl came and said,
  "It's passing up here."</p>
<p class="answer">In aviation, we divided the sky into eight parts which is a matter of meteorology. That is, a sky with
  zero octaves is clear and without clouds. With one octave there are a few clouds and the scale goes up to eight
  octaves, where the sky is full of clouds.</p>
<p class="answer">That day the sky was, let's say maybe five octaves which would mean that it was almost all covered.
  But, when I left the house I was talking with that lady and I saw a Light pass through a hole in the cloud, that the
  girl was pointing at, with reasonable speed, it was not very fast. It was Blinking, always Blinking. With an
  oscillation of around one second. It went North and I looked at it. It could have even been a satellite. Our
  artificial satellites until 8:30 pm still have the illumination of the sun and it could be emitting that Blinking
  Light by some rotating movement, or something like that. But that Light came back. Soon after it returned and
  satellites don't come back. It got weirder. But I couldn't say that was a Flying Saucer. I wasn't there to say that
  anything that came up was a Flying Saucer. I was there to get this story straight. That was my Mission.</p>
<p class="question">Was there any type of Air Force radar in the region that could confirm or be used to monitor these
  Phenomena?</p>
<p class="answer">No, only at Belém Airport. A Fixed Radar or a fixed Airport Radar.</p>
<p class="question">What does Fixed Radar mean?</p>
<p class="answer">Radar that is part of the Air Traffic Control Service.</p>
<p class="question">These attacks that were happening to people with a certain frequency, were they communicated to the
  State Government, to the State and County Authorities?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes, of course. There were doctors from the Health Department.</p>
<p class="question">Sent by the Government?</p>
<p class="answer">By the Government. They went there to look and examine people.</p>
<p class="question">And did they confirm the facts?</p>
<p class="answer">They saw the burnt spot and examined and took testimony from the patient. But they did nothing
  more.</p>
<p class="question">They didn't do anything! Did people recover easily?</p>
<p class="answer">They were very terrified. Some said they were sick and numb for some days. A Citizen came to look for
  me once a Light had appeared near his house and it focused in his direction. It was no longer that Red Light. It was
  like the Search Light of a helicopter, but it was actually a Craft.</p>
<p class="answer">He ran into his house, took a gun and pointed to where that Light was coming from. A Stronger Light
  came. He fell and went numb. He spent about fifteen days with mobility problems. But there was nothing serious. He was
  not hit by anything. A projectile or anything of that nature. Just a Light that cut off his energy and left him
  without the ability to move.</p>
<p class="question">What about the Federal Authorities, the Federal Government? Were they informed that this kind of
  absurd thing was happening in the region?</p>
<p class="answer">I believe so, but I do not know it. I just received orders from my Commander. Nothing more than
  that.</p>
And did you receive these testimonials from these people right at the beginning of the Operation?
Yes. The sighting
When did you have your first major contact?
You see, we had information that on the Island of Mosqueiro, in a place called Bahia do Sol,
the Island of Mosqueiro is a balneary in Belém. So, we knew that things were happening in
Bahia do Sol which is very close to Colares. It's another Island. Colares is one Island and
Mosqueiro Island is another.
There is Laura's Channel between the Island of Mosqueiro and Colares. You can almost see
Colares from Bahia do Sol and things were happening there. As we were investigating
everything and any indication was researched, we moved to Bahia do Sol.
I was always questioned by the Agents, who had more faith that this was happening than me
because when I arrived things were already in progress. I told you that I was in Brasília. It's
when I returned that they gave me this Mission.
They asked: "But Captain, don't you believe it?"
I said: "No, I don't."
For me it is something that I still need to know what it is. I couldn’t tell you that it's a Flying
Saucer because I’ve never seen a Saucer, I’ve seen Lights. I didn't see a Disc. So for me this is
not a Flying Saucer. It's no proof that I am satisfied with. I'm seeing strange things, but I can't
say what it is.
One of them, Petty Officer Flávio joked: "You don’t want this thing to go around above you,
turn on the Light and do everything, do a fly by round on you just for you to believe.”
I said: "That would be interesting."
It is difficult for a Light like this, something fortuitous, something that can be an owl, to guess
that you're joking like that. And coincidentally, that happened in Bahia do Sol. We were
talking....
What day did that happen?
About November. It was right at the beginning of the Operation in 1977, yes. A Light
appeared, it came from the North, in a North-South direction. In our direction. Average
altitude. And when it arrived, it stopped, it made a circle around and then left. Then they
made fun of me.
The Sergeants asked: "what now?
I said: "I don't know, I haven't seen it yet."
How was the Light?
Do you know these metal welders? A welding torch or an arc welder? When I was a boy, some
people were welding things and there was that Light that we should not look at. A Blue,
Strong Glow. It was like that. A glow of that nature. It was Blue, very Blue.
But could you see?
I saw a Light, not shapes.
Did you photograph those Objects?
Yes, and we wasted two months. Nothing came out of the pictures. We filled the frame with
the Bright Light, we photographed and nothing came out of the pictures. We didn't see
anything, there was nothing in the negatives.
Did this happen much?
Several times, we lost two months. Until a coincidence happened, and I think that there are no
coincidences. But then, it was an unusual event. I was analysing the photos and I was very sad,
very upset. I couldn't print those images in the photographic emulsion and there was a flash
light in my desk that I used in Jungle Operations.
I don't even know why it was there. Maybe because I was reviewing jungle equipment and
maintaining it so the flash light was on my desk. I was looking at the film or the negatives. But
nothing appeared. I was looking at it and I was very upset. We filled the frame and nothing
appeared.
I noticed that the flash Light had in one end a normal leg and at the other end, it had a red
cover. That served as a flare signal, like those little red tail lights on a car. If you removed the
cover, it had a lid and it had opaque glass. I looked at that and remembered that the doctors
examine the radiographs on the radio-scope. Which is an opaque frame with light behind it
and they place the radiograph there to analyse and contrast the light and shadow. So, I
thought, "I have a radio-scope here." I don't even know if that is the name they call this
medical device.
But I took a film, and placed it there and I noticed that there was a point in it. There was an
Object so I wasn't looking for any marks, any Objects. I was looking for a Light and I didn't
see Lights.
I noticed that it actually had a Little Cylinder and that Cylinder was in every film. So I had
managed to print the solid part of that sighting and not the Light. As a matter of wavelength, I
don't know why, the Light did not appear in the film.
But the solid part, the Probe, which we later concluded was a Probe, was actually a Cylinder.
That is what was on the film and I wasn't looking for a Cylinder, I was looking for Light. I
was upset because I saw no Light.
That film had to be very bright, right? Did you take a lot of photographs?
We took a lot of photographs. More than 500.
How many of those had UFOs?
Almost all of them.
Five hundred?
Yes.
And were they all catalogued?
I kept them but I was already very upset because of all those films. They were the result of two
months of work sitting right in front of me and I hadn't achieved anything. There was no
Light in it. I was looking to see in the negative what I had seen with my eyes and it didn't
show. Then we went with a curious look to the laboratory to enlarge it, and it was really a
Probe that was there.
The Probe?
It was a Probe and after we had this technical difficulty in the photographic part, I had help
from a Brother of Freemasonry called Milton Mendonça. He has passed away but he was a
cameraman at Liberal TV. He was smart in photography and I asked for his help because I
trusted him. I knew that if he was participating in the Operation, he would not talk about it
with anyone. I was absolutely sure that the matter would be restricted to our group.
I informed my Commander that I was having technical difficulties with photography. I asked
for Milton’s help and he authorized it. So, Milton was with us a few times and he always
helped. We started using Special Filters such as Infrared and Ultraviolet. I don't know if those
are the right names. We started using Special Filters anyway. We asked the Capital and they
sent the films and equipment to us.
And the result was?
Much better.
Big Objects?
We started to see something, Lights and other shapes that we didn't even imagine could be
printed on the emulsion with these photos.
These Objects that were seen, what was the most common pattern in terms of shape? What patterns
did you see?
At first we saw what everyone was reporting, including Father Alfredo de Lao. He also passed
away, he was an American Priest. He was the Parish Priest of Colares. He told me about a
Probe that he had seen several times, which was more or less the size of a 200 litre oil drum.
This Probe flew with an Irregular Flight, it did not have a straight flight. It flew as if it were
swinging. It emitted Light and sometimes two probes would fly together.
Where did it come from? To where would it go?
Suddenly we saw the Light and it usually came over the team.
Did you notice any kind of interaction in relation to what you were doing and the Phenomenon
itself? Any reaction?
A very strange thing. Your question is very interesting. They seemed to be absolutely sure as
to where we were. They didn't look for us, they would be on top of us. After we were there for
a while, let's say, after a month, things happened right above the team.
They were already on top of us, they knew what we were doing. You could move somewhere
else. If we went from here to there, then that was where they went. As if they were aware of
our movement, they knew with certainty where we were.
And what you were doing?
Yes. For example, this case that I told you about in Bahia do Sol, at that time, people were
already finishing classes and there were a lot of people on the beaches at night.
There was a lot of youths out dating and, let's say, there was about a hundred thousand people
there on the shore at the weekends. It appeared above us in Bahia do Sol. This curve that it
made was in a dark place. There was no one else, just our team there. The thing came and
flew in a curve and the guys joked: "what now?"
Was that the first big event involving you?
I wouldn't say big, but significant.
And then what did you do? Did you run back to the Base?
No, we spent the night there. We only left in the morning. The next day I talked to my
Commander and I said, "Look first", because every time he asked me, I said: "No, I didn't
see anything, only Lights." But this time I reported to him that a strange thing had happened.
Did you have any reaction in your body? Any problem resulting from that observation?
Not at that exact time. We noticed that we all lost overtime. We noticed that we lost visual
acuity. One's glasses fit the other. I could see very well at that time in 1977 as I was 37 years
old. But soon after, we all started to need glasses. Everyone on the team. But this happened
due to other exposures that we had later on.
Colonel, after an event like this that happened several times, as far as I know, did you do a full
Report? Did you have to undergo some kind of exam? What was the destination of these forms?
A Report of the event was made. An account with the time, place if possible, with geographic
coordinates. Everything correct. With mapping of the region. But no personal examination on
us. We were always trusted people to the Command.
I mean, physical examination to see if you had any issues.
No, No!
What about the Commander when he received the news that something had finally happened, that
had you convinced? What did he say? How did he react?
He was more satisfied, more cheerful. His reaction was very pleased.
Did you mention these facts to someone outside of the base, outside of Operation Prato, with your
family, friends in Belém?
My wife knew about the things I was doing, I talked to her. I talked to my brother. But outside
of that, no, and I even asked for their discretion. They asked me: "What do you want me to
say when someone calls looking for you, will I say that you are doing some Operation?”. But
they already knew what I was doing as I was known in the area. My family is well known on
the Mosqueiro Island.” Look, someone even said that, “I saw your brother there on the
Mosqueiro Island and he was there watching the 'chupa-chupa' thing.” So my brother asked
me and I couldn't say that I wasn't seeing it. I saw it but I was there on a Mission.
Did these facts continue to repeat themselves? New major observations? What else can you
remember to tell us?
Well, as Bahia do Sol had been a very favourable place, we started to visit it much more often.
With much more assiduity. We had friends at the National Intelligence Service, SNI. The SNI
has nothing to do with this. This is a matter for the Air Force. But the guys who were on the
SNI, who were our acquaintances, were curious to see what was going on. It was on the news a
lot. Everybody in Belém was talking about it. That was what everybody talked about from
morning until night.
About the Air Force Operation?
No, that there were these sightings, and they knew that we were observing it.
Did the people know about the Operation?
They knew it.
About Operation Prato?
They didn't know the name, but they knew the Air Force was looking into it. They knew the
guy was a Sergeant and that I was a Captain. They knew, but they didn't know what we were
doing. They knew that we were looking. The SNI guys asked to go on an Operation with us as
it was close to Belém. So, they asked if they could come too, so I said: "No problem with me."
But ask your boss for permission. The head of SNI at the time was in the Air Force too and he
was my Flight Instructor.
What was his name?
Colonel Filemon, he authorized it. But it wasn't an SNI Operation. It was mere curiosity, like
any other Citizen would have. But they wanted to see it with my team which they knew was
doing serious work from experience and who were in the most likely places to see them.
So they would have no chance of wasting too much time, so they came with us. It was
interesting because my kids had asked me to buy a small Christmas tree. We had a big one but
they wanted a smaller one. It was a child’s thing and I had to get this Christmas tree from a
big supermarket. I forgot the name. "Pão de Açúcar" or something like that, it was part of
"Pão de Açúcar". I am not advertising for "Pão de Açúcar".
So I said that to my team, and Milton Mendonça was there that day and he was a cameraman
at Liberal TV. He was there by mere contribution. He didn't have to go but he just helped us.
He was allowed to be there. It was known to the Command.
We arrived at 6 pm and we set up the photographic equipment, we set up everything. We
stayed in a dark, reserved place. We were watching to see what would come and I said:
"Look, today I'll return early. I have to be in Belém at 8 pm because I have to pick up my
children to buy a little Christmas tree."
At about 6:30 pm, it passed very high and there was Three Luminous Points Aligned. Very
high and with great speed. The speed was, and I'm from the Air Force so I know planes,
was greater than that of any airliner. It was flying very high in the West-East direction. That
is, from the Andes Mountains to the Atlantic. Very high, the three passed at a very high speed.
Well, at 7 pm, more or less, from North to South, that is, from California and Bermuda
Triangle to Brasilia, more or less,.Two Objects passed by us, Two Flashing Lights, aligned
also, one behind the other. They passed in a North-South direction.
We waited a little longer and the SNI guys did not arrive. These friends did not arrive and I
could not wait. Then we started to dismantle our equipment, store it in the boxes and place it
in the car and then they arrived.
I even joked with them and I asked, "What happened? We were supposed to meet at 6 pm
and you arrived after 7 pm."
Then they said: "We had a problem with the exit and such, it was a traffic thing.
Then one of them asked me a stupid question and I said: "Look, it passed a while ago, and if
you were here with me, at 6:30 pm, Three Lights went past that very high up and you would
have seen it. Then at 7 pm it passed again. But, now they're gone.”
He asked: "When do they pass again?"
I said: "I don't know, it doesn't happen a lot.”
He really asked that, and I said: "How the fuck do I know that. Stay here like I do, all fucking
night, looking up.”
But when we were talking about it, one of them said: "Look up here. Look up."
So we did. Then the Brazilian SNI hero shuddered with fear because I looked up and there
was a huge thing on top of us. A Black, Dark Disk. Standing over us. No more than 500 feet
high (150 meters). It was hovering over where we were.
No lights and no noise?
No. There was a Light in the middle which was Yellow to Amber. But it made a noise that
sounded like air conditioning and every now and then it made a bicycle ratchet noise. It made
a noise like you were pedalling backwards. That thing was just standing there with a Light in
the middle. It was a very big thing. I believe it was about 100 feet (30 meters) in diameter.
Standing right over us. We were looking at it and then it started to emit a Very Strong Yellow
Light. That illuminated the floor. Very strong. It repeated this short interval about five times.
What was the reaction of the SNI guys?
No. From everyone, it wasn't just the SNI guys. Look, it was so unusual. I had never seen that.
I was almost two months into this story and it had never appeared to us like that.
We didn't think to open the car and set up the equipment. There was also no time. The
machines were dismantled and stored in the car so we just watched and we were quite scared.
While that thing was Illuminating everything with that Bright Yellow Light. It went out and
lit up again, about five times.
Pulsating?
Yes. There was an interval of about two seconds when it went out. Then after two or three
seconds, it started again.
Was it doing a demonstration for you?
It was a Progressive Light. It was Not Instantaneous Like a Flash, the Light Expanded. Then
it turned back the same way.
I feel like it had something to do with you.
Yeah, it was standing right above us. The place where we were hiding was dark, so nobody
knew we were there. Just us and them, right? Now I know it was only us and them.
Was there participation from other teams, from other Government Agencies?
No, what I know is that there was a leak from that Operation, that incident, from that sighting
incident. I believe that the focus of this was in the Air Club.
Belém Air Club?
Yes, and a team from the Newspaper at the time, I don't know if it still exists. I think that it
was bought. It was the Newspaper Estado do Pará. The Newspaper team went where we went.
They took advantage as they already knew where we were. and that day we were not there, we
were elsewhere. They went to see this thing and it wasn't good for them.
They saw it?
Yes. They saw something and they never came back to see it again either. They swore they
would never do such a thing again. Here's what happened, they saw a Light approaching, and
That Light came in very low. It entered this channel that I told you about between Mosqueiro
Island and Colares, Laura's Channel. They call it Laura's Mouth. It entered this Channel.
They took the car and followed. That Light went towards them. In their direction and it
focused on them. They were in the car and the Roof of the Car Became Translucent.
Transparent too, just like before?
Just like it, as if it were glass. They were seeing the sky. It passed, stopped, focused on them
with a Very Strong Light and they photographed it.
But it wasn't published?
It was published. On an entire page of the Newspaper, or two. With an incredible sharpness.
After the scare that they got, some of them even seem to have had a vomiting outbreak. Some
lost emotional control. They got into the car and they drove away. A day or two later this was
published in the Newspaper.
A vast Report but you can get more information about this article with Pinon. It is easy to find
him at the Belém Air Club. He was a Pilot. Commander Pinon. He was very close to a person
who is close to us.
From the Magazine?
No, a Businessman. From São Paulo, José Luís Leandro Martins. I think he is not a
contemporary of yours, he is more recent.
Anyway, did you at some point during Operation Prato, well, you were always sending Reports to
your boss, but at some point did you ask if you could inform the population about it?
No, we didn't ask because we knew that it was not possible. This question wouldn't be
applicable to the Command because that was a different subject. We collected data and gave it
to the Commander.
Was this treated confidentially?
Yes. We had to collect data, document it, photograph it, film it if possible and inform the
Commander. From there he decided the destination.
Do you have any idea of what was made with that material?
Of course, we treated it and classified it.
And after you did that, it was informed to the Commander and after that it was archived. Stored
inside 1st COMAR?
Yes.
Would that go to the Capital?
Yes, later. It was informed to the Capital.
What was their reaction?
They didn't believe it. They even made fun of it.
Were you aware that the Air Force had already instituted a UFO Research System... almost ten years
before that in 1969, which was called Unidentified Aerial Objects Investigation System (SIOANI)?
At that time I was a lieutenant at the Belém Air Force Base and they distributed several
informative booklets. SIOANI, OANI or something like that. They were asking the officers
who were interested to give information about it and make reports. They were asking them to
give statements on the subject and it died soon after that in 1968, if I'm not mistaken. Around
that time.
Was there ever participation of US Military Personnel asking for information or wanting to
exchange information, or coming to Brazil to monitor your work?
Not to my knowledge.
Or the work of any other team?
Not that I know of. If that happened, it was at the top. I was Captain, I didn't get involved in
it. You wouldn't know.
Did the incidence of this Phenomenon become daily?
It was daily. Very active.
So, you detected various types of Objects? Probes? Crafts?
Later, we came to verify that there was at least Nine Shapes which we were able to determine
and classify the shapes of the Crafts. Some were Probes and from one photograph it looked
like a Bigger Ship that had Smaller Ships coming out of it. Another one had those Little Ships
coming back to the Bigger Craft as if it were a Mother-Ship receiving Smaller Ships or
Probes.
Was that documented, photographed?
It was, and filmed too.
What equipment did you use to record all of this material?
Cameras. I can't say what it was. Nikon, I don't know. Cameras with telephoto lenses of
300mm and 1000 mm. The 1000 mm ones were horrible to work with because they get out of
focus quickly. Any slip, any movement, gets you out of focus. It was horrible, a monstrosity. A
thing of that size, it was huge. We were not able to use it very much. Even focusing with it was
difficult.
What about camcorders?
Yes.
Any other type of instrument?
Recorders.
To record your reactions?
The Possibility of recording some noise or something like that.
Did you expect these Crafts to contact you? Was that one of the objectives of Operation Prato?
Look, we were exposed to everything. To tell you the truth, I'm not doing any mystery or
sensationalism about it. Because I don't care about anything like that. Anything could have
happened but we were in a Military Operation and it was our Military Obligation. If it
happened, it happened on duty.
Were you carrying weapons?
No.
At no time?
At no time.
Didn't you think about taking a gun, just in case?
No, at no point. At no time were we armed. We did not expect it to be necessary. Therefore, it
was never even thought of in the assembly of the Operation, in the logistics part of the
Operation. We had food and transportation but armament was out, weapons were never
thought of.
Was there any expectation at some point during the Operation that this Phenomenon could be
dangerous? In objective terms?
Yes, once. One time the sighting was very strong and I have the details of how it went. But this
thing really happened and I was very afraid that there was going to be an abduction.
How was that?
I don't mean to cut you off but let me make a brief digression. While talking to Rafael
Sempere Durá, Rafael gave me a very strong scolding. He called me crazy and irresponsible.
He said: "You're forbidden and you have a Commander. But I'm also your friend and I'm
forbidding you to do something like that."
We were on a boat that was anchored by a river and the thing stopped in front of us around
230 feet (70 meters) away.
How was that thing?
Well, to answer that question, I have to say why we were there.
So let's hear the full story. Was it Extra-Terrestrial?
I have a friend, who is an Air Force Officer. At the time he was a Captain, Victor. "Victor
Polonês", Victor Jamianiaski. A difficult name, let's just call him Victor, it's easier. He was
very fond of fishing. He was fishing on this nice river to fish. Well, while fishing, he managed
to hear about a case. He knew I was, the entire Air Force knew that we were conducting this
investigation.
He heard about the case of a boy who worked collecting clay for this Pottery Factory. He took
clay from the river for this pottery. He heard about the case that occurred with this boy and
he went to look for me because he knew that I was investigating this.
He told me about Luís and that Pottery Factory which was called Keuffer pottery. From
Paulo Keuffer, the same owner of Foto Keuffer, in Belém. Keuffer, K e u f f e r. He told me
about Luís and I told them to bring him to me. I sent an Agent there with a car to pick him up
because I wanted to talk to him. He told me of an incredible event. While he was harvesting
the clay, he saw traces of game to hunt who were eating the remains of flowers from a
flowering tree. At the riverside. He followed them and he saw where this game was eating. It
was an Alpaca. Do you know what an Alpaca is?
Yes!
There was an Alpaca eating in that place so he thought, "I'm coming back to get this Alpaca,
I'm going to kill this game."
He took the clay to the Pottery Factory, emptied the big canoe. It was a 20 to 30 feet or a 7 to 9
meter vessel. With an inboard engine. He took the clay there, emptied the vessel. He passed by
his house, got a shotgun, and came back during the day. He prepared a camp where he could
stay, in a low tree. He set up a hammock and kept a flash Light and shotgun while waiting for
the game to come by for him to shoot.
It got dark and he was setup in his camp, sitting in his hammock, while waiting to hear some
noise so that he could shoot the Alpaca, when a very Bright Light passed over him. The Light
passed and soon after that it came back and stopped on top of him.
It stopped overhead him and from the centre of that Craft that he described to me which
wasn't a discoid, it was more like a Boeing Cabin or the shape of an Ellipsoid. But from the
Bulge, on the Belly of this Craft a door opened and a Being came down with a Human Form.
So, I asked if it was coming down by ladder, a rope ladder, metal ladder or something like
that.
He said: "No, it came down in a Beam of Light. It came down with the arms open, in a delta
shape. It came down.”
When he saw that Being coming down, he jumped out from where he was and hid nearby,
where he watched. He put a tree branch over his face and watched what was going on.
This Being arrived and had a Red Light in His Hand. It wasn't a flash light that it held, it was
something that maybe was here, like this. A Red Light in the Palm of the Hand.
It went down and scanned his hammock and examined the place where he was. He had the
tree branch in front of his face, so he was hidden but scared to death. This Being later did not
look for him and did not search for where he was now. First it went straight to where he was
before at the hammock and now it was focused on exactly where he was hiding. It was a Red
Light. When he saw that he had been located he ran inside the dense vegetation. The river
there is totally influenced by the tide. It goes down and up according to the tide.
Becomes a black mud?
Yes. He left by the river bank stumbling over logs, roots, and he was having some difficulty
walking. That Being returned to the Ship, and the Ship started to enter the river before it
chased him at low speed. It was inside the river and at the height of the trees. Sometimes even
below the treetops. It was very low on the river and it was following him very slowly.
He was having difficulty walking as he intended to hunt and return with the boat but he did
not board it. If he did, the boat would have just sunk into the mud, due to the low tide. The
boat stayed in a place where it had buoyancy and on that boat there was a nine-year-old boy,
at the time, and a friend of his who took care of the boat.
19
They were fishing for crab as there is a lot of crab in that river. They were fishing for crab and
the guy was listening to a soccer game on the radio and those soccer games usually air at
night. He was listening to that and Luís came screaming. Screaming to get his friends
attention because he wanted to get on the boat and go. But this thing was following behind
him. When he got close he started screaming in despair until the boy caught the attention of
his partner and the guy dropped the radio.
He pointed out: "Look over there." The guy saw it.
But they all saw it and jumped into the water. Instead of helping Luís, they jumped into the
water. They abandoned the boat and Luís, as he no longer had his companions on the boat, he
hid. The other two remained in the water and Luis was hidden in the bush at the side of the
river.
This Craft stopped above the boat. The Being came down. With the same Red Light, it
examined the entire boat. It searched in all the places, it looked, examined the boat and they
saw all of this.
Then the Being went up, went back up to the Ship, it closed and the Ship took of. I talked to
Luís and I said: "I'm going there tomorrow. Tomorrow I want to be in that place. In the same
place you've been, I will go.” So, we went there to see the Ship.
We talked to Paulo Keuffer who was the owner of the Pottery Factory and he authorized it
and we went there. When we arrived, it was about 7 pm and it was raining. It wasn't a
temporal rain, it was a reasonable rain. The Agents went into the Watchman's House at that
Pottery Factory. They went to have a coffee, eat some snacks or whatever but I wasn't going to
worry about coffee as I was the Team Leader. I couldn't be there worrying about coffee or
chatting. I was watching to see if I saw anything, if anything happened.
When I was outside something came but I couldn't see the shape, it was a Dark Thing. I
couldn't see if it was Discoid or whatever. I couldn't. It was raining.
I could see Lights. A strong Green Light and a Red Light. And that thing made a noise. Like
an Air Conditioning Noise, but much stronger. It sounded like a Turbine. That Turbine Noise.
It was not a jet noise, it was the noise of Something Spinning. Do you understand? It was
different. It wasn't a jet noise. It sounded like a Blender. Stronger than an Air Conditioner.
This thing passed right over where I was. At the door of the House. And it was raining. I was
looking as it passed then it dodged the tree and left. It was very low. An air-plane would never
do that. The Pilot who would do that would be dead, deceased. It is too dangerous on a clear
day, imagine that at night and in the rain and that thing did it safely, it just passed by and left.
They asked: "Captain, do you want a cup of coffee?"
I said: "I just saw something here that was very strange." Then I said: "Let's finish the coffee
and go."
We got on the boat and went to this place where Luis had been. We stopped the boat. I went
down and walked to the tree where he had set up camp and we stayed down there.
So we went to this place and as the tide was filling, the height of the water was more and more
critical. There came a point in which nothing had happened yet but we were already with our
hands suspended, with equipment and everything raised above the water. We were almost
having to climb the trees, otherwise we would be submerged with everything. The tide was
rising and we were...
That quickly?
Yes. It was about 10 pm, more or less, when we decided to leave. We took a little canoe that
was with us and we went to the boat that was standing across the river. We saved the
equipment and we didn't drown. We left the equipment on the boat and I decided to stay a
little longer.
They asked: "Captain, aren't you coming back now?"
I said: "No, let's stay a little longer."
It was about 11 pm and we were chatting, getting distracted, smoking cigarette’s and stuff.
The river funnelled, we were on the right bank, and we saw the river funnelling in front of us.
At about 1.2 miles (2 Km) and it came from the left, from North to South, crossing the river, a
Very Strong Light. It was Yellow or Amber, like the Sun. But very low, on top of the trees. And
it crossed the river in the same position, more or less, where the Watchman's House is, where I
had seen the first thing.
In the Vigia Region?
The Keuffer Pottery Factory Watchman's House. It passed very low and it Illuminated the
river. That was filmed and in the film it flickers. Something like that. A Light as if it were a
Strange Flame.
Constant?
Yes. Then the trail appeared, it’s Light on the river. That was filmed. Very well filmed. When
you had a document like that and spectacular footage like this.
Didn't that go to the Capital?
Not yet.
Was it held in the Air Force Command?
Yes. Only later the Capital asked for it. I don't believe that the Capital believed in this story
very much.
The Capital thought it was what?
I don't know.
Half a dozen crazy people in the woods?
Yes. They didn't want to expose themselves, to give credit to something like that. But they had
colleagues there who wanted to know if it was all true. Well, it was 11 pm. We recorded time,
height, direction. All those things that we had to fill in the Report.
I said: "Now I'm not leaving here. Now we're staying."
We hadn't taken food, coffee, water, anything. Then Luis proposed to go to his house, a hovel
by the river, to make coffee, to bring bread, biscuits and whatever. So that we could have
something to eat for the night. He left with the boat and it had an islet in the middle of the
river. It was no more than 50-60 feet (15-20 meters) wide, but it was very long. It looked like a
submarine in the middle of the river but it had vegetation.
He left with the boat and disappeared on that Island. We didn't see him anymore. He left in a
small boat. He left with the little boy. They paddled and disappeared into the river. We didn't
see them anymore.
As soon as he disappeared, it didn't take very long. I was standing on top of the boat's awning
and the agents were chatting. But I was the Boss and I couldn't afford to have their easiness.
They were comfortable there. I was in charge, I needed to be alert. It came from my left side, I
was facing the beginning of the river. Where we come from, the Pottery Factory. A very Bright
Light came from my left side. The same Yellow Light, which was very strong.
As I saw the Light approaching, I stayed quiet. After I saw that it was very strong and that it
kept coming towards us, I alerted the Agents. I said: "Look there." They saw it and prepared
the camera, camcorder, everything. The thing came and it was low. About 650-820 feet high
(200-250 meters), it was not too high. The Light passed right over us and when it got close to
the river bank, that Yellow Light turned off. That Bright Yellow Light, that Yellow Sun, we
didn't see shapes, we only saw Light. But it suddenly turned off.
Then we saw a Strange Shape. The shape of an American Football. A pointed ball. An
American Football Shape which was Huge and Translucent like a Bedside Lamp.
But it had small windows in the middle. There were little windows throughout it's extension. I
didn't see anyone behind the windows, but there were windows, for sure.
It was a very big thing, about 320 feet (100 meters). Very big, a Big Football passing over us.
At low height, and it made a strange noise.
It made a noise of that air conditioning. It passed slowly over us, on purpose, very slowly. The
camcorder was turned on and its mechanism makes a noise. I asked the agent who was
filming to stop filming.
I wanted to make sure that there was no confusion between the camera noise and the noise
that we were hearing. Then I poked "Japonês". I handed that to the guy that was Japonês I
poked him and he stopped.
One is Flávio and the other is Japonês? -
Yes. He stopped
"Are you hearing it?" He said:
"Yes." It was the sound of the camcorder ratchet. There was this weird noise in the middle. In
the middle of that other noise that oscillating noise. He continued filming and photographing
it, but then that thing passed and left. It entered towards the direction of the continent,
towards Belém and left. It didn't disappear, it simply left.
I said: "Well, now I only leave here when I see more. Now it appears that things can happen
later."
That happened about 11 pm, 11:30 pm, more or less. The Report has the right time. It's been
so many years, but it was around that time.
We started talking, commenting "What a strange thing, did you see the little windows?" We
started detailing it, "It looks like an American Football" "Yes it looks like it". And so on.
At 1 am, between 1 and 1:30 am, it's accurate on the Report. It came back, the same Light,
but it was no longer Amber, it was a Very Strong Blue Light. It came travelling along on the
opposite bank of the river to where we were. The Light came along the river bank and we
were watching it, looking at it. The Light came and when it arrived at the Island, it then left in
the direction of Belém. But it was very low. Passing at the height of the treetops. A very big
Light and a Huge Thing.
Was that the most complicated situation, the most extraordinary case that you saw during Operation
Prato?
It was. It entered Belém, then returned to our direction. We could see that there was a Light
way over there. Through the trees, we saw that that Light penetrated the forest. But it
returned in our direction. It arrived and stayed right in front of us at the other side of the
bank river.
Knowing what you wanted?
It stopped in front of us. And later, for the sake of accuracy of the Report, I went to measure
this distance, 230 feet (70 meters). It stopped and stayed in front of us, that Monster, a Blue
Sun. It was a Very Bright glow, but you could face it, be staring at it. But it didn't hurt the
eyes.
Any windows?
There was nothing to be seen, only that very Strong Light. Very Strong, a Weird Blue, but
Very High, Very Big, a Huge Sun in front of us. Huge, it was incredible.
We just stood there looking: "Now what?" Then I got scared. Now it's too close. It was on the
other side of the river. Less than the distance between two goals of a soccer field. Huge. That
thing stopped in front of us. We watched and it took about three minutes, maybe, with that
Blue Light where we just looked, and nobody spoke while filming, photographing and such.
We just looked and questioned, "What now?" Suddenly that Blue Light went out quickly and
we could see what was behind that Light that had appeared, It was now showing us what was
emitting it. It was that Football again and it was standing in front of us. A Football that was
320 feet (100 meters) high. Stopped in front of us. But I didn't see any windows.
So it was a different Object?
It could be the same, but the interior must have been turned off, I don't know, something like
that, I didn't see any windows. You could see that Football in front of us. It stayed a little
longer. And suddenly we were all scared. What now? What if these guys come and abduct us?
And then what? Nobody knew what was going to happen from then on.
Colonel, do you know if this type of occurrence that you are describing to me, happens in the
Amazon? Is not something common in many places in the World?
No. It is not common, it is something extraordinary within Ufology. This is a testimony, first of
all, absolutely qualified, because it was made by several witnesses. The Object is seen by many
witnesses. All of these witnesses are qualified and within a Military function precisely linked
to this Operation.
In your opinion, what was the purpose of these Crafts? Why did these Crafts insist so much on
appearing in the North, in the Amazon? Anyway, what was going on in your head about what that
was?
I'll answer to you with a personal conclusion of mine. I exposed that conclusion to some
friends, serious ones, because I treat Ufology very seriously. I became much more interested
after the Air Force stopped the research. I remained interested in the subject and to me it's a
very serious subject. I rule out a lot of sightings because I didn't see them or because I'm not
sure. So I started to study this much more seriously and I went to try and understand it
myself. I've already seen it. Now I wanted to understand it. I wanted to draw conclusions from
that. Conclusions that I couldn't put in the report because they were my conclusions of study,
of trying to understand it. They didn't fit in the report.
As I told you, I was a Jungle Operations Officer. That's where my conclusion comes from. As
a Jungle Operations Officer I had a lot of contact with Indigenous Tribes and we were very
careful, very concerned about not transmitting any disease that was contained in ourselves to
them. The disease in our bodies is controlled by antibodies of ours that they didn't have and
you could pass them some flu, measles, tuberculosis, because we have that. That would be a
tragedy. We have it in our body, but it is controlled. We have them, these things exist in our
bodies. But our body has defences, and they didn't.
So I was very concerned that, involuntarily, we were going there on a Mission and we would
pass it on to the them. But fortunately, it never happened. I don't remember involuntarily
damaging any Indian in that way. That was a concern of mine and I went on to conclude
something else about why they are doing this.
If I were them and I put myself in their shoes, I needed an open, frank appearance, a direct
appearance, what would I have to do? I would have to protect myself. Me being them. I, like
them, would have to protect myself. Protect myself how? Knowing that you Gevaerd, Petit,
you carry in your bodies something that can damage mine, you See?
The only way to defend myself is if I had a sample of your blood, a sample of your tissue. It
was not difficult to imagine that this is what they were doing. These things even became a joke
to some people, the "Chupa-Chupa"the called it. But they were collecting material.
They were collecting blood. In order to see what was contained in the blood that could
damage them in a necessary future contact. But not only blood, also material, cells. I don't
know what this high energy beam could do, if it could carry that material too. Particles of the
body, pieces of the body. That could be later analysed by them. Or perhaps this recent trend,
Cloning. By taking a particle that had DNA they could then make a repetition. This is recent,
at the time I didn't think about any of that. But I thought that they were collecting material in
order to defend themselves in a contact event that needed to be close and that this could
damage them because of some disease of ours.
Their intervention, right?
Of course, they imagined that they were being attacked by an evil Being, like a vampire,
something that wanted to damage them.
Did they believe in things from other worlds?
They thought that they were things that came from Outside of Earth, from Another Planet.
They saw Shapes, Lights. They saw Shapes before me. They saw the Crafts before me, it took
a while for me to see them.
Did the Riverside Population in these regions arm themselves to defend against this Phenomenon?
They used fireworks and they were armed. They used those cartridge rifles and hunting rifles,
but they did use them. They even fired.
Did you document this through the Operation?
This was reported, they were armed. Some even shot, and others said: "Don't do that." The
Priest himself said, there is no purpose in that. It will never do anything. The one who tried,
who pointed a gun, laid dormant for two weeks, immobilized in the hammock.
Colonel, did this experience you just described influence your life in any way? In the way you see
the World? Was that at the very end of Operation Prato?
For the Air Force, that was the end. The Air Force ordered an interruption soon after that, it
didn't take long. This Report was passed on to my Commander, and he was told how it went.
Then the film was developed and seen. In the Headquarters Auditorium. Several Officers saw
it. We took...
What was their opinion?
They had no doubt that it was an interesting thing which they saw on the film, step by step,
slowly. There was this Shape standing there that we hadn't seen, we couldn't see it. We had no
idea of that. We only saw this later on, when printing the photographic emulation. This thing
had a door at the top like the door of a Boeing Plane. An open door and I didn't see any Being
inside.
In the photograph there's no Being, but a Beam of Light appears in our direction. In the
direction of our boat. From that door, there was someone focusing something in our direction.
But we didn't see that. I did't know of it at that time because of that very Bright Blue Light.
We didn't see that it had a Shape, we only saw that Huge Blue Ball. Now, with a declaration of
that level, something extraordinary like that after three or four months of work in the
Operation.
Why did COMAR and the Air Force deactivate the project?
Look, I tell you, maybe that's what I said on another occasion, these are questions that are
asked, and every time you answer they want more. The population, the World, they want
more, and they keep asking us questions that we just don't have the answers to.
Who are they? Nobody can answer that. Perhaps the most advanced in this subject are the
Americans. Russians, maybe.
Who are they? There's no answer.
Where are they from? There is no answer.
What do they want? There is also no answer.
Three questions that will be asked, and no one can answer. And that deflates the subject, even
demoralizes the Air Force and the Brazilian Government.
Still, wouldn't it be worth the Air Force to maintain the project in search of these three or more
answers? Wouldn't it be worth keeping? Why close the project?
If I were the Commander, if I had Command, I would continue. I obeyed, and I was told to
stop.
How was that order? Did they just tell you to stop?
"The Operation is cancelled." Okay, satisfied, Operation cancelled and you saluted. It's over,
okay, it's over. It was over for the Air Force but not for me.
Did you keep doing a vigil?
When I could, on the weekends. That conclusion on the material collection, about making an
antidote, a vaccine, a serological solution, that would inhibit any incidence of any disease in
the body of these Aliens from the blood or material collected from the human body, that
conclusion was exposed on one occasion, when I visited Rafael Sempere in São Paulo.
After a long conversation, I told Rafael Sempere my opinion and Rafael said to me:
"Look, that was the most logical explanation I heard about this “Chupa-Chupa.”
I agree. Because I heard from people that it was an act of aggression, and to me it doesn't
seem to be aggression. He agreed with me.
Was it research? To me it was research, material collection.
It was the same conclusion that was put to Jacques Vallée and he thanked me and said:
"Look, this was the most logical explanation of what I heard so far."
Now, after the Operation was over, did the material you collected remain in the Capital? It must
have been a lot.
No, it remained in Belém. Several times I tried to write the Final Report because Reports are
parcelled out. It is done case by case. For example, one night it happened three times. So there
had to be a Report involving the three individual cases and a Final Report. I tried several
times to write it, and what I wrote, I honestly thought that in the Capital they would call me
crazy for it because I would write what I saw.
Whoever was going to read it wasn't there, they didn't see it and they were going to call me
crazy. That Ball, all those things. I thought they would call me crazy.
Even after the Operation ended, you continued to research. How was that? Did you have any other
interesting experiences?
Yes, I did. After the Mission. Once, I was at home and I have never reported this before, I am
opening it up to you with the utmost confidence, because of your seriousness.
Can we publish it?
Yes. I repeat, I never told this to anyone with permission to publish. I am telling you now. I'm
already 60 years old, I will be 70 in a little while. If I get there, if I don't disappear before
then. I was at home. I had received some books from Bob Pratt and I asked him, because I
was wanting to study and understand this more.
A brief digression, did Bob Pratt visit you during the Operation?
Right at the beginning of Operation Prato.
Wanting information?
He wanted to talk to me.
What did he ask? What was his interest?
He wanted to know what had happened, because he had been on the Crabs Island and I didn't
even know about the existence of this Island or what had happened there. Later I had it
checked out.
What other UFO Researchers came to you to find out about it?
Nationals and Internationals. Max Berezovsky, General Uchôa. Several, I do remember Max
Berezovsky, I never had contact with him again. He is a Contributor to the Magazine. He
wrote and called me. He wanted to talk to me but we didn't have the opportunity to speak in
person, I don't know him personally.
Daniel Rebisso?
Daniel Rebisso was much later.
Reginaldo de Athayde?
He was in Belém and he talked to me. Several UFO Researchers came to me. One of them,
Bob Pratt came to me. There was a guy from Argentina that I don't remember the name.
Jacques Vallée came later, much later. He talked to me years later. He even gave me a book as
a gift.
Were you able to speak to or say something to those UFO Researchers? Was it authorized?
I talked to them about it. They even saw some pictures. Unintelligible and I am not authorized
by anyone to be giving any opinion on anything. I couldn't speak.
Did these Researchers keep their words?
They did.
Did you keep exchanging letters?
We continued to exchange letters. I was frequently consulted in some cases. The Logroño case,
do you know it? The case of a Priest, a Probe that entered, that stopped the radio. They sent
cases for me to give an opinion on it.
International Researchers?
Internationals too, from Spain.
Nationals and Internationals sent cases for you to analyse?
Through Rafael Sempere Durá, through our friend Osni Schwarz. They brought the cases for
me to look at and give an opinion. I looked and gave my opinion on several, including some
cases from the USA.
So, I was at home, I had received a bunch of books from Bob Pratt. I read them. I tried to go
deeper into Ufology, Humanoids, Appearances, Abductions and other things.
I was arming myself with more knowledge about Ufology. I was already interested in the
subject and it had nothing to do with the Air Force. It was my business and one day I had put
it on a shelf.
I lived in the Military Village, a long way from the highway. This detail is important because
there was no car trepidations. It was a Military Village and if anything passed by, it was a
passenger car.
One day, the books were piled on top of each other on my bookshelf. I was lying down and I
wasn't reading Ufology that day, I was reading another book. I don't remember what the book
was, but it had nothing to do with Ufology. My daughter, the one who is here at home, was a
little girl reading a children's magazine. She was reading at my bedside, on the floor, and I
was in bed reading.
The stack of books moved as if it had been picked up, the books moved off the shelf and fell to
the floor. The whole pile of books that were stacked.
Transported vertically, stacked? To the floor. Like you have one hand on the bottom and the other
on the top?
Like if you picked up the stack and did it like this, they went to the floor. When they hit the
ground, of course, the pile dismounted. But the books didn't fall, they came stacked. Until
they hit the ground.
My daughter got scared. Daniela, she was there. She got scared and she said: "Dad, how
funny, look how the books fell." At that moment, when that happened, my wife was
downstairs preparing the children's bottle. They suckled many years, she was down there
preparing it.
The same thing happened down there, but with a tray of glasses and cutlery. My wife was
alone down there. The tray flew out of the sink, flew across the kitchen and fell. It didn't
break a glass, but made noise. I heard the noise of crockery falling so I got up.
Before that, I had even joked about it when it happened, when the stack fell, soon after it
happened downstairs. I even joked. I picked up the books and put them back in place. I put
the stack of books back in their place in order not to scare my daughter so I even joked.
I said: "You guys want me to read it, I'll get a book and read." I opened a book on some page
and just when I was opening the book, it happened downstairs, in my house. The tray went
flying and fell.
From the noise I thought someone could have been hurt or cut themselves. It was a crockery
noise. The house had a staircase and it had two floors. I was going down and she was coming
up with wide eyes.
She said: "I won't stay down there anymore."
I asked what happened and she said that she didn't know, a tray that was flying fell. The tray
had no reason to fall from the sink. That's where you put plates and glasses every day. The
tray went flying and ended up in the middle of the kitchen. I thought, well, I didn't
understand that. I put things together on the tray and put it back in place and then I brought
my wife a glass of water.
Soon after that, around two or three days later, I was in bed but she was already asleep. While
I was lying in bed, I was doing a kind of shutdown, doing a mentalization. I was switched off,
very disconnected. It was about midnight. I was lying in bed with my wife by my side, and I
was lying on my side.
I was lying like this, on my side when suddenly, in my room a Very Strong Light, Very Strong
Light appeared and a Snapping Sound as if something had happened where a switch tripped
in a fuse box. As if it had a problem there and it made a Snapping Sound. A Big Snapping
Sound which was very strong and at the same time, my room was all lit up.
I got scared, it was a very strange thing and immediately after that, there was a Being behind
me, hugging me. It was kind of a weird situation, the guy was hugging me from behind, I
didn't really like it and there was another one at the head of my bed.
How Tall were they?
5 feet (1.5 meters) more or less...
What kind?
Dressed in something similar to an Astronaut Outfit. It looked like a Diving Suit.
Tight clothing, neoprene?
No, it was kind of cushiony. It was not tight. A thin person would even look fat in that. I didn't
see the face, but it was dark grey in colour. It looked like a Diving Mask, but you couldn't see
details of the face. I didn't see eye shape, I didn't see much and I was very scared. But that
thing was hugging me from behind. It hugged me, squeezed me and then he spoke in my ear,
in Portuguese. With a sound of today we hear these sounds like a computer.
A metallic voice?
Yes, a voice like that and he spoke in my ear: "Calm down." "We won't do you any harm."
And your wife?
She continued sleeping, she didn't even notice anything. It said, "Calm down, we won't hurt
you." This guy was hugging me and another little one at the head of my bed. I was backwards
in bed. Right after that, Another Snapping Sound and Another Flash. Then they were gone. I
was very scared.
Was there any missing time?
I don't remember. because after that I was thinking, did I dream it all? It was a weird thing, I
was awake when I heard the first snapping sound twice, then it happened again and all that, I
thought, fuck, I didn't understand it. I don't remember if I went downstairs to drink some
water, I think I did or if I went to grab some whiskey.
Did that bother you the next day? In the next day, Did it happen again?
No, the next day I went to the Base. My wife always closed the house gate, because of the dogs
and children. I would go out with the car in reverse, and when I got out, she would close the
gate for me. So she accompanied me to the car. I got into the car, said goodbye to her, then I
left with the car in reverse, she closed the gate and I went to the Base.
I had at that time, there's a fact related to that car. I had a navy blue Alfa Romeo. The car was
in the garage and when I went to put the key in the door, the driver's door, when I got close to
the door, the door on the other side opened. My wife saw it and she was startled, the door on
the other side opened all by itself. I didn't touch the car but when I came close with the keys
and I went to open it, the other door opened.
My wife was also looking and this other thing had already happened the night before when
the books were falling and the tray went flying in the kitchen. Then in the morning the car
door opens by itself.
She was scared, and I even joked: "Yeah, buddy, you’re not going very far. The trip is short.”
My house was near the Base. "Yeah, buddy, the trip is short"
Talking to yourself?
Yeah. Then I sat in the car and I reached out to close the door, when I did the door closed by
itself. My wife got even more scared.
"What is this thing?" I wondered. It closed the door itself.
I left and went to our Headquarters. The flag was being stretched so I was saluting and my
left arm itched a lot. I was anxious for the flag to reach the top already and the anthem to
stop. So that I could scratch my arm, I couldn't take my hand off the cap. My arm was
itching.
When it was over I scratched the spot on my arm which was reddish in this area. Have I
shown you that?
No!
It was reddish in this spot. I looked at it and it looked weird. My arm had a Red Dot and
around it was pink. But in that point and it's been there ever since. Since 1977 this point has
been in the same place right here.
This thing was itching a lot while I was working and doing my duties at my desk and stuff,
and this thing itched. Then one day, out of curiosity, I pressed on that point. Here, pay
attention here. When I pressed it, this thing appeared here. Look, and if I press like that,
you'll see that it appears here in the middle. Touch it. Do you see it? As if it had a little plastic
thing, a little piece of plastic.
Did you do an X-Ray?
Yes, nothing appears. Look, look at the point here. Touch on this point. Not here, in the point
there.
Yeah, I fell something, it looks like a needle stayed inside there. But very soft. Maybe a plastic
needle that went in and stayed.
Yes.
And it doesn't seem to be a vein.
No, it isn't..
The tip appears, I'll press here to see if. Very weird. Let's do a surgery and remove that.
I won't. It already happened to me. Listen I talked to the team later and showed it to them.
They looked at it. Then one said, "I have the same thing in my left leg." In one of his thighs,
he had it in one thigh. Flávio, the Lieutenant. He died of a stroke. He had one of those things
in his left leg.
The same type?
The same thing.
And the rest?
No, just the two of us. Just me and him.
And he passed away?
Yeah. You have to be careful. He died before me, despite being younger. Later, I talked to a
friend of mine, a doctor. I showed it to him and he thought that it was weird. We went to the
hospital to see what it was. They calibrated the x-ray, to capture skin but nothing appeared.
One time I went to São Paulo and talked to Rafael Sempere Durá. Half of his apartment was
about Ufology.
There was files, machines. I imagine that it's worse nowadays. He took a small compass that
he had. A little one. He approached the Object and when he placed the compass on it, the
needle oscillated. That's why I suggested that this can be Unprecedented Physical Evidence.
He came close, put it on top, he smokes a pipe, and he hears very badly, he was like this and
such.
"Let me see that"
I showed it appearing and he took a small compass, It looked like a can of ointment. He
placed it on top and it shifted.
He said: "Hollanda, this is something I have never seen before."
I talked to the doctor and he told me to do radiological research. Nothing appeared. I said to
Rafael I was going to have it opened and see what it is.
He said: "I wouldn't do that if I were you. Leave it as it is. Is it harming you?"
No, I replied.
"Is it bothering you?"
No, I replied.
“If it doesn't itch anymore then I would suggest differently, that you do not take that off. I'd
leave it as it is.”
Is it your understanding that the Brazilian Government is doing UFO research, whether in the
Amazon or elsewhere, related to that Phenomenon?
Research, as determination, as a program, no. I don't think so, I don't have any information
about it. Firstly, because I'm out. I'm retired. I have very little contact, other than finance,
with the Ministry of Aeronautics. I have friends there, but I never heard about it. That there
was a program. In an eventuality, if a case occurs, the Ministry of Aeronautics will investigate.
As it investigated the case of the F-5's, that went following Objects. But as a program, I don't
believe so. I don't know of any.
Do you think that there should be such a program, maintained by the Government, for research?
My personal opinion, I think so. If I was the Air Force Commander, if I had Command, I
would do it. I already have my personal reasons. But even if I hadn't, if I were Commander, I
would do it.
What do you think was done about Operation Prato, the documents?
I think that they are archived. Without them giving much value to it. I don't know of any
repercussions about that in the Ministry of Aeronautics. 500 pictures, dozens of films. Not all
of them were sent to them. They have the photos contained in the Reports. Some negatives, the
majority stayed in COMAR
In Belém?
Yes.
Do you know of anybody there that is guarding that material?
It is stored in the 2nd COMAR and you won't be able to get anything out. No one will open it.
Is there someone taking care of it? Maintaining it?
My Section, which I belonged to. It is kept there and you will have no access. Nobody opens it,
neither Belém nor the Capital. My films, the four films I captured with the camcorder. I told
you there were more than 500 photographs. But there were four films, one belongs to the
Ministry of Aeronautics. The other three were mine. All of them went to the Ministry of
Aeronautics, and I never got mine back. They were captured with my money, I captured them
and the Air Force never returned them.
You never thought to keep a souvenir of this material?
No. Look, I told you, The Air Force was and is my life. I love the Brazilian Air Force. Even
more when I was inside there. Today I stay outside, seeing how my companions are getting on,
those who have succeeded me, what they are doing with the Air Force so that it may prosper,
progress and grow.
I have always had a great deal of respect for the Air Force and for my service so I would never
do that to the Air Force. I was silent for 20 years. I was consulted and sought after several
times. I was asked to write, to make a statement. You asked me, and I said: "I can't talk about
it." But not anymore, now I'm retired.
What about the Military who remain in the Air Force, that know about these documents which the
population has the right to know, don't you think there will be a certain embarrassment? Shouldn't it
be released to the public?
That's a decision for the Command. My opinion is the one that I told you about. If it's
disclosed, if it's said, right after that comes other questions that the Ministry of Aeronautics
and the Government doesn't have answers to.
So in order to avoid this embarrassment, nothing is said. Once I was watching a show with
Flávio Cavalcanti in an interrogation about this, a guy asked:
"Why don't they land in Maracanã for everyone to see?"
If there is a landing like that, at the Planalto Palace, then there is no way, Right? What I
believe is that in the near future, in the very near future, and I may even be a little more
daring than what I'm telling you, it won't even be two years. This event will happen. Within a
year and a half to two years this event will happen. Clear, open contact. On all of the
televisions in the World, CNN, Globo, everyone watching. This should happen in the very near
future. Do you see the position that I was in?
Back then I couldn't do anything perfectly. If I said anything, the first thing that would
happen if I went to the television, even if I went to the television and said that I saw this and
that. The Aeronautics Minister would go on TV and say that I wasn't authorized to speak. The
Air Force wouldn't back up what I said and I would look like a fool.
He would say: "The Captain is not authorized. His statement has no value."
Today, I'm retired, I can say whatever I want and I don't mind being arrested.
Right after granting this interview to UFO Magazine, before even seeing it published, The Colonel
committed suicide. His death caused much controversy, as well as his revelations. It was his
revelations, in a large part, that motivated the Brazilian Commission of Ufologists to start the
campaign UFOs: Freedom of Information Now.
The campaign made the Brazilian Government, for the first time in history, admit that it researched
UFOs in the national territory. More than 4,000 pages of confidential documents and about 600
previously secret photos about ET action in Brazil have been released. Among them are hundreds of
pages and dozens of photos produced by Operation Prato, revealed in 1997 by Uyrangê de
Hollanda. Access this material on the UFO Magazine website. www.ufo.com.br – UFOs and ETs in
