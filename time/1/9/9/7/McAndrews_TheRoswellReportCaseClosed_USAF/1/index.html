<p>The most puzzling and intriguing element of the complex series of events now known as the <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell/index.html">Roswell Incident</a>, are the alleged sightings of
  alien bodies. The bodies turned what, for many years, was just another flying saucer story, into what many UFO
  proponents claim is the best case for extraterrestrial visitation of Earth. The importance of bodies and the
  assumptions made as to their origin is illustrated in a passage from a popular Roswell book:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>Crashed saucers are one thing, and could well turn out to be futuristic American or even foreign aircraft or
    missiles. But alien bodies are another matter entirely, and hardly subject to misinterpretation.</q></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1994 Air Force report determined that project Mogul was responsible for the 1947 events. Mogul was an
  experimental attempt to acoustically detect suspected Soviet nuclear weapon explosions and ballistic missile launches.
  Mogul utilized acoustical sensors, radar reflecting targets and other devices attached to a train of weather balloons
  over 600 feet long. Claims that the U.S. Army Air Forces recovered a "flying disc" in 1947, were based primarily on
  the lack of identification of the radar targets, and element of weather equipment used on the long Mogul balloon
  train. The oddly constructed radar targets were found by a New Mexico rancher during the height of the first U.S.
  flying saucer wave in 1947. The rancher brought the remnants of the balloons and radar targets to the local sheriff
  after he allegedly learned of the broadcasted reports of flying discs. However, following some initial confusion at
  Roswell Army Air Field, the "flying disc" was soon identified by Army Air Forces officials as a standard radar
  target.</p>
<p>From 1947 until the late 1970s, the Roswell Incident was essentially a non-story. The reports that existed contain
  only descriptions of mundane materials that originated from the Project Mogul balloon trainâ€”"tinfoil, paper, tape,
  rubber and sticks." The first claim of "bodies" appeared in the late 1970s, with additional claims made during the
  1980s and 1990s. These claims were usually based on anecdotal accounts of second-and third-hand witnesses collected by
  UFO proponents as much as 40 years after the alleged incident. The same ... </p>
