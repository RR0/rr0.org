<p>The "Roswell Incident" has assumed a central place in American folklore since the events of the 1940s in a remote
  area of New Mexico. Because the Air Force was a major player in those events, we have played a key role in executing
  the General Accounting Office's tasking to uncover all records regarding that incident.</p>
<p>Our objective throughout this inquiry has been simple and consistent: to find all the facts and bring them to light.
  If documents were classified, declassify them; where they were dispersed, bring them into a single source for public
  review.</p>
<p>In <time>1994-07</time>, we completed the first step in that effort and later published <em>The Roswell Report: Fact
  vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert</em>. This volume represents the necessary follow-on to that first publication
  and contains additional material and analysis. I think that with this publication we have reached our goal of a
  complete and open explanation of the events that occurred in the Southwest many years ago.</p>
<p>Beyond that achievement, this inquiry has shed fascinating light into the Air Force of that era and revitalized our
  appreciation for the dedication and accomplishments of the men and women of that time. As we celebrate the Air Force's
  50th Anniversary, it is appropriate to once again reflect on the sacrifices made by so many to make ours the finest
  air and space force in history.</p>
