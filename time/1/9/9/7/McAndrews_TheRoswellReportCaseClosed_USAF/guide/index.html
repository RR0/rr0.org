<p>This publication contains the complete report as submitted to the Secretary of the Air Force. The exceptions are the
  statements found in Appendix B. Due to Privacy Act restrictions and by request, the addresses of the individuals
  making these statements have been deleted.</p>
<p>This volume is divided into two sections, eight subsections, eleven sidebar discussions, and three appendices.
  Section One examines alleged events at two locations in rural New Mexico. Section Two examines the alleged activities
  at the Roswall Army Airfield Hospital.</p>
<p>Appendix A is a table listing the launch and landing locations of test equipment for U.S. Air Force scientific
  research projects High Dive and Excelsior. Appendix B is a collection of signed sworn statements based on in-person
  interviews conducted for this report by U.S. Air Force researchers. The exception is the statement of Lt. Col. William
  C. Kaufman, which was not sworn due to equipment failures at the time of interview.</p>
<p>Appendix C contains transcripts of interviews of alleged witnesses presented by UFO theorists. The interviews of
  <span class="people">Gerald Anderson</span>, Alice Knight and Vern Maltais were excerpted in their entirety from
  unedited interviews used to prepare the video, <em>Recollections of Roswell, Part II</em> (1993), and appear courtesy
  of the Fund for UFO Research. The interview of Mr. W. Glenn Dennis was provided by the interviewer, <a
