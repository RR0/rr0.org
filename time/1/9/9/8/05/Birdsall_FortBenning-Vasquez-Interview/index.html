<p content="abstract">John Vasquez interrog√© par Graham Birdsall</p>
<p>Few among the hundreds present at Laughlin had ever come across a UFO witness by the name of John Vasquez before,
  myself included. John was not a speaker there, nor an established and recognised researcher. He had travelled from his
  home in California to seek help and advice on a matter of great personal concern. A select few researchers attended a
  private meeting, at which John related <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/FortBenning">one of the most
    extraordinary incidents</a> any of us had come across in years. </p>
<p> The mass abduction of an entire battalion of some 1,300 military personnel. </p>
<p> The next day John kindly agreed to re-tell his story again on camera for inclusion in our new video magazine series.
  'UFOs: Hard Evidence.' I began by asking John why he had travelled several hundreds of miles to seek out UFO
  researchers... </p>
<p><q>What I'm trying to do is convey reports and documents concerning Army intelligence at Ft. Mead, Maryland, and also
  my investigative report: letters from all the Army and Air Force departments concerning UFOs, or a 'J.A.W.S." test, an
  acronym for Joint Attack Weapons Systems and also a mysterious outbreak of measles at Ft. Benning, Georgia." </q></p>
<p> John then began to re-live an event which he said came <q>as a surprise to all of us</q>. <q>It just happened. We
  were very frightened of this unusual light. This was a mass parade formation. There was 1,300 people." </q></p>
<p> Where was this exactly? </p>
<p><q>This was at the 1st A.I.T. (Army Infantry Training) Battalion post, it was a combat training group, infantrymen.
  We're talking right now about September 2nd, 1977. I know it sounds really wild, but I started investigating this
  whole event in '91. And slowly I conducted my own personal investigation into this event at Ft. Benning. I've been
  Finding a lot of documents and quotes concerning an unusual event at Ft. Benning, because we had the Secretary of the
  Army, Clifford Alexander being present, at Ft. Benning. </q></p>
<p><q>Normally it would have been someone from the Chiefs of Staff, a four-star general evaluating this JAWS test. And,
  I do have a JAWS test document at this time. It's written by the air force and I have the letter from them.</q> [I did
  indeed see this letter and it was recorded on film - GWB] </p>
<section>
  <h2>THE EVENT</h2>
  <p><q>It was an evening parade. There were thirteen-hundred men. We had to account for the staff and captains and XO's
    [executive officers]. We were standing in formation and somebody in front of me mentioned something in the sky and I
    didn't think nothing of it because I was just looking at stars. So I said. "What is it'?" The guy in front of me
    said. 'Just keep looking'. So I did and all of a sudden this star moved, in a gradual, floating way. I thought it
    was a satellite. This sergeant, who was standing behind me asked. 'What do you think it is?' I just said.
    'Satellite'. </q></p>
  <p><q>All of a sudden, this star just stopped, and then it moved away from us; came back and it moved again, stopped
    and moved away again, came back, and continued on. At this time, the same sergeant ordered us to stand to attention,
    and you can't move at all then. But I kinda glanced up to see where this thing went. and it was gone. </q></p>
  <p><q>And this is when the captain, our captain of Delta Company, 1st Battalion, 1st Infantry, was walking out of this
    building to make a speech. And this speech was to advise us of our 6-8 week training course. Just when he was
    walking to this podium to make his speech. I heard this "rushing' noise and I leaned back and looked across, to my
    left. I saw this bright light, an intense bright light. I thought it was a jeep, a truck or something. And it was
    moving across, slowly. </q></p></section>
<section>
  <h2>THE SLEEP</h2>
  <p><q>I saw some of Charlie Company's men running out of their formation, others were standing still. So I needed to
    lake a better look at this. I leaned forward. When I leaned forward this bright light just got really close and it
    was headed between the tree-lines. And I still thought it was a truck, but the light was really, really intense. I
    mean, it's a white, bright light, and it had this bluish outline to it. </q></p>
  <p><q>I looked at this thing and I thought. 'I don't know what this is'. Well. the guy who was standing in front of
    me, I wanted to say something to him, ask him what it was, but when I looked at him, he was asleep. His head was
    bowed, his eyes were closed, he was asleep. So I leaned back again, I don't know what happened here, but I was
    unconscious for a few minutes. </q></p>
  <p><q>When I came to, I was looking down and I couldn't move. I couldn't move my feet. And I tried desperately to move
    from where I was standing. The next thing I did, I could move my upper body, so I turned to my right, and I saw some
    of the men running to the tree-lines and others were diving underneath the buildings, a two-storey-high cross-way,
    such as you see in the picture </q>[left]. </p>
  <p><q>My buddy Alan... running, they were all running. So I just cried out for Alan to come back and help me because I
    couldn't move. He came back and he pulled me physically from where I was standing, physically pulled me. He pulled
    my arm and I sort of 'jumped' from where I was standing. </q></p>
  <p><q>He was saying. 'Take cover! Take cover!' and I was asking, 'What's going on here?' you know ? There was
    something happening and it was happening fast. I told Alan. 'I want to see the captain', so we ran over to where the
    captain was and he was standing behind this podium. And he was asleep. His head was bowed and he wasn't moving. </q>
  </p>
  <p><q>So I screamed. I screamed, "Wake up!' out loud. I mean. I screamed so loud I think everybody could have woke up.
    But there was a lot of guys still standing around in this formation and it was like they were motionless. The
    captain didn't wake up. 'TAKE COVER!" </q></p>
  <p><q>So about this time. Alan was turned around and is facing this thing, this light. I believe it was a light. And
    his face was really pale. I mean it's like he's just seen a ghost. His eyes were bulging and his jaw was open and I
    shook him. I told him. 'Don't look at it! Don't look at it!'. And he sort of came to and he was saying. 'What's
    going on'.'', like he was really confused. </q></p>
  <p><q>And we started to run, and when we started running to this first building, on the cross-base underneath, there
    was something moving and we didn't know what it was. So I told Alan to wait, get ready for it, we didn't know what
    it was. We'd seen the shadows moving underneath the building, and we're going to physically hurl this thing. Well it
    was one of us. </q></p>
  <p><q>He was coming out of the crawl space there and he was asking. 'What's going on'. 'What's going on?' We said.
    'The captain's asleep! The captain's asleep!' And I guess there were some more there 'cos he turned his head and
    said 'The captain's asleep!'. </q></p>
  <p><q>So. we told him. 'Just take cover, get away from it!' And me and Alan started to run again and the guy crawled
    away from us. We came to this second building and at the far end of the barracks, it's a two-storey barracks. We
    heard some guys under there, they were calling our last names so we ran over there. </q></p>
  <p><q>We dove under this cross-face and we started arguing about what was going on. We couldn't believe things were
    happening this quick, but this is our reaction, in a hostile manner, because when something like this happens, you
    know, when people get excited over things... </q></p></section>
<section>
  <h2> "MOMMY!"</h2>
  <p><q>Then we saw Sgt. Santini come out from the first building that Alan and I had just crossed. And this ball of
    white light, from 50ft, we were laying down. It looked like the size of a melon, a small melon. But it was a bright,
    white light and it wasn't a tracer, 'cos I know, I've seen tracers before, I've fired my M16's and I know what
    tracers look like. </q></p>
  <p><q>But this wasn't a tracer. It sort of came from the second storey, and sort of "roller-coasted' down to Sgt.
    Santini's height. And Sgt. Santini's about 5 feel 11 inches, 6 foot, and he was waving his arms up and down,
    screaming about what's going on, telling us to take cover and cursing the sky, because something was coming
    down. </q></p>
  <p><q>And he started to run and he disappeared in the second building. And this bright light just sort of
    "roller-coasted" down to his height and zipped across - then it disappeared. And the next thing we heard was a
    "slap" and a 'thump'. </q></p>
  <p><q>And one of us, Hackett, crawled over to the other side to see where Sgt. Santini was and he was "out" on the
    pavement. He didn't move. Apparently he was knocked out or something. Something hit him. </q></p>
  <p><q>When Hackett came back, this is when we started hearing the screaming. From Alpha Company, all the way down to
    Bravo, then to Charlie Company and to Delta. When it came to Delta Company, we heard somebody out in parade
    formation screaming. </q></p>
  <p> 'Mommy!', a high-pitched scream that went down to a grunting sort of scream. <q>I can still hear it when I talk
    about this, I mean, you hear a man screaming like that you know something's wrong. </q></p>
  <p><q>And I told Jones, who was sitting, laying next to me, I said we should go out there and help these guys because
    something's going on out there. But he just turned around and said, 'No, they're already dead, forget about
    it'. </q></p></section>
<section>
  <h2> "IT'S COMING OUR WAY!"</h2>
  <p><q>We started arguing again about these, we started arguing about where the M16's were and where the ammo' was. We
    were gonna' start deploying some of our defence tactics." </q></p>
  <p> To defend yourselves? </p>
  <p><q>Yeah. And I told Alan, whatever happens, just try to go back to the Main <strong>Post</strong> and get some
    help. I was going to stay behind with Jones and Hackett. </q></p>
  <p><q>Well. during that argument we were having, we had one of the guy s crawl over and we asked him what was going on
    out there. And he said "It's lights'. We looked at each other as though to say: 'Lights? What kind of lights?
    Strange lights, what?' </q></p>
  <p><q>This was more intense light. I mean the whole place just lit, like it was day. And the windows, on the barrack
    buildings, these old windows and the frame and everything on the building itself, silhouetted. The light just
    silhouetted the whole thing, just weird, it was really weird. </q></p>
  <p><q>Just moving across slowly, across the second storey coming around, and we could see the guys in front of us
    underneath the building and we started pounding the ground and calling their names out, calling them out to get away
    from that thing, but they didn't move. </q></p>
  <p><q>So we just kept coming around and by the time this bright light came to the corner edge, I looked into it, I
    sort of "fixed" myself into this. And I don't know what it was, but it was like looking into one of those
    searchlights, right inside. And I guess I was hypnotized into watching this and Alan was grabbing my arm and
    shouting. "What is it Vasquez?", and I said, 'I don't know, but it's coming our way'." </q></p>
  <p> Vasquez then described how he began to hear a 'voice' in his head. He looked down on the ground and saw a small
    frightened animal, which he labelled a 'possum'. He said he heard the animal ask, 'What is it?' and he answered back
    . 'I don't know'. His puzzled colleagues looked at him, saw the animal dart away and asked: 'Who are you talking to
    Vasquez?" He told them. </p>
  <p><q>Hackett, he's a native American, he told me: 'You know, you speak to Nature'. </q></p></section>
<section>
  <h2> "COME OUT"</h2>
  <p><q>I don't know, everything strange was happening. And this bright light, it was so bright that underneath the
    building you could see the pipes, the boards, you could see everything. The whole place was illuminated. Everybody
    was afraid, and so was I. You know, honest, we're scared of this light, like little kids hiding in a comer. </q></p>
  <p><q>By this time I hear this voice, this echo sounded sort of far away and metallic-like, and it's telling me. 'It's
    OK, don't be afraid. come out'. Well, I didn't know who said that and I asked all the guys underneath, 'Who said
    it's OK? Who's saying it's OK?' And all the guys are looking at me, like, 'Where are you hearing this from
    Vasquez?'" </q></p>
  <p> Vasquez told his friends that he kept hearing a voice telling him it was OK to come out. They crawled away from
    him, because they hadn't heard it. He told them to move towards the centre of the building, away from the light, and
    that he intended to go out and see for himself what was going on. Vasquez crawled out from underneath the building
    and headed for a grassy moll. </p>
  <p><q>I stood up and I looked to my left, and this bright, shiny, intense bright light was sitting in front of me. I
    saw this shadowy figure, kind of a little figure, scurry back into the light. </q></p>
  <p> --------------------- </p>
  <p><q>/ was told to keep my eyes closed throughout this time and the next thing that happened I heard this female
    voice ask, 'Do you remember?' </q></p>
  <p> ---------------------- </p>
  <p> I didn't know what that was, but when I lifted my left hand to shield the glare from this bright light, something
    hit my left shoulder, and it sounded like a fuse being blown. I go down, I reach with my hand for my friend.
    Hackett, and Hackett's screaming my last name, and I was reaching for him, but something else hit my back and I
    became unconscious. </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>RECOLLECTIONS</h2>
  <p><q>What I remember from here is that someone was telling me to keep my eyes closed. And I felt there was one person
    on my left, another person on my right. There was a cover over me and I was being lifted. My whole body felt tingly,
    real tingly, and the next thing that happened is a quick motion of two people, coming across my left and turning in
    unison and moving across, away from me and really fast. </q></p>
  <p><q>I was told to keep my eyes closed throughout this time and the next thing that happened. I heard this female
    voice ask. 'Do you remember?" And I said. 'Remember what?' And I didn't say a word. It was all mental
    communication. </q></p>
  <p><q>And when she heard me say, 'Remember what?'. I felt this deep concern come over her. Deep concern, like there
    was something wrong. The next thing. I had this physical exam, and after I was looking at this wall, and on the wall
    there was an insignia of some sort, a half-moon and a zig-zag of some sort." </q></p>
  <p> Vasquez pulled a neck bracelet out from underneath his shirt collar. Here was the self-same design that he had
    crafted from memory and wore at all times.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>VISIONS</h2>
  <p> And when I turned my head, I saw rows of men lying on a slab. At the 5th or 6th table, there were two things
    standing in back of me, and within just a split second, she just said, 'Got to sleep', and I did. The next thing I
    remember, this guy, I have to say it's a guy because I felt this was a male, he kept demanding for me to keeping at
    his eyes. And I didn't want to. I just didn't want to look at him because he scared me. </p>
  <p><q>And he said. 'There's nothing to be afraid...', or something like that. "Don't be afraid". And he kept demanding
    for me to look at his eyes. And I said. 'Only if it's going to help'. And he said. 'It will help'. I looked in his
    eyes and there were three images that I saw. One was myself, standing in an ocean, blue sky, and I'm standing in an
    ocean by myself. </q></p>
  <p><q>The other one was seeing a picture of the whole Earth being destroyed, coming apart, little by little. And the
    other one was an image of a human face, a pale, paste-white face, with a pupil like liquid mercury. And that's all I
    saw. I saw this face again. I became unconscious. The next thing I remember is that all of us were back in
    formation, everyone of us. </q></p></section>
<section>
  <h2> SELF-EXAMINATION</h2>
  <p><q>All of us are back in formation in line, but I remember that Alan and I were standing at the 2nd line, but we'd
    come back to the 4th line. We were all disorientated. It's like... it felt like we'd drank 50 gallons of beer,
    because we were kind of weaving back and forth. And so was Alan, and so was everybody else. </q></p>
  <p><q>We did what you'd call. I guess, our own personal examination. 'How are we doing?' A lot of us were very
    disorientated, didn't know what was going on. I looked across and I saw Sgt. Turner, who was standing there in his
    summer uniform, parade dress. He had all his medals on, I thought that he had spilled coffee on his trousers, but
    apparently he had had an 'accident'. He cursed and walked away. </q></p>
  <p><q>We were told to go back to our barracks by Sgt. Newkirk, and I was wondering, 'Hey, we didn't have a speech from
    the captain yet. What happened to our speech?" Well. we never had a speech and we started walking back, and some of
    us started falling down. We lost balance and I fell down too because everything was spinning, and that was unusual.
    And when I got up I started to walk away. </q></p>
  <p><q>Some of the people, some of the guys who'd been in formation, started getting sick, started vomiting, getting
    sick, falling down, like we lost all control of balance. When I came to the first building, I stopped and I looked
    at my watch. And my watch stopped at 7.40. I asked Jones, who was standing next to me, what time he had and he said
    he had 3.30. And he asked his friend who was standing right by, he said it was 4.45. All of our watches
    stopped. </q></p>
  <p><q>I got sick then. I got real sick. I don't know why, but I got back to my barracks and there were guys in there
    acting real odd, like some kind of drug-induced state or whatever. But they were acting really weird. Alan was
    sitting on his bed, gazing at the wall, it was like, he was "gone". </q></p>
  <p><q>I opened up my locker, and I was about to take my shirt off, when I noticed my shirt was unbuttoned at the top,
    my trousers button were open. But the funny thing is that my boots, the combat boots that you wear have eight holes.
    Well. it was laced through the fourth one and it came to a large, criss-cross at the end, and a sort of
    bow-tie. </q></p>
  <p><q>And I told myself. 'I know I didn't go out there like that... I know I didn't do this'. Because the drill
    sergeant would have said something, he would have been the first to scream and yell and say. 'What are you doing out
    here like this Vasquez?' </q></p>
  <p><q>Well. I told myself. 'I know I didn't do this', so I started changing my clothes, taking my clothes off, my
    trousers, and I found like a paste-glue, around my trousers. I wiped that off and wiped it off myself too. I don't
    know what that was.</q></p>
  <h2>A CHAIN OF EVENTS</h2>
  <p> John Vasquez then told me how he had begun to recall most of what had transpired at Ft. Benning over a decade
    later in 1989. </p>
  <p> As his memory slowly resumed, he began to research and investigate the strange happenings in 1991, beginning with
    a request for San Diego-based US Congressman Cunningham, to instigate an official inquiry on his behalf. The
    Congressman wrote to the US Army's National Personnel Records Centre in St. Louis, Missouri, requesting John's
    military file, known as a '201'. </p>
  <p> They wrote back stating that some documents pertaining to Vasquez's military career were missing, but crucially,
    they claimed to have no records of Vasquez having served at or visited Ft. Benning, either in a full or temporary
    capacity. </p>
  <p> Vasquez immediately set about the task of discovering the truth about what he and his fellow colleagues
    experienced that fateful day. Using his own money, he single-handedly wrote to the USAF, the US Army, the Joint
    Chief's press office, Ft. Sam Houston in Texas, the President's office and the Vice-President's office. </p>
  <p> He also contacted numerous other departments, including health departments and the Surgeon General's office.
    Vasquez wrote to the latter because on sifting through local newspapers of the time, he discovered one whose
    headline shot off the page: "Measles Outbreak Strikes Post's Troops" </p>
  <p> It was referring to a reported outbreak of measles at Ft. Benning. More to the point, they were referring to his
    battalion, 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry. </p>
  <p> Other health departments had previously advised Vasquez to contact the Walter Reid Medical Center in Washington
    D.C., who should have had details about the outbreak. He corresponded with a Dr. Rugal. Ph.D., who. on reading
    copies of the newspaper reports concerned, wrote back and said: <q>This is an unusual outbreak. There are no
      records</q>. </p>
  <p> Dr. Rugal told Vasquez that his main concern was that Walter Reid never sent a medical team to study the supposed
    outbreak, some thing they would have been automatically required to do had it been genuine. <q>We should have</q>,
    wrote Dr. Rugal, <q>it's a whole battalion</q>. </p>
  <p> Another local newspaper at the time made mention of the fact that a JAWS test had been conducted at Ft.
    Benning. </p>
  <p> --------------------------- </p>
  <p> PHOTOGRAPHS OF TWO LETTERS/FORMS: These hitherto classified UFO documents, derived from our extensive files,
    suddenly open up new avenues for research into the interesting aspect of psychological warfare and the role of Ft.
    Meade. </p>
  <p> ----------------------------</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>FRAYED NERVES?</h2>
  <p> On 23 October 1997. John Vasquez received a response to an inquiry made to the Joint Staff Panel. They maintained
    no knowledge of a JAWS test having ever been conducted at Ft. Benning. This was reiterated in similar fashion from
    officials at Ft. Benning itself, and Ft. Meade. But Vasquez had already received written confirmation from the USAF
    that a JAWS test had indeed been conducted at the base in question. </p>
  <p> That document, which I have seen (and was recorded on camera), is now the focus of some considerable
    attention. </p>
  <p> Vasquez has been told that the document is no longer available to the public, that anyone requesting it will be
    denied, even through a Freedom of Information Act request. He has also been discreetly contacted by telephone. A
    USAF official asked: "Can we please have our 'JAWS' document back?" </p>
  <p> In return, the official offered to provide Vasquez with 300 UFO documents. How old they were and what relevance
    they had, was anyone's guess, but some, Vasquez was told, referred to 'Roswell'. </p></section>
<section>
  <h2> SUMMARY</h2>
  <p> No amount of printed words here can come remotely close to matching the powerful impression left on those who have
    seen our video tape recording of the interview with John Vasquez, from which these quotes were derived. It is,
    without question, an extraordinary tale, but unlike so many ex-military personnel who have come forward down the
    years with equally bizarre stories. John Vasquez's credentials are different, and in so many positive ways: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>He has hitherto not been 'contaminated' by the UFO community - mainstream or otherwise. </li>
    <li>He is not out to make fame or fortune. </li>
    <li>He is not a senior military or intelligence figure, just a humble combat infantryman who seeks the truth. </li>
    <li>He has substantial documentation, correspondence and newsclippings which corroborates his background, the JAWS
      test and phoney 'measles' outbreak. </li>
    <li>He is not leaning on the side of those who might suggest this was an 'ET or UFO-related' experience/incident,
      albeit that if it were, it would be instantly labelled one of the most sensational in the annals of the
      subject. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>No, Vasquez is equally intrigued by the possibility that a secret JAWS test was deliberately conducted against an
    unwitting battalion of seasoned troops to gauge their reaction. </p>
  <p> Of course, it wouldn't be the first time that US military personnel have been used as guinea pigs to test covert
    experimental 'hard-ware', but might it be a 'first' for helping to provide factual evidence that 'UFOs' have been
    deployed in some form of mass psychological weapons test. </p>
  <p> Certainly, JAWS could not be construed as a defensive mechanism; the very meaning of the term 'Attack' suggests
    that it has potent offensive capabilities. </p>
  <p> If this was used on the unsuspecting 1,300 officers and men of 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry, the ramifications
    could be profound, not least for those soldiers who possibly suffered long-term effects. </p></section>
