<p>Since my new book, Glimpses of Other Realities Volume II: High Strangeness, was released to nationwide US bookstores
  on <time>1998-04-01</time>, I have heard from several ex-military and ex-intelligence people from around the country.
  They say the documents and military voices in my new book have true information about United States Government
  knowledge and cover-up of non-humans interacting with Earth.
</p>
<p>And a month ago, in <time>1998-05</time>, I was put in phone contact with a man I will simply call "Kewper" to
  protect his identity at his request. Kewper served as a First Lieutenant with the US Army Signal Corps and was a CIA
  administrator at an Army base in the southeastern USA from <time>1957</time> to <time>1960</time>. He provided his
  DD-214 and Certificate of Discharge along with a <time>1956</time> newspaper article about his being drafted. That
  civilian name and Army Signal Corps base of operations were consistent with the Army discharge papers.
</p>
<p>I would name the Army base, but as you read further you will see that Kewper was asked by a government watchdog to
  withhold that information in order to protect current <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a>-sensitive and classified
  operations out of the same base in <time>1998</time>.
</p>
<p>Back in the <time>1957</time> to <time>1960</time> period, Kewper taught radio operations and cryptography to Army
  Signal Corps officers under a false identification assigned to him by the <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a>. The head
  of that Signal Corps school had worked for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II. The OSS became
  the Central Intelligence Agency in <time>1947</time>. In addition to teaching, Kewper's CIA boss at the Army base
  asked Kewper to help analyse Top Secret cases gathered for the Air Force's Project Blue Book investigation of
  unidentified flying objects.
</p>
<p>When I first talked with Kewper a month ago, he said his security oaths expired 30 to 35 years after he got out of
  the Army and <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> in <time>1960</time>. So that period ended around <time>1995</time>.
  Therefore, he said, he now feels he's not doing anything wrong by discussing with me his extraordinary first-hand
  knowledge and experiences concerning "extraterrestrials"as he said they were referred to in the Top Secret classified
  files he'd read and analysed. However, a month ago he was not certain he wanted to go on the public record.
</p>
<p>On <time>1998-05-30</time>, I called him again to ask if he might now be willing to do a radio interview as long as
  his real civilian name was withheld. Since <time>1993</time> I have been reporting science and environmental news for the
  nationally syndicated Chancellor Radio Broadcasting Network. Kewper surprised me when he immediately said, "I'm afraid
  your phone is tapped." He'd had a call on Monday, May 25 from a man who did not explain who he was or for whom he
  worked, and did not address Kewper by name but simply started talking. And this is what Kewper told me on the record,
  under the condition that I edit out subjects that the unidentified caller said were still sensitive. Those edits are
  indicated by parenthesis notes in the following interview first broadcast on the North American syndicated radio
  programs Dreamland, on <time>1998-05-31</time>, and Coast to Coast AM Hosted by <span class="people">Art Bell</span> on all-night radio, June 1-2,
  1998:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">You answered the phone and they said...?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yeah, they didn't repeat my name. They just said: "We understand that you had a
    conversation with somebody in Pennsylvania in regards to classified materials that had been classified, and we would
    appreciate it if you didn't bring up the fact in an interview or television interviews in regards to [Army base name
    deleted] that you had mentioned on the telephone, and also about anything going on in the [CIA aerial logistics
    deleted] or anything in regard to that. We would really appreciate it because reporters and just interested people,
    if it gets aired, may try to get into the classified area thereand, of course, to their own physical harm."
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">They did not say that you could not talk about the six-fingered humanoid film?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">No; nothing like that.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Well, then, could we do an interview today? Not for name attribution but to put
    you on the radio as a person who servedand you can tell me how you want it describedand who saw this film, and you
    could try to give me the year. Can we do that?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yeah, I guess so, as long as I don't bring up anything about...
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">So you were getting the reports that Project Blue Book was collecting; that
    they were allowing to the public only those they were explaining. You were actually handling the files that were
    unexplained?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes. Probably not all of them, but at least we were one of the groups
    investigating the unexplained. I know when they closed down Project Blue Book they said they had found absolutely
    nothing as far as what they did in Project Blue Book that wasn't explained. And that was actually true because
    anything they didn't explain would be sent to Fort Belvoir in Virginia and then farmed out from there to other
    military. The <a href="/org/us/ic/fbi">FBI</a> was involved with some of the things, too, I know, because FBI would show up on some of these
    peoples' doorsteps.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">What were the years that you were personally working in the CIA and handling
    these highly classified reports related to the UFO phenomenon?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper"><time>1957</time> to <time>1960</time>. I was in the service starting in 1956,
    but I didn't get involved with this in the first year, you know.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">And your rank was what and in which military branch?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">I was in the Army and a First Lieutenant. I was still actually in the Army
    Signal Corps, but I also worked for the <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a>, too, because I was getting two paychecks.
    I was getting one from the <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> and one from military service.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Now, in the course of this work from <time>1957</time> to <time>1960</time>,
    did you see any 16-mm films related to this phenomenon?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">In regard to UFOs in Roswell, you mean?
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Right.
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">The only film I saw is the one that has been released in the last couple of
    years showing an alien autopsy. I saw that very same film in <time>1957</time>.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">And what were the circumstances in which you saw this?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">It was in regard to studying UFOs, in working up and going through and trying
    to cover or investigate some of these folders we had in regard to the different sightings. Apparently someone at
    Fort Belvoir, Virginia, sent that film to my boss. The team viewed the thing one Saturday morning and he had to send
    it right back to Fort Belvoir again. But we did see that one. And we also saw several other at that time highly
    classified UFO sightings on film. We had one film showing a UFO actually developing or materialising over a power
    plant out in one of the western states like Oregon or Washington or Utahsomewhere out in that area.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">You mean someone just happened to be filming?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes. Someone was trying a brand new camera and they were filming this power
    plant. First, the mountainous areas around, and then they were over to this power plant. The power plant had a
    smokestack and had some smoke going on up. And a little ways away from where the smoke was going up, we started
    seeing little white, round...like a little piece of a cloud. It got more and more dense, and more and more round.
    And pretty soon you could see little tiny windows around the bottom section. I'm just using "windows" as a term
    loosely. It developed more and more, and pretty soon it looked real silver, and soon it started flying off by
    itself, slowly.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">So you had on film, in Central Intelligence Agency work, we'll call it an
    actual materialisation of what appeared to be a hard, silver disc that literally just emerged from what looked like
    a vaporous cloud?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes; just a little ways from a cloud emitted by the smokestack. So we thought
    at that time that these aliens must have some way of materialising or travelling from one area to another and
    materialising, by using the current that was down in the power plant somehow to change the electric currents...into
    something electromagnetic or something solid, like solid material.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Now, how was the autopsy/dissection of the six-fingered humanoid film presented
    to you? What was the explanation of how this had occurred?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">They just said that this was done at Roswell, the same day or day after the
    same, I thinkthe craft was picked up at night; that some time during the next day this autopsy was performed there
    at the military base, and also an autopsy was performed in town in the little clinic or hospital they have there.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Now that would contradict the statement released with the autopsy/dissection
    film by the alleged cameraman who said he was there and filmed the wreckage and the beams that had the symbols, and
    that about two weeks later, I believe, he was asked to go to some place to film the autopsy dissection. Do you know
    how to reconcile these two pieces of information?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">No, I don't, because we were toldit mentioned right in the filmthat it was done
    in New Mexico, that most of the film was done right there at the military base outside of Roswell and that some
    little parts of the film were done at the local hospital or clinic.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">And what was the briefing to you about these six-fingered humanoids? How were
    they described? Was there any information?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">There was little info in regards to that. The film was about 10 years old at
    that time, and they just said this was the only film that we have of the aliens and the body. There are pictures
    that have been taken by different private people showing these aliens walking around outside their craft, something
    like that, but this is the only film that we have that shows a close picture of the aliens and exactly what they
    look like. So, if you run across any more of these sightings that people have sent in that describe this particular
    being, then you can match them up according to this.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Was the film you saw in black and white or colour?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">It was black and white.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">And did you ever see any colour film or photographs of these beings?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">No, not of the beings. The only coloured film I remembered seeing was of that
    spaceship materialising.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Now, you were working for the CIA and this was tangential to Project Blue Book.
    How were you shown this film? What were the screening conditions? Were you in Washington? Were you in the South?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yeah, they sent this down to [location deleted at Kewper's request after
    anonymous phone call referenced in introduction to this interview] and we looked at the film. Then my boss had to
    send it right back the next day by a special courier they had running between Fort Belvoir and CIA headquarters.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">How many of you were there?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">About 20 of us. There were 26 people involved altogether in our group, and I
    would say that about 20 of us saw it. Some were overseas at the time. A lot of the UFO pictures that we got were not
    from the United States; they were European, Central American, Mexican, and South American sightings of UFOs. One was
    an Italian film. So I believe we got it down there at the CIA because the CIA had facilities in all these foreign
    countries to be able to try to verify some of these things; because we had men in all the different parts of the
    world.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">So this was your first visual sort of experience with something non-human. Do
    you remember what you thought at the time?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yeah, I was kind of perplexed. I thought: How can this be? How can these beings
    come here? How can they be completely different from man?
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">But sort of resembled us in a humanoid-shape way.
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes, they did; they did resemble us. That particular alien, the six-fingered
    alien you might say it didn't resemble us completely, but it looked like a miniature man with a smaller head, but it
    wasn't the great big narrow face with the big eyes. It didn't have ears like we have; it had a little circle around
    a hole inside of its skull. The ears didn't look like [ours]. The nose looked basically like [ours] and the mouth
    was much smaller.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Do you remember if this film was shown to you in 1957, 10 years after 1947? Was
    there any knowledge then among the intelligence agencies from any communication with these beings about what their
    origin was?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Nothing really. While I was there, the whole three years, we never saw any
    information about where they came from and what they were doing here. Nothing was ever brought out in regards to
    that. My boss and I were both wondering about that: Why were they here? Why would they come here? And where were
    they from? During that period of time, as far as I know, the government had no idea where they were from or what
    they were trying to do here.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">From a military and CIA point of view, were they considered a threat?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Not really a threat, but there was a questionable threat; and they were working
    under that assumption to try to increase the different radar around the country more so that they could detect if
    they were coming in from outer space and be able to get some type of scrambling from the Air Force's nearest base to
    check it out or shoot them down or whatever.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Were you ever given a briefing or exposed to any other information between 1957
    and 1960 beyond that screening of the autopsy/dissection film?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">I would say no, not during that time. We just had the various foreign, a few
    domestic, but mostly foreign sightings that we had gone over. We had people overseas who would go and interview
    these people who had photographs of aliens outside of a saucer, but nothing at that time. Basically I saw just the
    film of the autopsy on that particular being; but, like I mentioned, when I went to Area 51 in 1958 I did see
    another type of a being where it was the peaked face, the great big eyes and the little chin that has always been
    termed a "grey", I believe.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Okay, can you describe that experience?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">We were out there for a meeting of all the CIA people around this country and
    over towards the Far East and so on, and we had the meeting there at Area 51. We were involved with this Project
    Blue Book thing and they wanted the meeting there, so some of us involved directly with itthere were only five of us
    that went from [name of Army base deleted] and we were the only five that had the meeting out there. They had
    meetings right in the main buildings of the Air Force, a little base they had there.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">At Nellis AFB in Nevada.
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes. But we went out to Groom Lake area and the two areas they had out there.
    They showed it to us, but only to us and not to the CIA people from the Far East or from Central America. They
    didn't go out there; it was only the five of us. We landed at Area 51 at the main landing strip. Then we got into a
    van-type of small minibus. After that, we didn't stop to get into any other buildings there. They took us down about
    10 miles away, something of that nature, and stopped at the first special area. And they took us into the area
    there, and they had U-2s and also the SR-71 BlackbirdsI believe they were flying them at that time. We were there a
    short period of time, and then we got back on the bus and went about another eight miles to the third and final area
    where they had highly classified material. We stopped there and went into an office area first, and then a colonel
    there met us and took us on a tour. He took us first of all down a walkway into a hangar area that had been carved
    out. It might have been a natural cave to start out with, but at least it was carved out of the mountainside area.
    It was not extremely large.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Was this the Papoose mountain range?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">I wouldn't really know. I don't think I ever questioned what the mountains
    were.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Okay, but so I am clear, this is a colonel who is joining you and your CIA boss
    and three other CIA men in your program?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Were there only six of you?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes. As we passed through different areas, naturally there were other workers
    and scientists working on different things, and office personnel.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">And did you understand what the reason was that your boss was having you go to
    have this tour by this colonel?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes. They wanted us to see the craft so when we looked at pictures, trying to
    identify fake pictures from the real thing, this would be a help to us. That was the main reason why we were toured
    through the area to see the different types of craft, so we could pick out the [hoaxed] "garbage can covers" from
    the real craft.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">So the six of you, with the colonel, your CIA boss, yourself and these three
    other CIA men involved in this project, you're going, literally moving, walking into a carved-out area of a
    mountain?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Can you describe exactly what you saw?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">As soon as we got in, the first thing we did see were two small craft.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">What colour were they?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">They were silver, kind of a silver finish to them; not real shiny and bright,
    but basically silver.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">What was the diameter?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">About 18 or 20 feet. They were quite small.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Were you allowed to go over and touch them?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">No. We were on a walkway area and couldn't get down over to where the craft
    were actually sitting.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">And how many others could you see?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">At least about seven, I think. There were some larger ones that were in the
    rear towards the end that we could see down there because they were probably 50 to 60 feet in diameter.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Could you see any characteristics on these? Were any different from another?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">They were all disc-shaped, but some had larger bottom areas that extended down
    the same as the top, the top extending up. And they were in different colours. The larger ones in the rear were a
    real deep, real dark grey colour, and some of the other ones were lighter in colour, but maybe like a light- or
    medium-brown type of thing. The larger ones in the rear had real large top units and large bottom units to them and
    were sitting on metal saw-horses to hold them up off the ground.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">And did the colonel try to explain, or did he have knowledge or any
    understanding of the propulsion system of the extraterrestrial craft?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">That question was asked, and he mentioned it was
    electromagnetic/antigravitational-type engines. But some of the craft had other propulsion systems also, but he
    didn't go into great detail on other propulsions. Apparently it was like antimatter propulsion on one of the units,
    something of that nature. And I saw they'd tried to reverse-engineer one craft, so part of it was taken apart. They
    were trying to figure out how it works, and he was explaining to us that there really was no physical motor in that
    thing. The entire disc was like an electronic circuit, and the aliens had to be inside of this disc to complete the
    electronic circuit to make it fly. The Area 51 people knew that, because they had tried to make that one fly. It was
    just like a battery electrical unit; it worked with antigravitational/electromagnetic drive, but the whole saucer
    itself was like the drive of the ship. It was all coated with nickel inside and it was like a giant circuit, an
    electronic circuit. And it took the aliens to complete the circuit because they were tied right in with it: they had
    headbands they wore that had detectors on, and they had finger-type board control where they could fly the craft.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Those are the hand-imprinted, six-fingered control panels that were with that
    autopsy film?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">And did you see the panels themselves actually there with the craft?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes. They were there with the craft. They were trying to figure out the
    electronic circuitry because there was no wiring of any kind that they could see. But later on when they had it at
    Groom Lake, they had a couple of scientists there who used microscopes to check over the fingertip-control
    harnessing and found little fibres going out from it. They found out then that it was a fibre optic type of
    electrical transmission throughout the craft.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">All done with light.
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes, it was light. The report I read originally said that when they looked
    inside the craft it was glowing with a real thin light inside from all the circuitry fibre optics.
    Reverse-engineering of that is apparently where we got fibre optics from.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">What was the colonel saying to you about these discs in relationship to where
    you were going next?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">He just stated that these are some of the craft we have picked up and captured
    in different parts of the world. Apparently some of them were even brought in from overseas from some point or
    other, but I gathered that most were captured within the US. He then mentioned that we were going back out to the
    general office area and another smaller hangar area to see the being, this extraterrestrial being, that they had
    there at that time.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Try to walk us through what happened next.
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Okay. We went from the hangar area where the saucers were, out to a covered
    walkway area and into an office complex, I would call it, because it was a bunch of small rooms and offices. They
    had a special room for viewing that had one-way windows in itone-way mirrors, rather. We could look through the
    window into this small office, and the being that was in there was not able to see us through the mirror because
    there was a mirror on his side.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">And what happened?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">They said we could go in and talk to this being, and at that time I chose not
    to go in. Years later, I wished I had, but I chose not to go in because they did tell us that the being spoke
    telepathically. The colonel had more terms added to it other than telepathically, but the being wouldn't speak in
    any manner that we could hear through our ears. So I chose to stay out, and the other four people did go in.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Your boss, the three other <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> guys and the
    Colonel Jim?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Now, can you describe the being exactly, from your watching this and listening?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">What the colonel called him was a "grey". He had the large head and bigger
    eyes, kind of slanted bigger eyes. He looked like he was wearing sunglasses because the lenses were real dark. He
    had kind of a slim face down to a peaked chin with just a little nose area, a tiny slit of a mouth and just holes in
    the side of his head for ear openings.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">About how tall?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">About five feet, something like that.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">What was the surface of the skin like in colour and texture?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yeah, it was greyish looking, but it looked fairly coarse, not like the
    smoothness of our skin.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Now what happened between your boss, the three <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a>
    guys and Colonel Jim in that room communicating with the being?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">My boss did ask him, <q>What are you doing here? And why do you come here?</q>
    The only answer he got was, <q>We are not here to conquer the Earth. We are not here to destroy anything. We are
      here to add knowledge to humans so they can gain more knowledge in different areas.</q> He [the
    <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> boss] said it was probably like a 16- or 20-letter name where he was from, but he
    couldn't remember what the being said. After he came out and we left, I asked him and he said, "I don't remember
    what it was, but it was a real long name that he had given us as far as where he was from." He'd asked if it was a
    part of the galaxy or if that was his planet. He said the being answered back to him that it was part of a galaxy he
    was from. Not our galaxy, but a different galaxy.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">A different galaxy?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">When the being had "telepathed" to your boss that it wasn't here to hurt
    anything but to impart knowledge, how would they impart knowledge to us if they weren't making themselves public to
    the Earth in a straightforward way?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">I remember my boss mentioning that when he said that, he denoted the creature
    was stretching the truth or lying just by the tone of the answer, this type of thing; that he wasn't telling the
    truth altogether, you know.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Did your boss and the other men explain to you how the telepathic process went?
    What did they experience?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">They said they definitely weren't hearing a thing through their ears and that
    the voice they heard more or less was right in the mind itself. They could put their fingers in their ears and they
    would still hear the being. One tried that; he plugged both ears to see if he could still hear the being, and he
    could.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Oh, you could see through the glass that one of the men actually put his
    fingers in his ears?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes, to see if he was actually hearing the being, and he wasn't, but he just
    heard what the being said right in his mind.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">What was the sound of the being in his mind?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">He said the voice almost sounded like an electronically reproduced voice. And
    now, of course, we have computers that can talk to us and answer the phone with a computer voice. Back in those
    days, that type of thing was just beginning with computers. He said it didn't sound like a human voice: it sounded
    like an electronic voice.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Neither male nor female?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Neither one, sort of in between.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Why would the concept of a telepathic-communication being bother you?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Well, naturally, it's something I'd never run across before; that would be a
    certain amount of bother, you know.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Did you ever learn in your work for the <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> what
    the relationship was between the six-fingered beings and the grey being?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Nope, never did.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Did someone explain why this being was even being kept there?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">No. They wouldn't tell us why he was kept there, how long he had been there or
    anything like that. I think one of the answers was, "We can't talk about that." I believe that was the main answer.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">And who at Area 51 seemed to be in control of this being? Which agency?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">It was the Air Force, actually. The Air Force colonel is the one we talked to.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Did this colonel or anybody explain to you what their perception was of this
    grey being from the standpoint of whether there was any kind of a threat?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">No, they didn't really consider it like a big threat, but there was always
    this: "We don't know for sure, but we don't think they are going to be harmful to us, but we don't really know for
    sure. We can't say for sure that they are not trying to invade, or checking us all out and checking out our
    military." Because even at that time, the saucer sightings were always around classified areas and any military
    bases, that type of thing. So it looked almost like they were scouting, you know.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">By the time you left the Army Signal Corps and <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a>
    in <time>1960</time>, did you have any further briefings about the beings, and were they referred to as
    "extraterrestrials"?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes, they were referred to as "extraterrestrials". Most of the time they
    referred to the one out there as a "grey".
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">The one at Area 51?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes. They just referred to it as a "grey".
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Did they have any live six-fingered humanoids anywhere?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">No, not that I know of. That was one of the questions I asked the military man
    on the way in thereif this was the same kind of being. He'd mentioned they had a being that we were going to look
    at, and I asked if it was the same being as Roswell. He said no. And I asked if they had any beings like at Roswell,
    and he said no.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">And Roswellfrom your point of view in 1957 when you were shown the six-fingered
    humanoid film, did it identify in the introduction where exactly the six-fingered humanoids had been retrieved from?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">They just said "near Roswell".
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">But they didn't specify?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">No, no. They didn't specify if that was the craft they had captured near
    Roswell; they didn't specify that. They just said "near Roswell", and I understand they had two or three craft they
    had picked up there that same summer of 1947.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Did anyone talk about the weather balloon story as being deliberately floated
    to obscure...?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes, they did, and they said it was a cover story. The weather balloon was a
    cover story.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">To cover up the fact that extraterrestrials and craft were retrieved.
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes. And I asked them why they covered this up. This was 10 years later...
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">In <time>1957</time>?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Right, in <time>1958</time> [while visiting Area 51]. I asked him [Colonel
    Jim], "Why do you continue to cover this up?" Well, he said it was covered originally because the Cold War was just
    starting and somebody up in the governmentI'm sure it was probably President Trumanhad requested a tight cover on
    this because with the Cold War starting and now having aliens flying around, he thought it would be too much for the
    American public all at once. But it was perpetuated, and even to this day they are still covering it with balloon
    stories.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Now it is <time>1998</time>. This is 40 years after you first saw the 16-mm
    black and white film of the six-fingered humanoid dissection, and there still appears to be a policy of silence and
    denial about this extraterrestrial interaction. Why do you think the government has not told the United States and
    the world what they know?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">You would think they would have by now. But I know that at the same time
    through the Cold War era back in the 1950s I was involved with itthe CIA in a lot of cases in regards to these
    unidentified flying objects did contact and work with even the Russians during that time of the Cold War to see what
    they had, because the Russians had contacted us in regards to UFOs as they had UFO sightings also. They contacted us
    because they thought it might be some kind of advanced flying craft that we had, and they were calling us to warn us
    to keep them out of their area because they thought they were our craft. We told them they were not ours.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">If Russia and the United States were secretly trying to talk with each other
    about an extraterrestrial presence, did you ever have any further information over the last 40 years about what our
    government's understanding of the agenda or intent of these beings is by now?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">I know that we have worked together with Russia on this, especially since the
    Gorbachev thing and we became more friendly; and that Russia is involved with particle beam weapons, too, from
    satellite and from ground. We had actually given them the particle beam weapon to be able to shoot down any of the
    saucer craft.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">But why would we try to shoot down craft if we perceived these beings to be
    benevolent?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Well, it could be something that happened since that time. I believe it would
    have happened over the [former] Soviet Union because I know they had a big craft go over that was almost like a
    mother ship, and they tried to shoot it down but the thing just shot all the aircraft that they had pursuing it,
    right out of the air in just a few seconds, with whatever lasers or whatever they [alien craft] haddeath rays,
    something like that.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">What is the source of your information on this?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">This is through my friend, through my boss's son. When he talked to me in 1993
    he mentioned that they'd had an ugly incident there where the aliens had actually attacked some type of a military
    base from where they had sent the planes up to attack [the mother ship].
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Did you ever learn what type of being was in that craft?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">No, I didn't. Nobody did. It was a flyover-type thing and nothing landed, so no
    one would know what was actually in there. But I know the big craft contained many small saucer craft; it was almost
    like an aircraft carrier, like we would have with airplanes on it.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">So, in summary, you went from 1957 to 1960 seeing these highly classified
    reports about extraterrestrial beings, technology and craft. You actually saw 16-mm black and white
    autopsy/dissection film of the six-fingered humanoid when you were in the CIA. You actually went to Nevada, to
    Nellis AFB and Area 51, where you personally saw at least seven different craft and the live being that was
    described as a "grey" with large black eyes and was different from the six-fingered humanoid. And yet, when you left
    the Army Signal Corps and <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> work in <time>1960</time>, there was still no
    understanding about the relationship between those beings or why they were there.
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes, that's right; one- hundred-per-cent right. At that time there was a
    question mark, a big question mark as to why they were here. In some casesapparently some of the US sightingsthey
    were tremendously friendly.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Were friendly?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes, were friendly. And, of course, there were all the abduction things that
    came out later. There weren't any in that original Blue Book file that I had seen at that time in Blue Book. I know
    there were quite a few later that said they were abducted.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">And did you ever see any references to animal mutilations or unusual deaths?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes. At that time we had it out in Colorado, I think. I saw some of those.
    Different parts of the animal were taken like samplesthe stomachs in some, sex organs in othersand [the animals
    were] apparently mutilated with a laser weapon of some kind that left very precise cutting edges.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Did you read about any such cases in that <time>1957</time> to
    <time>1960</time> time period?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes, especially from Colorado.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Even back then?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">And was there speculation on the part of the Central Intelligence Agency or the
    military about the relationship between these unusual animal deaths and the extraterrestrials?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes. The only thought at that time, if I remember correctly, is that they
    [extraterrestrials] were taking samples of these various animals on the Earth just to see more or less what their
    different functions were...
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">Do you think that this story should be told in its entirety today?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes, I think it should. I think it would be helpful in explaining it, first of
    all. We still have a lot of sightings to this day and age.
  </p>
  <p class="question" data-author="Howe">And this is why you're talking to me?
  </p>
  <p class="answer" data-author="Kewper">Yes.

  <h2>Epilogue</h2>
  <p>After this audiotaped interview was broadcast on the North American syndicated radio programs Dreamland and Coast
    To Coast AM Hosted by <span class="people">Art Bell</span>, I learned from Kewper that he'd contacted a phone company executive in his city to
    inquire about the source of the anonymous call to him on May 25. He was told that the source was the Wackenhut
    Corporationa security operation that works for the National Reconnaissance Office and other sensitive military and
    intelligence agencies in the United States.
  </p>
  <p>More than 50 years after the 1947 Roswell incident, a major question is: What do the United States, England,
    Australia other American ally government insidersand, according to Kewper, even Russiaknow which sustains the
    Orwellian policy of silence and denial in which lies are ordered to become official truth?...as written so strongly
    in SOM1-01, the Majestic-12 Group Special Operations Manual of April 1954:
  </p>
  <p>Any encounter with entities known to be of extraterrestrial origin is to be considered to be a matter of national
    security and therefore classified TOP SECRET. Under no circumstance is the general public or the public press to
    learn of the existence of these entities. The official government policy is that such creatures do not exist, and
    that no agency of the federal government is now engaged in any study of extraterrestrials or their artifacts. Any
    deviation from this stated policy is absolutely forbidden.
  </p>
  <p>What will it take to change this policy instigated by US President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order in 1947? What
    military-industrial-complex interests are so vested in perpetuating the suppression, and why? It seems a right of
    the entire global human family to know that we are not alone in this universe, and that extraterrestrial biological
    entities and other-dimensional entities have been interacting with this planet for aeons, affecting our biological,
    social and religious evolutions. But why?
