<p>
  The witnesses in this MA-1 case are Royal Canadian Air Force pilots who were flying in a formation of four F-86 Sabre
  jet aircraft (Figure 1). The planes were flying at <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">36000</span> <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">pieds</span>
    </span>, headed due west over the Canadian Rockies, about an hour before sunset <span class="source">R. J. Childerhose: Affidavit written in <time>1958-05</time>, and private communication to Dr. B. Maccabee.</span>
  . As they were approaching a large thunderhead R. J. Childerhose, the pilot in the second position (left side of the
  formation) saw a <q>bright light which was sharply defined and disc-shaped</q> or <q>like a shiny silver dollar
  sitting horizontal,</q> far below the planes but above the lower layer of clouds. It appeared to be <q>considerably
  brighter than the sunlight.</q> (Figure 2.)
</p>
<p>
  Sighting duration was variously quoted at <time>P45S</time> (Klass, 1968) to <time>P3M</time>. The pilot reported the
  observation to the flight leader, then took a photograph of it. That photograph, a Kodachrome color slide, was
  subsequently analyzed by Dr. <span class="people">Bruce Maccabee</span> who considered the hypotheses that the object
  was a cloud, a plasma phenomenon, or ball lightning (<span lang="de">kugelblitz</span>). We refer the reader to his
  detailed study <span class="source">Maccabee,
Bruce. "Optical Power Output of an Unidentified High Altitude Light Source." Private communication.</span> while
  presenting here only a summary of his arguments.
</p>
<p>The cloud hypothesis was contradicted by two facts, namely the equal brightness of the object on both sides as
  opposed to the darker appearance of clouds away from the sunlight, and the fact that portions of the object were
  brighter than the brightest clouds.
</p>
<p>The plasma or ball lightning hypothesis has been mentioned by <a href="/people/k/KlassPhilipJ/index.html">Klass</a>
  (Klass, 1968) and by <a href="/people/a/AltschulerMartinD/index.html">Altschuler</a> (Altschuler, 1968). It is
  contradicted by the radiance of the object and the duration of the observation. Maccabee derives the radiance <i>L</i>
  by solving the standard photographic equation, corrected for the effects of atmospheric attenuation:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
  <i>L</i>=4<i>Ef</i><sup>2</sup><i>exp</i>[(<i>b-a</i>)/<i>cos</i>θ]/<i>Tcos</i><sup>4</sup>Φ (1)
</p>
<p>where</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
  <i>E</i>=<i>H/t</i>. (2)
</p>
<p><i>H</i> is the film exposure level in J/cm<sup>2</sup> and t is the shutter time in seconds. <i>L</i> is the
  radiance of the object in the direction of the camera in W/sr/cm<sup>2</sup>, E is the irradiance on the focal plane
  of the camera in W/cm2, and f is the ratio of the focal length to the diameter, as set by the operator of the camera.
  The factor exp[(<i>b-a</i>)/cosθ] corrects for atmospheric attenuation, <i>b</i> being the optical thickness of the
  atmosphere from the ground to the altitude of the plane, a the optical thickness to the altitude of the object and θ
  the zenith angle of the slant path from the plane to the object. <i>T</i> is the transmission of the optics (aircraft
  window and lens) and <i>f</i> is the angle between the optic axis of the camera and the optical path from the lens to
  the image.
</p>
<p>We refer the reader to Maccabee’ s analysis for an excellent discussion of the range of values of these parameters.
  He finds a value between 1.09 and 1.34 for the attenuation correction factor, a value of 0.7 for <i>T</i>, shutter
  time of 1/125 at f/8 and a value of 0.95 for cos<sup>4</sup>Φ. The average density over much of the image is estimated
  at 0.12, leading to a value of H = 10<sup>-4</sup> J/cm<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<p>Inserting these values into (eq. 1) and (eq. 2) gives estimates of radiance of 1.7 to 2.0 W/sr/cm<sup>2</sup> if the
  object was at distances of 6 or 20 kilometers, respectively. Assuming that the object was a Lambertian emitter with
  constant emittance over its surface, Maccabee finds a range of 2.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> W (2,500 megawatts) to 3 × 10<sup>10</sup>
  W (30,000 megawatts) for the power output within the spectral range of the film. As he rightly points out, however, a
  the total power emitted over all frequencies might be much greater.o
