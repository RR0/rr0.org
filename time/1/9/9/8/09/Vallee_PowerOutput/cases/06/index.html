  <i>Case no. 3: December 30, 1966. Haynesville (Louisiana) -- Classification: CE-2</i></p>
<p>
  The third case is drawn from the official U.S. files. It took place at 8:15 P.M. on December 30, 1966, in the vicinity
  of Haynesville, Louisiana. The witnesses are a professor of physics, Dr. G., and his family. Inquiries with the
  weather bureau disclose that the weather was overcast, with fog and a light drizzle, ceiling about three hundred feet,
  all parameters that are in agreement with the witnesses' statements. There was no thunderstorm.</p>
<p>
  In early 1967 the author came across this sighting while reviewing the files of the U.S. Air Force as an associate of
  Dr. J. Allen Hynek at Northwestern University. The report by Dr. G. and his family had not been followed up by Air
  Force personnel, so we decided to pursue it on our own. Dr. G. told Dr. Hynek and myself that he was driving north
  that night on U.S. Highway 79 between Haynesville and the Arkansas border when his wife called his attention to a
  red-orange glow appearing through and above the trees ahead to their left. They continued to observe it as they drove
  down the highway. It appeared as a luminous hemisphere, pulsating regularly, ranging from dull red to bright orange,
  with a period of about two seconds. There was no smoke or flame that would have been characteristic of a fire. </p>

corrections and improvements to his initial calculations in this case and those that follow. (Private communication,
August 8, 1993).
