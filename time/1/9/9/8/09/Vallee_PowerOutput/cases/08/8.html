  <br> <br> where <i>d</i> = distance between the car and the object.</p>
<p>

  This formula is arrived at as follows: Calling <i>I<sub>c</sub></i> the intensity of the car headlights at a distance
  of 10 feet ahead of the car, <i>I<sub>u</sub></i> the intensity of the unknown source at distance <i>d</i>, and
  <i>P</i> the optical power output of the object we can write:</p>

<p>

  The fact that the headlights were washed out by the unknown source at a ten-foot distance provides a lower limit for
  <i>I<sub>u</sub></i>. If we assume that we can detect a "just noticeable difference" (JND) between
  <i>I<sub>u</sub></i> and (<i>I<sub>u</sub></i> + <i>I<sub>c</sub></i>) we write:</p>

  In his report, Dr. Condon estimated the distance at 2,400 feet, which gave an energy of 9 X 10<sup>8</sup> W (900
  megawatts) for the UFO. A more correct estimate is given by the subsequent investigation since the clearing is
  actually located 1,800 feet from the observation point. The energy output becomes 5 X 10<sup>8</sup> W (500
  megawatts). These figures are approximations only: As David Newton has since pointed out in correspondence with the
  author, the fact that the car headlights were not radiating uniformly in all directions but were directed onto the
  road by reflectors, should be taken into account in any refined calculations.</p>

  <i>Case no. 4: November 5, 1976. Grenoble (France) -- Classification: MA-1</i></p>
<p>
  Another remarkable observation made near Grenoble, France, on November 5, 1976, by a senior French scientist is
  relevant here. As in the previous case, there were multiple witnesses and the duration was long enough to allow
  details of the object and its trajectory to be seen and recalled. There were two other remarkable characteristics:
  first, it was possible to establish the distance of the object with precision; second, the exceptional qualifications
  of one of the witnesses provided some physical parameters that have rarely been available in UFO cases.</p>
<p>
  We are indebted to GEPAN, the French government's official UFO investigation task force (now known as SEPRA), for
  communicating to me the details of the case, which the author had the opportunity to discuss with them at length </p>
