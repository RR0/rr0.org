  <br> <br> The results of the analysis bracket the distance between the cell and the UFO: between 135 meters and 480
  meters, or roughly between 400 and 1,500 feet.</p>
<p>
  Although the diameter of the disc was estimated (5 meters) this is irrelevant to the calculation of the power output,
  which can be determined from the luminous flux at the photocell via equation (3). Assuming a distance of 135 m one

  hence <i>P</i> <u>&gt;</u> 2.3 kW whereas for 480 m, <i>P</i><u>&gt;</u>29 kW, assuming isotropic radiation from the
  object.</p>
<p>
  Curiously the GEPAN Report states that it assumes a continuous spectrum (black body radiation) and cites a range for
  the minimum power output between 160 kW and 5 MW. It is not a safe assumption that UFO emission is anything like a
  black body: The report states: "The fact that it was glowing red lets us put a -- rather unhelpful -- value of the
  wavelength of maximum emission at or above 700 nm."</p>

  <i>Case no. 6: August 24, 1990 Greifwahl (Germany) -- Classification: MA-1</i></p>
<p>
  Numerous eyewitness reports, supported by videotapes and photographs, make this "one of the best-documented sightings
  in Europe," according to von Ludwiger, to whose analysis the reader is referred for full details of the case (Von
  Ludwiger, 1995). Independent witnesses observed formations of luminous spheres hovering in the sky Northeast of
  Greifswald. Hundreds of tourists and local residents saw, photographed and filmed the phenomena, characterized by
  rapid accelerations and abrupt changes of direction, inconsistent with known phenomena or manufactured objects. One
  private investigation group received six videotapes and eleven photographs from different individuals and interviewed
  in person more than a dozen witnesses.</p>
<p>
  The investigation concluded that the phenomena "consisted of two groups of luminous spheres that hovered nearly
  motionless for about 30 minutes between 8:30 P.M. and 9:00 P.M. over the Pomeranian sea. The brighter and closer group
  formed a circle of six luminous spheres. The second group formed the shape of a Y."</p>
<p>
  The German weather service reported that approximately 5/8 of the sky was covered with high, fleecy clouds in partly
  shaded masses and gray, sheet-like clouds at 2,500 meters. There was a light ENE wind and the temperature was about 60
  degrees F, or 16 degrees C.</p>
<p>
  Given the number of precise observations, supported by photographs, it was possible to triangulate the position of the
  objects with some accuracy. From a distance of 14 km the Y formation appeared to be as bright as the full moon,
  according to one of the photographers, Mr. Ladwig. If the spectral distribution is equal to that of the moon, then the
  square distance law for the power output of the moon with 0.138 lux yields an estimated optical power output of:
  <i>P</i> = 1.8 X 10<sup>-3</sup> X 4 <i>pi</i> X 14,000<sup>2</sup> = 4.4 X 10<sup>6</sup> W by following the same
  reasoning as in the Fort-de-France situation (case no. 2).</p>
