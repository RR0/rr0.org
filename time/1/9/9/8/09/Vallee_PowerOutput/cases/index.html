<p>The cases that follow have been extracted from a larger sample where luminosity or power output data could be
  obtained. We have excluded some extreme cases (such as the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Tunguska">Tunguska
    explosion of 1908 in Siberia</a>) and all cases involving a single observer, leaving six adequately documented and
  researched incidents with multiple witnesses. In cases no. 2 and 3 the primary witnesses are known to the author, who
  has interviewed them personally. In case no. 4 the author has visited the site. In other cases we rely on the data
  assembled by qualified investigators, all of whom are known to us <span class="note">The author is particularly indebted to Dr. Claude Poher, Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Dr. Illobrand
von Ludwiger and Mr. Jean-Jacques Velasco who made investigation reports available for this study.</span>.
