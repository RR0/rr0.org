          available, the present incident offers an abundance of information. Police and firefighters reached the scene
          within minutes of the event. One law officer described the molten mass "running, boiling down the edges of the
          levee" over an area of about four by six feet. The central portion remained warm to the touch for another two
          hours. There were eleven witnesses in all, eliminating the hoax hypothesis. Two of the witnesses had
          independently seen a hovering red object with lights blinking in sequence around the periphery. Inquiries made
          at Eppley Air Field and Offutt Air Force Base disclosed that no engine failure had taken place and there was
          no aircraft operation in the area.<sup><sup>12</sup></sup></p></td>

          ceiling, visibility 10 miles, temperature 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Wind was from the WNW at 16 mph, with gusts
          to 25 mph. The town is located on the southeastern shore of the Missouri river in Iowa, across from the city
          of Omaha (Figure 1.) The object hit the ground in the vicinity of "Gilberts Pond" in Big Lake Park, across the
          Missouri from Eppley airport. The exact street address is 1900 N. Eighth street. It fell at a point 16 feet
          from the paved road and 6 feet from the top of the levee, burning an area 4 feet wide by 9 feet long. There
          was a secondary burn area 27 feet away on the side of the dike, measuring about 2 by 4 feet. </p></td>
