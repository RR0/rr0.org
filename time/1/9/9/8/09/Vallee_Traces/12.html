          Two other witnesses, Mike Moore and his wife Criss, reported seeing a hovering red object with lights as they
          crossed 16th street on their way downtown along Broadway avenue. Criss reported "a big round thing hovering in
          the sky below the tree tops. It was hovering. It wasn't moving." She added that she saw red lights around the
          perimeter of the object, blinking in sequence. A middle-aged couple who saw the event spoke to the
          investigators by telephone, stating that they had seen "a bright red object rocket to the ground near Big
          Lake" but they refused to be identified. Four teenagers in a small foreign car spoke to the Drakes at the time
          of the incident but did not make a report. </p></td>

          call from Kenny Drake), police officer Dennis Murphy and Robert E. Allen, who had served in the Air Force and
          wrote a weekly astronomy column for a local newspaper. Mr. Moore stated that the center of the metal mass was
          too hot to touch when he arrived on the scene about 8 p.m., only 15 minutes after the initial incident, and
          that it remained so for about an hour.<sup><sup>14</sup></sup></p></td>

          maintaining metal in a molten state. Griffin Pipe is the only company which has the capability for producing a
          similar product. Mr. Linton Stewart, Works Manager there, stated that they "drop the bottoms" from their
          cupolas on Friday afternoon and do no pouring until Monday. The melting point is close to 2500 <sup>0</sup> F,
          which would require transporting in a brick oven of 6 inch thickness with a large truck, keeping the material
          at the melting point. Conclusion: negative. </p></td>
