          reported visual sighting was at an altitude of only 500 to 600 feet, where reentering debris would not be
          glowing and (4) the lack of structural indications is inconsistent with space debris. </p></td>

        <td><p> The samples described in the ten cases we have reviewed are summarized in Table 3. They belong, broadly
          speaking, in two major classes: samples resembling slag or industrial residue, and light silvery alloys, with
          one incident (case no. 2, Maury Island) involving both types of materials. Unfortunately, as we have seen, the
          analysis of the original samples in this particular case was never released by authorities, and we can only
          refer to sources of dubious reliability. In incidents involving slag-like material one primarily finds iron
          with traces of chromium, manganese and silicon, notably in Jopala and in Council Bluffs. </p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><p> In cases involving light silvery material we find references to magnesium (cases 1, 3 and 6) and
          aluminum (cases 1 and 8), with iron mentioned in trace amounts. Some of the details of the composition remain
          puzzling: We cannot account for the very high degree of purity of the Ubatuba magnesium sample, or for the
          absence of water and fluoride in the Bogota specimen. </p></td>

      <tr>
        <td><p> We have encountered no case of unknown elements and no case with advanced technology materials
          exhibiting an unusual structure. However the samples, as analyzed, appear to be consistent with the accounts
          given by witnesses, lending credibility to the reports in spite of their sometimes extraordinary details. </p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><p> In summary, the analysis supports the thesis that an unidentified phenomenon has been repeatedly
          observed in various parts of the world over a long period, that it manifests through a physical, material
          support, and that it is amenable to scientific study. On the other hand, the patterns observed in the
          composition of the samples at our disposal do not point to any clear hypothesis for the nature of the
          phenomenon. </p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><p> The fact that no exotic composition was found in these ten cases cannot be used to negate the theory
          that an advanced technology of unknown origin may have generated the samples. In the case of our own
          automobile industry, for example, environmentally compliant engines produce more mundane exhaust (such as pure
          water) than older models, where one could find complex combination of gases. </p></td>
