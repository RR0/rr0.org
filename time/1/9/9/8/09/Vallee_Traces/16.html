        <td><p> A different approach has been proposed by J. Roser in correspondence with the author. Noting the
          composition of the Bogota specimen as mentioned in our earlier publication16 he hypothesized a nuclear design
          for the object's power plant, utilizing direct energy conversion rather than a heat driven mechanical prime
          mover. "A closed cycle MHD generator using a liquid metal working fluid with no vapor staging pumping could be
          configured in a torus or circular shape and would make very little noise due to the lack of moving parts," he
          wrote, adding that the nuclear process known as beta decay might allow the design to extract a surplus of
          power in the form of free electrons. </p></td>

        <td><p> Assuming a working fluid of Aluminum 27 plus some percentage of Phosphorus 31 (solitary stable isotopes
          of their respective elements) Roser speculates that depleted fluid might need to be occasionally ejected:
          "This discarded material would contain Al.27, P.31, iron from original melt or housing erosion, plus isotopes
          of nuclei close to aluminum and phosphorus such as Mg, Na, Si and s' Accordingly he suggests isotopic analysis
          of the Bogota sample to determine if it reveals anomalous isotopes such as Si.32 (half-life 280 years) which
          would indicate a nuclear-based power source. </p></td>

          detailed enough for a comparative study to be undertaken. This research is hampered, however, by several
          problems of methodology where lack of money or analytical resources is only a secondary obstacle. The primary
          concerns have to do with inaccuracies in data gathering, lack of information about exact dates and times, lack
          of detailed, critical field investigation, and failure to provide an irrefutable chain of evidence in the
          collection, transportation and examination of the samples. </p></td>

        <td><p> In spite of these shortcomings (which could be addressed through the setting up of better standards and
          through collaborative agreements among investigators), this paper has shown that significant progress had been
          made toward the analysis of a number of relevant incidents. In one case at least (Council Bluffs), the
          conditions of witness availability and reliability, on-site testimony by law enforcement officers, chain of
          custody, and timely analysis were met. Other cases, such as Ubatuba and Bogota, are sufficiently intriguing to
          encourage investigators to expand their work in the field. </p></td>
