          tests were later run in laboratories in Sweden, Denmark and Germany. The general conclusion was that the
          object was composed of tungsten carbide and cobalt, consistent with manufactured products. According to von
          Ludwiger, "all industrial countries have companies which produce such hard metals, and the manufacturing
          technology is in principle the same ... The overall quality of the material was outstanding, but not unusual
          for the early 1950s." </p></td>

        <td><p> At 11:26 p.m. EST a collision reportedly took place near Maumee, involving a car driven by two men and
          an unidentified light. Both witnesses were young Navy veterans, one of them a radar specialist. In their
          report to police they stated they had unexpectedly encountered an intense source of light in the middle of the
          pavement while traveling West on Stitt road toward Whitehouse, Ohio. They could see no outline or structure in
          the object. The driver swerved to the left, skidding for about 70 feet and expecting a catastrophic collision.
          When they stopped, however, there was no trace of the object. The passenger confirmed the report, adding that
          the light appeared "bright as a welder's arc." </p></td>

          proceed to the Maumee Police Station and await the arrival of the State Highway Patrol. They revisited the
          scene with two patrolmen. The car itself was examined, as well as the surrounding area, the road and planted
          crops. No tangible evidence was reported, except for skid marks made by the vehicle and some damage to the car
          bumper and hood. Some time later the driver reported finding two metal samples he retrieved in the middle of
          the road and some "fibrous" metal found on the car. This fibrous sample turned out to contain 92% magnesium,
          according to Lorenzen and Condon.<sup><sup>9</sup></sup></p></td>
