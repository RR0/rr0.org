      <td><p> Two students at the University of Bogota were about to take a cab at 4 a.m. that night when they heard a
        metallic sound overhead. They reported seeing a disc, about 12 feet in diameter, swinging in the air as if it
        had difficulty maintaining its altitude of 3,000 to 3,500 feet -- obviously a very rough estimate since it is
        notoriously difficult to estimate the distance and size of luminous objects at night. Four other objects
        appeared, flying around the first one as if to provide assistance. Spouts of liquid were then ejected from the
        primary object. The witnesses took shelter under a tree and watched the liquid fall on the pavement, producing a
        vapor. The objects rose and disappeared into heavy rain clouds. After letting the material cool down for about
        ten minutes the witnesses were able to recover two metal chunks, about four inches by one inch and a quarter
        inch thick. The first analysis was performed in Central America by a mechanical engineer with a petroleum
        company. He concluded that the sample was an aluminum alloy with magnesium and tin. It was nonmagnetic and
        contained traces of unidentified materials. He also stated that the material was easy to cut and presented very
        fine granulation. In October 1985 the author was given a sample of this material by Mr. Ricardo Vilchez, a Latin
        American investigator, and brought it to the United States for analysis. Subsequent study led by Dr. Harold
        Puthoff and ourselves showed it to be formed mainly of aluminum (93.7%) with phosphorus (4.8%) and iron (0.9%)
        with traces of sulfur and an unexplained oxy-carbide layer.<sup><sup>11</sup></sup> The sample included no
        fluoride and no water, contrary to most aluminum samples: fluoride is a common by-product of aluminum
        production. One side of the specimen showed evidence of violent activity and bubbling, while the other side was
        flat, with some embedded material, possibly from the road asphalt. Its appearance was typical of an overheat and
        was indeed consistent with the blowup of a machine, although the hoax hypothesis could not be totally excluded.

      <td><p> The sample was subjected to analysis with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) which produces an X-ray
        fluorescence spectrum, leading to the above composition findings. It was further analyzed with a scanning ion
        mass spectroscope (SIMS) which uses an electron beam in a vacuum, boring at various points into the material.
        This test found a surface layer of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, beyond which we encountered aluminum as well as
        magnesium (as reported by the initial analysis in Central America), with potassium, sulfur, sodium and silicon.
        Phosphorus and iron also showed up in trace amounts. </p></td>
