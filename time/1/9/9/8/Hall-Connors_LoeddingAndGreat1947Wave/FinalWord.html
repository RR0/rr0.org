<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<p> There are a number of other very interesting sightings that shed more light on the aftermath of the great UFO wave
  of 1947 and Alfred Loedding's influence on Project Sign. Two very intriguing reports from July 29th and 31st 1948 seem
  to support Loedding's dramatic findings expressed in the Estimate draft. They come from Indianapolis, Indiana, and
  remain listed unidentified in Air Force files. The first sighting took place at 9:55 A.M. CST on the 29th when James
  Toney and Robert Huggins were driving near the wooded area of Fall Creek. Just after crossing the creek via a
  cantilever bridge, they neared the intersection of East 56th Street and Fall Creek Boulevard. At that point Toney and
  Huggins observed a strange looking flying machine pass about 200 feet from them. It appeared to be of shiny aluminum
  construction moving at a slow speed of not more than 30 miles per hour as it flew about 30 feet above the tree tops.
  The craft did not resemble anything the men had ever seen in the skies before, looking like a "broad short propeller"
  or boomerang with "cups" on its upper sides. The object had a three to one ratio, approximately six to eight feet long
  by about two feet high. The strange machine made no noise as it then passed out of sight over the tree line.</p>
<p>Sign extensively investigated the case with the initial field work being supervised by Colonel James A. Ronin,
  commander of the 331st AFB reserve training unit at Stout Field near Indianapolis. They quickly determined it could
  not have been a glider or aircraft. TID officers even wrote to the General Electric Company in Schenectady, New York,
  in the belief it might have been the result of their roto-chute experimental vehicle, but found that it had never
  flown in that area of the country.</p>
<p>When a very similar sighting took place in the city two days later, intelligence officers became even more
  interested. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Vernon Swigert in the south central part of town witnessed this second event. The object
  they saw flew over at 8:25 A.M.. on the 31st. It appeared white and had the same general three to one proportional
  shape as in the earlier sighting. Yet that object looked much more like the traditional flying saucer. This unknown
  craft resembled a "cymbal," and moved silently by at very great speed. The two observers felt it may have traveled as
  fast as 1,800 miles per hour at a height of 2,000 feet. At no time did it deviate from a level flight path and left no
  exhaust trail <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 3, Cases 185 and 190, listed as  Incidents 151 and 152 in 1948 era documents</span>.
</p>
<p>Because no other aircraft or balloons of any sort could be found to explain the Indianapolis Sightings, they were
  both marked unidentified <span class="source">Ibid</span>. Already self-conscious about having no proof to back up
  their Estimate conclusions, Sign officials like Loedding went to great lengths to continue to run a very tight and
  professional investigation throughout the rest of the year. Unidentified listings were therefore still sparingly
  given.</p>
<p>By August UFO incidents in the US, like those from Indianapolis, seemed to have peaked for the year just as rumors of
  disc sightings started to filter out of Eastern Block countries and the far reaches of Asia. Most were strikingly
  similar to the disc reports in North America during 1947. Many of these, in fact, came from areas of the globe where
  the term "flying saucer" had never been heard <span class="source">Vallee, Anatomy of a Phenomenon: Unidentified Objects in Space?A  Scientific Appraisal (Chicago: Henry Regnery Company, 1965), p. 54</span>.
</p>
<p>Few of those foreign reports were evaluated by Sign, but an interesting sighting from August 3, 1948, reached AMC's
  TID from, of all places, Moscow. This fact is significant because although a rash of UFO incidents occurred over
  Russia that year, it was also the high point of the Berlin Airlift. Tensions between East and West were so strong that
  many expected a third world war might soon break out. Reports on UFO activity behind the Iron Curtain were therefore
  few and far between?accounts of which are only now becoming known.</p>
<p>Thus somewhat of a curiosity among early intelligence personnel, primarily for its Cold War era location, this case
  is known as the Moscow Report. The file did not really represent an especially good account, being compiled only from
  the recollection of an undisclosed American newspaper reporter. His sighting took place about twenty miles northwest
  of the city at sunset when he and a Russian friend viewed a long narrow cigar-shaped object proceeding at a high but
  not excessive speed toward the northeast. No wings or stabilizers were visible likening it to an aircraft or rocket,
  although the sunlight reflecting off its surface did suggest that the craft had a metal skin. The reporter and his
  acquaintance both watched the spectacle as it passed by without making a sound. They agreed that the object looked
  like a rigid airship, so familiar to anyone who had lived through the great age of the large dirigibles in the 1920s
  and 1930s. Yet both also said it moved far too fast for a lighter-than-air craft. Neither had any idea what the
  strange object could have been, "it might have been anything the reporter himself concludes" <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 3, Case 195, listed as Incident  171  in 1948 era documents</span>.
  Because the Air Force had no way to investigate such a sighting, this is the type of report often filed under the
  handy category: "insufficient data."</p>
<p>Another type of classification used in the Air Force files reads "unreliable." Unreliable became the conclusion of
  case number 198 because its witnesses were children. Case 198 is however a notable mystery in the Sign files. Not only
  is it one of very few reports describing a UFO landing, but also the size of the file seems unwarranted when taking
  into account that the unreliable designation was given early on in the investigation. Experience will tell any
  researcher that when so many pages are found on an Air Force UFO case, strong attention was given to it by
  someone.</p>
<p>The incident involves two children ages ten and eight. They were playing in their backyard on a Hamel, Minnesota,
  farm on August 11, 1948, when they had their attention drawn skyward. Above them in the noontime sky the children
  noticed a dull gray metallic craft descending downward. Each of them described it as two inverted plates stuck
  together which, in their words, then gently touched down with a "clanking noise." It soon started making a whistling
  noise and rose up to twenty feet, stopped and hovered, and then maneuvered over the tree tops and telephone lines
  before flying off.</p>
<p>The first investigator on the scene was from the AMC and his immediate conclusion stated: "This apparent bit of
  fantasy is hardly worth further consideration" <span class="source">Ibid., Case 198, listed as Incident 162 in 1948 era documents</span>.
  Such a designation, especially after funds were expended for travel out of Dayton, always killed further investigation
  then and there. But despite that early conclusion, a large amount of attention was soon displayed on the case as
  evidenced from the correspondence. Soil samples were collected and photos taken documenting the landing sight.
  Numerous government agencies including the FBI then requested access to the samples. Usually only lieutenants and
  maybe a captain are involved in such an investigation, but correspondence in the files shows a Lieutenant Colonel
  Allison initiating a "resurvey" of the landing sight. This would seem to indicate that at some point the initial
  investigation was overruled and a more detailed study ordered. Who decided such a sighting with only children as
  observers warranted so much attention? Why did the FBI end up analyzing the soil samples and not Wright-Patterson
  labs? Why does the FBI correspondence show J. Edgar Hoover personally involved in the administration of the soil
  analysis? <span class="note">The findings of the soil sample analysis showed no indication of an  anomalous event at the site nor the presence of a metallic object  having touched the pebbles in the soil</span>
  Case 198 has plenty of questions to go around.</p>
<p>A sighting from September 23rd that year from San Pablo, California, stumped Air Force investigators sufficiently to
  label the case "unidentified." It involved two highly respected witnesses, Sylvester Bentham and retired US Army
  Colonel Horace Eakins, who spotted a very odd-looking flying object around noon. Initially it attracted their
  attention not because of its amoeba-like shape, but speed?described once again as faster than that of any known
  aircraft. For over three minutes the attentive observers watched it traverse due east in a straight line at a constant
  speed. They estimated that the object had to have been at least a mile above a low flying bomber then in view. The
  men, in fact, could not agree on the exact shape or dimension because it was so high. They did note that unlike the
  early jets of the time, it made no noise and left no exhaust. The Air Force ruled out an astronomical cause. They
  could only find a west-bound United Airlines plane as a possible solution yet felt this was highly unlikely because it
  would have been moving in the opposite direction <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 3, Case 208, listed as Incident  176  in 1948 era documents</span>.
</p>
<p>A much more well-known case became the third of the UFO Classics when North Dakota Air National Guard F-51 pilot
  George F. German had a very strange encounter while he attempted a nighttime landing into the Fargo airport at 9:00
  P.M. CST, October 1, 1948. German had just completed a crosscountry flight when on final approach his fighter passed
  within 1,000 yards of a sharply outlined orb. Described as a "blinking light" just inches in diameter and making
  "remarkable revolutions," the experienced flyer had no idea what to make of it. German pursued the light repeatedly in
  order to identify, but after 27 minutes the object climbed out of sight.</p>
<p>Because of a hair-raising series of intricate maneuvers made during that intercept, this case has often been referred
  to as the German Dogfight. It's an apt title because during each of his persistent passes toward the light, the object
  rushed straight at the F-51. And each time German tried to turn around and pursue, he found it necessary to make an
  extensive series of turns, only to end up repeating the same scenario all over again. During the ordeal the light
  appeared to travel in excess of his own speed which ranged from 300 to 400 miles per hour yet produced no exhaust
  trail nor sound <span class="source">Ibid., Case 284, listed as Incident 172 in 1948 era  documents</span>. </p>
<p>Four other observers, including two pilots in a Piper Cub flying just below him, corroborated Gorman's story. The
  chief of the control tower also followed the event with binoculars. In fact, it was because the extraordinary
  encounter had so many good witnesses that the Air Force followed up with an extensive investigation. Sign/TID
  investigators Lawrence Truettner and Major Paul Lmbela flew to Fargo and headed up the case. Eyewitness accounts were
  checked and rechecked, and the plane itself was thoroughly gone over. Surprisingly, the aircraft's metal skin revealed
  radioactive exposure. To make sure, four separate Geigers were used to confirm the readings.</p>
<p> It did sound like an exceptional incident at the time, but the facts soon pointed to some rather obvious solutions.
  The evidence suggested that the mysterious nocturnal orb might have merely been a small lighted weather balloon.
  Following other such incidents over the Caribbean, Intelligence found that when an aircraft approaches a lighted
  balloon at night, even an experienced pilot can have his perspective distorted. The balloon, in other words, appears
  to rush toward the plane when actually it is the plane rushing toward the balloon. Because the balloon is moving so
  slowly, it is the aircraft that then makes the evasive action. When the aircraft attempts another pass, it has to make
  a complete 180 degree turn only to find itself rushing once again by the balloon so fast that the pilot can not
  identify it. Another lesson bestowed on general aviation from this would-be UFO case concerned the mysterious
  radiation. After further study, TID investigators discovered that any aircraft flying at high altitudes in the thin
  upper atmosphere is prone to absorb cosmic radioactivity <span class="source">Ruppelt, Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, pp. 31-39</span>.
</p>
<p>This incident is now a standard in UFO lore. This is puzzling because correspondence of the time shows Alfred
  Loedding, the most open minded to an extraterrestrial hypothesis, writing a memo expressing caution in regard to over
  emphasizing the Gorman incident. Such insights were not, however, made public and over the years much speculation has
  circulated in regard to this sighting.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate because debunkers often seize on these sensationalized stories. When discussing the early history
  of UFO phenomena, they almost exclusively focus on classics like the Gorman Dogfight or the Mantel Incident. That's
  natural because those are the easy ones to explain. Most debunkers never even bother to research, let alone discuss,
  the other sightings of the time. As a result, people are lead to believe that all of the early cases have equally
  reasonable conclusions.</p>
<p>When putting the event into historical perspective one understands this mind set. It must be remembered that even by
  this date the Air Force had not yet released any kind of official report on UFOs and as a whole still hesitated to
  take a position. Most of their investigations, even of such publicized incidents, were stamped "RESTRICTED" or
  "SECRET" and could not be disseminated to the general public until declassified. When the Blue Book Files were finally
  made public in 1976, few people bothered to research other cases from these early years?being so infatuated with the
  legends like the Gorman incident.</p>
<p>While the Gorman Case has been discussed in almost every book published on UFOs, a much better sighting twelve days
  later has never been dealt with. It took place in South Bend, Indiana, on a clear and cloudless day at 11:45 A.M. CST
  when two office workers standing at a window of the Studebaker Corporation observed a silvery flat disc-shaped object
  speed silently through the sky at around 1,500 feet. The UFO appeared just a little smaller than a DC-3, although it
  moved about three times as fast.</p>
<p>Both witnesses were uncertain if the craft was spinning. They used the description "flashing" because the sun's rays
  reflected from it just as brightly as it would a chrome surface, thus at least giving the appearance of a rotating
  machine. During the brief eight to ten second sighting, the object came from the northwest on a straight southeasterly
  heading. It flew with no visible means of propulsion, wings or rudders. Neither observer had any idea of what they
  saw, but felt certain it could not have been a balloon or aircraft. Both office workers held important positions in
  the company's engineering department and were described by Studebaker management as being of "a high type of caliber,"
  and highly reliable <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 3, Case 216, listed as Incident  180 in 1948 era documents</span>.
</p>
<p>It is the mass of this and many other obscure cases rather than just the three famous Classics that led Sign to its
  developing belief in extraterrestrial visitation. Loedding, Sneider, Truettner, and even Deyarmond had to have been
  impressed by the repeated similarities of reported details among these many cases?especially when most of them were
  not known to the general public <span class="source">Albert B. Deyarmond's personal papers, courtesy Project Sign  Research Center</span>.
</p>
<p>The single best sighting of 1948 and perhaps the best case then to date is also overlooked, or perhaps overshadowed,
  by the so-called Classics. It was the first truly notable incident in which radar data combined with trained visual
  observation to produce a stunning UFO case. The initial report came into TID from Japan and involved a twin engine
  F-61 Black Widow night fighter from the 68th Fighter Squadron. While on patrol the night of October 15, 1948, its crew
  had a very curious encounter at 11:05 P.M. local time.</p>
<p>The incident occurred over the Fukuoka area between the islands of Shigamo Shima and Fusae Shima on a clear and
  moonlit night when the F-61's radar detected an unknown object five miles away and below them at 2,305 feet. At the
  time of detection, radar clocked the UFO at a speed of 200 miles per hour. Curious as to what could be flying over a
  then occupied Japan, the pilot increased his speed to 220 miles per hour, deciding to close in for a visual
  confirmation. He guessed it would probably turn out to be an F-51 Mustang fighter from another squadron but decided
  they could use the practice anyhow. He nosed down and approached within 12,000 feet of the would-be fighter but the
  unknown target then surprised him. It suddenly dived down under his F-61 in a "split s' maneuver, making a 180 degree
  turn and increasing its speed to over 1,200 miles per hour (almost three times their own speed). The UFO's burst of
  power appeared only temporary because the object soon slowed to its original velocity. By that point, however, both
  the pilot and his radar operator knew that their target could not possibly be an F-51, but they decided to try to find
  out just what it was that they were chasing.</p>
<p>Attempting another intercept, the pilot again closed to a relatively close distance merely to have the UFO go down
  and off at tremendous speed, slowing only after putting about nine miles distance from their aircraft. Four more times
  the same scenario took place as if the strange machine was playing a game with them. Ground radar could not confirm
  the presence of the UFO, although it tracked the F-61. Operators did say that because the incident occurred at such a
  relatively low altitude, ground clutter interfered with surface-to-air tracking.</p>
<p>Similar UFO intercepts would follow, yet this case stands out because the crew twice gained visual confirmation, thus
  excluding any possibility of a radar malfunction. The aircraft's radar operator, 2nd Lieutenant Barton Halter, had 300
  hours logged in his position and became convinced they had encountered some new type of experimental aircraft. The
  pilot, 1st Lieutenant Oliver Hemphill, had 900 hours flying time with 350 of those in combat in a B-17 over Europe. He
  stated that the UFO behaved much like the ME-163 German rocket planes did when attacking our bomber formations. But
  Hemphill stressed it did not look like a ME-163 nor any aircraft he had ever seen.</p>
<p>In the Sign files there are pages and pages of reports and even a drawing of the object as seen by the pilot. The
  general description likened it to a "rifle bullet," about 20 to 30 feet long with no discernible exhaust trail,
  flames, power plant, wings, stabilizers, fins, or crew canopy. Yet the UFO must have been real because Hemphill noted
  at one point that its silhouette was projected on the clouds by the full moon. In the investigation that followed, it
  was firmly established that there were no other aircraft then in the area. Intelligence officers also learned that the
  weather conditions were good with five to six miles visibility, but that even with the moon there would not have been
  enough light for visual sightings at any great distance.</p>
<p> Everyone at TID very much wanted to know what the F-61 crew saw that night in the dark skies over Japan, but no
  clues could be found. The case went down as the first unidentified in a special category called "radar-visual" <span
      class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 3, Case 218, listed as Incident  183 in 1948 era documents</span>.
  A few Intelligence personnel, however, felt the October 15th incident over Japan could have represented an attempted
  intercept of a Soviet spy plane. It has only recently been discovered that Britain would soon fly nighttime
  reconnaissance missions over Russia, and America had overflights of Siberia as early as 1946 by way of the North Pole.
  The USAF also made incursions into the eastern borders of the USSR throughout 1949. By 1956 the CIA would direct
  hundreds of deep penetration missions into Soviet territory with the famous U-2 spy plane. Some thought all along that
  the flying saucer reports were attributable to the Soviets conducting the same type of surveillance that we were doing
  to them, but only a few Project Sign cases seem to substantiate the claim. Following is a good example of a report
  from November 4, 1948, that obviously represents a foreign spy plane:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>Unidentified aircraft observed at 1043 14 Nov [sic] 1948 over Army Observation Post #1 at 37O 57'N-125O 31'E, in
    South Korea, flying east to west at an altitude of 5000 feet. The same aircraft was sighted by army observation post
    #2 37O 51' N-125O 17' E, 4, 37O 57' N-125O 26' E and 5, 37O 56' N-125O 29'. Subject aircraft circled observation
    post number 2, then headed north. Aircraft was twin engine bomber type, and is believed definitely to have been
    Soviet </q><span class="source">Ibid., Case 238, listed as Incident 209 in 1948 era documents.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p> A second good radar-visual report followed the October 15th case. This time it occurred on the other side of the
  world in Germany and involved an experienced F-80 jet pilot of the 23rd Fighter Squadron stationed at the
  Furstenfeldbruck AFB. While out walking on the night of November 23rd, the Air Force captain observed from his base a
  reddish starlike object as it was simultaneously detected by ground radar. The crew in the radar station judged it to
  be at 27,000 feet traveling between 200-500 miles per hour. It then climbed to 40,000 feet and circled 40 miles south
  of Munich <span class="source">Ibid., Case 249, listed as Incident 222 in 1948 era documents</span>.</p>
<p>Those are the basic facts present today in the Sign files, but when Edward Ruppelt described this incident in his
  1956 book, he stated that radar had tracked the object at speeds up to 900 miles per hour and that they detected it
  climbing 23,000 feet in a matter of seconds! Those figures are not in the documents released by the National Archives
  in 1976. Though anyone who has read Ruppelt and has checked his facts with other files, knows that he was a stickler
  for details. This could not have been a simple mistake. What reports did he see that are no longer detailed in the
  declassified files?<span class="source"> Ruppelt, Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, p. 46</span> If his facts are
  correct, it is a stunning admission because no man-made aircraft in 1948 could match that performance.</p>
<p>Another mysterious nocturnal phenomenon known as Green Fireballs appeared in the New Mexico night skies during that
  November and December?seen by hundreds of witnesses up through 1949. After investigations by Project Sign and noted
  scientists like Dr. Edward Teller and meteorite expert Dr. Lincoln La Paz, (who himself had observed these lights) no
  conclusions were reached. La Paz, who had a UFO sighting in 1947, became convinced they were not identifiable as a
  known astronomical activity <span class="note">See Chapter 5, pp. 88-89</span>. </p>
<p>The more La Paz studied the phenomenon the more he could be certain that they were not meteors. Unlike meteors, the
  fireballs flew nearly horizontal at about 40,000 to 60,000 feet. And whereas almost all meteor impacts can be
  discovered from projecting their observed trajectory, no green fireball could ever be found to have hit the earth.</p>
<p>La Paz even concluded that the green fireballs were surely artificial objects and perhaps represented
  radio-controlled missiles. If true, they were not of domestic origin because the United States military didn't have a
  clue when the fireballs began to fly over the super-secret Sandia lab at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico where America's
  atomic weapons were being built. Then the Hanford nuclear facility in Washington State had a sighting as well as the
  Los Alamos, New Mexico, nuclear research laboratory. Since these were the three most vital facilities to nuclear
  weapons production in the country, their administrators became frantic for answers and the Air Force was the
  organization expected to provide them <span class="source">Clark, The Emergence of a Phenomenon, pp. 184-185</span>.
</p>
<p>The USAF subsequently created a special study called Project Twinkle to investigate this new spin on the UFO
  phenomenon. It finally became a research project under the Geophysics Research Division of the Air Force and ! the
  Cambridge Research Laboratory in February of 1950, more than a year after the largest number of sightings had taken
  place. Dr. Louis Elterman served as a central figure in the project. He contracted with the Land Air Co. to provide
  technical personnel during a scheduled period from April 1 to October 1, 1950, and from October 1, 1950, to March 31,
  1951. But with the start of war in Korea on June 25, 1950, the project wound down. In the summer of 1951 Major Edward
  A. Doty took control, and by December Twinkle had closed down <span class="source">Bruce S. Maccabee, "Still In Default," In Walter H. Andrus, Jr.,  and  Richard H. Hall, eds., MUFON 1986 International UFO Symposium  Proceedings, 143, Seguin, TX: Mutual UFO Network, Inc.; and Clark, p.  190</span>.
</p>
<p>Ruppelt claims that Twinkle was administratively formed earlier, in the late summer of 1949, when the green fireballs
  were still frequently being reported <span
      class="source">"Ruppelt, Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, p. 51</span>. Twinkle then decided its best chance
  to document the phenomena would be through the use of three special cinetheodolite (Askania) cameras. A cinetheodolite
  was basically a theodolite range finder with a movie camera attached. The trick with such a device is to get at least
  two or more cinetheodolites triangulated on the same object in order to determine altitude, speed and size. The Air
  Force, of course, with typical military bureaucracy initially allocated only one cinetheodolite to Twinkle and
  frequently moved it so often to where sightings had already just occurred that no one area was consistently scanned.
</p>
<p>Dr. Elterman's final report on Twinkle in November 1951 stated in scientific terms what Ruppelt had said about the
  study: "Project Twinkle was a bust" <span class="source">Ibid., pp. 47-52</span>. No triangulation was ever achieved,
  although on April 27, 1950, four objects 30 feet in diameter were recorded by a Twinkle team at 150,000 feet over
  Holloman AFB traveling at high speed <span class="source">Maccabee, "Still In Default," p. 45</span>.</p>
<p>The real question, however, is why did Project Sign not come into the investigation of the new UFO phenomena in a
  more meaningful way. In fact, some of the most spectacular reports of that or any other year would occur in the very
  last quarter of 1948. Yet right in the middle of this unsettling rash of events, Sign found itself increasingly
  ignored and underutilized by the Pentagon. Green fireballs were actually but a small offshoot of this new and larger
  phenomena which involved varying types of nocturnal lights appearing over a whole host of military installations. Not
  all of the cases seem to be in the files, but it is apparent from the available records that a great deal of concern
  arose with no guesses as to what could be causing the events. </p>
<p>A typical sighting not unlike the November 23rd incident in West Germany, took place December 3rd at 8:15 P.M. PST on
  a clear night at the Fairfield-Suisun AFB, in California. As in the case from Germany, a bright light came into view
  at about 20,000 feet, although this report differed dramatically in that the object had first made a low level pass
  over the airfield at only 500 feet! Control tower operators described it as a round white light that silently passed
  between the tower and the airfreight terminal at a speed in excess of 400 miles per hour. Close views through 8-power
  binoculars revealed no definite form, just a bright light one to two feet in diameter and moving with an undulating or
  bouncing motion. Then all of a sudden observers witnessed it vertically rise to 3,000 feet and level off?soon
  thereafter reaching an altitude of 20,000 feet and heading south-southeast. Seen from another nearby control tower,
  all of the various witnesses were certain that the strange object behaved like no aircraft, balloon, or any type of
  navigation lights <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 3, Case 257, listed as Incident  215 in 1948 era documents.</span>
</p>
<p>Sign did thoroughly investigate this case but uncovered no clues to the mystery. Few times before had highly trained
  observers been at such a loss to identify an aerial object. While little could be done other than take statements, the
  records of the time do convey a sense of desperation. The Pentagon wanted to know what could so effortlessly violate
  the airspace of a US military installation, but Sign could no longer suggest what they had formally concluded.</p>
<p> As a result, team members became increasingly frustrated?Loedding in particular. The top brass wanted answers, yet
  would not accept nor even care to listen to what some of the best in Air Force Intelligence were trying to tell them.
  An interesting letter found in a recent release of Sign documents does dramatize how seriously the UFO situation was
  then taken despite official denials. In short, it signified a UFO alert by the Pentagon:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>This Headquarters has instructed all major Air Commands, both in the ZI and Overseas, to be particularly alerted
    at this time for sightings of unidentified aerial objects and to generally comply with the requests contained in
    subject TWX.</q></p>
  <p><q>This Headquarters has also requested the cooperation of the Departments of the Army and the Navy, and the Coast
    Guard, in instructing their installations along the same lines </q><span class="source">FOIA request I-NAIC-97-053, Project Sign and Grudge documents  1948-1949, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio</span>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Recently there have been some documents come to light that shed a little more light on the late 1948 time period,
  but they also raise new questions as well. These involve numerous Project Sign and Grudge records released from the
  Wright-Patterson Air Intelligence Agency via the National Records Center in St. Louis, Missouri. For years researchers
  questioned the presence of such files but were always pacified with the statement that these former intelligence
  records were destroyed in an accidental fire in the St. Louis depository in 1973. Due however to the unending pursuit
  of truth by legitimate investigators, the lost files finally surfaced. While many of these include duplicate
  information present in the National Archives' Blue Book collection, new information is revealed. A few of the "missing
  cases," for example, are finally detailed. The incidents are very amazing but hold no new secrets to the UFO
  phenomenon. Therefore, we now know that some of the "missing cases" were in large part just that?missing?or
  misplaced.</p>
<p>Yet the most amazing discoveries are of cases that were never even listed in the vast Air Force index of sightings.
  Some of the incidents are rather startling for the extremely impressive character of the witnesses involved and the
  nature of their sightings. In addition, correspondence has also come to light which sheds more light on administrative
  matters. Combined with other microfilm rolls of Sign and Grudge files held in private hands, (which duplicate some but
  not all of the National Archives' Blue Book records) much cross-checking needs to be done to fill in the gaps in the
  historical record. Years of work are ahead for researchers.</p>
<p>Two of the most startling documents discovered in the Sign and Grudge papers are detailed here. We begin with a
  letter written by Air Force Intelligence Chief Major General Cabell to the AMC. Cabell states quite plainly in that
  correspondence that the reported incidents of UFO activity are clearly of a real and concerning nature. He then
  inquires about Project Sign's views on the matter. This is somewhat puzzling considering Cabell must assuredly have
  been privy to the July Estimate draft. Yet five days later Colonel McCoy then responds with an even more
  straightforward answer. He states a percentage of the phenomenon are admittedly unexplainable and must represent craft
  of "foreign origin." Foreign origin in this case is again used to imply extraterrestrial visitation, although the
  possibility of Soviet activity is still not ruled out. Thus even by 1948 many intelligence officers were forced to
  either reevaluate a Soviet connection or accept a non-earthly theory. Today, following the fall of the Soviet Union,
  this revelation is even more startling as we now know none of those UFO sightings represented Soviet activity. And
  certainly no other national power had such technology then or now. Attitudes on how to handle the press are also
  discussed in the passages. The following letters are therefore quoted in full to demonstrate a rare look at how Air
  Force officials were actually thinking in the late days of Sign. Such detailed correspondence is very rare in military
  records:<br> <br>

<div>Department of the Air Force<br> Headquarters, United States Air Force<br> Washington<br> 3 Nov 48<br> Subject:
  Flying Object Incidents in the United States<br> To: Commanding General, Air Materiel Command<br> Wright-Patterson Air
  Force Base<br> Dayton, Ohio<br> <br> 1. By letter dated 30 December 1947 from the Director of Research and
  Development, Headquarters USAF, your headquarters was required to establish Project "Sign". <br> <br> 2. The
  conclusion appears inescapable that some type of flying object has been observed. Identification and the origin of
  these objects is not discernible to this headquarters. It is imperative, therefore, that efforts to determine whether
  these objects are of domestic or foreign origin must be increased until conclusive evidence is obtained. The needs of
  national defense require such evidence in order that appropriate countermeasures may be taken.<br> <br> 3. In addition
  to the imperative need for evidence to permit countermeasures, is the necessity of informing the public as to the
  status of the problem. To date there has been too little data to present to the public. The press, however, is about
  to take it into its own
</div>
<br>
<div>hands and demand to be told what we do or do not know about the situation. Silence on our part will not long be
  acceptable.<br> <br> 4. Request immediate information as to your conclusions to date and your recommendations as to
  the information to be given to the press. Your recommendation is requested also as to whether that information should
  be offered to the press or withheld until it is actively sought by the press.<br> <br> BY COMMAND OF THE CHIEF OF
  STAFF:<br> [Unsigned]<br> C.P.Cabell <br> Major General, USAF<br> Director of Intelligence, Office of<br> Deputy Chief

<div>Basic 1tr fr Hq USAF, 3 Nov 48 to CG, AMC, "Flying Object Incidents in the United States"<br> 1st INd MCIAT/ABD/amb<br>
  Hq AMC, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio. 8 Nov 48<br> To: Chief of Staff, United States Air Force,
  Washington 25, D.C., ATTN: AFOIR<br> <br> 1. In attempting to arrive at conclusions as to the nature of unidentified
  flying object incidents in the United States, this Command has made a study of approximately 180 such incidents. Data
  derived from initial reports have been supplemented by further information obtained from checklists submitted by mail,
  from interrogations of other field agencies, and by personal investigation by personnel of this Command in the case of
  incidents that seem to indicate the possibility of obtaining particularly significant information.<br> <br> 2. The
  objects described fall into the following general classifications groups, according to shape or physical
  configuration:<br> a. Flat disc of circular or approximately circular shape.<br> b. Torpedo or cigar shaped aircraft,
  with no wings or fins visible in flight.<br> c. Spherical or balloon shaped objects.<br> d. Balls of light with no
  apparent form attached.<br> <br>
</div>
<div>3. Some of the objects sighted have definitely been identified, upon further investigation, as weather or upper air
  scientific balloons of some type. A great many of the round or balloon shaped objects indicated in paragraph 2c above
  are probably of the same nature, although in most cases, definite confirmation of that fact has been impossible to
  obtain.<br> <br> 4. Some of the objects have been identified as being astro-physical in nature. For example, in
  daylight sightings, the planet Venus has been reported as a round silvery object at extremely high altitude. Action is
  being taken to obtain the services of a prominent astro-physicist as a consultant, to study all of the incidents to
  determine whether some can be identified as meteors, planets or other manifestations of astral bodies.<br> <br> 5.
  Arrangements for accomplishing a study of the psychological problems involved in this project are being made in
  coordination with the Aero-Medical Laboratory at this Headquarters. The possibility that some of the sightings are
  hallucinations, optical illusions or even deliberate hoaxes has been considered. <br> <br> 6. Although explanation of
  many of the incidents can be obtained from the investigations described above, there remains a certain number of
  reports for which no reasonable everyday explanation is available. So far, no physical evidence of the existence of
  the unidentified sightings has been obtained. Prominent scientists, including Dr. <a
      href="/people/l/LangmuirIrving/index.html">Irving Langmuir</a> of the General Electric Company, have been
  interviewed to determine whether they could advance any reasonable explanations for characteristics exhibited by the
  objects sighted. In an early interview, Dr. <a href="/people/l/LangmuirIrving/index.html">Langmuir</a> indicated that
  these incidents could be explained, but insufficient data were available at that time on which to base definite
  conclusions. It is planned to have another interview with Dr. <a
      href="/people/l/LangmuirIrving/index.html">Langmuir</a> in the near future to review all the data now available,
  and it is hoped that he will be able to present some opinion as to the nature of many of the unidentified objects,
  particularly those described as "balls of lights." <br> <br> 7. All information that has been made available to this
  headquarters indicates that the discs, the cigar shaped objects, and the "balls of light" are not of domestic origin.
  Engineering investigation indicates that disc or wingless aircraft could support themselves in flight by aerodynamic
  means. It is probable that the problems of stability and control could also be solved for such aircraft. However,
  according to current aerodynamic theory in this country, aircraft with such configurations would have relatively poor
  climb, altitude and range characteristics with power plant now in use.<br> <br> 8. The possibility that the reported
  objects are vehicles from another planet has not been ignored. However, tangible evidence to support conclusions about
  such a possibility are completely lacking.<br>
</div>
<div>The occurrence of incidents in relation to the approach to the earth of the planets Mercury, Venus and Mars have
  been plotted. A periodic variation in the frequency of incidents, which appears to have some relation to the planet
  approach curves, is noted, but it may be purely a coincidence.<br> <br> 9. Reference is made to "The Books of Charles
  Fort" with an introduction by Tiffany Thayer, published 1941, by Henry Holt &amp; Co., New York, N.Y. It appears that
  similar phenomena have been noted and reported for the past century or more.<br> <br> 10. In view of the above, the
  following conclusions are drawn:<br> a. In the majority of cases reported, observers have actually sighted some type
  of flying object which they cannot classify as an aircraft within the limits of their personal experience.<br> b.
  There is as yet no conclusive proof that unidentified flying objects, other than those which are known to be balloons,
  are real aircraft.<br> c. Although it is obvious that some types of flying objects have been sighted, the exact nature
  of those objects cannot be established until physical evidence, such as that which would result from a crash, has been
  obtained.<br> <br> 11. It is not considered advisable to present to the press information on those objects which we
  cannot yet identify or about which we cannot present any reasonable conclusions. In the event that they insist on some
  kind of a statement, it is suggested that they be informed that many of the objects sighted have been identified as
  weather balloons or astral bodies, and that investigation is being .&bdquo;, pursued to determine reasonable
  explanations for the others.<br> <br> 12. A report, summarizing the results obtained from analysis of the data and a
  technical investigation of the engineering aspects of the objects described, is nearly complete, and a copy will be
  forwarded to your headquarters in the near future.<br> <br> FOR THE COMMANDING GENERAL:<br> [Signed H.M. McCoy]<br>
  H.M.McCoy<br> Colonel,USAF<br> Chief, Intelligence Department
</div>
<p> New discoveries continue to be made but we are still no closer to learning why Sign came to such a dramatic end. Why
  Alfred Loedding, one of the Air Force's most brilliant minds, was purged from UFO investigations by 1949 and from
  Wright-Patterson entirely by 1951. Important mysteries are still to be discovered.</p>
