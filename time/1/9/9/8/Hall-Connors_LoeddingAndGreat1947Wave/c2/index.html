<p> The following accounts are the first reliable UFO sightings for <time>1947</time> <span class="source">Edward J. Ruppelt's personal papers do vaguely detail two fighter  intercepts on a "violently maneuvering" UFO near England on January  16-17, 1947; and an undated post-war account of "disc-shaped aircraft"  near Habberbishopshiem, Germany. (Ruppelt's private papers, File R104,  courtesy of Professor Michael Swords)</span>.
  It is unknown exactly when Loedding became privy to the reports. Undoubtedly they were brought to his attention by the
  second week in July—being widely talked about in military circles by that point. Loedding and others in Intelligence
  at Wright Field saw it as proof that the disc mystery was real and not simply the result of news play on the Kenneth
  Arnold story.
</p>
<p> To this day these cases are misquoted in virtually every book. They actually represent three separate incidents
  which took place during a six month period prior to mid-April. They were witnessed by Weather Bureau meteorologist
  Walter A. Minozewski at the Richmond, Virginia, weather station. In all of these curious events he described seeing a
  "silver disc" with distinct differences in shape and performance to that of a balloon. At some point after the events
  he reported the incidents to his superiors.
</p>
<p>The last sighting occurred one April morning when Minozewski and his staff caught sight of a very bright metallic
  elliptical disc while they were tracking a small "Pi Ball" (or wind measuring) meteorological balloon then at 15,000
  feet. He checked his observations through a theodolite telescope. (A theodolite is an optical device used for
  measuring horizontal and vertical angles—in this case used to track weather balloons.) The disc flew just below the
  balloon and remained in sight for fifteen seconds, appearing much bigger than the balloon with a flat level bottom and
  a dome on top. It remained on a westward heading at high speed until vanishing off into the distance <span
      class="source">Edward J. Ruppelt, Report on Unidentified Flying Objects (Garden  City, NY: Doubleday & Co., 1956), p. 41; and "Air Intelligence  Report No. 100-203-79, Analysis of Flying Object Incidents in the US,  Air Intelligence Division Study No. 203, 10 December 1948, Directorate  of Intelligence and Office of Naval Intelligence," p. 8; and United  States Air Force, "Project Grudge, Final Report No. 102 AC 49/15-100,"  Appendix B and Appendix I, Final Report by J.A.

("Hereafter these files will be listed only as  Project Blue Book Files with relevant case identification and role  numbers.); and Ted Bloecher, Report on the UFO Wave of 1947 (By the  Author, 1967), p. I.</span>.
</p>
<p>For some unexplained reason disc sightings often occurred in connection with balloon tests. It is ironic, because if
  it was not for the presence of highly trained balloon men in those instances, no one would believe the observations to
  be anything other than misidentifications of their own balloons. For that reason, and the expertise of such men,
  Loedding took special interest in all investigations involving balloon technicians.
</p>
<p> As another side note, it should be mentioned that there is some mystery concerning the Minozewski sightings. In
  January of 1967 researcher Ted Bloecher reviewed the Minozewski case file at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio,
  thanks to the assistance of Lieutenant Colonel George P. Freeman Jr. who arranged his visit. Bloecher's associate,
  atmospheric physicist Dr. James McDonald of the University of Arizona, then contacted Minozewski to confirm the
  details of the report with him. Minozewski recounted the fine points of the case just as they appeared in Air Force
  files but was baffled because he said he had never reported the incidents to the military. Equally perplexing is the
  fact that the Minozewski sightings are not now part of the Blue Book index released to the National Archives nor does
  the case file appear as complete as when Bloecher reviewed it thirty-two years ago <span class="source">Bloecher, Report on the UFO Wave of 1947, pp. x, xiv</span>.
  As will be demonstrated in this chapter, it is apparent that sometime during or after the close of the twenty-two year
  long Air Force investigation into UFOs that followed 1947, a conscious effort was made to downplay any sighting which
  occurred prior to the Kenneth Arnold incident. Those after Arnold's sighting were then often claimed to be the result
  of simple hysteria generated from his highly publicized account.
</p>
<p> Only a few very sketchy reports can be found in May in any type of records, most without exact dates or times. Few
  of these came to the attention of the early investigators like Loedding, because they were not recorded until after
  the Kenneth Arnold sighting, and only then detailed in obscure newspaper articles. Others were not documented until
  private researchers started doing investigative work years later. For example, a Mrs. H.G. Olavick (later Rawlins)
  recalled to Dr. James McDonald in 1967 that she witnessed ten flying discs make some curious aerial maneuvers near
  Tucson, Arizona, on or about May 5th of 1947. One of those objects appeared larger than the other nine discs, perhaps
  as big as 100 feet in diameter. Viewed with her former husband, they both agreed at the time that the discs must be
  some sort of new high performance military aircraft. As they watched, the nine smaller craft began "playing around the
  cloud" in violent aerial maneuvers for about seven minutes as if making mock dogfights. Finally regrouping in a V
  formation behind the larger craft, they flew off with tremendous acceleration toward the northeast <span
      class="source">Correspondence of Ted R. Bloecher</span>. FBI files document another sighting on May 5th between
  Ellensburg and Seattle, Washington. In that case three men sighted at 3:30 P.M. PST a silver object streaking
  erratically across the sky at great height and leaving a long pillar of "gas" which remained in the sky for over
  thirty minutes <span class="source">Documents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, dated 27 September 1947</span>.
</p>
<p><span class="people" title="Ted Bloecher">Bloecher</span> documents in his book a sighting by Mrs. W.C. Clark, of
  Memphis, Tennessee, who reported seeing two flying objects shaped like "tennis balls" pass over her yard around the
  first of May <span class="source">Ibid.; and Memphis, Tennessee, Commercial Appeal, 1 July  1947</span>. Another
  woman, Mrs. Slawuta, reported that on May 10th she saw a flying "shining elliptical object" with a gold band around it
  heading east over Newark, New Jersey <span class="source">Newark, New Jersey, Star-Ledger, 1 July 1947</span>. This
  would be one of the first that Loedding might have taken keen interest in because of the feature of a central
  ring—perhaps structural in nature.
</p>
<p> None of these early reports came to national attention until after the Kenneth Arnold sighting in June. A few were
  then investigated by local military intelligence officers. In the following case an Army Air Force security officer
  out of Tinker Field, Oklahoma, made a report and later the incident was reinvestigated by the FBI. This particular
  sighting impressed the military due to the reliability of the witness, Byron Savage.
</p>
<p>A businessman and private pilot from Oklahoma City, Savage observed sometime on or about May 17th to the 21st a shiny
  disc-like object flying over the city. It was dusk, at the time of the sighting as Savage and his wife had just
  started to walk out to their car. At first he commented to his wife that a big white plane was coming over. He
  continued to watch the craft because it soon became evident that this thing was no ordinary aircraft. The object was
  as big as six B-29 bombers! It flew between 10,000 and 18,000 feet toward the northwest at a speed estimated at more
  than three times that of a jet, which in those days flew about 500 miles per hour. The disc reportedly made no noise
  except for a very faint "swishing sound." It passed over in a matter of fifteen to twenty seconds and had the
  appearance of a "perfectly round and flat" frosty white elliptical object <span class="source">"Fast Flying Disks Reported in West," Associated Press news service,  27 June 1947</span>.
  Savage stated to FBI investigators that "he was sure this object was not a meteor and in his opinion it must be
  radically built and powered, probably atomic" <span class="source">Documents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, dated 24 July  1947</span>.
  This was one of the first reports that ended up in Wright Field's (later the Blue Book) records, when Loedding began
  gathering all the paperwork he could on the flying disc mystery.
</p>
<p>Similar objects appeared over Manitou Springs, Colorado, on the 19th when witnessed by Pike's Peak Railway mechanics
  Dean A. Hauser (a navy veteran), Ted Weigand, Marion Hisshouse, T.J. Smith, and L.D. Jamison. They were on their lunch
  break around 12:15 P.M. MST as the men noticed some sort of shiny metal-like craft overhead. It flew around the area
  for over twenty minutes making erratic aerial maneuvers that no aircraft they knew of could undertake <span
      class="source"><span class="people" title="Ted Bloecher">Bloecher</span>, <a
      href="../../../../6/7/Bloecher_Report1947UfoWave/index_fr.html"><em>Report
    on the UFO Wave of 1947</em></a>, p. I</span>.
</p>
<p>While the news accounts on this incident are brief, a very interesting remark in one of the stories indicates that
  representatives of the 15th Air Force, then part of the Army Air Force, interviewed the rail workers on June 29th and
  sent their findings to Washington. This would certainly be one of the first indications of military interest in a UFO
  sighting. In fact, those who had the opportunity to view the Air Force files before they were released to the public
  in 1976 speak of this as one of its cases. Today, however, the file along with a notable number of other early cases
  is officially "missing." The National Archives lists them in the Air Force index but do not have them in their
  collection of declassified files turned over to them by the military in late 1975. Loedding had obviously been privy
  to it once he persuaded the Pentagon to send its UFO files to Wright Field in September of 1947. Unfortunately,
  further details of this case are lost with many others.
</p>
<p> A more obscure sighting that even Loedding may not have heard about occurred around the 19th when an Augusta,
  Georgia, physician, Dr. Golden R. Battey, spotted four discs at 11:00 A.M. EST while fishing in St. Helena Sound near
  Beaufort, South Carolina. Battey stressed how bright they looked and related that the craft traveled at an altitude of
  more than 20,000 feet in a southeasterly direction. He said they were spinning on their axes with a circular rim
  around their lower quarter as they silently moved by in less than twenty seconds at great speed <span class="source">The (Portland) Oregonian, 6 July 1947; and Augusta, Georgia,  Chronicle, 6 July 1947</span>.
</p>
<p> Two flying discs accounts are found for the first day of June but like almost all of the early sightings, were not
  reported until after the Kenneth Arnold incident. Yet these did later make numerous newspaper stories and were
  undoubtedly read by many including Alfred Loedding on or by the 6th of July. One of these came from housewife Mrs.
  C.W. Parks in Bakersfield, California, who saw two groups of ten flying discs each moving at high speed in a
  southeasterly direction on June 1st <span class="source">Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Patriot, 1 July 1947</span>. That
  night another housewife, Mrs. Inez Nostrant, observed numerous bright luminous plate-sized objects flying in groups of
  twos and fours as high as planes over Grand Rapids, Michigan <span class="source">Grand Rapids, Michigan, Herald, 1 July 1947</span>.
</p>
<p> On the 2nd of June private pilot Forrest Wenyon saw a jar-shaped rocket-like object fly across the nose of his
  aircraft at great speed near Lewes, Delaware, heading in an easterly direction around his own altitude of 1,400 feet.
  Wenyon reported his observation to the CAA, Eastern Airlines, and the FBI because the object was spotted in commercial
  airline space. There was some speculation on his part that there could have been a connection to a crash of a C-54
  from such an object just two days before. The sighting did end up in Air Force records but for whatever reason was not
  released to the National Archives when other UFO files were made public in 1976. Earlier researchers who had the
  chance to view that file indicate that the military attributed the sighting to a rocket test. History, however, bears
  no documentation of rocket tests over that densely populated East Coast area <span class="source">Columbus (Ohio) Citizen, 8 July 1947; and Bloecher, Report on the  UFO Wave of 1947, p. HI-9</span>.
  This is one case in which it would be interesting to know if Alfred Loedding consulted on due to his experience in
  rocketry (The Wenyon incident is detailed in recently released FBI records).
</p>
<p> That same day Carl Achee, Jr. and John Scales, Jr. observed one circular flying object over Shreveport, Louisiana,
  along the Red River. This event, like others, were not thought by the witnesses to be of significance until they read
  accounts of the widely publicized Arnold account. For that reason those and reports from June 10th in Douglas,
  Arizona, and Weiser, Idaho, on the 12th have received little attention even by modern day researchers <span
      class="source">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Inquirer, 8 July 1947</span>.
</p>
<p>Other early accounts come from overseas. According to the Times of India, flying discs were seen over Bombay as early
  as June 7th with other saucer-like accounts coming from South America <span class="source">Fortean Society's Doubt, 19 (Spring-Summer 1947): 91</span>.
  Disc reports outside the United States are very rare prior to July of 1947, but at 3:30 P.M. local time on June 10th,
  Hungarian citizen Gyorik Ference saw four "yellow-red platter-like objects" fly over Budapest. They were sphere-shaped
  and silver in color, traveling at high speeds <span class="source">"Project Sign, Report No. F-TR-2274-IA," Project Blue Book Files,  Roll No. 85, Administrative Files, Box 1</span>.
</p>
<p>Although it was in the United States that pilot Richard Rankin, a veteran flyer with more than 7,000 hours in the
  air, had the most notable flying saucer sighting prior to Arnold's. As with other early witnesses, he did not report
  it until others like Arnold had admitted to seeing such strange objects. Contrary to later accounts of the Rankin
  Case, his observation did not happen on the 23rd, but on the 14th, and did not occur at 2:15 P.M. but at 12:00 noon
  PST. Nor was Rankin in flight at the time, but saw the objects while watching a boy mow the lawn outside his friend's
  home in Bakersfield, California.
</p>
<p>At the time of the sighting it was a clear and sunny day when both he and the boy saw ten round objects or "saucers"
  fly over in a loose "V" formation with one straggling in the rear." They were heading north, but seven of the discs
  then reversed direction and came back over them toward the south. Their diameters appeared to be from 30 to 35 feet,
  and they were traveling at an estimated speed of 350 miles per hour around 8,500 feet. At the time of the sighting
  Rankin thought the craft must be some sort of new Army or Navy test vehicle much like the oval-shaped XF5U-1 "flying
  flapjack" and even commented as much to the lad mowing the lawn. Yet, military intelligence concluded Rankin's
  sighting represented no known aircraft type <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 1, Case 7, listed as Incident 29  in 1947 era documents; and "Pilot Recalls Seeing Discs," The (Portland)  Oregonian, 3 July 1947, p. 11; and "Pilot Vet Reports Seeing 'Flying  Saucers' June 23," Denver Post, 2 July 1947; and documents from the  Federal Bureau of Investigation, dated 3 July 1947</span>
  (No XF5U-1 were airworthy at that time) <span class="source">USAF Museum Files, Wright-Patterson USAFB</span>.
</p>
<p>Loedding, among others, greatly valued such observations from experienced pilots. Interviews with Loedding's son in
  1997 and 1998 stressed that Alfred took special interest in any sightings made by pilots. Although the Fourth Army Air
  Force in connection with the FBI first investigated the case, Loedding had a chance to review the Rankin file sometime
  by the end of that summer. Again, it is not known what he thought but like other case files he inherited from the
  Brown and Davidson team, Loedding was surely struck by the similarities of the incident to others. The hallmarks of
  these included shiny saucer or wing-like objects flying fast and silently, often in groups or in special formations.
  An early such sighting comes from Lansing, Michigan on the 15th at 9:30 P.M. CST which added to the notable early
  cases:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>Harry Von Riper was alerted by his landlady, Mrs. Letta Loree, and watched "balls of fire" jump in and out among
    the clouds "like clay pigeons" for about ten minutes. He tired of watching and returned to the house and did not see
    them again. He saw a searchlight beam, but the searchlight was stationary and could not, he thought, cause the
    phenomenon</q> <span class="source">Lansing, Michigan, State Journal, 6 July 1947, p. 1</span>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> That same day, although apparently earlier in the afternoon, housewife Mrs. H. Ackley saw a very bright silver
  balloon-like object appear to the northeast of Gering, Nebraska <span class="source">Sacramento, California, Union, 8 July 1947</span>.
  News accounts tell of another sighting the following day over Valley City, North Dakota at 9:00 P.M. CST:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>Hjalmer Lokken, fireman at the State Teachers College, reported "something that looked like a ball, bright red
    in color [that] went shooting past. It was about the height of the flag pole on the college building (approximately
    65 feet.)" It traveled to the west at terrific speed</q>. 22
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 17th a strange round object was seen traveling in a straight line over Logan, West Virginia <span
    class="source">Logan, West Virginia, Banner, 14 July 1947</span>. Then in Dubuque, Iowa, a very unusual sighting
  took place as described again by a local press account:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q>Mrs. Louis Korn, 879 Rush Street, Dubuque, Iowa, saw over the Mississippi River six objects which all looked the
    same. They appeared to be two feet long and one foot wide, oval shaped ("Being deeper than a saucer, more like a
    shallow cup, with broken handle") and somewhat vaporous, like a white cloud. They seemed to float gently through the
    air, visible in each case for about an hour. Mrs. Korn and her husband saw similar objects on the 4th of July</q>
    <span class="source">Dubuque, Iowa, Telegraph-Herald, 1 July 1947</span>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Also on the 17th a disc story comes from Bremerton, Washington, when Mrs. Emma Shingler saw more than one
  plate-shaped object flying west out over the Pacific at tremendous speed. This incident is interesting because that
  evening at 6:00 P.M. PST three flying discs were again seen over Bremerton heading west by Mr. and Mrs. H.K. Wheeler
  <span class="source">"Fast Flying Disks Reported in West," Associated Press news  service,  21 June 1947; and The (Portland) Oregonian, 27 June 1947; and Seattle,  Washington, Post-Intelligencer, 26, 21 June 1947. (Mrs. Shingler had a  similar sighting on June 24th at 10:00 A.M. PST)</span>
  (Reports such as those, detailing the discs heading out to sea, led Alfred Loedding and the first military
  investigators to wonder if the objects could have been launched from Soviet submarines). And before the night of the
  17th ended, Professor Emeritus from the University of Wisconsin, E.B. McGilvery, spotted a round luminous object
  heading to the northeast of Madison <span class="source">Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Journal, 1 July 1947</span>.
</p>
<p>The next day on the 18th a notable sighting occurred in Green Springs, Alabama, when at 4:00 P.M. CST Mrs. H. Akins
  with others observed a blinking disc-shaped craft fly westward <span class="source">Birmingham, Alabama, News & Age Herald, 9 July 1947</span>.
  Another less well-known pre-Arnold sighting occurred in Oregon that day when E.H. Sprinkler and other residents of
  Eugene spotted multiple "saucers" in the southwest heading northeast. Sprinkler captured a picture of them.
  Unfortunately, the film revealed only dots because by the time that he had gotten his camera into position, the
  objects were speeding out of sight at tremendous velocity <span class="source">Bloecher, <em>Report on the UFO Wave of
    1947</em>, Index</span>.
</p>
<p> On the night of the 19th, from his back yard, R.D. Taylor spotted eight to ten discs which were lighted from within
  as they zoomed over Cedar Rapids, Iowa <span class="source">Des Moines, Iowa, Register, 8 July 1947</span>. Mrs. Jerry
  Neels said she saw some "bright and shiny" discs south of Kelso, Washington, on the 20th <span class="source">"Flying Saucer Story Grows," The (Portland) Oregonian, 28 June 1947</span>.
</p>
<p> That same day Mrs Annabel Mobley and her daughter Luanne observed three triangular-shaped groups of three discs
  flying toward the northeast of Hot Springs, New Mexico <span class="source">Albuquerque, New Mexico, Journal, 2 July 1947</span>.
  Also on the 20th, around 11:00 P.M. PST Archie Edes and his family saw an oval flame-like craft descend at high speed
  near Moses Lake, Washington <span class="source">Seattle, Washington, Post-Intelligencer, 26,27 June 1947</span>. A
  Spokane woman around the 21st added to the growing list of pre Arnold sightings when she saw eight discs descending
  with a "dead leaf motion" near the shore of the Saint Joe River in Idaho <span class="source">Jacques Vallee, Passport To Magonia: From Folklore to Flying  Saucers  (Chicago: Henry Regnery Company, 1969), p. 191</span>.
  Two other sightings were reported for the 21st but are dismissed as explainable phenomena <span class="source">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Bulletin, 9 July 1947; and Project Blue  Book Files</span>.
</p>
<p> Edward L. de Rose had still another early sighting. At 11:30 A.M. EST on the 22nd he reported a "brilliant,
  round-shaped silvery-white object" moving in a northwesterly direction over Greenfield, Massachusetts. It traveled at
  a high rate of speed somewhere at around 1,000 feet of altitude and streaked across the sky in a matter of only eight
  to ten seconds before vanishing from view. He felt certain the mysterious craft could not have been a balloon and
  represented something very real when later filing this report with the A-2 section of Army Intelligence of the
  Atlantic Division <span class="source">Extract from "Weekly Intelligence Summary, ATC, 30 July 1947,"  Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 1, listed as Incident 46 in 1947 era  documents</span>.
  That day a very similar sighting took place in Radium Springs, Oregon. In that case a "flying pie-plate" was seen by
  H.E. Hammond and his son L.V.W. Hammond, the secretary manager of the Eastern Oregon Federal Savings and Loan
  Association <span class="source">Baker, Oregon, Democrat Herald, 27 June 1947</span>. Before the 22nd ended a sighting
  occurred in Tucson, Arizona, when Walter Laos spotted a very strange-looking flying object <span class="source">Tucson, Arizona, Daily Citizen, 1 July 1947</span>.
</p>
<p> On Monday the 23rd at 2:00 A.M. EST a Mississippi woman, Elizabeth H. Hall, awoke to a frightening sight. Outside
  her bedroom window that early morning a very bright light grew larger and then receded. She knew that it could not be
  a star, nor could she determine its size or shape. After this pulsating brilliance continued three times, it silently
  disappeared on its fourth cycle <span class="source">Letter to J. Alien Hynek, from Elizabeth H. Hall, 6 November 1980,  files of the J. Alien Hynek Center For UFO Studies, (Hereafter referred  to as CUFOS)</span>.
  This account came from the same date as that of E.B. Parks and a dozen other witnesses who saw two illuminated discs
  fly at terrific speed, low over Hazel, Green, Alabama <span
      class="source">Huntsville, Alabama, Times, 1 July 1947</span>. Later that day at 3:30 P.M. CST, an unusual flying
  object traveling about 150 miles per hour appeared over the mountains outside of El Paso, Texas. Dr. G. Oliver
  Dickson, an optometrist, described how it looked like a blimp with a point at each end. Although unlike a
  lighter-than-air craft, it remained bright or luminous. He stressed that because "The sun's rays were not reflected on
  it" <span class="source">"More Flying Discs Reported," Oklahoma Norman Transcript, 4 July  1947; and Albuquerque, New Mexico, Journal, 29 June 1947. (That  sighting may have occurred on the 22nd—news accounts of the case are  confusing)</span>.
</p>
<p> Ironically, that night Richard L. Bitters, the editor of a large newspaper, saw strange flying objects over
  Wapakoneta, Oregon, but sat on his amazing story till after he saw Arnold's account published <span class="source">Wapakoneta (Oregon) Daily News, 1 July 1947</span>
  (This despite the fact that another similar sighting occurred in Cincinnati that same night) <span class="source">Cincinnati, Ohio, Times-Star, 1 July 1947</span>.
  Thus, neither of those sightings made the papers before Arnold's account, but one story was actually reported to
  newspapers on the 23rd. The tale came from a railroad engineer in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. As he was climbing off his
  engine, he observed ten shiny disc-shaped objects flying in a string-like formation, "like wild geese." The six line
  story it generated produced little attention at the time <span class="source">Speech by Frank Edwards to Civilian Saucer Intelligence, 28 April  1956</span>.
  The public's perception of this strange new flying disc phenomenon would, however, soon change.
