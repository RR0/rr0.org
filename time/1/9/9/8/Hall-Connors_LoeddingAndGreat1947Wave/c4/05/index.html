<p>UFOs proved even more persistent the day following the Independence Day Sightings. In Augusta, Maine, at 1:15 P.M.
  EST dozens of reports came into the Civil Aeronautical Administration describing unidentifiable flying objects over
  the city―all heading in a northerly direction. Dan Kelly, program director at the local radio station WRDO,
  personally saw twelve of the discs.
</p>
<p>By 8:00 A.M. PST on the other side of the country in Sacramento, California, Dr. A.K. Carr had a remarkable sighting
  of two disc which may have been seen by others shortly afterwards. The local newspaper detailed this his sighting:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>They came in from the west, Dr. Carr said, one was at about
    <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">10000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">feet</span></span>, I would say and the other was traveling at about
    <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">10000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">feet</span></span>, I would say and the other was traveling at
    tremendous speed at about 5,000 to 6,000 feet. We could see streams of vapor behind them. The lower one continued in
    an easterly direction, but the other, which I was observing through 12 power field glasses, banked sharply over the
    city and flew north. It seemed to stand on one edge as it turned <span class="source">Ibid</span>.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just 30 minutes later two similar discs were seen far to the south near
  <span class="place">Dana Point, California</span>, by Mr. and Mrs. John K. Street. Street was an insurance company
  executive and he and his wife were spending the weekend at the beach side town enjoying the long holiday. At the time
  of the incident they were sight seeing just a few miles inland at the Capistrano Mission. Mr. and Mrs. Street
  described the objects they saw as two "saucer-like" craft which slowly flew up the canyon from the beach in a
  northerly direction toward the Capistrano Mission <span class="source">Bloecher, Report on the UFO Wave of 1947, p. III-l</span>.
</p>
<p>Then about 50 miles north northwest of Dana Point two discs were once again seen by a third independent witness over
  Eagle Rock, California. Donald Levine, ten years old at the time, described them as yellowish and traveling at a high
  rate of speed flying straight toward the north <span class="source">Ibid., Index</span>. About that same time a fourth
  observer just a few miles north of Eagle Rock saw disc-like objects over Glendale, California. In that case, however,
  observer Donald Dwiggins reported seeing four discs which changed shape and flew at <span itemscope
      itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">8000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">feet</span></span> to <span itemscope

          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">feet</span></span> <span class="source">Ibid</span>.
</p>
<p>A series of sightings occurred in Washington State around Spokane and Seattle that also involved independent
  observations of similar flying objects between 10:45 and 11:00 A.M. PST <span class="source">Ibid</span>. In
  Covington, Kentucky, that afternoon, two women described seeing a flying saucer with <q>legs.</q> Interestingly, that
  same day a Chicago woman reported an identical feature on a flying disc, stating: <q>it had legs</q>
  <span class="source">Ibid., p. 11-15</span>.
</p>
<p>In <span class="place">Bethesda, Maryland</span>, <span class="witness">Jack LaBous</span>, a visual artist, saw a
  very unusual flying object. He said it looked like a dome with an antenna protruding from beneath. This is of note
  because a Sioux Falls man described seeing an identical sort of disc the next day ― also describing some sort of
  pole-like appendage sticking out of the bottom of the craft <span class="source">Sioux Falls, Idaho, Daily Argus Leader, 1 July 1947; and Pierre,  South Dakota, Daily Capital-Journal, 1 July 1947; and Denver, Colorado,  Post, 1 July 1947; and St. Paul, Minnesota, Dispatch, 1 July 1947; and  Bloecher, Report on the UFO Wave of 1947, p. 11-15.

</p>
<p>Other reports on the 5th came from <span class="place">St. John, New Brunswick</span>; <span class="place">Sherbrooke, Quebec</span>;
  <span class="place">Port Huron, Michigan</span>; <span class="place">Anaconda, Montana</span>; <span class="place">Hollywood, California</span>;

</p>
<p>Of special interest, around 11:00 A.M. PST in <span class="place">San Jose, California</span>, Sergeant <span
  class="witness">Charles R. Sigala</span> of the Army Air Force said he and three others observed a <q>silvery</q>
  flying disc near his home. Sigala was on leave from Hamilton Field at the time and saw the object fly by in clear
  view. It circled around over some nearby mountains at about 5,000 feet, dipped several times, and then headed toward
  the sea. Sigala estimated the object to be as large as an automobile <span class="source">The (Portland) Oregonian, 6 July 1947</span>.
  Further north in Albany, Oregon, at 3:20 P.M. PST ex-sailor Ted Tannish and his friend Bill Lemon observed a similar
  circular-shaped object rapidly flying south. They then watched it slow down before heading northward ― finally
  disappearing into a cloud bank <span class="source">Albany, Oregon, Democrat Herald, 1 July 1947</span>.
</p>
<p>At 7:00 P.M. EST TWA pilot Captain John L. Dobberteen and First Officer Frank Corwin, observed a strange looking
  object while over <span class="place">Neapolis, Ohio</span>. They were on a ferrying mission from the East Coast with
  an empty airliner at about <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span
      itemprop="value">4000</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">feet</span></span> when the unknown object came into sight. Both
  pilots described it as a "whirling fan blade" about the size of a small private plane and moving at an estimated speed
  of <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue"><span itemprop="value">200</span>
          <span itemprop="unitCode" content="HM">miles per hour</span></span>. The Captain stated that it definitely
  resembled no plane or auto gyro he had ever seen and felt it may have resembled a flying disc if seen from the ground.
</p>
<p>Dobberteen deviated slightly off course and followed it for a short time before correcting back to a heading for
  their destination in Chicago. After landing Dobberteen made a point of reporting the incident to air traffic control
  as the event had occurred in commercial air lane space and he feared that the mysterious object may pose a hazard
  <span class="source">Bloecher, Report on the UFO Wave of1947, p. 11-17</span>.
</p>
<p>At sunset, two miles north of <span class="place">Fayetteville, Arkansas</span>, Henry Seay (who had a sighting the
  night before) claimed he saw a ten to twelve foot wide luminous disc briefly land on his farm! Very conservative and
  set in his ways, Seay described the event to UFO researcher Dr. James McDonald years later.
</p>
<p>He had been driving his cattle toward the barn for milking at the time. As he moved them up a road leading to the
  milking barn, a disc-like object flew over him and showered down an array of sparks. The sparks landed on Seay's bare
  arms but did not burn. The whole incident, however, badly frightened his cattle. For the next ten minutes Seay
  scurried around attempting to gather them up―being more concerned about his livestock than looking at the
  bothersome disc. Finally getting them rounded up to drive back toward the barn, he saw the disc again. This time it
  had touched down between him and the barn at a distance of 200 yards across the pasture. As he gazed at the object
  Seay could discern a round flattened shape that was luminous but not too blinding to look at―just too bright to
  clearly make out any distinct edges. Within seconds the craft silently rose up vertically to almost 40 feet and zoomed
  off horizontally at a speed around 50 miles an hour. As it did so, it again dropped a shower of sparks which fell to
  the ground but did not seem to damage his nearby oat field. Only ashes were evident from the event and Seay could not
  even find a mark on the ground to prove where the disc had landed. Yet, like the night before, his cattle remained
  badly spooked by the whole event <span class="source">Ibid., p. IV-1</span>.
</p>
<p>We know that Alfred Loedding was investigating such landing cases by at least 1948―the files of which have
  never been released by the Air Force <span class="source">Interview with Donald Loedding by the authors. (Donald stated that  his father spoke many times of the landing cases he had investigated.)</span>.
  But there is no indication Mr. Seay was ever contacted by anyone other than Dr. McDonald, although Seay did say his
  neighbors saw the disc too.
</p>
<p>That night at 10:30 P.M. EST many Canadian residents of Wallaceburg, Ontario, observed two large formations of
  luminous discs traversing a wide area of the nighttime sky <span class="source">Associated Press news service report, 7 July 1947</span>.
  Back east in <span class="place">Shrewsbury, Massachusetts</span>, Mrs. Jessie F. Willis reported that she saw eight
  blue flying discs heading in a northerly direction about 7:30 P.M. EST. She then observed others in groups of twos and
  threes <span class="source">Aldrich, Project 1947: A Preliminary Report On The 1947 UFO  Sighting  Wave, p. 80</span>.
  By 9:30 P.M. MST Mrs. Shirley Hefferon and her sister Lois Mae Gadbaw of Butte, Montana, saw several strange craft
  pass overhead in a northerly direction <span class="source">Helena, Montana, Independent-Record, 6 July 1947</span>.
  At 10:00 P.M. MST lights were reported on the horizon by Evanston, Wyoming, residents but these may have been
  attributed to searchlight beams from the fairgrounds in Salt Lake City <span class="source">Wyoming, Unita County Herald, 11 July 1947, p. 1</span>.
  By 9:45 P.M. EST Mrs. Scott Jones, daughter, and children witnessed a "shooting star" turn and float toward the
  Phillips Packing Company in Cambridge, Maryland. It then turned again in an opposite direction <span class="source">Cambridge, Maryland, Daily Banner, 1 July 1947</span>.
  Around 10:00 or 10:30 P.M. PST in Longview, Washington, Mrs. Margaret Carter told of seeing a spherical,
  aluminum-colored object in the southwestern skies headed northwest." The object "dipped" several times while it was in
  view for up to five minutes <span class="source">Longview, Washington, Daily News, 8 July 1947</span>.
</p>
<p>In <span class="place">Norwalk, Ohio</span>, that night two Huron County farm families saw saucers. They noted that
  "one disc over-lapped the other and traveled in the opposite circular directions" <span class="source">Sandusky, Ohio, Register-Star-News, 8 July 1947</span>.
  At 12:23 A.M. EST the next morning, a sighting occurred in Paterson, New Jersey. Across the country John Neisswanger
  of Eugene, Oregon, was returning home on a dark and lonely road about 12:30 P.M. MST. Suddenly, he became startled by
  a slowly-moving aerial object. His description compared it to a child's drawing of the sun with lines around it. He
  then stopped the car, and he and his wife and another passenger watched the weird phenomenon until it passed
