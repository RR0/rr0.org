      Wave of 1947</a></th>

</table>
<p> The Muroc Sightings were the pivotal event which activated the United States military into concerted action on the
  saucer mystery. After that point, as Edward Ruppelt recalls, it was indeed a very serious business. In the middle of
  this was poised Alfred Loedding.</p>
<p> Dayton started to receive firsthand UFO reports by Wednesday, July 9th. One of these came from Idaho when Boise
  Evening Statesman writer Dave Johnson, who after three days of trying, finally caught a glimpse of a UFO. Flying out
  of Go wan Field in an AT-6 from his National Guard unit, he observed at 12:17 P.M. MST a strange looking dark object.
  Johnson tried to make sense of the weird sight as it became silhouetted against the clouds. The UFO then made a
  half-roll and entered a stair-step climb. Johnson at first thought it might be a balloon. (Many of the early
  meteorological balloons were made from neoprene which would turn smoky gray or black in the sunlight) <span
      class="source"><em>The Roswell Report, Fact Versus Fiction in the New Mexico  Desert</em></span>. No apparent
  balloon launches, however, could account for the incident <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 1, Case 53, listed as Incident 83  in 1947 era documents</span>.
  Later, Johnson learned that three ground observers at Gowan Field who were National Guard pilots had also reported a
  similar object <span class="source"><a href="/people/b/BloecherTed/index.html">Bloecher, Ted</a>: <em>Report on the UFO Wave of 1947</em>, p. 111-13</span>.
  Like Johnson, they too were mystified as to what it was they had seen that day.</p>
<p>Another sighting came in from the 1380th Army Air Force Base in Fort Pepperell, Newfoundland. It related a story near
  Grand Falls, when a police constable's wife and mother-in-law observed four "egg-shaped phosphorus colored discs."
  Each disc passed over in a side-by-side formation around 11:30 P.M. ADT. Ten minutes later a similar object, which the
  constable saw himself, darted across the sky with a "jellyfish-like flash" <span class="source">Extract from "Weekly Intelligence Summary, ATC, 16 July 1947,"  Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 2</span>.
</p>
<p>A report that never reached Dayton, but is of interest came from two men flying over Glacier Park, Montana, at 3:53
  P.M. MST. They spotted seven flying saucers heading in a northwesterly direction. The two men, Ed Johnson and Joe
  Dimio, noted that the craft were only visible for a short period?indicating they traveled at a fairly fast rate <span
      class="source">"Kalispell Pilots Sight 'Flying Saucers,'" Flathead, Montana,  Monitor, 10 July 1947, p. 1</span>.
</p>
<p> Less than three to five percent of UFO incidents were reported to Air Force Intelligence <span class="note">Research conducted by Jan L. Aldrich</span>.
  For example, another very good sighting that was only documented by the newspapers came at 5:45 P.M. CST from the
  nationally known News-Press editor, Helen Culver Gettys. She witnessed a flying saucer pass over her car near the St.
  Joseph (Missouri) Country Club. Mrs. Gettys had just left the club with her mother and Mrs. Charles Culver when a
  flash in the sky caught her eye. All of the ladies were then quite startled to look up and see one of the famous
  saucers. As it flew northward at about 1,000 feet, they commented on how the sun reflected off its shiny metal
  surface. The disc appeared in full view for a matter of seconds, indicating it traversed the area at a high rate of
  speed. All three women possessed solid reputations and Mrs. Gettys stressed in her own article about the incident that
  prior to the sighting they had consumed only "one bottle apiece of a local bottler's very soft drink" <span
      class="source">"Saucer Seen by Society Writer Near Country Club," St. Joseph  (Missouri) News-Press, 10 July 1947, p. 1</span>.
</p>
<p>At 8:00 P.M. CST a Liano, Texas, man, T.A. Smith, reported a disc going southeast. Smith described it as a whirling
  wash tub throwing off sparks <span class="source">Austin, Texas, American, 11 July 1947</span>. Finally, that night a
  West Virginia man decided to do something about the unsettling wave of saucer sightings. When discs appeared over
  Johnny Johnson's Bluefield home, he fired upon them with his shotgun! The irate West Virginian failed to do any
  visible damage to the saucers. But if this account is accurate, the UFOs in this case had to have been flying at a
  very low altitude in order to come into gun range <span class="source">"Learns Shots Can't Ground Flying Discs," Bluefield, West Virginia,  Sunset News, 12 July 1947, p. 1. -Vi</span>.
</p>
<h2>Thursday 10 July</h2>
<p> Saucer sightings were reported by newspapers on the following morning from Ontario, Canada; Westminster, Colorado;
  Douglas, Arizona; Burien and Seattle, Washington; and Niwot and Aurora, Colorado <span class="source">Denver, Colorado, Rocky Mountain News, 10 July 1947; and Seattle,  Washington, Post-Intelligencer, 11 July 1947</span>.
  That afternoon George Dey and Roy Wilson reported to newsmen that they had seen at 1:20 P.M. MST, seven "flying
  saucers" over the Joel Hart ranch west of Buhl, Idaho. They said at first the objects were shiny and flying in
  formation, but then they broke up and sped out of sight <span class="source">Buhl, Idaho, <em>Herald</em>, 17 July 1947</span>.
  At 4:30 P.M. EST a Logan, West Virginia, man, George Vance, observed a "round-shaped object with a sort of a turtle
  back" glistening intensely as it flew in a straight line <span class="source">Logan, West Virginia, Banner, 11 July 1947</span>.
</p>
<p> As the sightings continued one of the top US astronomers from the Department of Meteoritics at the University of New
  Mexico, Dr. Lincoln La Paz, his wife, and two teenaged daughters, reported seeing an elliptical object very high among
  the clouds. The incident occurred at 4:47 P.M. MST while they were driving from Clovis to Clines Corner, New
  Mexico.</p>
<p>La Paz estimated, with the aid of a pencil held at arm's length, that the object was 20 to 30 miles from his
  position, ellipsoidal and rigid, 160 feet long and 65 feet thick, traveling 120 to 180 miles per hour horizontally and
  600 to 900 miles per hour vertically. It appeared silent and "self-luminous" against the dark clouds with a sort of
  "wobbling motion" and no exhaust or vapor trail could be observed. The object had "a sharp and firm regular outline,
  namely one of a smooth elliptical character much harder and sharper than the edges of the clouds." It remained in view
  for at least 30 seconds and " then ascended upward and disappeared for five seconds behind a cloud until it **"'
  reappeared at a two degree elevation and about a five degree elevation north of true west. Finally, it vanished into
  the clouds for good. La Paz stated that , the ascent he saw the object make "thoroughly convinced me that we were
  dealing with an absolutely novel airborne device" <span class="source">H.B. Darrach, Jr. and Bob Ginna, "Have We Visitors From Space?"  Life, 7 April 1952, p. 83</span>.
</p>
<p>There is a possibility this sighting could have represented a balloon. Large polyethylene envelopes were just then
  coming into use for research balloons and could easily reflect the sun's rays, yet would never travel that fast if his
  calculations were correct <span class="source">The Roswell Report, Fact Versus Fiction in the New Mexico Desert</span>.
  Despite this, interest in the sighting continued for many years. The case was first made public by Life magazine in
  1952 but withheld La Paz's name. The sighting was examined by the Air Force and a file compiled, but all evidence of
  the paperwork was removed before release of UFO files to the National Archive's in late 1975. Today the case is not
  even listed in the Blue Book Index which is now also a part of the National Archives' collection.</p>
<p>More sightings came from the West that day. In Cheyenne, Wyoming, two silver discs shaped like saucers with a dome on
  top slowly passed over in a clear sky <span class="source">Skylook #27, February 1970, MUFON</span>. In Temple, Texas,
  a former Army Air Corps colonel, Smith Tarrant, observed two flying "discs" from the door of a local welding shop. He
  estimated they were at 1,500 feet, flying against the wind, heading along a straight course at about 200 to 250 miles
  per hour. They headed out of sight over the course of three minutes to the south with no indication of sound or smoke
  or means of propulsion <span class="source">Waco, Texas, Times Herald, 15 July 1947, p. 1</span>.</p>
<p>That same day numerous individuals observed discs fly through the skies of Missouri, although few of these sightings
  sound like balloons either.</p>
<p> It all began with 60 eyewitnesses at an ice cream social on the John Cox farm six miles northeast of Mercer. They
  witnessed groups of saucers in twos and threes pass over north to south. Some did fly by themselves, but most were in
  formation.</p>
<p>A mile south of Princeton, Missouri, (fourteen miles south of Mercer) those same flights of discs were observed by
  Mr. and Mrs. Dykes and Mr. and Mrs. J.W. Buren and their families while driving down US Highway 65. The sight so
  startled them that they pulled off the road only to be joined by other motorists. Among those were Mr. and Mrs. W.S.
  Thompson with their friend, J.M. Beets. Other observers included Mr. and Mrs. Rit Thompson and Mr. and Mrs. W.H. Nell.
  All gave a similar account to the one that happened at the Cox farm, stating that the saucers came over singularly and
  in groups for almost a half hour. In fact, on a farm one mile east of Princeton, Mr. and Mrs. Parvin Woodward and
  their guest, Perry Coon, confirmed this same "saucer show" <span class="source">"Saucers Put on Show at Princeton," St. Joseph (Missouri)  News-Press, 1 1 July 1947, p. 1</span>.
</p>
<p>At 7:00 P.M. MST near Brockton, Montana, Ray Carpenter and his wife observed a shiny object illuminated against a
  dark cloud bank. A former manager of the Wolf Point airport, Carpenter judged it to be about the same size as a
  private aircraft traveling very quickly <span
      class="source">Wolf Point, Montana, Herald-News, 17 July 1947, p. 1</span>. Then at 8:00 P.M. a pilot for the Lee
  Geophysical Company, saw a shiny craft zooming southward near Tulsa, Oklahoma <span class="source">Tulsa, Oklahoma, DailyWorld, 11 July 1947</span>.
  At that same time another Tulsa man, J.C. Penman, reported seeing a "circular fluorescent lamp" move in a
  northeasterly direction. Penman was a former Army Air Force crew chief and had never seen anything like it before
  <span class="source">Ibid</span>. A half hour later one more disc appeared over a mountainous area northeast of Salt
  Lake City, Utah. Described as an "aluminum type of thing," it remained in view for two minutes as it moved with a fast
  but "funny" motion <span class="source">Salt Lake City, Utah, Tribune, 1 1 July 1947</span>. Then in Indianapolis,
  Indiana, Mrs. Bernie Hollingsworth had a sighting at 9:30 P.M. CST. She described a "flying saucer" pass near her home
  headed east, stating that it looked like a "shining piece of oblong steel" <span class="source">"Flying Saucer Is Back Again-Or Something," The Indianapolis  (Indiana) Star, 11 July 1947, p. 19</span>.
  By 11:55 P.M. EST a flying saucer was seen southeast of Dover, Delaware. Mrs. Hilda Dinsmore characterized the object
  she saw as a round dull colored object "sailing across the sky" <span class="source">Dover, Delaware, Index, 13 July 1947</span>.
</p>
<p>Another report came from Newfoundland on the 10th from two Pan-American Airways mechanics near Harmon Field, AAFB,
  Stephenville Cross. At 5:30 P.M. ADT they (and a third man) were driving up a mountain road six miles south-southwest
  of the base when all three of them, J.N. Mehrman, A.R. Leidy, and I.E. Woodruff, observed a silver circular disc at
  about 10,000 feet. It passed in horizontal flight along a great curved course. The disc's size, they stated,
  approximated the wingspan of a C-54 transport aircraft and looked to be cutting a bluish-black trail about fifteen
  miles long as it literally parted a path through the clouds over Harmon.</p>
<figure class="right side">
  <tr>
    <figcaption>
      Some personnel of the 1388th at Harmon Field also saw this great cut made in the clouds and acquired two
      Kodachrome pictures taken by one of the mechanics who first witnessed the event. Today copies of these images are
      in the Blue Book files and although very poor reproductions, they show the spectacular aerial trail. Above is the
      best of those two photos <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 1, Case 59, listed as Incidents  26-21 in 1947 era documents</span>.</caption>

  </table><p>The trail passed over the base and out toward the north-northeast?being compared to the afterglow of a
  powerful searchlight when suddenly switched off. Weather records confirmed scattered clouds between 8,000 to 10,000
  feet which supported the original altitude estimate.</p>
  <p> Known as the Harmon Field Case, this incident received the first intensive investigation by Army Air Force
    Intelligence. The sighting became especially relevant to Intelligence officials both at Wright Field and the
    Pentagon because of the concern of a Soviet connection to the saucer mystery. The reasoning basically followed the
    assumption that if the USSR was flying spy flights over the United States, the missions would logically have to pass
    over some area of Canada or the far north. For that reason the sighting just twelve hours earlier in Newfoundland
    coupled with this one, and a disc report out of Alaska the very next day, stirred up a lot of excitement <span
        class="source"><a href="/people/g/GrossLoren/index.html">Gross</a>: <em>UFOs: A History</em>, "1947", pp. 44-45; and Project Blue Book  Files,  Roll No. 2, Case 63, listed as Incident 41 in 1947 era documents</span>.
  </p>
  <p>The initial report was filed by base intelligence officers on the 16th, but by the 21st a more detailed report was
    forwarded to the Pentagon. General Schulgen then ordered intelligence at Wright Field in Dayton to send a top-level
    assessment team to Harmon Field "immediately" <span class="source">Michael D. Swords, "Project Sign and The Estimate of the  Situation."  first draft of unpublished article written for 1998 issue of Journal Of UFO Studies</span>.
  </p>
  <p>The T-2 chief, Colonel Howard M. McCoy, dispatched a team by the 30th that may have included T-3 (engineer section)
    specialist Alfred Loedding. McCoy's team was also asked by Schulgen to report directly to the Pentagon following
    their investigation. Interestingly, at that time, Schulgen also asked McCoy what the T-2 analysis and the T-3
    engineering sections had "prepared" to date on the disc phenomenon. McCoy's notes do not tell us if Analysis
    Division Chief Colonel William R. Clingerman had any answers or if the T-3 section at Wright Labs had compiled any
    analysis. McCoy himself was working on the German/Soviet technology angle. He, in fact, had even interviewed the
    famous successor to Count Zeppelin's dirigible empire, Hugo Eckener. Eckener was then in America consulting with the
    Goodyear company to try to revive the era of the great airships following WWII <span class="source">Ibid</span>.
  </p>
  <p> The T-2 investigation of the Harmon Field Case really shook up their own aeronautical engineers in the T-3
    section. Part of the report had the ring of Alfred Loedding's expertise and read as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><q>The bluish-black trail seems to indicate ordinary combustion from a turbo-jet engine, athodyd motor, or some
      combination of these types of power plants. The absence of noise and apparent dissolving of the clouds to form a
      clear path indicates a relatively large mass flow of a rectangular cross section containing a considerable amount
      of heat</q> <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 2, Case 60, listed as Incident  27a  in 1947 era documents.</span>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The T-2 team excluded a meteor or fireball scenario in their own minds despite the fact that an astronomical event
    became the official conclusion on the case file. Behind the scenes, T-2 and Washington were still focused on a
    Soviet connection. Wright Field investigators spoke with the commander of Harmon Field and others to make sure that
    no British or Canadian aircraft had been in the area at the time. And since they knew no American aircraft were to
    blame, they privately concluded something of "foreign origin" made that curious split in the clouds over
    Newfoundland. </p>
  <p> Although, by 1948, "foreign origin" would become a catch word in Dayton to refer to extraterrestrial space craft,
    these men where only talking about a Russian threat at that time. Their concern grew, In fact, because Newfoundland
    seemed to be especially attractive to the discs. Early the next morning at 2:20 A.M. Codroy residents reported
    seeing a "flying saucer" with a cone-shaped tail. Two men saw the object when they were standing outside a local
    store and had their attention drawn to the sky by a very bright disc streaking across with a yellowish cone-shaped
    after-glow. They described it as a luminous object traveling at great speed from the northwest and heading east at
    about 6,000 feet <span class="source">"Statement of Mr. ___, Codroy, Newfoundland," Project Blue Book  Files, Roll No. 2, Case 60, listed as Incident 27b in 1947 era  documents</span>.
    Both men felt certain they could not have mistaken it for a plane or falling star. A third man then saw the same
    aerial phenomenon. He had served in the civilian Air Detection Corps during the war and possessed great experience
    with identifying aircraft. He also became convinced the disc was "not a plane, but definitely some flying object"
    <span class="source">"Army Air Force Intelligence Report," Project Blue Book Files, Roll  No. 2</span>. Overseas in
    Norway, European papers were talking about "flying saucers":</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><q> A "flying saucer" was observed Thursday evening near Skotfoss. At about 19:30 my wife told me that she had
      seen an object in the sky, says one of the three persons who observed "the saucer." It moved in between the clouds
      at an undetermined altitude, blinking like a star or like a mirror when the sun is reflected in it. As it entered
      the shadow it became dark and round or oval. It is completely out of the question that it was an airplane. There
      was no sound from the saucer, which was about the size of an airplane. The object was in view for four minutes and
      then disappeared towards the southeast</q> <span class="source">Smalands, Norway, Dagblad, 11 July 1947</span>.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Before the day was out discs were also seen in Amsterdam, and Leyden, Netherlands; Birmingham, England; Santiago,
    Chile; Kagoshima Bay, Japan; and then back in North America over New York, California, and Ripley, Ontario <span
        class="source">The New York Times, 11,12 July 1947, pp. 1,2; and Leyden (Holland)  Naval Radio Service, 10 July 1947</span>.
  </p>
  <h2>Friday 11 July</h2>
  <p> UFO activity started early in the morning of the llth at 2:30 A.M. MST when Mrs. Anna Potts of Yuma, Arizona, rose
    from bed frustrated by her barking dog. She got up and went outside to quiet him when suddenly, and to her great
    amazement, she saw a disc-shaped object go over at high speed with a spinning or rotating motion. The craft passed
    without a sound in a matter of just five seconds. This suggested that the craft must have been at a relatively low
    altitude as it became lost from view after crossing the tops of nearby homes. Mrs. Potts reported the event to the
    Daily Sun, absolutely convinced she had seen a flying saucer <span class="source">"Yuman Says She Saw Saucer Friday," The Yuma Sun &amp; Arizona  Sentinel, 12 July 1947, p. 3</span>.
    Perhaps the same object flashed in front of Mr. Ernest Tiffany's bedroom window one hour later in Tulsa, Oklahoma
    <span class="source">Tulsa, Oklahoma, Daily World, 12 July 1947</span>.</p>
  <p>In Longview, Washington, at 6:30 P.M. PST two groups of a dozen or more shiny objects were observed flying with
    bright flashes as they turned and caught the sun's reflection <span class="source">McMinnville, Oregon, Telephone Register, 24 July 1947</span>.
    By 7:20 P.M. EST a report came out of High Point, North Carolina, when pilots flying at 1,000 feet saw a "ball of
    fire." It appeared as a huge object, round on top with a black band through the center. "The bottom part of the
    object was revolving, and periodically bursts of fire came from underneath, as if some sort of exhaust" <span
        class="source">Associated Press report, 12 July 1947</span>.</p>
  <p>Later that day around 10:00 A.M. GMT while ferrying a Viking transport aircraft to Argentina, Captain Norman E.
    Waugh of London's Airwork Ltd. had a very interesting UFO sighting over the Bay of Biscay. Waugh was near 8,000 feet
    when he spotted ahead, and above him, an elongated oval or "tadpole" shaped craft flying at about 16,000 feet. First
    Officer Peter Roberts and Radio Officer Stuart Chinneck both agreed with Captain Waugh that the object looked
    grayish in color and of unusual design. At one point they came within five to six miles of the UFO. It then passed
    the starboard side of their aircraft at lightning speed, leaving a long vapor trail. During that time the flight
    crew estimated the object to be traveling about 600 miles per hour at 7,000 feet above their aircraft. Waugh, a
    former Bomber Command and Transport Command pilot with sixteen years flying experience, and Roberts, a former
    wartime Squadron Leader, knew no aircraft outside the US proving grounds at Muroc had that kind of performance. They
    later told reporters that neither of them had seen anything like it before <span class="source">"Saucer Flew Past Our Plane," London (England) Times, 12 July 1947;  and "Man Who Saw a Flying Saucer," (Buenos Aires) Herald, 22 August  1947</span>.
  </p>
  <p>On that same side of the world during a small country fair, a "flying saucer" appeared over the Irish town of
    Cahirciveen. It approached from the northwest at about 1,000 feet at great speed and appeared to be revolving as if
    it were on an invisible axis. The craft had a kind of white halo and passed over without making a sound. Many
    observers were from outside the area, only being in town for the fair. Three names that were recorded as witnesses
    were Michael J. O'Sullivan, J. Coffey, and Patrick O'Shea, all from Cahirciveen. The total time of the sighting
    approximated eleven seconds <span class="source">"Flying Saucer Seen in Co. Kerry," (Dublin) Irish Times, 12 July  1947, p. 1</span>.
  </p>
  <p> Then, in Italy at 10:30 P.M. local time, multiple "luminous discs" were seen above Garsenda. They flew from north
    to south as many local citizens watched the spectacle <span class="source">"Flying Saucers Above Garsenda," Milan, Italy, IlNuovo Corriere  Delia Sera, 12 July 1947</span>.
    Interesting, cases also came from South America in Paramaribo, Surinam, on the llth <span class="source">Paramaribo, Surinam, De West, 11 July 1947</span>.
    Yet, unexplainably, after this day widespread UFO activity suddenly slowed. Just like turning off a switch, people
    stopped seeing a phenomenon that had spanned the world and accounted for hundreds of reports. In comparison to the
    onslaught of sightings from the 4th to llth, less than two dozen good incidents would be reported during the rest of
    the year. Did the news media simply stop covering the sightings or did the phenomenon actually change in character?
  </p>
  <p>Only a few UFO reports, for example, can be found for the 12th. One comes from Spring Coulee, Alberta, Canada, but
    sounds suspiciously like a balloon sighting <span
        class="source">Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Times-Herald, 14 July 1947</span>. Then a man reported a "silver ball"
    flying with a purring noise over Silver Lake, Washington, at noon <span class="source">Longview, Washington, Daily News, 12 July 1947</span>.
    Again in this case, it could be attributed to an IFO or identified flying object ? very possibly a distant jet.</p>
  <p>Five incidents were reported in the American West on the 13th. Three came from Grand Forks, North Dakota, in the
    afternoon. All describe bright revolving objects traversing the sky. Then at 5:15 P.M. CST a Milwaukee Railroad
    signal crew in Mussellshell, Montana, observed an irregularly moving round white object <span class="source">Montana Record-Tribune, 17 July 1947, p. 1</span>.
    At 7:00 P.M. PST over Baker Valley, near Wingville, Oregon, a round object flying with a "dipping motion" was seen
    by many witnesses and several aircraft pilots who tried in vain to pursue it <span class="source">Baker, Oregon,Record-Courier, 17 July 1947</span>.
  </p>
  <p>On the 14th two reports came from Idaho only ten minutes apart. The first sighting occurred at 7:20 P.M. MST south
    of Idaho Falls. In this case a man described seeing a turning and twisting craft fly by on an irregular westward
    course. Ten minutes later, and to the west, in Nampa, Idaho, a dozen "flying discs" were seen by Mr. and Mrs. O.B.
    Warnock <span class="source">"Nampans Report 12 Flying Discs," Nampa, Idaho, Free-Press, 15 July  1947; and Idaho Falls, Idaho, Commoner, 18 July 1947</span>.
  </p>
  <p>Two unrelated reports came from the 15th, although both describe a strange "fiery object." Distantly separated,
    however, the first incident occurred in Indonesia and the second in Utah <span class="source">Paramaribo, Surinam, De West, ISJuly 1947; and Ogden, Utah,  Standard  Examiner, 15 July 1947</span>.
    On the 16th a sketchy report came from South America and one from Rugby, North Dakota. In the latter case, a
    luminous revolving object was seen at 1:00 A.M. CST only 200 feet off the ground <span class="source">Paramaribo, Surinam, De West, 16 July 1947; and Rugby, North  Dakota,  News, 17 July 1947, p. 1</span>.
  </p>
  <p> Just one account is evident for the 17th, but it is a very unique sighting. In that instance multiple objects
    appeared at various levels above Helena, Montana, from 2:45 to 3:00 P.M. MST. Although, those accounts do liken them
    to simple balloon clusters known to be in use at the time by the military <span class="source">Helena, Montana, Independent Record, 18 July  1947</span>.
    On the 18th, however, two very notable daylight disc sightings can be found. They begin with Mr. and Mrs. Roger
    Morin of Arlee, Montana, who spotted two discs at 10:00 P.M. MST heading west. By 11:30 P.M. CST in Joplin,
    Missouri, one disc zoomed to the southeast looking like a "silver meat platter" <span class="source">Missoula, Montana, Daily Missoulian, 22 July 1947; and Joplin,  Missouri, Sunday Globe, 20 July 1947</span>.
    No reports have surfaced for the 19th and only one for the 20th which occurred in Texas at 10:35 P.M. and very

  <h2>26 July</h2>
  <p>In Washington D.C. at noon President Truman waited on board the presidential aircraft Sacred Cow to sign some
    important documents before hurrying back to Missouri and his dying mother. Soon a courier arrived at National
    Airport carrying what proved to be far reaching legislation. With the signing of the National Security Act of 1947
    and Executive Order 9877, the Army, Navy, and now the Air Force were coordinated as one military establishment under
    a single Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal.</p>
  <p> This allowed the Army Air Force to become a separate branch of the armed services under a new name, the United
    States Air Force, or USAF. Stuart Symington served as the first Secretary of the Air Force. (The three departments
    were separately presided over by a civilian Secretary, each of which became members of the new National Security
    Council.) On September 26th General Carl Spaatz became the first Chief of Staff of the new USAF. (Each service's
    chief of staff would become members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.) General Hoyt Vandenberg then became Vice Chief of
    Staff on October 1st. Symington, Spaatz, and Vandenberg seldom spoke publicly on UFOs, and what they did say seemed
    to indicate that the sightings posed no defense concerns. Whether they actually believed that may never be known,
    but the new Air Force via men like Alfred Loedding is known to have had a very real interest by this date in the
    curious flying disc reports.</p>
  <h2>28 July</h2>
  <p> A sighting very similar to the United Airlines Flight 105 Case occurred on this date on the same run as that noted
    July 4th incident. Captain Charles F. Gibian and First Officer Jack Harvey of this July 28th Flight 105 trip were
    preparing for a landing into Boise, Idaho, at 8:34 P.M. MST. As they lost altitude over Mountain Home (45 miles out
    from Boise), Harvey spotted a strange craft far ahead of their DC-3. Just as Captain Smith described twenty-four
    days earlier, Harvey characterized the bizarre object as silhouetted against a bright western sky. Captain Gibian
    then noticed the object and accounted that it appeared to be at 9,000 feet as their aircraft began descending from
    that same height to 8,000 feet. He described it as weaving as if "it was going through choppy air." Gibian also
    stated that it was "going like hell when it disappeared" toward the northwest. Both pilots agreed the object to be
    about the size of their own aircraft and about 40 miles distant. They also felt certain what they saw that day could
    not have been an aircraft. Each stressed that they had never seen such a thing before and publicly expressed concern
    that possible military experiments were being carried out in commercial air lanes <span class="source">Boise, Idaho, Daily Statesman, 30 July 1947; and Bloecher, Report  on  the UFO Wave of 1947, p. 111-13-14</span>.
  </p>
  <h2>29 July</h2>
  <p>A sighting at Hamilton Field, California, at the end of July represented one of those few truly exceptional cases
    that finished out the year. It definitely contributed to Loedding's mounting interest in flying discs and
    determination to investigate deeper.</p>
  <p> Known as the Hamilton Field Incident, it began at 2:50 P.M. PST when Lieutenant Ward L. Stewart in the 415th
    reserve training unit landed in an AT-6 from a routine training flight and parked his aircraft near hangar <span
        class="source">Documents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, dated September  1947</span>. The Assistant
    Operations Officer, Captain William H. Ryherd, then called his attention to an odd object flying above the hangar.
    It headed right over a P-80 jet fighter coming in on a preliminary landing approach at around 6,000 feet.</p>
  <p>The P-80 flew in excess of 250 miles per hour as the unknowns proceeded to pass by the jet "as if it was standing
    still." A second object then appeared, flying a left to right "protective" maneuver over the first craft until they
    each passed southward toward Oakland and then out over the ocean. Both the captain and the lieutenant agreed the
    objects were 15 to 25 feet in diameter, shiny white in color, and circular-shaped. The total duration of their
    sighting lasted about fifteen seconds as the craft sped by in a clear sky. No noise could be detected, but the
    observers felt they could not fairly judge that they were completely silent because of the background roar of the
    P-80.</p>
  <p>Lieutenant Stewart piloted B-29 bombers during the war and had considerable experience as a flyer. He conveyed
    authority to Intelligence officers when questioned, stating that the objects were "unlike any conventional type of
    aircraft he had ever seen." Captain Ryherd also conveyed a highly impressive evaluation of the sighting with an
    extreme degree of sincerity throughout his testimony <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 2, Case 69, listed as Incident 52  in 1947 era documents</span>.
    Given the opportunity, investigators should scan some of the Oakland papers to see if any other UFO reports were
    made in connection with the Hamilton Field Incident. Many cases listed in this book have been discovered in just
    such a way. Uncovered in newspapers from areas near documented sightings, these secondary sources make it all the
    more evident something truly amazing took place in 1947.</p>
  <p>One other good sighting for the 29th is found in the files of the FBI. It is of interest because it also describes
    an object not too dissimilar than the two objects seen over Hamilton Field that day. Note the similarities in the
    report:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><q>At or about 12:05 p.m., July 29, 1947, a sedan, driven by Steve Berrmann and carrying R.J. (Bob) Madden in the
      front seat and Karl Herman in the rear seat, was proceeding northwesterly along the road leading from Canyon Ferry
      to York, both in Montana some 25 miles N.E. of Helena.</q></p>
    <p><q> When at a point approximately 1/4 mile N.W. of Canyon Ferry, (as shown on Forest Service Map to be in the
      NE1/4 of NE1/4 of Sec. 10 TION R1W) Karl suddenly shouted "See it! See it! There's a flying saucer!" Steve
      immediately slowed down and gradually brought the sedan to a stop, he and Bob meanwhile scanning the sky i in the
      direction pointed by Karl in an effort to see the "flying saucer," but without success.</q></p>
    <p><q>Approximately ten seconds elapsed between the time Karl reported seeing the "saucer," coming over the horizon
      at high speed from the southwest, (Karl first thought it a meteor) and traveling northeasterly, and the bringing
      of the car to a stop.</q></p>
    <p><q>As the car came to a stop, Steve, Karl and Bob, simultaneously, saw the following:</q></p>
    <p><q>Directly ahead, (N.W.) 2 to 3 miles distant and approximately 3000 ft. above the ground, a bright disc
      hovering and fluttering in the air. Descending and rising through a vertical distance of fifty or a hundred feet
      for a period of about five seconds then, while at the top of an ascent, the "disc" suddenly swooped to the
      Northeast at tremendous speed and disappeared into the clear air within a distance of 200 ft. That is to say it
      did not pass beyond an obstruction to further visibility but "melted into thin air" as if because of tremendous
      speed.</q></p>
    <p><q>This disc was, from the viewpoint of the observers, apparently 3 ft. diameter, circular and of no great
      thickness ? approximately 3 or 4 inches.</q></p>
    <p><q>The sky was blue with scattered small clouds, the sun was shining brightly and the disc gleamed and shimmered
      in the bright sunlight as if covered with highly polished nickel.</q></p>
    <p><q>After the "disc" disappeared from view, the sedan and its occupants proceeded northwesterly along the road,
      but could discern no evidence of the presence of the "disc" along or adjacent to that thoroughfare.</q></p>
    <p><q>It is to be remembered that the dimensions as stated above were as they appeared to the observers some 2 or 3
      miles from the "disc" and the true dimensions must be considerably greater. 59<br> <br> /s/R.J. Madden<br> <br>

  <h2>30 July</h2>
  <p> Ending out the last UFO report for the phenomenal month of July, this particular account deserves to be quoted in
    full. Although sightings dramatically fell off by this point, the case is extremely note worthy as evidence that
    very good encounters did occasionally occur during the rest of the year. The witness involved was returning to his
    home in Estevan, Saskatchewan, from the Canadian town of Torquay:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><q>A motorist driving close to daybreak with his headlights on was watching storm clouds in the northeast. As he
      watched, something swept out of the clouds and passed overhead moving in a southeasterly direction. It glided down
      near the ground and then rose again and disappeared at a rapid rate of speed. The unidentified object did not seem
      to be very high in the air. "At first it looked like an aircraft wing that was on fire at both ends but when it
      passed overhead I could see that it was circular in shape. It looked to be about the size of a tractor wheel and
      about four foot thick. It was revolving and appeared to have flames or fire at the outside edges."</q></p>
    <p><q>I have laughed at the stories of these things, but not any more; I was scared. The object was real. I kept
      looking around for someone else to witness it but there was nobody else in sight at the time."</q></p>
    <p><q>The motorist said the object was silent and remained visible for about 20 seconds </q><span class="source">Canduff, Saskatchewan, Canada, Gazette-Post-News, 14 August 1947,  p.  1; and Estevan, Saskatchewan, Canada, Mercury, 31 July 1947, p. 1.</span>

  <h2> The Hoaxes, 1 August</h2>
  <p> Hoaxes have always existed in connection with any type of mysterious phenomenon. It is regrettable, but that's
    human nature. Often UFO reports, legitimate or not, tell us more about the observer than the observation they make.
    Fortunately, because so many dedicated researchers over the years have become interested in UFO activity, most
    hoaxes are eventually exposed. The serious approach taken by military intelligence in the early years also helped
    weed out and expose pranksters.</p>
  <p>Those investigators were very leery about hoaxes and feared the public, and especially the Pentagon's reaction, if
    they were found to have been taken in by such a ruse. In typical military fashion intelligence officers did not
    "fool around," and routinely relied on the FBI for background checks. Alfred Loedding, in particular, was careful to
    only concentrate on cases involving highly credible observers such as pilots. He also had that scientific knack for
    looking at data as a whole and not making conclusions based on any one particular event.</p>
  <p>Undoubtedly, however, witnesses who produced photos or physical evidence received the most attention by
    investigators. There are actually a good number of cases in the 1947 files of people claiming to have discovered
    pieces of "flying saucers" that had supposedly crashed or exploded somewhere near them. Equally surprising is that
    few of these were attempts to perpetrate a hoax. In almost all of those cases, Intelligence and/or the FBI
    determined the witnesses were genuinely fooled by objects that were indeed mysterious, but only in the manner in
    which they were discovered.</p>
  <p>There is even reference in both Air Force and FBI files to the Mogul balloon project. This concerned one of those
    physical evidence cases and referred to several inquiries made by an Intelligence officer, and later FBI field
    agents, as to whether a particular fragment could have been a piece of debris from a "Mogul" <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 2</span>
    (This obviously proves the Mogul project was not as secretive an operation as present-day Air Force officials claim
    when debunking the Roswell Incident) <span class="note">See Appendix V</span>.</p>
  <p>The first well-documented UFO hoax in the early files concerns two individuals by the name of Harold A. Dahl and
    Fred Lee Crisman. They had made the claim that six low-flying UFOs hovered over their boat on June 21st while they
    were looking for floating lumber off Maury Island near Tacoma, Washington. Subsequently it became known as the Maury
    Island Incident when they confessed under FBI interrogation to a hoax. This occurred after the Brown and Davidson
    Army Intelligence team was tragically killed returning from Tacoma after interviewing Dahl and Crisman. Attributed
    simply to an unfortunate plane crash, their accident had no real connection to the case.</p>
  <p>It is also unfortunate that Kenneth Arnold became a victim of these hoaxers. Although he did not lose his life as
    the result of their ignorant deeds, he did lose something he considered just as valuable, his reputation. This
    concern for his reputation had made Arnold desperate to learn more about the curious flying saucers following his
    own sighting in June and a second one on July29th <span class="note">Few people have heard the story of Kenneth Arnold's second UFO  sighting. It occurred at 6:55 A.M. when Arnold was flying over Union,  Oregon. On this occasion he saw 20 to 25 discs which were rough  appearing on top and lighter on the bottom. As these objects flew,  Arnold estimated them to be 24 to 30 inches in diameter and flying at  speeds faster than 200 miles per hour. He also commented that the discs  fluttered and flipped on edge as they headed north. Surprisingly, this  second sighting by Arnold received almost no news play</span>.
  </p>
  <p>Arnold sought any proof he could and became interested in the Maury Island case after the editor of Amazing Stories
    magazine, Ray Palmer, agreed to put up $200 to help him investigate their claim. Arnold, however, could not have
    been kept away from such a story. It was outwardly such a good sighting because the witnesses were actually claiming
    to have pieces of "slag" expelled by one of the saucers after it had supposedly encountered mechanical problems.
    They also purportedly captured the saucers on film which captivated Arnold more than anything else. Even Captain
    E.J. Smith of the United Airlines Flight 105 Case became taken by the hoaxers out of that same need?the need for
    proof.</p>
  <p>Seeking to substantiate any possible proof that did exist, Arnold had personally convinced Lieutenant Brown, who
    had worked on his case, to travel to Tacoma. Brown and Davidson both took advantage of the offer and flew up to
    Tacoma to meet with Dahl and Chrisman while they were being interviewed by Arnold and Smith in a hotel room at the
    Winthrop.</p>
  <p>Once on the scene the more experienced Brown and Davidson saw the story as an obvious hoax, but because the
    officers held such a high degree of respect for both Arnold and Smith, they did not indicate to them their feelings
    and subsequently allowed themselves to be talked into taking some of the alleged fragments back for study.</p>
  <p>Flying back to Hamilton Field to take part in the Air Force Day ceremonies, an engine caught fire and the wing came
    off of their B-25 near Kelso, Washington, killing both Brown and Davidson. The fragments were recovered from the
    wreckage, and after careful analysis proved to be simple slag from a local Tacoma steel mill. The military
    threatened to prosecute Dahl and Chrisman but never carried through with it. But because they hesitated to disclose
    the case as a hoax while considering prosecution, many thought the sighting to represent a true event.</p>
  <p>The press made a lot out of it at the time and for some reason even erroneously stated that the Air Force had
    ceased disc investigations altogether. When the real story came out months later, buried on the back pages, people
    missed the explanation. As a result, some still naively detail the Maury Island Incident, alluding that it may not
    have been a hoax <span class="source">Randle, The UFO Casebook, pp. 11-15</span>. </p>
  <p>Because of that mistaken perception, so pervasive at the time, the first step had been taken which, over the years,
    would make the military more and more defensive in regard to the media. Even Arnold, held in high regard by early
    investigators, is treated only with ridicule following the whole tragic event. Afterward, when an article came out
    critical of the Arnold sighting, TID clerks automatically added it to his file. Intelligence officers around the
    country felt they had learned a valuable lesson from the incident?caution.</p>
  <h2>4 August</h2>
  <p>Every researcher has their own favorite cases for certain periods. The following sighting from Alaska is a
    particularly attractive story for two reasons. First, this incident received detailed documentation in the military
    files which usually was not the case with a sighting in such a distant location. Secondly, the incident is typical
    of a lot of air-to-air sightings of the early days, not only in the manner in which it occurred, but the description
    of the object seen. In fact, when compared to the United Airlines Flight 105 Case of July 4th, the similarities are
    striking. Also comparable is the time of day in which both sightings took place. Surprisingly, this account is
    seldom mentioned in the popular literature.</p>
  <p>The incident began northwest of Bethel, Alaska, when DC-3 Captain Jack Peck and copilot Vince Daly of Al Jones
    Flying Service were on routine cargo run. At dusk they suddenly sighted a black saucer-shaped object cross their
    flight path. It had come in at a right angle to their aircraft and Peck instinctively made a precautionary climb
    from 1,000 to 1,200 feet to avoid any chance of collision. He then swung in behind the disc and chased the peculiar
    looking craft as it became silhouetted against a brilliant evening sky. Peck pursued at 170 miles per hour until
    losing sight of it four minutes later.</p>
  <p>During the incident they noted that the disc had a smooth streamlined surface with no visible means of propulsion.
    The speed of the object was subsequently computed at 510 miles per hour, based on the assumption that the UFO
    traveled 34 miles in four minutes while the DC-3 moved eleven miles in the same period. If correct, this would also
    infer that the craft was more than twenty miles distant when last seen. To be able to see an object at that
    distance, it would indicate a diameter of at least 50 feet and suggests a length of about 500 feet.</p>
  <p>Aside from such startling figures, the Bethel Alaska Case drew attention within Intelligence among men like
    Loedding because of the quality of observers. The airline also considered Captain Peck as a man with an "excellent
    reputation." A letter in the Air Force files speaks to his character, stating "no one here doubts in the least but
    that he actually saw this object" <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 2, Case 75, listed as Incident 58  in 1947 era documents</span>.
  </p>
  <h2>6 August</h2>
  <p> By the fall of 1947 the FBI had become very active in UFO investigations. The following FBI memorandum was drafted
    by the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, field office and addressed to FBI Director J. Edgar Hover. It demonstrates that
    although Intelligence in Dayton would soon begin a twenty-two year investigations into UFOs, other organizations
    like the FBI did substantial work as well in these early years.</p>
  <p>This memo did make it into Intelligence files at Wright Field but not all of the FBI paperwork seems to have been
    shared with them. Correspondence from August even indicates Loedding urging the T-2 Analysis Division (which he was
    working for on the disc sighting) to give direction to A-2 Intelligence, Fourth Air Force at Hamilton Field, and via
    them direction to the FBI. Was this a show of frustration that Wright Field may not have been receiving the
    cooperation that they should have as directed by Washington following the Muroc Sightings? This memo does shows a
    sincere and worthy effort by Special Agents to conduct an investigation into this particular sighting: </p>

    </table><p>One of the most interesting features of the 1947 period is the sheer number of disc sightings. This is
    not to say there was not a diversity of phenomena reported, but many of these "disc or saucer accounts" are
    extremely noteworthy because few other periods had such high percentages of observations describing true "nuts and
    bolts" type objects. For example, an above average daylight disc sighting of late 1947 comes from the Smoke River
    Canyon near Twin Falls, Idaho. On this date at 1:00 P.M. MST a blue disc-shaped object actually flew beneath the
    walls of that canyon river valley! On its flight, the strange craft sped above a well respected area trout farmer,
    A.C. Urie. His two sons, Keith and Billy, also witnessed the event as they were coming across the river to meet
    their father with a boat. All three witnesses then watched it pass about 75 feet over a stand of Mormon Poplars,
    causing the tree tops to bend and sway as if caught in a vacuum. By that point the craft, which had descended as
    much as 300 feet below the 400 feet high canyon rim, became silhouetted against its steep walls, resembling an
    "inverted pie-plate." Urie estimated it to be about twenty feet wide by ten feet thick with a horizontal pipe or
    pole sticking out which emitted bright flames <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 2, Case 80, listed as Incident 75  in 1947 era documents</span>.
    The former county sheriff and a county commissioner, L.W. Hawkins, also reported a similar disc sighting at 9:30
    A.M. that day about twenty miles southwest of Twin Falls near the Salmon Dam. Eventually FBI investigators checked
    all of the witnesses and gave them and Urie a very good recommendation <span class="source">Research conducted by Jan L. Aldrich. (Interestingly, Guy  Bannister,  a famed suspect in Jim Garrison's Kennedy assassination trial, was one  of the FBI players in the Twin Falls investigation)</span>.

    <p> That morning another interesting sighting occurred over Redmond, Washington, at 9:00 A.M. PST. The resulting FBI
      report is quoted here to illustrate that when a UFO report appeared in a news article, there definitely were
      officials taking notice:</p>

    <p>On the Pacific island of Guam, American enlisted men reported seeing crescent-shaped objects flying past the US
      military base there. They stated that they flew on a zig-zag course at least twice as fast as a conventional
      airplane <span class="source"><a href="/people/g/GrossLoren/index.html">Gross</a>: <em>UFOs: A History</em> 1947, p. 58</span>.

    <p> In the Mt. Josephine, Skagit County forest of Washington State, a ranger observed a flying disc similar to the
      object seen in Twin Falls, Idaho. That UFO descended rapidly from the northeast and flew with a slight angular
      pitch, but righted itself as it came lower. Finally the unusual machine flew off to the southeast at great speed

    <p>Also that day two army officers at Fort Richardson, Alaska, stated that they saw an unusual object flying above
      them at a tremendous rate of speed below the cloud layer then at 10,000 feet. The records state that the officers
      described the craft as sphere shaped?not saucer-like. They noted, however, that unlike a balloon it definitely
      moved against the wind and had a metallic appearance <span class="source">Documents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, dated 19  September 1947.</span>

    <h2>19 August</h2>
    <p> Another sighting comes from Twin Falls, Idaho, at 9:39 P.M. MST when numerous people sighted multiple groups of
      flying objects in the night sky. These formations resembled a "glow in the air" the color of electric lights. The
      "lights" traveled at "terrific speed" and flew in triangular formations. At one point three of them peeled-off of
      a larger group of ten and sped away in a different direction. Due to an overcast, the observers felt that they
      were not astronomical anomalies <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 2, Case 83, listed as Incident 64  in 1947 era documents</span>.
    </p>
    <p>Apparently many agencies were looking into this sighting including the FBI. On August 22nd the following memo was
      composed by the FBI:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><q>In accordance with your request, this matter was checked with Army Air Forces. Lieutenant Colonel Garrett
        advised Special Agent _______ that extensive inquiries within the Army Air Forces revealed that no research or
        experiments were being conducted by the AAF in the vicinity of Twin Falls, Idaho on or about August 19, 1947.
        Colonel Garrett stated that he had no information which would throw any light on the matter reported in the
        teletype</q> <span
          class="source">Documents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, dated 22 August  1947.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If, on the other hand, the Idaho UFOs could have been explained away as aircraft or meteors, it would have
      surprised few. By August the Gallup poll revealed over 90 percent of adult Americans had heard of flying saucers,
      but that people continued to feel they represented secret military craft or natural phenomena <span

      Thus, even after the summer wave of 1947, the public still looked upon human achievements in science and
      engineering with the same sense of wonder they had since the beginning of the modern technological revolution
      around the time of the 1897 UFO wave. Our present-day mind set associating "flying saucers" with extraterrestrial
      visitors simply had not yet taken hold. It is interesting to note that even research scientist at the Holloman
      AFB, who worked around the latest technologies, made no conclusions when they had discs sightings themselves that
      month. The events are detailed by an official statement drawn up by Operations and Projects Group, Electronic and
      Atmosphere Division personnel which Alfred Loedding spoke to a year later?actually while investigating an entirely
      different case: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><q>During the latter part of August, 1947, this organization was carrying on several test runs with a modified
        SCR-270 at this base. I had released a corner reflector and two balloons and was watching them in their flight
        as they drifted to the southeast from this base. While watching the balloons through a pair of ten power
        binoculars, a white object, appearing to be round, came into my field of vision, I followed the objects as far
        as possible but lost it within seconds after picking it up. The object was traveling at an unprecedented rate of
        speed and appeared to be several thousand feet over the top of the Sacramento mountain range, traveling in
        horizontal flight south to north ... it was definitely not a balloon and apparently not manned judging from the
        violent maneuvers which were performed at a high rate of speed</q> <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 2; and Gross, UFOs: A History  1947, pp. 62-63.</span>

    <h2> 3 September</h2>
    <p> On this day at 12:15 P.M. PST twelve to fifteen circular-shaped objects appeared high above Oswego, Oregon. Each
      of the strange craft were described as "very silvery in the afternoon sun." While such a report sounds like it
      might simply be a misidentification of aircraft or meteors, Intelligence officers could find no such solution.
      They became sufficiently impressed with the observation to list it as unidentified in the Air Force's record
      system of sightings started by 1948. As stated before, that classification was never lightly given and even
      exceptional cases such as the DC-3 encounter over Bethel, Alaska, did not receive such a discriminating
      designation <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 2, Case 85, listed as Incident #  51 in 1947 era documents</span>.

    <h2>12 September</h2>
    <p> Although most UFO reports in 1947 do describe saucer-shaped objects, nighttime lights again appeared on this
      date. This strange incident involved a Pan American flight eastbound from Midway Island to Cahu. Just after
      passing Necher Island at 1:00 A.M. local time, the crew spotted an intense incandescent white light off the
      starboard side of their aircraft. At first the pilot thought it might be the navigation lights of another plane,
      but it was far too bright for that. The flight crew tracked the unknown object and determined it held a true
      course of 350 degrees while holding at a steady altitude of 9,500 feet. </p>
    <p>The captain estimated its distance from their aircraft at five miles. But just as he took the plane off automatic
      pilot, the light approached within one mile. After that the UFO quickly veered off to a course of 190 degrees at
      which time the light split into two parts. The two separate orbs then changed to a less bright reddish hue and
      flew in a side-to-side formation until zooming out of sight at tremendous speed, estimated at over 1,000 miles per
      hour.</p>
    <p>Investigators calculated the total duration of the observation at only six seconds, but as any pilot will attest
      to, that is a long time when an unknown object is near your aircraft. Despite the brevity of the sighting, Naval
      Intelligence took a great deal of interest in the case. The pilots were interviewed by Naval officers who tried to
      find an astronomical solution to their unprecedented encounter but realized the pilots had good familiarity with
      meteor phenomena. The pilots told Navy officers that they were certain they had not seen a meteor because it
      consistently held a steady altitude. The captain of the flight had ten years flying experience with Pan American
      with 7,000 hours in the air, much of it over the Atlantic and Pacific air routes. His second officer had 1,700
      hours and eleven years of flying experience?four years of which were spent in B-24s flying East Coast training
      duty and combat missions in the South Pacific. Both pilots impressed intelligence officers as keen observers <span
