<p> The year following 1947 witnessed the formal activation of Project Sign. Unfortunately the heyday of Sign lasted but
  a brief period. Four specific case investigations during 1948 tell a great deal of the story of Alfred Loedding and
  his beloved Sign project. In fact, if ever there was a time in which a group of highly technical people sought answers
  to the complex UFO mystery, it was during that watershed period. In that year Loedding, Sneider, and other team
  members were literally looking for a sign to explain the events which had transpired during the past year?something to
  help explain the perplexing sightings of unusual aerial phenomena that were still occurring.</p>
<p>On January 7th, 1948, they thought they had one. On that day Kentucky Air National Guard pilot Captain Thomas F.
  Mantell, Jr. died when his F-51 fighter crashed southwest of Franklin, Kentucky, after intercepting a high flying UFO.
  Soon known as the Mantell Incident, the case is considered one of the most famous flying saucer stories of all
  time. </p>
<p>The fateful intercept began at 2:30 P.M. CST near Louisville after personnel of Fort Knox's Godman Air Field became
  concerned over the presence of a strange object overhead. It had been in sight since 1:45 P.M. when tower operator
  Sergeant Quinton Blackwell received a call alerting him to the UFO by the fort's security police. Tower commander
  Colonel Guy F. Hix later confirmed an unknown over the area along with Captain Gary Carter, also in the tower at the
  time. Carter, with the aid of 6 x 50 field glasses, described it as a round white object which appeared very high and
  at times seemed to hover. PFC Stanley Oliver, also in the tower, described the UFO more akin to a high altitude
  balloon, stating that it looked like "an ice cream cone topped with red." Others had a similar description, likening
  it to a "parachute with the bright sun shining on top of the silk" <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 2, Case 136, listed as Incident  33a-f in 1948 era documents; and "Statements by PFC Stanley Oliver,"  Case 136</span>.
</p>
<p>Hix really didn't know what to think but decided he would try to find out. About that time just such a means came to
  his disposal when Mantell's flight of four F-51 fighters neared Louisville on a return ferry mission from Marietta Air
  Base in Georgia. Hix asked the group to pursue and identify, although, one of the planes was running low on fuel so
  continued on to the flight's planned destination at Standiford AFB in northern Kentucky. The remaining three F-5 Is
  then began climbing as Mantell took the lead. At 2:45 P.M. Mantell gained visual contact with the UFO?stating that it
  was "in sight above and [a]head of me, and it appears to be moving at about half my speed or approximately 180 miles
  per hour." Already over 10,000 feet, Mantell led his flight still higher despite the fact they had no oxygen on board.
  Even as they approached the danger level of 15,000 feet, where no pilot is advised to fly without oxygen, Mantell
  pursued the UFO. He then reported: "It appears to be a metallic object or possibly a reflection of sun from a metallic
  object, and it is of tremendous size." Abruptly banking right, he continued his climb.</p>
<p>At 16,000 feet Mantell's right wingman, 1st Lieutenant Albert Clements,' tried to match the maneuver but started to
  fall behind. His other wingman, 2nd Lieutenant B.A. Hammond, also fell behind, becoming very concerned about their
  altitude. By that point they were over Bowling Green at 20,000 feet with Clements and Hammond quite a bit behind
  Mantell. The two wingmen had not yet seen the object nor were they even sure of what they were looking for. Mantell
  then radioed to them: "Look, there it is out there at 12 o'clock!" Clements could only "discern a bright-appearing
  object, very small, and so far away [that I was] unable to identify it as to size, shape, color ... Its position was
  slightly lower and to the left of the sun." Clements then urged his leader to level off and try to catch up with it
  from below. Mantell ignored the advice and radioed back that he wanted to follow it up to 25,000 feet for ten minutes
  and if he didn't get any closer, would then abandon the chase. Mantell then called Godman Tower around 3:15 P.M.,
  stating: "I'm still climbing, the object is above and ahead of me moving at about my speed or faster. I'm going to
  close in for a better look." </p>
<p>Those were the last words ever heard from Mantell. The two other planes had broken off at 22,500 feet and headed for
  Standiford. All they could see as they left was their flight leader above them in the sun, still stubbornly climbing
  higher. At around 25,000 feet heading south, Mantell had pushed his luck still further but lost. He blacked out from
  oxygen deprivation at about 3:17 P.M. as his plane continued to climb to 30,000 feet. At that altitude the aircraft
  lumbered over and entered a circling descent. Soon the plane began an uncorrectable looping power dive, breaking up
  between 20,000 and 10,000 feet. Mantell must have regained consciousness sometime before the crash because throttle,
  mixture, and prop-pitch were all altered to slow the aircraft. Unfortunately that attempt only served to over-stress
  the aircraft and may have caused its actual breakup <span class="source">Philip J. Klass, UFOs Explained (New York: Random House, 1974), pp.  34-37</span>.
</p>
<p> The aircraft crashed on the William J. Phillips farm outside Franklin, Kentucky, just 750 feet from the owner's
  house. Mantell's body was partially decapitated yet still inside the aircraft. It was not burned, radioactive, nor
  riddled with bullets as later sensationalized accounts claimed <span class="source">"Mantell Accident Report," Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 2, Case  136</span>.
  His watch, however, had stopped at 3:18 P.M., a minute or so before the aircraft had hit the ground. Godman Tower did
  not observe Mantell's crash, but kept sight of the UFO until 3:50 P.M., more than two hours since the sighting began.
  By that time Clements had refueled at Standiford and returned to the area but did not see anything unusual.</p>
<p> This now famous UFO case had actually begun earlier that day at 1:15 P.M. when state police received civilian
  reports of an odd flying object over Maysville, Kentucky (80 miles to the east of Louisville). Their report initially
  put Fort Knox police on alert which in turn placed Godman Tower on the lookout for a UFO. But unexplainably another
  sighting came at 1:35 P.M. west of Louisville and Godman Tower near Owensboro and Irvington. This report described a
  circular object about 250 to 300 feet in diameter. If correct, the UFO should have already passed the north edge of
  Godman field prior to their first sighting at 1:45 P.M. <span class="source">Case 136</span>. </p>
<p>That night more than a dozen AFB control towers around the Midwest reported UFOs "low on the horizon." The first
  sighting came from the Clinton County Air Base near Wilmington, Ohio, at 7:35 P.M. EST. There, officers described
  seeing a light that seemed to be "dancing" up and down as it changed color from red to green. It then abruptly left to
  the southwest with a trailing exhaust. Then, just to the southwest of Clinton near Columbus's Lockbourne Air Base,
  tower operators saw a brilliant light descend as it trailed an amber-colored exhaust. Appearing perfectly spherical or
  orb-like, the object proceeded to make three tight circling maneuvers as it passed over the entire base. The light
  next streaked up at tremendous velocity to abruptly stop at a stationary position below an overcast sky. Yet, it soon
  rapidly descended straight back down. Coming much closer to the ground, the orb hovered for ten seconds?only to rise
  straight back up once again. The mysterious light returned to a spot just below the clouds before it sped off to the
  northwest <span class="source">Loren E. Gross, UFOs: A History 1948 (Fremont, CA: By the Author,  1992), p. 6</span>.
</p>
<p>The Air Force publicly blamed the planet Venus as the cause for all of the series of sightings, including the
  daylight incident in Kentucky. In actuality, however, many of the intelligence officers in TID's Sign project were
  slowly becoming convinced UFOs were extraterrestrial in origin during the course of the long accident investigation
  that continued through April. Loedding and Sneider got the Venus idea from Dr. Hynek who had only offhandedly
  suggested the planet as one possible explanation. They, however, used it as a cover or a quick fix to explain away
  what, at the time, became a very widely publicized incident in the midst of what was obviously going to be a long
  investigation. Sign team members thought they might have to suggest a far more shocking conclusion, but not before
  they had the time to develop the theory.</p>
<p>Edward Ruppelt, head of a later UFO investigation named Project Blue Book, confirmed as much in his memoirs. He
  stated that many at TID had adopted the "interplanetary" option by the end of the investigation because all others
  were exhausted. For that reason the Sign staff, in Ruppelt's opinion, looked only for evidence suggesting "spaceships"
  and nothing else in the Mantell case. Not finding any, they stuck to the Venus excuse to keep it under wraps. A
  sighting of the planet Venus would serve that purpose as well as any, but in their haste they did not even bother to
  check to see if Venus would have been bright enough to have been visible by Mantell or Godman Tower.</p>
<p>Asking that question to Dr. Hynek in 1951 when Edward Ruppelt headed a reinvestigation of the case, they discovered
  that Venus would have been too dim to have been seen on the afternoon of January 7th. Ruppelt then discovered evidence
  suggesting that some or all of the Kentucky sightings could have been caused by a 100 foot diameter Navy "skyhook"
  research balloon released that morning at the Clinton County AFB in Ohio. Skyhooks were used for high altitude
  cosmic-ray research and were very secret at the time. He also discovered that the wind currents that day were right to
  take a skyhook over Kentucky, yet the best evidence was still to come. In the files, he read about two observers who
  just hours after the Louisville incident sighted a balloon. Both individuals, one in Kentucky and the other in
  Tennessee, had initially had their attention drawn skyward to what appeared to be a very unusual object to the naked
  eye, but then they easily identified it through their telescopes as a balloon <span class="source">Ruppelt, Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, p. 38</span>.
  It seemed the final proof, but despite Ruppelt's discovery, the Air Force never officially backed down from its
  unplausible celestial explanation and has thus caused newspapers and magazines to continually sensationalize the
  story. To this day the case's details are so distorted that it remains not only the most talked about of the "Classic
  cases," but the most confusing as well. </p>
<p>Yet Ruppelt's theory, although quite plausible, does leave serious questions unanswered. Mantell's last radio
  transmission clearly indicated the UFO was out-pacing his 400 mile per hour F-51. Skyhook balloons, even when caught
  in the jet stream cannot travel that fast. Of course if it was a skyhook, it could have been as high as 60,000 feet
  causing Mantell to only think it outperformed his fast plane when in actuality he was seeing something much higher and
  further away. That might explain why the object remained in view from Godman for over two hours. But Mantell did have
  2,867 flying hours, 67 of them in the F-51. He was a very experienced flyer and a veteran of the Normandy
  Invasion?having also won a Distinguished Flying Medal. He was also then operating his own flying school. At 22,000
  feet or higher could he not have recognized a high altitude balloon that should have resembled a cone-shaped object,
  much like ground observer PFC Oliver described?</p>

  </table><p>A close friend of Mantell went on record indicating that his friend had been a very cautious pilot and
  could not understand what would make him exceed the dangerous limit of 15,000 feet without oxygen. Even a flying cadet
  has the knowledge hammered into him at an early point that no one under any circumstances endangers himself or his
  aircraft by going above 15,000 feet without oxygen. Mantell's fellow pilot stated: "The only thing I can think was
  that he was after something that he believed to be more important than his life or family" <span class="source">Ibid., p.37</span>.
</p>
  <p>Two other amazing but less well known cases came into TID during the long Mantell investigation that further
    influenced the Sign team's opinion. One concerned a "flying wing" report from the Central Philippines. Filed by 1st
    Lieutenant Robert W. Meyers, the sighting took place on April 1st 1948 at 9:55 A.M. local time on a clear day with
    unlimited visibility as the experienced aviator led a flight of three P-47s of the 67th Fighter Group. Meyers was at
    1,500 feet when he noticed the unusual craft three miles east of his position. Shaped like a flying wing or
    "half-moon" with a "turtle back," the object resembled nothing then in the Pacific. The strange craft flew below him
    at about 1,000 feet and traveled around 200 miles per hour. He estimated its span to be 30 feet by 20 feet long,
    with an overall silver color. Meyers attempted to contact the other three aircraft in his group, but his radio went
    out.</p>
  <p>Finally, curiosity got the best of him, and Meyers decided to try to get a better look. He made a 240 degree left
    turn, but as he did the UFO made a 90 degree left turn and leveled out to accelerate away at great speed in a matter
    of only seconds. No sound, power units, landing gear, cockpit, or exhaust trails were detectable, but he did notice
    that the craft had a small dorsal fin <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 2, Case 122, no Incident # listed  in 1948 era documents for this case</span>.
  </p>
  <p>Loedding, with his knowledge and expertise of flying wing designs must have took a special interest in this case.
    He also had reports of Meyers reputation as a pilot. By all accounts Meyers was a "reliable, non-excitable
    individual who appeared quite positive about his statements." This, coupled with the fact that the Northrop Flying
    Wing (the XB-35 and YB-49 models) were the only aircraft anywhere in the world that met the characteristics of the
    craft he saw, made this a truly remarkable sighting <span
        class="source">USAF Museum Files, Wright-Patterson US AFB</span>. Because those aircraft never left the United
    States, the Sign team knew Meyers saw something of "foreign origin." But by then even the diehards in the project
    were becoming doubtful that such aircraft could be of Soviet construction. Loedding and a majority of the team
    therefore theorized by that spring that many of the UFO incidents could possibly represent something from outside
    this world <span class="note">Opinion of the authors</span>.</p>
  <p>A report that strengthened their position came just four days later. It involved three trained balloon observers
    from the Geophysics Lab Section at Holloman AFB, New Mexico. On April 5th they and project leader J.W. Peoples, were
    working on a secret project connected with the Air Force's Watson Laboratory field studies. In the middle of their
    tests they noticed a round white object with a golden hue fly very high over the base at "tremendous speed." The
    third man then briefly caught sight of a second UFO. One of the men described what he saw as an irregularly rounded
    craft, slightly concave on top. The duration of the incident only spanned 30 seconds, but in that time the unknown
    made at least one vertical loop and then disappeared westward.</p>
  <p>Although the knowledgeable balloon men said the object looked a lot like a balloon, they were certain that it was
    not because three facts discounted the possibility of a lighter-than-air object. First, its violent maneuvers
    surpassed the stress limits of any known balloon design then in use. Secondly, the high level winds up to 65,000
    feet were measured that day as coming from the west at only ten to fifteen miles per hour and no balloon flies
    against the wind. Finally, if high velocity winds were present, and they had blown from the east, a balloon could
    not attain such speeds even if caught in strong winds. The only fact that likened it to a balloon was that at no
    time could sound be detected nor could their sensitive 400-meter atmospheric noise receiver, then in operation,
    record any signal <span class="source">Project Blue Book Files, Roll No. 2, Case 139, listed as Incident  122 in 1948 era documents</span>.
  </p>
  <p> Highly trained aerial observers such as these carry a lot of weight in a UFO investigation. Alfred Loedding and an
    assistant from Clingerman's office, Lieutenant Colonel J.C. Beam, went out to New Mexico to investigate the case in
    person. Unfortunately, when they arrived Peoples and the other witnesses were away on other duty, but they were
    interviewed later at Watson Labs in New Jersey.</p>
  <p>Loedding and Beam did talk to a Lieutenant Markley while at Holloman. Markley indicated that unusual radar returns
    had been noted at the base. He also told them of a sighting he had in August of 1947 and observations of "flat,
    round aeroforms"on two other occasions. (See page 109.) Loedding and Beam took advantage of their trip to
    investigate another older case. They traveled to Phoenix, Arizona, and interviewed William A. Rhodes who had
    captured a heel-shaped flying disc on film on July 7th, 1947.</p>
  <p>After Peoples and the original observers in the Holloman incident were later interviewed at Watson Labs,
    investigators became personally convinced that they had seen something that flew "faster than any known object."
    Sign logged this case as the first of only seven unidentified sightings for <a href="../../../../4/8/index.html">1948</a>.
    Still very conservative with that designation, even incidents like the flying wing report from the Philippines did
    not make the unidentified list. This shows that even the biased Sign team gave out unidentified ratings very
    sparingly and despite modern day claims were not so obsessed by the extraterrestrial hypothesis as to have it affect
    their objectivity.</p>
  <p>Le <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/ChilesWhitted/index.html">4<sup>ème</sup> et plus important des
    événements</a> qui formèrent la position de Sign arriva le 24 juillet lorsque le vol 576 DC-3 des <em>Eastern

    ovni ! L'équipage effrayé était à 5000 pieds et à 20 miles au sud-ouest de Montgomery, en Alabama, lorsque l'objet
    inconnu arriva en trombe du nord-est. Il arriva aussi près que 700 pieds sur la droite de leur appareil à une

  </p>
  <p> Quickly becoming well-publicized, the now famous Chiles-Whitted Sighting remains one of the most notable of all
    UFO cases. In fact, right after the Eastern flight landed, the pilots reported their incident to the airline
    manager. Eastern then released the details of the spectacular event to newspapers that day. From there the story hit
    the national news, generating sensational headlines. These news accounts also reached the Pentagon and the new
    Intelligence Chief Major General Charles P. Cabell. Cabell had Dayton on the phone immediately, ordering Colonel
    McCoy to initiate a prompt investigation. By the afternoon of the 25th McCoy had Alfred Loedding, Albert Deyarmond,
    and Major Raymond Llewellyn on an Air Force plane headed to Atlanta. Losing no time, the Sign team quickly had
    Chiles and Whitted under interrogation on the 26th at the Henry Grudy Hotel. Loedding and Deyarmond questioned the
    pilots over and over and became impressed by the consistency of their accounts. Loedding and Deyarmond also became
    impressed by the military service of Chiles and Whitted and in particular Chiles' outstanding record in commercial
    aviation. In the meantime Llewellyn tracked down the lone passenger who had also seen the object. He had not
    actually been able to observe much, only commenting on the object's bright red-orange exhaust. A preliminary report
    was then sent to the Pentagon, and the team returned to Dayton more convinced than ever that something beyond human
    origin had been responsible for this and other incidents.</p>

      subject one way or the other <span class="source">Ruppelt, Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, pp. 40-41</span>.
    </p>
      <p>After the Chiles-Whitted Sighting, TID's Sign team sponsored, apparently under Loedding's sole authorship, a
        classified top secret document for inter-service distribution which traced the history of UFO investigations all
        the way back to the ghost rocket sightings of 1946. Like all such military evaluations involving a study up to a
        specific point in time, it received the term "estimate of the situation." The document has now become famous for
        the term. According to Ruppelt, this Estimate of the Situation reached a dramatic conclusion, stating that many
        of the UFO sightings investigated by Project Sign may be "interplanetary" in origin. Although the most startling
        part of the report advocated that the military should be put on an "alert footing" in the wake of the
        unexplainable sightings <span class="source">J. Alien Hynek, The UFO Report (New York: Barnes &amp; Noble Books,  1997), p. 4</span>

This Headquarters has also requested the  cooperation of the Departments of the Army and the Navy, and the Coast  Guard, in instructing their installations along the same lines."</span>.
      </p>
      <p>Needless to say the report drew considerable attention as it went up through the chain of command and passed by
        Air Force scientific advisors?all the way to Chief of Staff, General Hoyt Vandenberg.</p>
      <p> Vandenberg, however, refused to have it distributed due to what he saw as a lack of any physical evidence to
        support their conclusion. He and other top brass were just not ready to go on record with such a fantastic
        position without hard proof?physical proof. And that was the one thing no Sign officer could provide no matter
        how hard he wished he could. Correspondence of this time shows Pentagon officials were also mindful of the panic
        caused by the radio broadcast The War of the Worlds on October 30, 1938 <span class="note">It is interesting to note that at the height of the UFO wave in the  summer of 1947, Welles made a very amusing statement to the press: <q>Orson Welles said today  he'd bet  10 to  one that the "flying saucers" will fizzle into fancy just like his  "invasion from Mars" broadcast that fooled the nation in 1938.  "I want everybody to know that I didn't have anything to do with this  saucer hoax," though. He added, "I scared the shirts off Americans  once. That was enough." The actor-producer-director-writer, currently filming 'Macbeth,'  pointed out that during his famed radio dramatization many Americans  reported seeing space ships landing. Others claimed they saw armies of  Martians.  "People are imaginative and gullible," said Welles. "Nine years ago  they believed they saw Martians and now they see strange objects in the  sky and think they're flying saucers."  "But in case they do turn out to be from Mars," he grinned, "I've been  predicting that sort of thing for a long time."?Toronto, Canada, Daily  Tribune, 8 July 1947</q></span>.
      </p>
      <p>Because of the panic generated from that incident, no general would have wanted to answer to the President if
        an Air Force press release about UFOs had led to a similar disaster. Vandenberg, a decorated commander from WW
        II and a career military officer, intended to focus all of his efforts on organizing and building up the image
        of the new USAF. Even if UFOs were from another planet, Estimate conceded that they could not prove a direct
        threat to national security, and thus the Pentagon chose a wait and see attitude <span class="source">Ruppelt, Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, pp. 41-46; and  Jacobs, The UFO Controversy In America (Bloomington, IN: Indiana  University Press, 1975), pp. 57, 95, 103, 212</span>.
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Vandenberg's official lack of interest in TID's Estimate led to low morale among Project Sign
        staff. Despite a trip to the Pentagon by Sign team members Lawrence Truettner, Albert Deyarmond, and Alfred
        Loedding to lobby for Estimate, the Pentagon refused to be swayed into sanctioning the document <span
            class="source">Correspondence with Professor Michael Swords</span>. No matter the significance of their
        conclusion, Sign could not share their opinions outside TID <span class="source">Interview with Professor Michael Swords</span>.
      </p>
      <p>Only a handful of the thick, black-covered, legal-sized Estimate reports were ever reproduced, and those were
        soon ordered burned. A few copies apparently survived up until 1951 when Ruppelt reviewed the intelligence
        files. He claimed that by that time the report had been declassified, but this is unlikely when one considers
        its conclusions and the fact that no copy of Estimate has ever surfaced. But, Ruppelt did claim to see the
        document with his own eyes. If any copies of Estimate survived beyond that point, they probably were taken as
        souvenirs along with some other early files known to have met that fate. Today they may very well be collecting
        dust in someone's attic. Some researchers erroneously claim that Air Intelligence Report Number 100-203-79,
        "Analysis of Flying Object Incidents in the United States," a joint study by the USAF Directorate of
        Intelligence (DI) and the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) approved on December 10, 1948, and declassified in
        March 5, 1985, is a modified version of Estimate <span class="source">"Air Intelligence Report No. 100-203-79, Analysis of Flying Object  Incidents in the US, Air Intelligence Division Study No. 203, 10  December 1948, Directorate of Intelligence and Office of Naval  Intelligence," USAF Directorate of Intelligence, Central Intelligence  Files: Top Secret Control #2-7341, National Archives II, College Park,  Maryland</span>.
        Although the Navy sent a letter to the USAF in January of 1948 desiring to assist in the analysis of UFOs, their
        subsequent joint study superseded Estimate which was only an estimate of the situation up to the time that Sign
        submitted it <span class="source">Thanks here goes to Jan L. Aldrich's expertise in the analysis of  declassified documents. He convincingly suggests that because the USAF  Directorate of Intelligence is superior in authority to TID and Sign,  that their jointly sponsored study with the Navy simply superseded  Estimate. Thus Air Intelligence Report No. 100-203-79, is not a "ghost  version of Estimate" as suggested by other researchers but a uniquely  different document. </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Air Intelligence Report Number 100-203-79 is an amazing document in its own right. It is so
        notable because its main conclusion suggested that a number of UFO events had a high probability of being the
        result of Soviet activity. In fact, a later Blue Book officer, Dewey Fournet, urged that this document be kept
        classified because even in 1952 he and others (although open-minded to an extraterrestrial explanation) still
        felt that the Soviets may be responsible for many of the incidents <span class="source">Bruce Maccabee, "Notes on Air Intelligence Report 100-203-79:10  December 48, Top Secret, Declassified 5 March 1955 by Mr. Thompson (1),  head of declassification," (Silver Springs, Maryland: Privately  published, 26 March 85), p. 1. </span>.
        This is of such significance because today, with the opening-up of former Soviet records, historians now know
        that the USSR never flew spy missions over the United States with aircraft or guided missiles.</p>
      <p>Dewey Fournet also made the statement that somewhere in the files awaiting declassification is a copy of Sign's
        Estimate. (He actually had a chance to see it as he did 100-203-79) <span class="source">Letters to Jim Melesciuc from Dewey Fournet, 23 May, 27 July, 1992,  CUFOS files. </span>.
        It could be true. The National Archives has a nightmarish amount of former military files, some of which are no
        longer classified, but whose content has literally been lost because they are buried in virtual mountains of
        document clutter. Anyone who has ever waited at any one of the National Archives' facilities will attest that it
        can take hours just to have the material in the catalog tracked down.</p>
      <p> Who knows what is lost in that vast government paper shuffle not to mention the material still classified? So
        many government documents have accumulated that some 100 million are still awaiting declassification from WWI
        alone. Others predating just 1960 number over a billion pages of material. Even making a brief study of these
        could take teams of researchers a lifetime. </p>
      <p>Although Dr. Hynek confirmed in the 1970s that Estimate did exist as Ruppelt and Fournet claimed, Ruppelt's
        book is the only first hand account we have of the draft and merely teases us with a few of its points <span
            class="note">This author has had the opportunity to view Ruppelt's unedited  manuscript of Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, and it does list  additional cases discussed in Estimate, but gives no further  information on the document</span>.
        One interesting passage suggests that the Air Force had an interest in UFOs before 1947 and that the English had
        actually tracked some of the "Ghost Rockets" in 1946 on radar. 25 If so, this would contradict the Air Force's
        consistent refusal to this very day to recognize the phenomena's existence before June 24, 1947.</p>
      <p>Donald Loedding clearly remembers the controversy surrounding the rejection of his father's "Estimate of the
        Situation" draft to General Vandenberg and the resulting deep disappointment by his father. Donald had the
        impression that Alfred Loedding, who had been a rising star at Wright Field, officially fell from favor as a
        result of his personal belief that many of the flying disc sightings could represent craft of extraterrestrial
        origin. When he personally authored that carefully reached conclusion in the "Estimate" draft, Loedding severely
        hurt his career.</p>
      <p>Researchers know that with the end of 1948 a drastic change took place in Project Sign. The great sense of
        importance that the Pentagon had previously bestowed on the project suddenly ceased. Dropped almost overnight,
        it happened in the midst of one of the most unsettling series of UFO sightings over American military bases then
        to date. By mid-1949 the leaders of the project like Sneider and Loedding would be ousted and, barring a period
        in the early 1950s, the AMC staff would never again openly talk about the origin of UFOs. Perhaps the extreme
        conclusions of the Estimate draft and the summary of the Project Sign final report (drawn up in late 1948 by
        Truettner and Deyarmond, and finished in February 1949) became just too much for the Pentagon to handle. Titled
        Unidentified Aerial Objects?Project Sign, a great deal can be interpreted by reading between the lines of the
        passages of that final report.</p>
      <p>Even the introductory passages are important because they use some very interesting phrases. In the Foreword,
        for example, the Rand study is mentioned along with the intent to explore the possibility that some observed
        objects may represent "spaceships" or "satellite vehicles." (On July 21st the Pentagon had ordered a study to be
        made by the Rand Corporation to evaluate that possibility) <span class="source">Ruppelt, Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, p. 40</span>.
        This is stunning terminology regarding the Rand study because everyone who would have then read that report knew
        full well that not only did the United States not possess anything that could attain earth orbit, neither did
        the Soviets. In fact, it would be nine years before such an event occurred with Sputnik?considered much ahead of
        its time then.</p>
      <p>The Introduction of the Sign final report has another intriguing passage. In the second paragraph it clearly
        states that this report is not a final estimate of the situation. This may very well have been a way of stating
        that the Sign report was not able to draw the conclusions it did in Loedding's Estimate of the situation.</p>
      <p>Another sentence in the final report also seems to draw something from the earlier Estimate report when it
        speaks of assessing the possibility of a threat to national security presented by "such large numbers of
        unidentified flying objects." In the original Estimate report, Dr. Hynek confirmed that the Sign team called for
        an official UFO alert to be proclaimed?somewhat as was actually issued late that fall. Therefore, although the
        Pentagon always outwardly ignored the UFO situation by stating that no threat was presented to national
        security?the fear was clearly there.</p>
      <p>Aside from that, the sentence is also of note because for the first time the term unidentified flying object is
        used. The summary again uses that phrase and speaks of The Books of Charles Fort, which was one of the first
        works detailing unusual aerial phenomena in earlier times. This is significant because officially the Air Force
        has always refused to recognize the UFO phenomenon before June of 1947. One wonders how much discussion of this
        was present in the Estimate draft.</p>
      <p>Many more pages follow the introductory pages, including an appendix by James E. Lipp of the Rand Corporation
        that contained the conclusions of their contracted study. It actually considered the possibility that UFOs could
        originate from either Venus or Mars. (Prior to NASA's planetary probes in the 1960s and '70s even reputable
        scientists openly considered without ridicule the possibility that civilizations could exist in our own solar
        system.) Travel from other star systems, however, was considered improbable even then because Lipp's report
        stated that "the actions attributed to the 'flying objects' reported during 1947 and 1948 seem inconsistent with
        space travel [because of the vast distances between stars]."</p>
      <p>The report was released only to specific government and military offices as the ominous end of Sign came when
        the Air Force changed the name of Project Sign to Project Grudge at the request of the Director of Research and
        Development. Officially indexed as the "Detailed Study of Flying Discs," Grudge marked a sudden attitude change
        in UFO investigations. That revised project began in 1949 by building a public relations campaign to downplay
        UFO sightings <span class="source">David Michael Jacobs, The UFO Controversy In America (Bloomington,  IN: Indiana University Press, 1975), p. 50</span>.
      </p>
      <p>At the same time the elite of the TID intelligence officers, almost all of which had gravitated to Project
        Sign, were on their way out. Ruppelt wrote that many in intelligence "drastically and hurriedly changed their
        minds about UFOs when they thought the Pentagon was no longer sympathetic to the UFO cause." He stated that
        others who had not changed their minds were "purged." Other officers who had even briefly considered the
        extraterrestrial hypothesis eventually found themselves replaced by new personnel. The Pentagon used Grudge to
        "put an end to UFO reports" by explaining every sighting and telling the public just how the Air Force used
        expert investigation methods to reach their conclusions. This sudden change in policy was so pronounced that
        Ruppelt wondered if there was not some hidden reason behind it. He wrote of an underlying feeling he had when
        taking over UFO investigations in 1951: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><q>This period of mind changing bothered me. Here were people deciding that there was nothing to this UFO
          business right at a time when the reports seemed to be getting better?maybe I was just playing the front man
          to a big cover-up. I didn't like it because if somebody above me knew that UFOs were really spacecraft, I
          could make a big fool out of myself if the truth came out" </q><span class="source">Ruppelt, Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, pp. 58-60</span>.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p> Dr. Hynek also spoke of that period in his writings. He described this change at TID as occurring virtually
        overnight. Donald Loedding confirms that Alfred Loedding was "fired" from Project Sign by 1949 as a result of
        his position. Although he did remain in Dayton doing work for the Air Force until 1951, the pressure
        continued.</p>
      <p>Donald feels that officials at AMC attempted to "phase his father out" as is often done in the corporate world.
        Records do show, in fact, that Alfred Loedding's efficiency rating reports went from excellent in 1948 to lower
        and lower grades until he resigned on February 16th, 1951. At that time Loedding secured a job as director of
        jet research at Unexcelled Chemical Corporation in Cranbury, New Jersey. After Vandenberg's death in 1954,
        Alfred Loedding once again found the Air Force interested in his skills. In 1955 Loedding returned to Dayton and
        Wright-Patterson AFB. By 1960 he was working out of Langley AFB in Virginia as the Air Force's liaison officer
        to NASA. The records indicate that he served only as a civilian consultant in that role, but the implication
        posed by his family is that there may have been a connection with CIA headquarters at Langley. But from 1951
        until his death in 1963, Loedding, according to Donald, never again worked on or talked about UFOs?so deep was
        his disappointment and disgust with being "fired" from Project Sign for his views.</p>
      <p>Alfred C. Loedding was of strong German descent, ingrained with a high moral work ethic and dedication to
        family and country?the United States of America. When Loedding helped draft the Sign position on the
        extraterrestrial thesis, he did so with great thought and devotion. Vandenberg's rebuff severely hurt Loedding's
        pride. Also professionally injured at the time by his views, Loedding never again became involved in UFO
        research. Another man may have compromised his stand, especially when it clearly affected his career for the
        worse. But Loedding was too dedicated and true to himself to be a "yes man." Thus, the worst that can be said
        about Alfred Loedding is that he was not a diplomat as later Blue Book notables Edward Ruppelt and Robert Friend
        were. As a result, Loedding's time in ufology was brief but very notable <span class="source">Great thanks goes to Donald and Fred Loedding for the time that  they  devoted to the authors' research</span>.
