<section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p> The collection of predictions that is presented here arose out of long study of the UFO phenomenon. Most of them
    were sought out in the early <a href="../../../8">1980s</a> during a period when I was interested in the application
    of Murphy's law to UFO study. I had intended it as a chapter of a book I was writing. During a bout of nostalgia I
    recently reread it and decided to update it. One motive was a realization that this information constitutes a
    fascinating measure for assessing the nature of the UFO phenomenon and the quality of our collective thinking about
    it. It is sometimes said that theories about it are unfalsifiable, yet there is obviously a body of discourse here
    which not only can be falsified; it has been.
  </p>
  <p> It will be noticed that this collection contains references to something known as Fetridge's Law. It was an
    important feature of the original study and I have decided to retain it. Fetridge's Law derives from an unfortunate
    fellow named Fetridge who ambitiously decided to do a live broadcast of the return of the swallows to Capastrano.
    The swallows were known to infallibly return each year to that town on a certain date. Of course, that year the
    swallows decided to procrastinate. The dictum learned from this debacle states, "Important things that are supposed
    to happen do not happen, especially when people are watching you."
  </p>
  <p> The UFO phenomenon follows this law with almost spooky conscientiousness. The few predictions that do come true in
    this collection are always about basically unimportant things happening or important things not happening.
    Unbelievers tend to have a better success rate than believers, but that seems to be largely because their
    predictions tend to be of a modest and forgettable form like the UFO phenomenon behaving more or less as it always
    has with no high consequences. When they get a little ambitious, they get cut down as well.
  </p>
  <p> I make no claim this collection is exhaustive. There are doubtless many other predictions out there that I missed
    or forgot about simply because virtually nobody can read and digest the whole UFO literature. There is an obvious
    bias towards items predating the Eighties. I read much less of the literature nowadays. I state this merely to warn
    people against seeing a trend of predictions getting fewer ergo people are wising up. That is doubtless wrong. I
    also tended to avoid predictions from psychics and tabloids. I favored proclamations from ufologists and individuals
    claiming direct contact with aliens. For those who argue the UFO phenomenon extends back through history, a few
    predictions associated with ancient astronauts are included to demonstrate the ubiquity of Fetridge's Law.
  </p>
  <p> Though imperfect, this collection is large enough and representative enough to derive a number of solid
    conclusions and recommendations. The aliens in the UFO phenomenon, be they those of contactees or abductees, do not
    give accurate information about the future, particularly when the information concerns matters of great concern like
    the destruction of the planet, war, or profound changes in society. Whether this indicates deception, folly, or mere
    error can be argued about, but the basic upshot is that their pronouncements deserve no more weight than the opinion
    of an average man in the street. Theories by ufologists, particularly those derived from the ETH
    (UFOs=extraterrestrials), have a poor track record and can be considered falsified in the sense of showing
    trustworthy or practical results. You can safely ignore aliens and ufologists in figuring out how to live your life.
    When they say the world will end, don't end your own. The historical record gives you ample precedents to judge them
    as unworthy of your attention.

  <h2>What I Saw After I Waited</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>"I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate from the tower of Syrene even unto the border of
      Ethiopia. No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be
      inhabited 40 years." Ezekiel 29: 10-11. Less ostentatiously, Ezekiel also prophesied Tyre would be taken by
      Nebuchadnezzar and trodden down by horses and chariots, never to be rebuilt. Nebuchadnezzar never destroyed Tyre
      and the city flourished for centuries. St. Jerome of the fourth century professed astonishment at Ezekiel's
      prophecy failing so utterly.
    </li>
    <li> Doxographic sources ascribe to the early Pythagoreans, among them the cosmographer Philolaus, belief in the
      moon being inhabited all over by big, beautiful animals and plants. "The animals in their virtue and energy are
      fifteen degrees superior to ours (and) emit nothing excrementious." There was believed to be a danger of their
      destruction by means of a weather catastrophe involving suffocation in the glassified, cool water element of the
      moon-heaven. It is suspected this cosmic catastrophe was being predicted to occur at the end of a world period
      such as that found in Babylonian and Indian religions. Even allowing an ambiguity of a few thousand years for
      expiration, this prediction can be declared impossible by virtue of the failure of the Greek system of
      teleological physics.
    </li>
    <li>"What retribution thou dost destine for the two sides, O Wise One, by thy bright fire and by molten metal, give
      a sign of it to souls, to bring harm to the wicked, advantage to the just." Thus spoke Zarathustra (628-551 B.C.)
      in the Persian text <i>Yasna.</i> Zarathustra was hoping for the imminent transfiguration of the world, the
      renewal of existence. Good was to totally triumph over evil by the will of Ahura Mazda. Zarathustra's proclamation
      of imminent eschaton was among the first to depart from the cosmic cycles predominant in preceding religions.
      Zarathustra has been considered a contactee in <i>Oahspe.</i></li>
    <li> Roman writers such a Pliny, Lydus, and Obsequens spoke of flying shields and their aerial kin as portents of
      future evils and worldly disorders. Joannes Lydus treats UFOs in prophetic terms in <em>De Ostentis. </em>When
      they moved east to west it was said to foretell "a future movement of the hated Parthians." North to south
      movements signaled thunderstorms.
    </li>
    <li> Deferring to that faction of UFO study that advocates the contactee status of Jesus, we enter him because some
      theologians, especially those following the studies of Albert Schweitzer, feel his prophecy that the Kingdom was
      "at hand" was central to his ministry. Matthew 10:7. Its subsequent failure prompted some interesting hedging by
      his disciples.
    </li>
    <li>April 14, 1561. The Nuremberg Broadsheet illustrates a "dreadful apparition" of crosses and rods and globes
      fighting vehemently among themselves in the morning sky till they fell from the sun down upon the earth where they
      burned and wasted away with immense smoke. Its author warns against ridiculing these high signs or "God may send
      us a frightful punishment on account of our ungratefulness." By this reasoning, "the God-fearing will by no means
      discard these signs, but will take it to heart as a warning of their merciful Father in heaven, will mend their
      lives and faithfully beg God, that he avert His wrath, including the well-deserved punishment, on us, so that we
      may, temporarily here and perpetually there, live as His children." The Nuremberg apparition would have been more
      timely had it preceded that century's violence rather than follow it.
    </li>
    <li> Emanuel Swedenborg was strongly driven by a millenarian impulse that held the Christian Church was due to be
      overthrown. He taught that the Flood ended the Most Ancient Church and the Crucifixion ended the Ancient
      Representative Church. The third judgment, prophesied by Christ and foretold in Revelations, would usher in a new
      age. The many evils of his age he catalogued in his <i>Spiritual Diary</i> served to confirm to him his
      expectation of Apocalypse. Swedenborg felt The Last Judgment occurred in 1757 in the world of man's spirit, but
      the state of the mundane world admittedly had not changed outwardly. Swedenborg has been credited with more
      material prophecies such as the Stockholm fire of 1759, but these accounts are not first-hand and have debatable
      worth.
    </li>
    <li> November 17, 1896. One of the first sightings of the Airship Mystery includes a comment by the operator of an
      airship that almost hits a tower on a brewery. "We will get to San Francisco about half-past 12," was what R.L.
      Lowery overheard. If they got there, nobody noticed. Sacramento district attorney, Frank D. Ryan, surmised the
      signs and wonders meant the advent of the millennium. A letter to the <em>Stockton Evening Mail</em> a couple days
      later theorized whimsically, "It is probable that in a short time (the Martian Lord Commissioner's) ambassador
      will make a call on the President," but it was waiting for McKinley to take charge of things.
    </li>
    <li> April 9, 1897. An encounter between James Southard and the occupants of an airship in Nebraska reveals an
      intention to destroy the Spanish Navy within the week.
    </li>
    <li> A.C. Clinton, alleging to be an airship inventor, promises to appear before the directors of the Omaha
      Trans-Mississippi Exhibition on April 17, 1897 and demonstrate his craft. Similarly, guys descended from the ten
      lost tribes of Israel in the North Pole area claimed they would appear at the Nashville Exposition on June 18 and
      19. This was according to Judge Love and his fishing partner, Mr. Beatty of Waxachiw, Texas. Neither airship
      exhibited themselves.
    </li>
    <li> The prophecy received from the Virgin at Fatima contained an assurance World War 1 would end that very day,
      October 13, 1917. Some accounts misreport the prophecy as being about Communism.
    </li>
    <li> Eros Urides, a Martian communicating through a medium in 1920, predicted a great awakening for the earth and
      promised communication with Mars and other planets would be "realized in a short time."
    </li>
    <li> During the mediumship of George Valiantine a prophecy came through that the Martians would get through to us
      before we got through to them. They were saying, in the 20s, this would happen before long and, incidentally, they
      were already trying to communicate with us.
    </li>
    <li> Kenneth Arnold, after his sighting, received media attention and got a call from a Texas preacher who was
      getting his flock ready for the end of the world because the saucers were harbingers of doomsday.
    </li>
    <li> Reverend Lester Carlson, pastor of a La Grande, Oregon tabernacle, was witness to a flying saucer on June 27,
      1947 and was led to predict the end of the world also.
    </li>
    <li> M.F.S. Hehr, who was in contact with Venus, reports saucers were manned by Atlanteans in training "for the
      salvage work necessary in 1960." Persons and material must be collected for the restart of civilization.
    </li>
    <li> The national commander-in-chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Louis E. Starr, of Portland, Oregon, revealed
      on July 5, 1947 he was momentarily expecting word from Washington which would "help explain the discs." A telegram
      concerning the "fleets of flying saucers" was due 3 p.m. EST, but it apparently never arrived.
    </li>
    <li>"Saucers were all a part of a prophecy - one of the things man was to see and not understand," explained an
      elderly Negro man to Louisiana governor Jimmie H. Davis. "The time was not distant when the world would know no
      seasons - winter will come in summer, spring in fall, and fall in spring - men will walk before they crawl, cotton
      will open before it blooms, the watermelon will come before the vine. The governor commented, "The watermelon
      thing I gotta see."
    </li>
    <li> Speaking of the saucer craze in July 1947, Orson Welles said, "I'll bet ten to one this will fizzle out." <em>Newsweek</em>
      also assigns them a premature burial with an item titled "Broken Saucers." It lamented, "As quickly as they had
      arrived, the saucers disappeared into the limbo of all good hot weather stories."
    </li>
    <li> Donald Keyhoe, in his historically important article for <em>True</em> magazine in January 1950 intimated we
      might get a surprise revelation like contact by spacemen in 1950. Keyhoe also noted that since saucers showed peak
      activity in July 1947 and July 1948, we could expect it to peak again in July 1950. (No. It peaked in March that
      year.)
    </li>
    <li> March 9, 1950. Mexico's government newspaper <em>El Nacional</em> quoted a Mexican scientist as saying his
      claim that flying saucers carry visitors from Mars would be confirmed in the near future.
    </li>
    <li>"The official explanation may be imminent." --Donald Keyhoe, 1950, in his book <em>The Flying Saucers are
      Real.</em></li>
    <li> Mr. Silas Newton, infamous from the Scully hoax, prognosticated that saucers soon would land on the Earth,
      because they had nearly completed their survey. The date might be winter 1950, or at least by the fall of 1951.
    </li>
    <li><em>Is Another World Watching? </em>was Gerald Heard's question titling one of the first books to appear on the
      saucer mystery. Heard speculated Martians were concerned our A-bombs might blast Earth into a cloud of dust which
      would yield a nuclear winter on their world. Inversely, they might also be concerned the bombs would accelerate
      sunspot growth such that an X-ray summer would follow or even, physics forbid, a nova.
    </li>
    <li> In February 1951 Keyhoe predicted an upswing in UFO activity for the spring of 1951 due to scheduled atom bomb
      tests near Las Vegas, Nevada. (No.)
    </li>
    <li> Lonzo Dove, Chief Astronomer of the IFSB, advanced one of the droller claims of having made a successful
      prediction. Dove was floating a Martian launch theory derived from prior saucer sighting dates and charted a 1952
      arrival date for the space armada between April 14 and 16. On the 16th, Dove felt he had been vindicated when he
      photographed "a huge cloud 30 miles in diameter and 15 miles up in the sky, a double track a mile wide." He found
      added significance in the simultaneous appearance of an "equally abnormal double cloud" hanging some 60 to 90
      miles over a region of Mars.
    </li>
    <li> Walter Winchell, the columnist, announced on June 30, 1952 that "Scientist at Palomar Observatory, California
      are supposed to have seen a 'space ship' land in the Mojave Desert, in May last. Four persons stepped out, took
      one look, and went off again. The U.S. Army may officially announce it in the fall." (No.)
    </li>
    <li>"Within the next few days, they're going to blow up and you're going to have the granddaddy of all UFO
      sightings. The sighting will occur in Washington or New York - probably Washington." A few days later the great
      Washington National flap began. The timing is indeed uncanny and it has the impressive distinction of having been
      made to the head of Project Blue Book. The scientist based this on a buildup of UFO cases then happening on the
      East Coast. The scientist was unnamed however because of security reasons. Nobody gets credit. Funny how that
      works.
    </li>
    <li> Writing for <em>Look </em>magazine in 1952, Donald Menzel put forward his mirage explanation for certain UFO
      sightings and concluded triumphantly, "I believe these experiments will eventually cause the saucer scare to
      vanish - most appropriately into thin air, the region that gave birth to it." A less sanguine colleague, Urner
      Liddel, penned remarks for the Optical Society of America that proved better grounded. "I have no delusions that
      all 'explanations' which may be given will stop the flood of saucer stories. They are but facets of this stage of
      history. People believe what they want to believe - not necessarily what is true."
    </li>
    <li> Readers responding to a major article in <em>Life</em> magazine in the summer of 1952 gave editors the
      impression that they were resigned to visitations from space and they expected a landing momentarily.
    </li>
    <li> In January 1953, Edgar L. Plunkett predicted we were on the verge of a breathtaking discovery with respect to
      saucers.
    </li>
    <li> Between January 14-18, 1953 the Robertson Panel predicted UFO sightings would "increase again this summer."
      (No.)
    </li>
    <li> In April 1953, Albert K. Bender editorializes on natural disasters he sees wreaking havoc and predicts a pole
      shift may be due in 1953.
    </li>
    <li> In July 1953 Edgar R. Jarrold, President of Australian Flying Saucer Bureau suggested saucers occur in two-year
      cycles and might be connected to Mars in some way. Because Mars would be even closer in future oppositions, he
      said we should anticipate greater number of sightings in 1954 (No) and 1956 (No). The years 1953 and 1955 should
      be fairly light ones. (Yes &amp; Yes) In fairness, 1954 saw a heavy flap in France, but not here.
    </li>
    <li> Max B. Miller of Flying Saucers International interpreted Nostradamus as predicting for 1953 "A third world war
      will come to the world. A great ship from another world of higher intelligence shall land and intervene."
    </li>
    <li> Donald Keyhoe hoped his book <em>Flying Saucers from Outer Space </em>would prepare Americans for the "final
      act of the saucer drama." He termed 1954 a "possibly fateful year" in which Russians could stage a mass A-bomb
      attack by paralyzing defense efforts with rumors that alien machines were actually secret Red weapons.
    </li>
    <li> E.R. Chamberlin, in his study <em>AntiChrist and the Millennium </em>singles out the first contactee work,
      George Hunt Williamson's <em>The Saucers Speak</em>, as a technological dispensation of the millennial impulse.
      Telepathic communications with Saturn's tribunal established "A new Golden Age is about to be ready to be born on
      the earth." It was understood that a fleet of Martian spacecraft would arrive in 1956. Chamberlin observes, "In
      the 1963 edition of the book, the author speculated that the fleet may, in fact, have arrived as promised - but in
      secret, a curious echo of Charles Russell's belief that Christ arrived in 1874 - invisibly."
    </li>
    <li> The Yada proclaimed in 1953 that the discs portend the expansion of the sun into a <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/Supernova.html">supernova</a>, the heating and crystallization of the
      understrata of the earth under increasing cosmic radiation, and the forming of hollows in the Earth.
    </li>
    <li> Three Men-in-Black told Albert K. Bender in September 1953 that the U.S. Government would reveal the secret of
      the UFOs in either 5 months or 4 years. A 1976 prediction by Bender stating, "In 1977 something spectacular will
      take place involving space" fared no better.
    </li>
    <li> In 1953, a pair of miners reasoned that since flying discs had appeared at Brush Creek, California on April 20,
      May 20, and June 20, it might reappear on July 20. John Black's June encounter had been so close he even saw the
      pilot - a little guy dressed in green trousers, a tie, a jacket, and a green cap. "He looked like someone who had
      never been out in the sun much." A crowd of over 200 people assembled in anticipation. It included cameramen from
      United Press Movietone and Telenews Corporation and a pair of telepaths. Someone attributed the no-show to
      bow-hunters being present.
    </li>
    <li> Orfeo Angelucci's alien friends were right about one thing: "There would be no mass contacts." Promises that
      their next campaign would be "more revealing than the one of 1952" seem less on target. Intelligence about atomic
      warfare with Russia being imminent, success over cancer arising, and Christ's reappearing soon can be deemed
      disinformation. There are a great many other predictions offered up in Angelucci's <em>Million Year
        Prophecy. </em>Those that have already expired include a Grand Committee of the world's finest humans coming
      into full flower by 1984, an exodus from an economically bust California in 1984, a subsequent turnaround for
      California by '75, George Wallace's Third Party becoming a might force by '72, the disproof of evolution in '69
      leading to its complete discrediting by 1999, and lastly, the mystery of life and the mystery of Sleep being known
      by 1980.
    </li>
    <li> July 28, 1954. Affa of Uranus passes along a message through contactee Francis Swan indicating, "This earth is
      really going to end as stated in the Holy Bible around 1956."
    </li>
    <li> In October 1954, James Moseley announced "The Flying Saucer Mystery - Solved." He had in his possession
      irrefutable documented evidence from a high official source solving the saucer saga. He promised it would "be
      presented in full in the November issue" of his publication <em>Saucer News. </em>In the next issue however he
      apologized and revealed only he was not permitted to publish the information and would not elaborate why.
      Eventually it did appear. In the June-July 1956 issue the solution was finally unveiled. Saucers were built by the
      "The Organization" - a super-secret group entirely separate from the U.S. Government. Their mission: "absorbing
      excess radioactivity in our atmosphere."
    </li>
    <li> Easily the best account of a failed prediction concerns the saga of Dr. Charles A Laughead and Mrs. Dorothy
      Martin that was chronicled in the famed sociological study <em>When Prophecy Failed. </em>It tells of the
      reception of a prophecy from Sananda of the planet Clarion. Chicago would be flooded at dawn on December 21, 1954.
      A great tilting of the American continent would follow it. Other continents would variously submerge or rise up. A
      group of believers in these teachings were to be picked up some time before the cataclysm. Phone calls from a
      Captain Video informed them the pickup time would be 4 P.M. on the 17th. These and other predictions never came to
      pass. "The cataclysm was stayed by the hand of the God of Earth." That excuse was a bit too pat for some believers
      and they left. Others stayed and stepped up their proselytizing efforts. Not one new convert was made however and
      circumstances caused a dispersal of the band of disciples. While the sociologists were correct in predicting
      increased proselytizing, their expressing a faith that the group would have grown under the publicity they
      received had not circumstances intervened, hints that the absence of converts ran counter to their expectations.
    </li>
    <li> By his own account, Aime Michel, in the spring of 1954, correctly predicted a wave would occur at the end of
      that summer. He then predicted a new wave would occur in eastern Europe or the Middle East near the end of 1956.
      (No)
    </li>
    <li> George Adamski's aliens suggested they were foretold by ancient prophecy as a sign of deliverance. His aliens
      acclaimed the approach of a Cosmic Age for the Earth, but they also warned a drastic tilt of the earth "could
      happen at any moment" and change the face of the planet. They were concerned this would alter the lanes in which
      they travel through space. In his final book, Adamski berates in no mealy terms the landing prophecies and
      evacuation promises of "phoney" contactees and attributes these "dubious" psychic messages to subconscious
      origins.
    </li>
    <li> Aliens informed George van Tassel that the explosion of the hydrogen bomb would "extinguish life on this
      planet." There was a clarification after this failed to happen that only the detonation of a "true" hydrogen bomb
      would do this. Bombs using deuterium and tritium isotopes didn't count.
    </li>
    <li> George Hunt Williamson, in <em>Other Worlds - Other Flesh,</em> indicates an event his space friends call the
      "Great Telling" must be getting close. On that day, millions of citizens would know "beyond the shadow of a doubt"
      that aliens exist because every device capable of receiving a message, from phones to radios, would be made to
      give their announcement of intent. It was going to happen soon because weird events in Canada proved they were
      running tests on earth equipment. These events consisted of radios turning themselves on and off, phones ringing
      with no one on the line, and automobile gauges that go wild - except when at the garage for repairs.
    </li>
    <li> Based on theories that saucers levitate through the action of sound, Desmond Leslie predicted that with more
      jets crashing through the sound barrier "soon an entire house will be raised and put down in another site." After
      authorities investigate this, science would soon be "well on the path to Adeptship in the dark arts."
    </li>
    <li> Harold T. Wilkins wrote in August 1955, "We cannot for one moment doubt that the artificial earth satellite to
      be launched within two years - by the United States and/or Soviet Russia - will definitely establish the existence
      of space ships in our atmosphere." Wilkins also hints that a Martian "Death Ceiling" is meant to prevent future
      lunar and interplanetary voyages by terrestrials.
    </li>
    <li> August 30, 1955. David Ankenbrandt was given one week to deliver a message to the government. "If there were
      any more wars here, 'they' would have to take over." He did not deliver it, even after he received a second visit
      emphasizing the matter. Blue Book found out anyway and, as the kid feared, they dismissed him as a head case.
    </li>
    <li> December 25, 1955. "The next war, if fought, will be on American soil. America will be destroyed, then
      civilization all over the world will be destroyed," according to Bucky of Venus.
    </li>
    <li> If free will does not prove our undoing, mankind will culminate his evolution by attaining the age of light and
      life wherein mortals will experience final fusion with divine Adjusters. This will take place in the safety of
      Morontia temples that can withstand the blazing glory that consumes and obliterates the physical body. Afterwards,
      evolution will proceed unto yet higher levels till the superuniverses settle into light and life and the totality
      of the grand universe will be perfected and its finite destiny fulfilled in the achievements of life, harmony,
      beauty, truth, and goodness. A Mighty Messenger temporarily assigned to Earth's Archangel Council says that after
      this most profound occurrence in the annals of eternity "There are those who hold the Supreme Being himself will
      emerge from the Havona mystery enshrouding his spirit person and will become residential on the headquarters of
      the seventh superuniverse as the almighty and experiential sovereign of the perfected creation of time and space."
      The timescale implied by the <em>Urantia Book</em> presumably forbids calling this a miss in our lifetime or in
      billions of years, but every consumer knows if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
    </li>
    <li> Truman Bethurum jotted down some impressions he received during his visits with the people of Clarion. These
      include the absence of atomic wars, a return to the soil via small farms and country estates, and the
      disappearance of class with equality for all. These are arguably correct in a small, measured degree, but there
      were other predictions much farther off the mark. Political partisanship was to disappear but did not. The third
      new President was to be female but was not. Battleships andbombers were not obsolete by 1980. Nations were not
      eager to settle their differences by 1961.<br/> Building for destruction multiplied horribly rather than ceased in
      the decades after Bethurum's contact. Space travel was to proceed after the elimination of greed, class, and race
      hatred. Lastly, and tragically, Bethurum was wrong in predicting the five-year-olds of 1955 would not have to
      carry guns into battle when they grew up. Vietnam happened.

    <li>"I wouldn't want to hazard a guess as to what the final outcome of the UFO investigation will be, but I am sure
      that within a few years there will be a proven answer." When Edward J. Ruppelt of Project Blue Book began, he was
      still divided over whether that answer would be the ETH or the "It's All Nonsense" theory. Eventually he entered
      the latter camp and warned that until we actually meet up with spacefolk, "we're stuck with our Space Age Myth -
      the UFO." He also predicted "Project Blue Book will live on." Blue Book is no longer with us though, in fairness,
      it did survive over a decade after Ruppelt wrote that. Whether there was a proven answer depends on whom you talk
      to.

    <li> Rolf Telano, engineer or whatever, predicted on January 23, 1956 that "<q>some great catastrophe is likely to
      take place very soon</q>." The magnitude and nearness are uncertain, but there would be relatively severe loss of
      life and property. It would manifest as a series of natural calamities like earthquakes and floods caused by
      ethereal stresses generated by atomic experiments and certain mental attitudes.
    </li>
    <li>In Morris K. Jessup's ufological study of the bible, a large section is devoted to a reinterpretation of the
      13th chapter of Mark. To Jessup it prophesied the coming of a shining powerful Mothership that will rescue the
      remnants of those who survive a cataclysm that might be either a pole shift, a meteor bombardment, or atomic
      holocaust. They would live for a time after this event in celestial regions. Jessup finds signs of the endtime in
      contemporary thermonuclear devastation by assigning its identity to the earthquakes in divers places mentioned by
      Mark. Developing a line of logic presuming Christ's prescience, Jessup figures "<q>if we have a margin of about a
        generation in which to anticipate destruction, then we can say roughly that something should be expected within
        a thirty year period starting sometime during the postwar decade. Should we say then, between 1950 and 1980?</q>"

    <li> Dino Kraspedon's alien contacts from Ganymede and Io revealed plans to study the effects of a monstrous
      celestial body that would soon become visible and catastrophically join our solar system towards the end of the

    <li> The first contact account after Sputnik was turned in by Reinhold O. Schmidt; the infamous contactee who would
      eventually be convicted of fraud in association with the promotion of quartz that saturnians claimed had healing
      properties. In the first meeting with Schmidt they spoke of planned satellite launches and warned "the first two
      will never leave the ground and the third will go up, but won't send back much data." Schmidt, writing in 1959,
      claimed this prophecy was proved. The nation will never forget the embarrassment of the Vanguard TV-3 blowing up
      on the launch pad on December 6, 1957. The second launch on January 31, 1958 however successfully put into orbit
      Explorer 1. It lived longer than later Explorer satellites and is not regarded as a disappointment by history. The
      third launch, TV-3B, flew 57 seconds before breaking up. What is curious about this affair is why Schmidt did not
      phony up his tale to be more historically accurate.

    <li>"Do you want to see a flying saucer?" the unusual stranger asked John Whitworth in his shop in Bedfordshire,
      England. John was game and drove to an isolated spot he was directed to. He was not disappointed. A year goes by

    <li> A warning of imminent attack by Venusians was relayed to UFO groups and VIPs around the world. All nuclear
      weapons and atomic energy plants would be destroyed. A world republic would be set up. For money you get a
      position in the new government. Karl Mekis, Venus Security Commissar and ex-Gestapo agent amassed $300,000 selling
      survival kits and graft. Postponements were issued and Mekis ended up serving time on 17 counts of fraud.

    <li> A little group at Point Reyes Station, California headed by an amusing, yet frightening dark-haired female
      believed extraterrestrials would transform their Inverness meetinghouse into a flying saucer when the world ended
      on April 22, 1959. The group inspired Phil Dick to write his novel <em>Confessions of a Crap Artist.</em></li>
    <li> Richard Hall disclosed a scientific evaluation of UFO flaps suggested that UFOs came from Venus. Expect a flap

    <li> Margit Mustapa did some dictation for a Venusian Brother around 1958 that revealed the Earth was "destined to
      become a sacred planet." The process would take some decades and would involve elimination of the self-pride of
      mankind. Thought reading would have to become common as well. One prediction now testable was that the children of
      her time would become representatives of a "new race" that would bring in a culture founded on fourth-dimensional
      thinking. To the extent this was connected with the inner man and his growth, it was arguably a correct
      prediction. To the extent these new age individuals should have felt increased spiritual speed and velocity in a
      vortex of radioactive love calling from the planet Venus, it appears certainly wrong. A later prediction that
      Mustapa relayed from Saint Germane also seems wrong: "An immediate release from the evil powers will be introduced
      during the Xmas time of 1959."
    </li>
    <li> The world-famous psychologist Carl Jung wrote his book <em>Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the
      Sky</em> as a warning that UFOs signaled the end of the Age of Pisces, i.e. the era of Christianity, and the
      changing of the "gods" attendant with a long-lasting transformation of the collective psyche that would lead to
      the Age of Aquarius. Well there was the Sixties radicalism and the death of god theology fad, but they were
      short-lived and Christianity seems firmly entrenched in American society now even as UFO belief continues as
      strong as ever.

    <li> Ray Stanford falls unconscious and a voice speaks through him. "Have your cameras ready: we are going to give
      you an opportunity in broad daylight to film extraterrestrial craft in the skies over Corpus Christi within eight
      days." Six days later, two cameras run by Stanford and a friend do manage to capture an image of an UFO or UFOs
      that they sight from Corpus Christi on the afternoon of July 29, 1959. The image on the films however lacks any
      identifiable structure because the UFO is too far away. Some opportunity. Next time, don't call us, we'll call
      you.

    <li>. In an emergency transmission from Master Aetheius to the Space Scientists of Earth, we were warned our
      behavior was being closely watched. "<q>Throw a bomb in to the Serene Face of the Moon, Earth, and you, will
        die!</q>" Ranger flights and Apollo boosters have been deliberately crashed into the Moon without apparent
      retaliation. More benevolently, they acclaimed, "<q>The time when a great beam of Understanding and Transmuting
        Light, which will be thrown deep into the foul, black, cancerous growth (of great conspirators from the centre
        of the Earth) is shortly due to come</q>."

    <li> Beings from a pure crystal Venus reveal to Ralph Lael in 1962 that man is on the verge of splitting the
      electron. Correct! Electron-positron annihilation is now a common research tool in nuclear physics. Lael spoiled
      the feat however by adding "<q>When he completes the process he could start a chain reaction that will blow up the
        whole planet</q>." Venusians said it happened once before when mankind used superweapons while on Pewam.

    <li>Richard Ogden passed along some predictions he received in mental communication with a scientist on Neptune. One
      includes the information the President would die in the first term. The President would be either Stevenson or
      Nixon. When Kennedy received the nomination, Ogden revised this to involve Kennedy. This becomes almost
      interesting, but is diluted further by the failure of his other predictions like the beginning of World War 3 in
      West Germany in 1966.

    <li>80. Using the theory that Martians time their arrivals with respect to the oppositions of Mars, Harry Lord of
      the Tynesdale UFO Society predicted flaps would occur in late '62/early '63 (No), early '65 (No), late '67 (Yes),
      late '69 (Way No!), and a large peak in late '72 (No). This looks worse than chance expectation.

    <li>Andy Sinatra, the Mystic barber of Brooklyn, revealed during a February 4, 1962 demonstration that if the
      Peoples of the World would not unite within 90 days "<q>terrible destructive forces</q>" would be released and
      probably lead to the toppling of the U.N. Building by his invisible army of Martians.

    <li>Daniel Fry's aliens indicated it would be at least 4 years before they adapted to our environment, but they
      added a loophole that existing political tensions would have to be eased before they made a mass landing. Fry to

    <li>Gary Wilcox, a dairy farmer in Newark Valley, New York encountered two UFO beings on April 24, 1964 who
      mentioned that astronauts Glenn and Grissom would die of exposure in space within one year. Quite wrong, but John
      Keel adds an annotation that Yuri Gagarin died exactly 3 years later on the date of the encounter. Grissom died in
      the Apollo launch pad fire of <time>1967</time>. <span class="people">John Glenn</span> remains alive as I write

    <li><time>1965-07-21</time>. Felipe Martinez was told by a little Martian they would soon reveal themselves to
      people everywhere and they return for him and his family on December 3, 1965 before burning up our planet for not
      accepting their existence. The story purportedly started a large wave of reports that 'They' would invade Earth on
      that date.

    <li> Two parties of students from Mexico City were taken to a space station in August 1965. The extraterrestrials

      power of creative thought effectively.

    <li> Raymond Fowler tells an amusing anecdote associated with the Exeter incidents. People had been gathering for
      UFO watching at an UFO site and an officer of the military finally decided to put this folly to rest by proving to
      them that they were simply watching reflections of light from Pease AFB. He joined the crowd and radioed the base
      to turn the lights on. After a brief wait, he repeated the order. The base informed him the lights <strong><em>were</em></strong>
      on. Oooops. Fetridge's Law strikes again.

      times the diameter of our solar system. Within this embryonic star there is bound to be quite a collection of
      cosmic debris; and if we are due to pass through the middle of it we shall be in for a pretty tough

    <li> Arthur Shuttlewood indicates that prophecies about the end of the world are being reexamined and reinterpreted
      and the day of revelation may come between April 1966 and the end of 1967.
    </li>
    <li> Frank Edwards, author of the popular <em>Flying Saucers-Serious Business,</em> wrote in 1966 "<q>the Overt
      Landing or deliberate contact cannot be far away. If we have indeed gone through 6 phases in 19 years - then the
      final phase would seem to be due in the next 2 or 3 years - or it could come tomorrow...</q>" In his 1967 sequel
      <em>Flying Saucers-Here and Now </em>he intimated "<q>ultimate contact with the UFOs is possibly imminent - or
        probably imminent</q>" and suggested that astronaut transmissions are tape-delayed because "<q>it would make
        good sense for the UFOs to contact our astronauts in orbit</q>."
    </li>
    <li> Coral E. Lorenzen warned in the 1966 book <em>Flying Saucers-The Startling Evidence of the Invasion from Outer
      Space, </em>"<q>The UFO problem embodies an urgency which defies expression. Certainly procrastination is no
      solution. To leave matters as they are would indicate we are anxious to relearn the bitter lessons of history:
      Billy Mitchell - Maginot - Pearl Harbor - and so on</q>." In the sequel there is a slightly less ominous
      prediction: "<q>If UFO events continue as they have in the past year, it should be evident before the end of 1968
        just what the UFOs are</q>."
    </li>
    <li> In his Project B 1966, John Keel was also emboldened by the heady atmosphere of the flap then ongoing to write
      how "<q>altogether these thousand of reports mount up to an alarming picture. Perhaps they indicate that the UFOs
        are now engaged in a massive final stage of operations</q>." Next year, he also wrote, "<q>The final solution,
        however, will never come from the Air Force or the government but will be delivered by the UFOs themselves. That
        day may not be far off</q>."

    <li>ames McDonald predicted the UFO issue "<q>is soon going to blow wide open</q>" to Jim Hughes in 1966. McDonald
      was even gathering references for a post-breakthrough nose-thumbing of exobiologists who had slighted the UFO
      problem. T.H. Hoult, head of sociology at Phoenix, predicted McDonald's interest in UFOs, and the saucer craze
      itself, would soon wane and McDonald would wonder why he ever became involved.

    <li> Case 19 - The Condon Report: "<q>A project investigator was at the site of a predicted UFO landing. The UFO
      landing did not occur</q>." Condon took a fancy to this one guy's claim that he was in telepathic communication
      with extraterrestrials and decided to play out the invitation in the best scientific tradition. He claimed 'they'
      would land in Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats at 11 a.m. on April 15, 1967. Condon dispatched committee member
      Wadsworth along with several patrolmen and a brass band to the scene and had them wait for the arrival. To insure
      'they' had not confused Mountain and Pacific Time Zones, the group even waited an extra hour. It rained at Noon.
      They left 12:30. We thank Condon for this replication, as should all good scientists.

    <li> In the spring of 1967, a communication from planet Ummo indicated an Ummite spaceship would land at a place
      outside Madrid, Spain, pick up some of their contacts, and take them to their planet. Witnesses are said to have
      seen an UFO and photographed it at the predicted time. The photos however were hoaxed and the alleged many
      witnesses were anonymous or untraceable. In the Nineties, the whole Ummo affair was confessed to be a hoax.
    </li>
    <li> An entity named Karne contacted Arthur Shuttlewood and predicted that trouble would soon erupt in the Middle
      East. Some would mistake this as a sign of World war 3, which it would prove not to be. War between the Arabs and
      the Jews broke out a few days later, in June 1967. Another prediction, cast-iron, was that there would aerial
      manifestations in late October to make disbelievers sit up and take notice. That they did. They ridiculed the
      sighting of flying crosses at the end of that month. Karne also warned Shuttlewood not to buy into a prophecy
      being made by Interplanetary Masters that the first minute of of the first hour of Christmas 1967 would be of
      momentous importance to our planet. Rumor said it would be the Second Coming. Karne announced, "<q>Christ, the
        Alpha and Omega of our Solar system, will arrive not later than 1975 and possibly before the end of 1972</q>."
      Shuttlewood concluded, "<q>By the end of 1974, at latest, my humble guess is that many amazing things will come to
        pass</q>."<br/> In a sequel, Shuttlewood meets two Visitors, Joab and Micah, who prophesy a spiritual war of
      Purification which would be signaled by the Sun rising with a grey halo. This would bring about the Complete
      destruction of the earth or usher in a New Age. Other events at Warminster cause Shuttlewood to speculate the
      Awakening would involve a confusion of tongues (ala Tower of Babel) as normalized hydrogen streams through a
      breach in the Van Allen belts and cause human to squawk like Donald Duck. It would also cause blackouts, the
      befouling of water, and the stilling of autos. An outflowing of Cosmic consciousness during the adaptation to the
      new state of affairs would make it all a vibrantly joyous event. The wake up call was scheduled for 1974-5, but
      the broader impression he got was that "<q>1971-1980 will be a momentous decade for Man on Earth</q>."
    </li>
    <li> John Keel's extraordinary odyssey through the UFO phenomenon climaxes in a series of prophecies related by
      contactees and purportedly originating from an entity named Apol. The style and atmosphere of Keel's books cannot
      be captured by mere iteration of the events reported by him. One feels like a vandal trying to offer a summary
      like the following chronology, but it would be a greater crime not to include some sort of account of so important
      an example of this phenomenon.<br/> May 1967: Silent contactees predict giant power failure.<br/> June 5, 1967: A
      massive power failure occurs in the Northeast USA. Its scope is less than the 1965 Blackout.<br/> June 19: Apol
      predicts things will get more serious in the Middle East. The Pope will go there on a peace mission and be knifed
      to death. Then, the Anti-Christ will rise up out Israel. Apol adds the Vatican would send food and aid to
      refugees.<br/> June 21: Keel hears by way of another ufologist that a famous newsman in the Midwest would soon
      die.<br/> June 23: Frank Edwards, a newscaster and author of two flying saucer books, dies of heart failure in
      Indiana.<br/> June 28: The Vatican announces they are sending assistance to war victims. Apol and others step up
      their warnings about the Pope. They add a man in a black suit with a black knife would attack him in an airport.
      More predictions warn of impending plane crashes and Robert Kennedy being in grave danger.<br/> Also in June: In
      the wake of '67 Blackout, there is a warning a yet bigger power failure would happen. This would be followed by
      natural catastrophes. New York City would slide into the Ocean on July 2. Rumors spread and hardware stores sell
      out of candles and flashlights. Keel, himself, stocks up on water.<br/> July 2: Nothing.<br/> July 20: The Vatican
      announces the Pope will visit Turkey. Contactees date his assassination for the 26th. They add it would be
      preceded by an earthquake and followed by three days of darkness.<br/> July 22: A deadly earthquake hits
      Turkey.<br/> July 25: The Pope lands in Istanbul.<br/> July 26: The Pope leaves Istanbul. The visit is without
      incident. Keel however does see UFOs on this date. Ha-ha-ha. Undaunted, Apol and company predicts a new big event
      for December 15. They also predict the dollar would be devalued (No), Red China would join the U.N. (Yes), and
      Keel would move to a New York apartment on the ground floor. They also foretell a terrible disaster on the Ohio
      River - people will die. They imply a plant will blow up. With time, details of the December 15 event fill in.
      Space people would time a countrywide blackout to happen the moment Lyndon Johnson lit the White House Xmas tree.
      Considering this the sort of thing those perverse aliens would do for yuks, Keel buys into this prediction, albeit
      warily, and prepares for a blackout.<br/> October: "Hopi and Navaho Indians will make headlines shortly before
      Xmas."<br/> December 16-26: There is a rescue effort to help Southwest Indian reservations hit by a snowstorm.
      Among them are Navaho and Hopi.<br/> December 15: LBJ throws the switch. Immediately comes news that a bridge
      along the Ohio River has collapsed during rush hour. Keel had crossed that bridge many times in the past. People
      died.<br/> December 17: The Prime Minister of Australia goes for a swim in rough surf and his body vanishes. This
      was predicted, says Keel.<br/> December 18: An Air Force jet plows into a Tucson shopping center. Keel indicates
      this was predicted the day before. (This is incorrectly dated in his account as December 11.)<br/> Undated: An
      unprecedented event is scheduled for December 24. A great light will appear in the sky and then...<br/> December
      24, 1967: Nothing<br/> June 6, 1968: Robert Kennedy assassinated.<br/> November 27, 1970: A man dressed in black
      and wielding a kris, a black knife, attacks the Pope in an airport. Not Istanbul: Manila International Airport.
      Benjamin Mendoza AMR Flores, a surrealist painter, was outfitted in a priest's cossack to do the deed. An art
      critic commented that Flore's art was contrived, but betrayed no madness. Those familiar with Keel's concept of
      reprogrammed humans doing things in the name of the phenomenon may be puzzled to find Flores had no voices in his
      head egging him on. His act was in opposition to hypocrisy and superstition - an act of ideology. On September 2
      of that same year an individual who had been hearing voices in his head did attack the Pope, but with stones.<br/>
      Keel interprets all this as some sort of perverse game to lure people in and then make them appear foolish when
      they have people's attention. Acceptable, but one could alternatively interpret this pattern as a working out of
      Fetridge's Law. It is always the most important events that fail to live up to expectations.

    <li> Fourth grade students in Roosevelt, Utah are playing with a Ouija board and are informed that a flying saucer
      would appear above Roosevelt Hospital at 8 p.m. on February 23, 1967. On the scheduled evening, the children of
      Clyde McDonald's family rush outside to keep the appointment and run back inside. It's out there. The parents
      confirm there is indeed a big orange ball of light in the southeast over the hospital. It was the talk of the
      school the next day as many of the other fourth grader saw it, too. Several other people are documented as having
      seen the round light traveling in a south to north direction over Roosevelt. An orange ball may not be a flying
      saucer, but this still seems to be a impressive sounding success given the multiple witness status, the
      specificity of the predicted time, and the lack of an obvious source of misinterpretation (Hoax balloon?). As
      Frank Salisbury point, "<q>the really perplexing thing</q>" is that the prediction came from a bunch of kids
      playing with a Ouija board. "<q>What can a non-superstitious twentieth century scientist say about this?</q>"
      Perhaps it is precisely because no important person would ever take such a prediction seriously that this
      particular prediction came to pass.

    <li> In August 1967, an unnamed American researcher of note was promised he would get the Nobel Prize in 1972 for a
      cure for cancer the aliens would give him. He nearly suffered a nervous breakdown before he wised up to the fact
      that this was not going to happen. He subsequently dropped out of the field.

    <li> In a pair of whimsical notes to <em>Scientist</em> magazine, Walter F. Cannon offered this prediction: "<q>Since
      William Dunbar had square UFOs, and we have round UFOs, the next step would seem to be triangles. If NASA would
      only make our spacecraft a little pointier...we may not have to wait for the twenty-first century</q>." Later he
      wrote, "I still believe triangles are the coming thing, although my reasoning, being more Freudian than
      documentable, is not such to convince a skeptical astronomer. The Space Shuttle conforms to Dunbar's requirement
      of a pointier spacecraft. Oddly this prediction seems to be coming true. The Grand Boomerang of March 1983 was a
      well-publicized early example and more recently a flap in Belgium starred triangular craft. They do seem to be
      much more numerous than when Cannon wrote his note.

    <li> Larry Klein, a researcher believing fallen angels are behind the UFO phenomenon, issued 12 predictions based on
      his analysis of the Bible - an analysis we might fruitfully note included the identification of Satan as a
      gynecologist. Several involved UFOs The U.S. would soon capture saucers and their fallen Angels would be shown to
      be non-human and in top government positions. By 1983 there was to be a Landing en masse near Egypt and by 1984
      Archangel Michael would battle Satan in saucers. Even sooner, five saucers would land at the U.N. His other
      predictions fared equally badly, such as Reagan quitting in 1968, Romney becoming President, and the star "<q>Wormwood
        falling from the skies onto the<br/> Earth before 1972</q>."

    <li> Judgment Day was due to commence November 22, 1969 according the entity named Ox-Ho. It would involve a series
      of cataclysms that would culminate in the tilting of the earth's axis. The contactees, Light Affiliates, claim
      Judgment Day did take place as scheduled, but they frankly admit they misinterpreted the messages about the
      world's collapse.
    </li>
    <li> John A. Rimmer, in a 1969 <em>Merseyside UFO Bulletin, </em>offered a prognostication of the UFO scene for the
      Seventies. The bulk of his predictions were of the 'more of the same thing' character such as his pronouncement
      <q>"the Great Revelation will not take place in the Seventies</q>." These were all admirably correct. The only
      error was foreseeing the possible advent of professionals taking over the scientific side of ufology and maybe the
      evolution of an UFO journal which would be "known, respected and contributed by a wide scientific community, not
      just ufologists."
    </li>
    <li>In a paper for the AAAS symposium on UFOs between December 26 and 27, 1969 Donald Menzel offered, <q>"I do
      predict however a continued decline of public interest in UFOs The people seem to have taken up a new cause:
      Astrology...I further predict that scientists of the 21st century will look back on UFOs as the greatest nonsense
      of the 20th century</q>." The decline he saw was only temporary and the comment on astrology seems dubious.

    <li>Robert Kepley, a frequent observer of UFOs, predicted UFOs would intensify as the years go back. Other
      mysterious activity would occur including violent physical and spiritual changes. Taking a scriptural perspective,

    <li>In May 1971, Alan Vaughan predicted a spacecraft "<q>in the shape of the sun</q>" and "controlled by some form
      of super-intelligence" would land on the Earth before 1976.
    </li>
    <li>Paul Solem once seemed to have some success contacting UFOs and having them appear before crowds. Venusians
      promised four major demonstrations to Solem. "This one will be in broad daylight and we'll have reporters and
      cameramen from the big networks so there won't be any questions any longer." One of the faithful added, "This is
      the greatest event in the entire solar system." 1500 people, including newsmen, assembled Easter 1971 for the
      landing of the extraterrestrials. When they failed to appear, Solem blamed bulldozers on the landing site. He
      canceled the other three demonstrations.
    </li>
    <li>The happy people of the utopian world of Lanulos, located close to the galaxy of Ganymede, had not landed yet
      because they feared they might have to kill earthfolk should the government refuse to let them leave. Why take
      chances? Even so, Woodrow Derenberger assured us "before long" scientists would have to tell the truth about UFOs
      for "they will eventually land among us and make themselves known to all." Information about Saturn being
      bowl-shaped and the rings simply being rainbows shining off its ice does not seem to have been confirmed by
      Voyager spacecraft.
    </li>
    <li>In December 1971, NICAP predicted there would be a flap in 1972. Reports were increasing and researchers had
      found a five-year cycle in UFO records. In March 1973, their <em>UFO Investigator</em> boasted in headlines "1972
      Upholds Five-Year Cycle." In small print however you would have discovered 1972 had 152 reports compared to 137 in
      1971. Such an increase can only be termed trivial and absolutely not a valid indication of a flap. Just how
      trivial was demonstrated later when a true wave surged forth in 1973. Their November headline implicitly accepted
      the cycle was broken: "First Flap in Six Years Resurrects UFOs as National Controversy."

    <li> In 1972, the Universal Party, claiming contact with space brothers, said there would be an intervention by 1976
      and their candidate would probably win.
    </li>
    <li>In June 1973, Uri Geller held out the possibility of much greater contact with extraterrestrials in the
      following three years. Andijah Puharich is told by Geller's Intelligence in the Sky, a.k.a. IS, to prepare for a
      mass landing. "It may be some years or sooner...Many, many thousands of people will see us. At a later date, they
      hedge, "But the landings might be invisible, and only visible to you." The landings, you see, are only meant to
      charge up the beings."
    </li>
    <li>Jerome Clark and Loren Coleman believe the UFO myth is saying man is on the brink of catastrophe because our age
      has denied him belief in the magical and wonderful. "If this balance is not soon restored, the UFO myth tells us,
      nature will have its way. The collective unconscious, too long repressed, will burst free, overwhelm the world,
      and usher in an era of madness, superstition and terror - with all their sociopolitical accouterments: war,
      anarchy, fascism." Well, the accouterments part is pretty clearly wrong. Fascism has been in blatant decline,
      anarchy seems confined to places like Bosnia, and warfare has been of a historically unusual limited variety.
      Whether one considers the world more mad and superstitious is hard to put into objective measures, but it smacks
      of moralizing rather than a serious prediction.
    </li>
    <li> Edward Ben Elson, a Madison, Wisconsin lawyer, predicted Comet Kohoutek would flood our planet with petroleum.
      The comet was actually a spaceship and 144,000 persons would be taken aboard. Elson was appointed as agent in
      order to sell 1,000 tickets ranging in price from $10 to $100. This assignment was given to him by a "beautiful
      black angel encapsulated in a glow of pure light." The other 143,000 were delivered to Elson for temporary storage
      in ten-bushel baskets. They had miniaturized down to an inch in height. Embarkation was set for December 24. The
      media ate the story up. This was one of a delightful string of stunts "Crazy Ed" had played over the years. Among
      these was his nude candidacy for mayor, the banana-shaped universe theory, and the Disciples of Aten cult. It
      openly planned a heist of King Tut's rings in order to activate Cheop's pyramid to create a Messiah possessed and
      illuminated by alien energy. He also sent an Algerian double of himself to a Real People celebration that involved
      a story they did on him once. Dick Gregory, the comedian, rightly called Elson's Kohoutrek apocalypse tale
      "Brilliant...In illusion and imagination this is real...beautiful."
    </li>
    <li>William K. Hartmann, one of the Condon committee members, observed after the AAAS UFO Symposium, "In view of the
      growing popularity of television science fiction serials, and soon to be published evidence from mariner 9 that
      Mars was once more clement in the past, one might anticipate a resurgence of UFO interest by the date of this
      book's publication." David M. Jacobs berated Hartmann for failing to build a scientific thesis to justify this
      slight to ufology. Jacobs leaves unsaid the momentous aspect of Hartmann's prediction that prompted this fatuous
      remark. 1973 saw a massive UFO wave and Hartmann's prediction actually came to pass and it was his only
      prediction: A 100% success rate. This is unique. Hartmann had no duty to construct a thesis and, had the
      prediction failed, nobody would have cared about how he reasoned it.

    <li>Eric Norman's <em>Gods and Devils from Outer Space</em> bears a chapter asking "Earth Changes: Is Our World
      Coming to an End?" it begins, "Someday a historian of the future may sit down at his desk and attempt to
      reconstruct the details of the devastating earth changes that shattered our planet in the 1970s." Contactees and
      psychics warned people, but nobody listened. Norman goes on to chronicle the predictions of Dick Miller, George
      King, Dan Martin, Ted Owens, Tenny Hale, Edgar Cayce, Doc Anderson, John Pendragon, Bertie Catchings, John
      Catchings, Joseph De Louise, Joseph Donnelly, Irene Hughes, Beverly Jaegers, Komar, Al Manning, Ernesto

    <li>In 1973, Jerome Eden predicts "with almost absolute certainty" 1) Planetary water supplies will shrink and
      drought will bring about worldwide crop failures (No). 2) "Dust bowl" deserts will eat away at the land
      accompanied by an unprecedented increase in tornadoes and hurricanes (No). 3) Increased temperature extremes
      (Don't know). 4) Increased static electricity leading to disasters involving magnetic compasses, guidance systems,
      and communication interference. 5) Generation of electric power will break down due to DOR production and "direct
      withdrawals of power by UFOs" and temperature extremes (No). 6) Outbreaks of DOR sickness, "killer smogs" that
      will kill thousands and maybe hundreds of thousands. 7) Planetary famine and consequent wars for survival. 8)"When
      the Interplanetary DOR-Carrying Invaders from Outer Space feel the planet is thoroughly reeling with chronic
      weakness, divisiveness, and chaos, so widespread that Earthmen can no longer defend their planet or themselves,
      the signal will be given for an <em>open</em> assault on the entire globe. Thousands of "stars" will suddenly drop
      and swoop toward Earth..."

    <li>At the 1974 APRO Symposium, the Lorenzens predicted the government would ease up on UFO secrecy over a 3-year
      period. Later: "I was wrong. Essentially the same information had been leaked to me through 3 separate channels
      giving me confidence that I was onto something. In retrospect I feel either I was 'set-up,' i.e. fooled into
      thinking I was onto something real, or that such a plan did exist but had since been reversed."

    <li>In a 1974 interview, the Pascagoula abductee Charles Hickson said, "...I think before the year is out, that our
      government - particularly our Air Force - is going to come out to the American people and tell them these things
      exist. In 1982, Hickson offered an even more dramatic prediction: "They'll come down in force. We're going to see
      something I can't even comprehend. There's going to be a strange power or energy released on earth that will work
      on our minds and turn our minds from different things besides war." Hickson claimed this would start by 1983 and
      by 1984 they would arrive. The aliens told him; "by 1984 we'll be softened enough and changed from our bad ways.
      They are coming down to see what they have accomplished."

    <li>In early 1974, the chaplain of a French air base, Rather Mollisson, learned in a hypnotic session with a young
      man that a landing of an UFO was to take place. He evaded pinning down the moment or hour but did speak of the
      period of the full moon. Confused and skeptical, Mollisson discussed the case with a professor of German at Orange
      who was a friend. Hypnosis was performed again and the event was narrowed down to happening around the 23rd of
      24th at St. Gilles, France. That was in 3 days. It was decided to form a sortie of 7 persons and two cars and
      travel down to St. Gilles to check it out. Equipped with a camera and binoculars, they stationed themselves on a
      hill overhanging St. Gilles with a clear view of the surrounding countryside. It was clear, very cold, and windy.
      An hour before midnight, a light appeared in the SSE behind St. Gilles. It slowly descended along a curve against
      the wind. It was described as luminous with an electric blue fluorescence. Its contour was hazy and in the shape
      of a ball. Subsequently 4 more balls appeared along the same course - rather like boats traveling a canal I would
      surmise. They stopped descending at one point, they think to avoid the village. Panic apparently seized at least
      one member of the sortie. One of the witnesses took photos, but nothing probative or convincing was captured. No
      one else in the region reported the UFOs The party reported no landing and the low definition of the UFO instills
      no confidence it is truly inexplicable.

    <li>John H. Womack was told in April 1975 that our leaders have sold us out to the devil. People are becoming too
      selfish and irresponsible for effective self-government and will lose the freedom they presently enjoy. "Your only
      hope for real peace and joy is to discover your own anti-demon drug." I suppose thorazine didn't count as an
      anti-demon drug for some reason, but the prediction about loss of freedom is debatable.

      Evolutionary Kingdom." This is the group that years later led to the Heaven's Gate suicide.

    <li>In the Garden Grove case there is this garbled version of John Gribbin's infamous Jupiter Effect prediction
      given in the voice of an alien entity: "Of this known Earth orbit - of this helious alignment - third outer orbit
      - of this to pass 1982 - of this beware - of land will topple into the ocean - of this - The ocean will devour the
      land - of this projection to you - do you not see." Dr. Wanda M. Lockwood similarly recalled from her 1964
      encounter with an alien visitor, the warning "Remember 1982 and keep the faith." The doc figured this also might
      refer to Gribbin's cataclysm as that year approached. Gribbin had second thoughts about the logic of his argument
      as '82 approached and he withdrew the prediction. By the time his book was reprinted, he waffled back to
      acceptance. Gribbin and his co-doomsters were wrong of course. The scientific community was not surprised. For
      those wondering what went wrong, some comfort can be gained from the encounters of Oscar Magocsi. His friends, The
      Psycheans, take credit for staying the catastrophe.

      there shortly before Doomsday. During the subsequent legal battle she denied the prediction while admitting only

    <li>"I have a feeling that there is a Dark Age coming which, in effect, represents the externalization of the

    <li>October 26, 1976. Joy Summery mentions that a group in Andover, Massachusetts experienced "visions of beings

    </li>
    <li>On November 7, 1976, Jeffrey Mishlove received from Ted Owens an agreement to demonstrate his psi abilities
      given him by Space Intelligences. For the following 90 days Owens would telepath to the aliens "to produce, not
      one, but at least three major UFO sightings" in a target area 100 miles around San Francisco. Alien life forms
      would be produced before startled human eyes and magnetic and em-fx in California would cause many strange things
      to happen like power blackouts. Mishlove announced the demonstration to 70 scientists and government officials. On
      November 26, a large power blackout caused by high winds hit the area. On December 3, Owens said an UFO sighting
      would happen in a few days. Distressed by the delay, Mishlove, on the 6th, emphasized the need for the event to be
      seen by many in a way that cannot be questioned. On December 8, it happened. Hundreds watching an aerial art
      display saw an UFO. Some did not see it, including a man who accidentally caught it on videotape while shooting
      the art display. On February 2, 1977, two alien life forms appeared before a Concord man who was abducted and
      paralyzed temporarily. No magnetically caused strange events were noted.<br/> The December 8 event was considered
      by Mishlove to be "one of the best-documented UFO sightings in the annals of ufology" during the initial phase of
      his investigation. This glowing appraisal was subsequently downgraded in his research report. There he felt it was
      the best case ever in the Bay Area. He reveals his co-investigator, James Harder, "felt that this sighting wasn't
      very interesting" and that the videotape had "little authenticating value." Suggestions the UFO was a weather
      balloon was weakly countered with witness comments it moved against the wind. Winds aloft often differ from ground
      winds. Assuming one accepts this is a major event, we find Owens exactly wrong - one, not three major events,
      occurred. In a review of 140 claims made by Owens over the years, Mishlove found about half are clearly disputable
      or outright lack any evidence. The other half is "suggestive, not conclusive evidence of PK or Space Intelligence
      activity." The highlights of these claims form a picture of havoc that Jehovah might envy - lightning strikes,
      storms, tornadoes, blizzards, floods, droughts, earthquakes, and the occasional sports upset. My impression is
      that the collection of claims builds on a false assumption that extreme weather is rare. That may be so for any
      given point in the country, but for the country as a whole a person can pretty much expect extremes to occur on a
      monthly to seasonal basis.

    <li>On December 30, 1976, Greta Woodrew channeled an alien warning that Nature planned a "holocaustic endeavor to
      cleanse" the Earth. A "beaut" would hit our part of the globe. UFOs would soon appear in increasing numbers. "In
      the coming decade the people on your planet will be prepared for the vibrations of the landings. In your time
      frame, much of the activity will be in the next one hundred moons." That period has now passed without incident.
      Woodrew further revealed Andrijah Puharich had brought together 36 SpaceKids who were collectively warning, "In
      the coming decade we would have a series of drastic shifts in land masses." Volcanoes, earthquakes, famine, and
      disease would accompany it. 40% of the world's population was to have been decimated.

    <li>Mrs. Ruth Norman, a.k.a. "Spaceship Ruthy," placed wagers with Ladbroke and Company amounting to thousands of
      dollars that spacecraft would land by certain dates. "They will come soon. How soon might be a matter of months.
      Or to the end of the century, but probably this year. They don't give us a date," she said in 1977.
    </li>
    <li>Jim Hurtak had a series of contact experiences with Enoch. Hurtak revealed to Jacques Vallee, "I believe that
      the Earth will be contacted within the next 18 months by highly evolved beings from other worlds." Vallee
      commented on the typical failure of this sort of prediction.
    </li>
    <li>The entities of the Betty Andreasson affair indicated their association with the Second Coming of Christ.
      Eschewing an exact date, they said in 1977, "the Master is getting close."
    </li>
    <li>Cecil Michael had an astral vision in response to his request to entities to see the immediate future. Among the
      elements of import is his witnessing the atomic vaporization of a great glistening city. The timescale is highly
      indeterminate however with intimations that immediate might mean a few hundred years.
    </li>
    <li>In deference to ufologists who identify angels as extraterrestrials, let's include Roland Buck's experiences. On
      January 21, 1977 Buck finds himself in God's Throne Room where the secrets of the universe are stored. Buck is
      apprised of a number of these secrets and is given a piece of paper that has 120 predictions on it. Fortunately
      they also emblazoned into his mind because the paper self-destructs on the following day leaving some furry ashes
      which, in turn, evaporate into nothingness. Buck is amazed when the predictions all begin to come true in
      sequence. Number 113 bore special fascination since it involved Karol Wojtyla of Poland being named Pope over a
      year before it came to pass. Asked by a radio interviewer if he had information we could forward to, Buck slipped
      in the catch to this marvelous record: "I have written it down. However one of the things that is so important,
      that god impressed me with, because of the impact of many of these things, he doesn't want them out before he
      releases them. Sometimes he releases them ahead of time. I feel a definite restraint in releasing some things. For
      example, this one (about the name of the future Pope) would have really been devastating ahead of time."
    </li>
    <li>David Saunders believed he found a pattern of to some gradual UFO waves. They were separated by 61 months and
      moved eastwards in 30-degree steps. Saunders claimed he thus predicted in advance a 1972 wave in South Africa.
      Allan Hendry criticized Saunders by characterizing the wave as a minor flurry of reports and not a true wave.
      Hendry also disputed Saunders' methodology by noting that Bloecher inflated a 1947 collection of reports into a
      wave by intensive research into news files. The Blue Book files showed no such wave. Saunders predicted a December
      1977 wave for the Soviet Union and some credit the post-Petrozavodsk jellyfish wave as fulfillment. There are
      grounds for dispute here as well for the wave did not have a gradual onset as Saunders' pattern demands and the
      jellyfish UFO has been solidly explained by James Oberg as a rocket launch. Waves for January '83, February '88,
      March '93, and April '98 never materialized.
    </li>
    <li>UFO predictions by psychics are too ubiquitous to merit consistent cataloguing. A good sample exists in a book
      called <em>Predictions for 1977. </em>Of 45 psychics, 25 issued predictions related to ufology. Most gravitated to
      predictions about increases numbers of UFO sightings (Countess Amaya, Laurie Brady, Elizabeth Burrows, Ann Fisher,
      Dr. Joseph Jeffers, Dr. Joseph Pinkston, Aquarius) and government revelations (Ralph Campo, Tenny Hale, Dahrla
      McComb, Bright Star, U.S. PsiSquad). Intimations the UFO mystery would climax were variously advanced in claims
      that UFOs would: become a known fact (R.C. "Doc" Anderson, Reverend Lawrence A. Ball), show a scientific pay-off
      (Ted Owens), appear in large cities (John East), land in every state at the same time (Dr. Paul Lynch), reveal
      themselves (Dr. Ingrid Sherman), send a formal delegation to the U.N. (Grant Wylie), invite people on a five-year
      tour through an announcement on television (Ralph Campo), or start universal conflict (Joseph Donnelly). Only one
      denied the time for an UFO breakthrough was due and predicted instead bizarre contacts (Aquarius). This was right,
      but trite. Other predictions included UFO-caused blackouts (Bertie Catchings), a plane crash with an UFO (Rev.
      Robert Hill), the release of previously held-back research (Lou Wright), the construction of flying saucers by
      earthmen and a Washington UFO fad (U.S. PsiSquad). Psychics, incidentally, were not unanimous about UFO origins:
      Russia (Elizabeth Burrows, Joseph Jeffers), the inner earth (Dahrla McComb), twelve different galaxies (Ralph
      Campo), and an alien base in Georgia (Joseph Donnelly).<br/> Two psychics from this book preferred to save their
      UFO predictions for Timothy Green Beckley. When he chose to ask ten psychics about their impressions of UFOs Ellen
      Evans predicted 1977 would be known as the great flap year (No) and J. Josephs talked of UFO entities guiding
      humans to a third set of biblical scrolls. Beckley drew a consensus from his ten psychics that UFO activity would
      increase and alien entities would make themselves known in the near future. Consensus failures among psychics are
      almost lawful. Some think their agreement connotes reliability, but it is quite the opposite and I remind people
      of a book called <em>California Superquake - 1975-'77</em> which was stuffedwith psychics and visions predicting
      that non-event. 1977 also marked the failure of Jeanne Dixon's prophecy about aliens "from a planet on the
      opposite side of the sun...transmitting their secrets to us." Dixon's impressions of UFOs include notions of
      secret devices by man to create blackouts and women beyond Jupiter who will teach us about solar energy.
    </li>
    <li>Clarissa Bernhardt, purporting contact with space brothers, predicted that beginning in March 1978 the West
      Coast would change geologically with much of California going under the sea. Phoenix would be a port city before
      ten years passed.
    </li>
    <li>Philip Klass predicted that 1978 would see the next great UFO flap because of the release of the movie <em>Close
      Encounters of the Third Kind. </em>A graph of UFO reports compiled by Allan Hendry perversely shows a substantial
      lull during the run of the movie with reports increasing only after the movie left the theaters. The movie
      invested UFOs with awe instead of fear and probably defused anxieties to a degree that it contributed to a long
      depression in UFO numbers.
    </li>
    <li>In a 1978 holographic vision to the UFO investigator/contactee of the Dapple Grey Lane incident, Zeta Reticulans
      reveal Hiroshima and Nagasaki were hoaxes and an upcoming nuclear bombardment of the East Coast would fail when
      the warheads would go unexploded. A Middle East crisis would include another Arab shutoff of oil in 1982 (No).
      Terrorist nukes would force diplomatic relations by 1984 and bilateral disarmament by 1987. Official UFO contact
      would ensue to preserve the peace. A number of weeks after the vision, the contactee checked into a
      crash/retrieval assertion by the aliens and concluded none of the aliens' statements could be trusted.
    </li>
    <li>In 1978, a person in telepathic communication with the aliens claimed some crucial contact with
      extraterrestrials would happen, perhaps with someone like the Archbishop of Canterbury. In a March 17, 1978 letter
      to ufologist Nigel Watson he added he had a strong foreboding about a big chemical or fuel company accident. It
      did not happen. In a 1980 letter, he indicated thermonuclear war is likely in the near future.
    </li>
    <li>June 26, 1978. PLW is regressed by R. Leo Sprinkle and he foresees a worldwide system of disasters circa 1993
      involving fires, quakes, and California falling into the sea.
    </li>
    <li>Guido Franch of Villa Park, Illinois predicted the landing of the spaceship Neptune for 9:30 p.m. November 24,
      1978 near Warrenville. Five hundred people, including newspaper and TV reporters, showed up in freezing
      temperatures to watch the skies. The Neptune, with "Cutty Sark" emblazoned on it to take advantage of a contest,
      would be manned by the Black Eagle Galaxy patrol of which Franch was admiral. His ground crew failed to show up
      and this prompted Neptune to abort touchdown. Franch felt humiliated.
    </li>
    <li>"I see the apocalyptic/occultist strains becoming more dominant in ufology. Perhaps as in Arthur C. Clarke's
      <em>Rendezvous with Rama </em>we shall actually see a church of Jesus Christ Cosmonaut..." Roger Sandell
      presumably missed the Sixties' appearance of Bob Geyer's Church of Jesus the Saucerian. The apocalyptic and occult
      elements of ufology are perpetually present, but I could offer a quantitative argument that they decreased for a
      time in the Eighties. The Nineties have seen a resurgence.
    </li>
    <li>John Weldon and Clifford Wilson, advocates of the Demonic Hypothesis, prophesied increased acceptance of UFOs,
      its occult tie-ins, von-Danikenism (No). More government revelations, physical evidence, and attempted contacts by
      scientists should occur (Arguable, but I say No). "Great signs and wonders" will be seen and they thought it was
      possible significant proof would appear along with a serious chance of contact with key world governments
      existing. This is in concert with a belief that demonic activity would step up as the time of the Second Coming
      approached.
    </li>
    <li>Soviet UFO authority Felix Zigel felt UFO sightings would "not just continue but increase. The more information
      that extraterrestrials obtain about us, the more curious they must become." By inference, the actual decline must
      mean they got bored.
    </li>
    <li>In a 1978 interview, Rex Stanford deduced the demise of little saucer organizations and the increase in quality
      research (Yes and No). "But quite frankly I think there are going to be some breakthroughs perhaps in the next
      year or so." Allan Hendry's <em>UFO Handbook </em>came out in 1979 and those of the psychosocial persuasion would
      consider that a breakthrough work, however there are reasons to doubt Stanford was thinking in those terms. Call
      this a probable No.
    </li>
    <li>In December 1978, Fortunato Zanfretta of Torriglia, Italy encountered an ugly, monstrous being ten feet tall
      with dark, green skin. Under hypnosis he recalls they came from the "third galaxy" and they will "soon return and
      in numbers."
    </li>
    <li> Filiberto Cardenas was told by an entity named Kiostras that an UFO bearing 6 people would deliver a message on
      April 3, 1979. Kiostras also predicted California would sink into the sea; the illness of an actress which would
      prevent her from becoming First lady; the end of Sadat's rule before '81; the death of Liz Taylor; a cancer cure;
      and China fighting Russia for control of Asia.
    </li>
    <li>A thousand people partied on a stretch of unfinished interstate highway north of San Diego in response to
      posters distributed by Mark Block who claimed extraterrestrials would land 11:49 p.m. on June 21, 1979.
    </li>
    <li>"Diophantes" made it known that the inhabitants of Sirius II knew our civilization would end and a new one set
      up by 1980.
    </li>
    <li>"We're trying to arrange an encounter for you so you can get on with the new book." Ruth Montgomery, ever the
      skeptic, wanted to see an UFO first. "How could I do a book about flying saucers or space aliens without actually
      seeing one and becoming convinced they are real?" Evidently you do it by reading letters by contactees and giving
      up asking for proof in the face of excuses about Ruth living on one of the busiest avenues in Washington. Could
      she dare have denied us her book <em>Aliens Among Us</em> for so petty a reason as not being sure?
    </li>
    <li>Referring to Val Johnson and his 14 minutes of missing time, James W. Moseley suspected Johnson would find an
      explanation for those missing minutes. "Our Psychic Prediction is that this police officer is our next
      well-publicized abductee." Wrong, but that is probably because he didn't count on Allan Hendry's involvement who
      argued against it.
    </li>
    <li>Based on first-hand space channeling, Jane Allyson and Robert Short believed UFOs would evacuate people from
      natural disasters in 1980 and '81.
    </li>
    <li>Jenny Randles has claimed success in predicting UFO activity in the Pennine area of Great Britain by recognizing
      a 21-month cycle in a base period from 1973 to 1979. She predicted UFO waves for November 1980, August/September
      1982, May/June 1984, and February/March 1986. 1980 was a dismal year for UFOs, but a concentration of impressive
      cases happened in November, she asserts. She also asserts the August/September 1982 happened right on time. <em>The
        Pennine UFO Mystery</em> has her confidently predicting "May/June 1984 should prove rather interesting." It
      wasn't. By her account, 1984 saw only 23 cases with the best clustering happening between April 15 and 25. She
      finds these 5 cases interesting while admitting they may be associated with military exercises. Writing in 1986
      she acclaims, "Somehow (I don't know how) my prediction had come true." Sure.
    </li>
    <li>Brad Steiger polled the Starseed and the prophetic consensus of these folks as of January 1980 was that the
      following events would happen: A pole shift beginning from 1982-84. A worldwide famine has begun and will worsen
      in 1982 (No.) World War III may happen in 1982-85. Armageddon, the last great battle between Good and Evil, starts
      in 1989 or 1990. Worldwide UFO contact would apex in 1986 (No). The New Age will have its ups and downs until the
      year 2000 (Okay, but trivial). The Earth Changes will sporadically shudder the planet in earnest from 1984 until
      the end of the century (No).
    </li>
    <li>Edilcio Barbosa made a nationally televised announcement that at 5:20 a.m. March 8, 1980 a spaceship from
      Jupiter would land at Casimio de Abreu. Fifty thousand people showed up. Profound silence at the moment of truth.
      Then, "Hey, where is the UFO?" A massive traffic jam ensued. Barbosa was nowhere in sight.
    </li>
    <li>"Of late the UFO front has sitzkrieged. But, for 2 reasons I predict there will be a bull market in early 1981."
      The reasons, hilariously enough, are 1) Marjorie Fish's research on the Hill star map (Hendry was just giving the
      coup de grace!) and 2) <em>The Roswell Incident.</em> So said D. Keith Mano of the <em>National Review.</em> 1981
      was a bear market and the Roswell case would gain prominence more into the early Nineties.
    </li>
    <li> Analyzing the course of the UFO phenomenon, Ann Druffel predicted a progression from material to psychic UFO
      aspects that will expand into philosophical questions of being and finally it will teach us "what they might know
      about God." Stephan Denaedre's <em>UFO Contact from Planet Iarga </em>comes to mind as fulfilling Druffel's
      expectations. It also qualifies as the dullest book in all ufology. Theological comments actually are present in
      contactee literature back to Adamski and beyond. At best, the book represents a verbose climax. I discern no
      progression.
    </li>
    <li>UFO beings directly gave psychic Barry Andrews the revelation "The mass landing will take place in all the
      world's capitals on June 24, 1982."
    </li>
    <li>Contactee Ken Macmillan says three predictions he made in 1981 came true. 1) Earthquakes in China (as usual). 2)
      A "natural disaster" in Japan. He points to the airplane crash of a Boeing 747B northwest of Tokyo on August 12,
      1985. 3) "Great bloodshed in Poland." Actually he meant Africa - it's just that the Earth spins so fast his
      Landanian contact could not pinpoint it properly.
    </li>
    <li>One case to emerge from China involves a scientific researcher who on three consecutive evenings in May 1981 had
      UFO experiences. The last included a chat with a blonde girl during which the researcher asked her if they could
      have one of their crafts for research purposes. She responds, "The request is acceptable, but at the moment we
      don't have any craft to spare. We will satisfy your request in the near future."
    </li>
    <li>November 14, 1981. The abductee Bill Herrmann pens an essay titled "Inevitable Destruction" which warned that
      current Geopolitical Events were leading Humanity on a Collision with Thermonuclear Holocaust.
    </li>
    <li>The Halloween 1982 episode of <em>Real People</em> featured a segment on contactee Wayne Aho waiting with
      friends for a flying saucer to land. After a few hours the TV crew leaves having been quite unimpressed.
    </li>
    <li>La Verne Landis perished of starvation, dehydration, and hypothermia after weeks of waiting for the arrival of
      an UFO which higher powers told her and Gerald Flach to expect. From October 5 to November 15, 1982 "They kept
      telling us they would be picking us up. It never happened. Every time it never happened."
    </li>
    <li>Stan Seers chronicles a "mysterious cooling of the earth's climate in the last 30 years" which "could spell
      disaster for much of the life on this planet." He also notes an increase in earthquake activity. The sun's
      magnetic field may be reversing. This portends a "cataclysmic future for Earth and its inhabitants." UFOs are here
      to study this event. "There will be no history." Fashions change of course and it is global warming that worries
      people now. Seers was belatedly recycling the fears of those predicting a new ice age, a common notion of the
      1970s.
    </li>
    <li>Walter Andrus comments in the July 1983 MUFON UFO Journal, "I am predicting that the forthcoming book titled
      <em>Clear Intent</em>...will force the Pentagon and our government Intelligence agencies to reveal why they have
      conducted a 'Cosmic Watergate' or cover-up with respect to their involvement with UFOs"(No) In March 1992, Phil
      Klass "predicts that such Government action could not, and will not, ever occur." (Yes)
    </li>
    <li>Amid the myriad lunatic prophecies issued in the holy <em>Book of the Sub Genius </em>is one with an UFO theme.
      For the year 1988 they predict "Tribulation Money dropped from UFOs" It was revealed in 1990 that a case had
      happened at some unknown date wherein a beam of light shot out of the bottom of an UFO. "Suddenly, we heard a
      clanging sound on the roof and the pavement. There falling from the sky were 50 and 100 lira pieces. "It's raining
      money!" Call this a possible hit.
    </li>
    <li>March 1986. Whitley Strieber has a press conference in Washington dealing with predictions about the dangers of
      upcoming ozone holes that would create measurable crop damage in the 1990-93 period. In <em>Secret School</em>, he
      cites plant stomas somewhere were getting smaller in 1995, but no word if these were crops or if this is truly
      damage. He mentions some plankton was dying for some undetermined reason, however any link to UV would seem
      absurd. None of this convinces to farmers since grain is so plentiful in 1998 that prices have hit record lows.
      The ozone problem would also generate weakened immune systems in animals and a resurgence of disease. He alleges a
      200 percent increase in rabies proved this prediction right. The visitors predicted further ozone holes over the
      Arctic and Strieber later indicated in a MUFON paper that this prediction came true. No confirmation of this
      however exists. Strieber indicated that haze has been increasing and would spread rather dramatically over the
      next three to five years (No). There are going to be some extremely controversial and profoundly unsettling
      revelations in the next year or so (No).
    </li>
    <li>April 9, 1989. Whitley Strieber has a vision of giant boulders sailing off the edge of the moon along with a
      realization that the moon's exploding means, "Oh, this is the end of the world." The dream also had images of a
      nuclear plant being destroyed mere weeks before Chernobyl. Could the moon part come true, too? He decides it
      could.
    </li>
    <li> June 11, 1989. Scott Corder relays 34 predictions given to Donna Butts who is in contact with an Amorcan named
      'Peter.' The more blatant failures include: a limited nuclear exchange by March 1991, UFOs cause panic when they
      retain a Space Shuttle by 1990, Bob Dole becomes our last and greatest President, open contact by Amorcans in
      1990, world temperatures rise by 10 to 30 degrees and there is flooding from melting ice caps, a nuclear strike
      involving Nicaragua, the end of fossil fuels in "91, the Anti-Christ takes power in '92, and S.D.I. is
      unsuccessfully used to defend the earth against an evil race of aliens. Most of the others look wrong or too
      uninteresting to bother checking e.g. quakes, volcanoes, new oil reserves, etc.
    </li>
    <li> Raymond E. Fowler reports Betty Andreasson's warning that "man is going to become sterile" and extinct. Says
      he, "Their very improbability adds to the probability of their truth." However inconceivable it is, he sees "signs
      are all about it us that attest to its authenticity." The terrible damage man is inflicting on our planet will be
      the cause. "Life on earth would become extinct."
    </li>
    <li> Jerome Clark argues the Nineties will be "The Last Decade" of the UFO mystery. "Among some close observers of
      the UFO scene there is a growing sense that the UFO controversy as we have known it since 1947 may not survive the
      coming decade." Roswell and Gulf Breeze are breaking the pattern of secrecy and this openness seems to him to be
      accelerating. "The day is coming, we may be sure, when the scientific community abandons its near criminal
      negligence and concedes its shameful failure to address the most important scientific question of the 20th
      century. When that happens - when we ufologists are proven to have been right all along - we will be lucky to
      enjoy half an hour's worth of vindication before we get trampled to death in the stampede." It is safe to say that
      Sagan's book <em>The Demon-Haunted World</em> shows that the scientific community is not ready to concede that
      ufologists are right.
    </li>
    <li> David Clarke and Andy Roberts offer six predictions. 1) UFOs will continue to be reported but they'll be larger
      and more complex (Clearly they have continued. The Hale-Bopp hoax purportedly involved a spaceship four times the
      size of the Earth. Pat Parinello claimed around 1992 that a giant spaceship - 150miles across by 30-50 miles wide
      was heading for Earth (<a href="https://www.labyrinth.net.au/%7Estanton/xfiles/giantsp.txt">document</a>). The
      issue of increased complexity can be argued either way.) 2) No government announcements with consequent escalation
      of cover-up claims to include aliens running the government (Such claims already existed pre-1990, but they are
      better known and spreading) 3) Further invalidated MJ-12ish documents will emerge (Yes-The Special Operations
      Manual delivered to Tim Cooper in 1992 and revealed by Friedman in 1996). 4) The abduction craze will continue and
      become something far stranger (Yes - the MILAB cases, Jacobs future takeover by hybrids, praying mantis
      leadership) 5) An ET-based religion will emerge involving abductions with something similar to 'casting out of
      devils' (Don't know - does Druffel's fight-back strategies count?) . 6) Ufology will remain an unsolved mystery 25
      years from now.
    </li>
    <li>June 28, 1991. Stanton Friedman, while on the "For the People" radio talk show," predicts there will be an "an
      international announcement. They will show pictures. I think they will clearly establish that we are dealing with
      Alien visitors and I think they will convene an international conference of religious, economic, and political
      leaders."
    </li>
    <li> UFO Magazine does a cover story on 1992 Predictions because a sense that the year would see Something Really
      Big was out there among the buffs approaching a level of excess. Bill Hamilton thinks increasing revelations
      meant, "we're going to learn a lot more in 1992." Tal LeVesque says a high-tech fascist takeover is underway and
      believes 1992 will be the year of the UFO threat as researchers drop out, death threats increase, and cults
      increase. Gary Schulz feels "1992 is apparently going to be a pivotal year for ufology" and elitists will pull off
      the grand unification of Europe (No). Richard Hall, Scott Smith, George Knapp and Charlie Hickson predicted
      nothing would happen and that it was all b.s. (Yes).
    </li>
    <li>Joseph W. Ritrovato, in the March 1995 issue of <em>MUFON UFO Journal,</em> offers a forecast of a flap based on
      a combination of 4 alleged cycles of UFO activity of 13, 21, 32 months and 5 years in length. Most of the year, or
      December 1994 through September 1995 will show an increase in observed UFOs...The best viewing should be during
      the entire spring season (perhaps starting as much as a few weeks before the spring equinox) but most especially
      on every other Friday through Sunday from the second weekend in April to the third weekend in May...if the wave
      crest doesn't occur at the end of April it should be no more than three weeks from that time." Phil Klass
      counter-predicted "IF there is UFO Flap this year, it will not occur until August, when Congress adjourns and goes
      home and the summer doldrums set in. SUN predicts there will be no UFO Flap in 1996 because UFOs know they cannot
      compete with the presidential elections for media attention." According to Paul Ferrughelli's NSRC Yearbook, the
      highest monthly total in 1995 occurred in August. Second highest occurred in June. April was third-highest and May
      tied for sixth and seventh. We don't know if there was a flap in 1995 because Ferrughelli's database acquired new
      sources that year making a higher average for the year probably artifactual. There was no flap in '96.
    </li>
    <li> John Mack's tribe of abductees offer a nice variety of world destruction fantasies: earth will be puking us off
      with geological and meteorological convulsions to rebalance itself (Ed), a plague of communicable AIDs (Scott),
      nuclear war (Jerry, 1992), Brazilian-type deforestation repeated everywhere (Jerry, 1991), an electromagnetic
      catastrophe from negative human technology (Joe), a huge planetary shakeup (Sara), earth changes involving great
      shifts in the continental shelf with a tidal wave engulfing the South and East Coast before 2002 (Peter), the
      collapse of Earth-connected systems and a tearing of the cosmic fabric essential to the unity of the universe
      (Carlos), and a cosmic water balloon floods the Earth suffocating everything (Arthur).
    </li>
    <li> March 18-19, 1995. The so-called stealth Disney UFO documentary predicts the release of government documents
      about ongoing alien encounters. Most Americans will likely explore outer space aboard crafts of alien origin.
    </li>
    <li>Scott Mandelker offers a study of what Brad Steiger called the Star People. They still predict natural
      disasters, a major transition, man-made conflicts, California going into the sea, Earth Changes, catastrophes, and
      crises. The new time for the harvest tends to be around 2010 and he notes the end of the Mayan calendar and The Ra
      Material suggested this<em>.</em></li>
    <li> Richard Boylan argues at length that the extraterrestrials are planning to reveal themselves and are employing
      a 4-element Game Plan. 1) The number, boldness, and openness of UFOs are increasing. 2) The increase in close
      encounters reported to therapists and the public. 3) An increased sense of mission among experiencers and
      researchers. Such an increase among researchers was predicted by myself as part of the evolution of the paranoia
      in ufology. 4) Greater governmental leaking. He anticipated an "announcement of the first openly-declared,
      official ET presence on Earth" in 1997. He concludes this "will make it virtually impossible by 1998 for any
      informed person to deny extraterrestrial reality. Subsequently he talks about UFO overflights of various capitals
      around the world and wonders when they will overfly Washington. "Surely that open appearance will spell the end of
      the UFO Cover-Up. It will also mark for us the beginning of a new and cosmic chapter in our history."
    </li>
    <li> At a 1995 press conference, John Mack comments on the fate of the world, "The fact of the matter is that we
      have 15 to 20 years before the psychological, moral, physical, and environmental collapse of the Earth as a living
      entity becomes altogether a reality. This scientific, predictable fact if you just move the clock from what's
      going on now." Abductions seem to be an effort to change our consciousness to alter that fate. Asked whether our
      continued existence two decades hence would prove him wrong: "I don't think so because we will know exactly what
      brought about the incredible transformation of our behavior and consciousness that would be required for that to
      happen."
    </li>
    <li> February 5, 1996. Though expressing doubts, Richard Boylan relays second-hand information by way of a CIA UFO
      specialist and the Aviary UFO Group that EBE claims "a major public extraterrestrial landing" will occur on April
      24, 1997 near the White Sands Missile base. EBE also told them of a series of upcoming Earth cataclysms in 1998.
    </li>
    <li> The Guardian through Ruth Ryden beseeches, "Look to the heavens at night, for just as cloud formations are
      becoming unusual with symbols and signs, so will the stars begin now to startle humanity with movements and
      formations that are not in the plats of astronomers. As your solar system is experiencing many changes along with
      your planet, so will star systems begin to change their orbits." Falling stars, volcanic eruptions, and focused
      crustal-generated violent weather patterns will increase.
    </li>
    <li> Alexander Collier, friend of Andromedans, predicts between now and 2007 that Saudi Arabia will become the North
      Pole. Atlantis, Lemuria, the hollow inner earth, and reincarnation will be scientifically proven. Our alien
      genetic heritage will be proven. Extraterrestrial life will make contact and their range and presence
      acknowledged. Aliens will vacate our planet and leave us alone.
    </li>
    <li>September 29, 1996. "This planet is about to be recycled, refurbished. Started over. That doesn't mean it's
      going to be destroyed, it doesn't mean the end of the world. But it does mean that it is going to be spaded
      under." Marshall Applewhite, a.k.a. "Do" in the Heaven's Gate videotape "Last Chance to Evacuate Planet Earth
      Before it is Recycled," indicates this is "urgent" having been clearly informed by his Older Member of how short
      the remaining time is. "<strong>The end of this civilization is very close.</strong>"
    </li>
    <li> December 15, 1996. Debbie Jordan, one of the famed abductees of <em>Intruders</em>, opines on a television
      show, "I feel as if they're pretty much done with what they've been doing for a while, and the time is drawing
      very near, very quickly, that we're going to be ready for what they have planned next, and I think it's going to
      be open contact. I think that there's going to be a lot of admissions made by a lot of people, way up in the
      "high-ups," and the "should-knows," that are going to finally talk. I think that big, big things are right on the
      horizon."
    </li>
    <li> September 18, 1997. Valentine H. Gernann comments on the Strieber scenario negatively: "To hear Strieber talk,
      the millennium is going to be upon us as the Visitors uplift the human race to hyperconsciousness. It takes a lot
      of guts to say something like this when nearly every contactee we know has been totally betrayed by the Visitors
      when the chips are down." His own opinion is, "To me there is little doubt that Their program has gained huge
      momentum in recent years and that it is building to a peak in the fairly near future." He considers it possible
      that maybe they will leave.
    </li>
    <li> David Jacobs' <em>The Threat</em> reports the impression from his abductees that there will be a future
      catastrophe. Hybrids will integrate into our society, take it over, hand it over to control by big bug aliens. A
      few non-hybrids may be preserved for scientific purposes, but most earthlings will be human-alien hybrids.
    </li>
    <li>At the 1998 MUFON UFO Conference, Michael Lindemann predicts universal acceptance that UFOs are alien will occur
      "within the next five to ten years."
