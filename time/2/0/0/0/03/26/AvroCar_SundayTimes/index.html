<p>"IT is the nearest the RAF got to a UFO. Recently discovered photographs taken at a secret laboratory in the 1950s
  reveal for the first time how close Britain came to developing a saucer-shaped stealth fighter after the second world
  war. </p>
<p>The pictures, taken at a research centre in Canada, show a revolutionary ultra-high-speed jet fighter designed by the
  British engineer John Frost. </p>
<p>Aviation experts who studied the pictures last week said the jet incorporated some of the features on America's
  stealth fighter plane. </p>
<p>Work on the aircraft in the 1950s was codenamed Project Y. Frost and his team initially set out to build a
  disc-shaped machine with vertical takeoff, but ended with a sleek, arch-shaped aircraft. </p>
<p>"The pictures are a wonderful find," said David Windle, who has researched the history of Project Y. "It is
  technology that Britain just lost and it is a pity the project was abandoned. Who knows what would have happened if
  they had pursued it." </p>
<p>The photographs were taken at a laboratory in Malton, near Toronto, where Frost was working with Avro-Canada, a
  subsidiary of the British firm Avro, to develop a jet fighter for the Canadian government. He wanted to create an
  aircraft which could fly at 2,500mph and take off and land on its tail. </p>
<p>The existence of Project Y has been known about for years, but no pictures of the aircraft have ever been found. An
  aviation researcher accidentally discovered the photographs in a file at the Public Records Office in Kew. </p>
<p>An elongated saucer shape was used because of the revolutionary "radial flow" jets designed to power it. The engines
  were project was abandoned before the plane had its first test flight. The engines were designed to emit the exhaust
  gases from several small nozzles, increasing the thrust of the jet. Aviation experts said last week that the prototype
  vehicle would have been almost invisible to radar because of its slim his cross-section. It would also have been more
  likely to evade enemy missiles because of the lower heat output through the numerous jet outlets. </p>
<p>It is not known why the revolutionary jet never went into production, but the project was abandoned before the plane
  had its first test flight. </p>
<p>Alex Raeburn, then assistant superintendent of manufacturing at Avro, described the life of secrecy for those on the
  base. "The security was very tight," he says. "Armed guards were stationed on the doors and drawings were taken away
  as soon as we'd made the component. In fact, we never knew exactly what it was we were making." </p>
<p>Verne Morse, one of the team who worked on the secret project, said he was amazed any pictures had survived because
  of the total secrecy surrounding the project. He described how he saw a subsequent model designed by the team. </p>
<p>"When I saw it (the plane) for the first time I was stunned," he said. "I'd heard rumours we were working on a flying
  saucer, but I dismissed them. Now, here I was looking at it, and I was speechless." In 1954, the Canadian government
  decided to end the development of the aircraft. The American air force took over the project and later a scaled-down
  version of the plane became an "air jeep", which was nicknamed the Avrocar. </p>
<p>Raeburn said he witnessed test pilot Spud Potocki flying the saucer- shaped craft. "I remember him flying up to the
  hangar windows and looking in like a humming bird might do. When he flew in cold weather the engines sucked pieces of
  ice off the puddles. They'd float around in the air, shining in the sunlight." </p>
<p>Professor Michael Graham, professor of aerodynamics at Imperial College, said: "In the 1950s there was a lot of
  interest in different aircraft shapes. This is built like a kind of flying wing. Its ability to hover is useful for
  landing in rough places." </p>
<p>While Frost worked on Project Y, American engineers were developing their own ultra-high-speed jets at desert bases
  in California and Nevada, which led to the development of spy planes such as the U2. </p>
<p>In 1961, however, despite the successful flights of the Avrocar, the American air force halted all funding for the
  company's researchers. There were no more British-designed flying saucers and Frost left Avro and moved to New
  Zealand, where he died. </p>
<p>Last week Tony, his son, said: "Dad was a brilliant artist who was always designing things, but he combined that
  skill with being a very capable mathematician and great lateral thinker."</p>
