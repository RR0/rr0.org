<p>Michel Gauquelin conducted huge statistical tests of the positions of planets at birth for various professional
  groups, personality types, and parent-child relationships. His sample sizes were as large as 60,000. His work has been
  repeated and verified by scientific organizations in several countries.
</p>
<p>The chapter of Gauquelin's book "Birthtimes" which describes the reactions of the scientific community to his
  research (including the CSICOP episode) should be of interest to any philosopher of science. He also discusses
  scientific reactions to Galileo, Newton, and Kepler. Newton and Kepler were believers in astrology, and Newton's
  contemporaries refused to believe in "gravity" because it was action-at-a-distance -- something in the realm of
  astrology.
</p>
<p>Here is a summary of Gauquelin's results: <br> If you were born with: <br> Moon in 1st, 2nd house: "simple" <br> Moon
  in 5th, 7th, 8th house: not a writer <br> Moon in 9th house: "not simple" <br> Moon in 9th, 12th house: writers,
  politicians <br> Moon in 10th, 11th house: not a sports champion, scientist, or actor
</p>

  11th, or 12th house: sports champions, physicians, <br> military leaders, top executives; "strong will"; not a
  painter, <br> musician, or writer

</p>
<p>Saturn in 1st, 7th, 8th house: "strong will" <br> Saturn in 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 10th house: not a scientist or
  <br> physician <br> Saturn in 1st, 3rd, 6th, 10th house: not a scientist <br> Saturn in 3rd, 4th house: "extrovert"

  actors, journalists, <br> writers, painters <br> Saturn in 10th house: "not strong will"
</p>
<p>Moon in 9th or 12th house: amiable, disorganized, dreamer, easy-going, <br> fashionable, friendly, generous, good
  company, good-hearted, helpful, <br> imaginative, impressionable, impulsive, merry, nonchalant, popular, <br>
  socialite, spontaneous, superficial, tolerant
</p>
<p>Venus in 9th or 12th house: affable, agreeable, ambiguous, attractive, <br> beloved, benevolent, charming,
  considerate, courteous, elegant, <br> flattering, gallant, gracious, juvenile, kind, obliging, pleasant, <br> poetic,
  polite, seductive
</p>
<p>Mars in 9th or 12th house: active, ardent, belligerent, brave, <br> combative, daring, dynamic, energetic, fearless,
  fighter, lively, <br> offensive, reckless, spontaneous, strong-willed, stormy, tireless, <br> tough, valiant, vitality
</p>
<p>Jupiter in 9th or 12th house: ambitious, authoritarian, conceited, gay, <br> harsh, humorous, independent, ironical,
  lively, mocking, prodigal, <br> proud, show off, social climber, spendthrift, talkative, warm, well-off, <br> witty,
  worldly
</p>
<p>Saturn in 9th or 12th house: cold, concentrated, conscientious, <br> discreet, introvert, methodical, meticulous,
  modest, observer, precise, <br> reserved, sad, simple, sombre, stiff, taciturn, thoughtful, timid, <br>
  uncommunicative, wise
</p>
<p>These are people who are very successful at their professions. Studies <br> of non-champion sportspersons, for
  example, found they were born with <br> Mars in any house.
</p>
<p>Also, the data peaks don't always fit neatly into houses.</p>
<p>Note that there are a few contradictions, due to difference databases <br> being used. The examples below illustrate
  that there's nothing wrong <br> with contradictions.
</p>
<p>Gauquelin tested 50,000 personality traits against the appropriate 12 <br> zodiac symbols. The results showed
  absolutely no correlation with <br> traditional astrology. In fact, more often than not the people born in <br> a sign
  lacked the personality traits associated with that sign.
</p>
<p>He also was unable to correlate any personality traits with the position <br> of the Sun, Mercury, Uranus, Neptune,
  or Pluto. He was unable to find <br> professions associated with Venus in the 9th or 12th house, or at least <br>
  professions where people become famous.
</p>
<p>Gauquelin's found that the two most powerful houses are the 12th (after <br> rising), 9th (after midheaven), and two
  next most powerful houses are <br> the 6th (after setting) and the 3rd (after midnight). Astrologers say <br> that the
  most critical houses are the 1st (before rising), 4th (before <br> midnight), 7th (before setting), and 10th (before
  midheaven). In other <br> words, astrologers are right that the planet angles are very powerful, <br> but wrongly
  assert that the planets are strongest at the angle and <br> approaching the angle. Gauquelin found that the planets
  are strongest <br> in the two hours (1 house) after the angle.
</p>
<p>For example, astrologers assert that persons born with Mars in the 1st <br> house will have that planets' qualities
  most strongly. Gauquelin found <br> that although the qualities of Mars are correct, persons born in the <br> 12th
  house will have those qualities strongest.
</p>
<p>Lastly, Gauquelin disproved the astrological belief that children's <br> horoscopes (planets in zodiac symbols) are
  similar to their parents <br> (Kepler had been a believer in this). However, if a parent was born <br> with a planet
  in a strong angle, his or her children also tend to have <br> the same planet at the same angle. This he proved be
  examining a sample <br> of 60,000 births. Again, this shows that planet angles are powerful, <br> but the zodiac is
  meaningless. And again, the influential planets were <br> the Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. No hereditary
  influence was <br> found for Mercury, Uranus, Neptune, or Pluto.
</p>
<p>Gauquelin ends the book with a chapter on modern obstetrics, <br> particularly research that shows that hormones from
  the fetus induce <br> birth (in other words, the fetus decides when it wants to be born). He <br> suggests that this
  research could lead to explanation of natal <br> influences on personality. In other words, a fetus predisposed to
  <br> "strong will" may be able to sense when Mars rises, or is overhead (and <br> have difficulty sensing the setting
  and IC angles). The hereditary link <br> may also be discovered.
</p>
<p>Gauquelin urges astrologers to oppose recent trends towards Caerareans, <br> drugs and other techniques to induce
  birth as a great threat to future <br> research into astrology. <br></p>

</p>
<p>The Venus strengths should incline her to be feminine. Perhaps I will <br> suggest to her mother to encourage sports
  and leadership. Note that she <br> gets contradictory influences for acting, science, and writing. <br> Astrologers
  describe her Jupiter-Saturn Opposition as a number of <br> tensions, between herself and others, between moving too
  fast and moving <br> too slow, between starting new projects and finishing old ones.
</p>
<p>Let's compare this to traditional astrology (Robert Hand's "Planets in <br> Youth"). Jupiter in the 12th house means
  "...you will be very kind and <br> generous toward less fortunate people...a very gentle person who can't <br> stand
  to see others hurt...you probably do not enjoy being in the <br> limelight very much. You prefer to remain humble and
  quiet...And when <br> you are alone, you find comfort in the peace and quiet of your own inner <br> world..."
</p>
<p>These last two sentences are the complete opposite of actors, <br> politicians, and military leaders! <br></p>
<p>Astrological Houses and the Gauquelins' research.</p>
<p>Maggie McPherson pisces@cs.mcgill.ca <br></p>
<p>David's posting of a summary of the Gauquelins' research prompted me to <br> think about astrological houses. The
  Gauquelins found that planets <br> traditionally associated with certain careers (or with talents useful in <br> those
  careers) appeared in the 12th and 9th houses with a frequency <br> greater than chance for people successful in those
  careers. In traditional <br> astrology, the 12th and 9th houses are considered "weak", and they have <br> little to do
  with the career or personality type, which are ruled by <br> the 10th and 1st houses respectively. Houses 1 and 10 are
  also considered <br> "stronger", and so a planet placed in these houses should be more <br> prominent. Planets related
  to a particular career should be prominent, <br> one would think, in the charts of people who achieve prominence in
  that <br> profession.
</p>
<p>The Gauquelins used a house system that differs from all the systems used <br> by astrologers, but their findings
  cannot be accounted for in this way. <br> Subsets of their data have been reanalysed using Placidus and Equal House
  <br> systems, and the results were replicated. (The 10th cusp, the midheaven, <br> is the same for the traditional
  systems and the Gauquelins' system, but <br> their "rising point" differs from traditional ascendants by as much as
  <br> 20 degrees for European latitudes.)
</p>
<p>How can one resolve this apparent discrepancy between tradition and the <br> statistical findings of the Gauquelins?
</p>
<p>One might be tempted to assert that the traditional house system(s) should <br> be abandoned in the face of the
  published evidence. On the other side, the <br> astrologer whose experience convinces her/him that the traditional
  houses <br> (e.g., the Placidus houses) are useful might be tempted to dismiss the <br> Gauquelins' findings as a
  curious anomaly. In other words, one might be <br> tempted to assume that the traditional houses are either right or
  wrong. <br> But this would be to fall prey to a common fallacy in reasoning: the <br> fallacy of the false dilemma. It
  need not be true that the traditional <br> house systems are either wholly wrong or wholly right. A possibility <br>
  exists that different house systems are appropriate when applying <br> different astrological techniques or when
  addressing different questions.
</p>
<p>It may be possible to reconcile the two forms of evidence. Perhaps one kind <br> of house system is useful for
  determining personality and success in career, <br> and another is useful for other purposes, such as transits. The
  astrologer <br> who has worked with transits will undoubtedly have found impressive <br> correlations between transits
  through traditional houses and circumstances <br> in the life of the querant.
</p>
<p>I know of one suggestion for an alternative approach to houses that might <br> satisfy both the traditional
  astrologer and the astrologer who feels compelled <br> to take account of the findings of the Gauquelins.
</p>
<p>The suggested approach is the brain-child of the always innovative Axel Harvey <br> of Montreal. An excerpt from an
  article of his appears below. I present this <br> excerpt without his permission, but I am sure he will not be upset
  with me <br> for doing so; I have never known Aquarians to shy away from publicity. The <br> excerpt is from an
  article entitled "Horoscopes in Azimuth" which appeared <br> in the premier issue of the short-lived local publication
  "Considerations."
</p>
<p>In presenting this excerpt, my aim is to demonstrate that possibilities <br> exist for house systems and combinations
  of house systems that will <br> account for the Gauquelins' data as well as the daily experience of the <br>
  astrologer. I cannot say whether the particular approach taken by Axel <br> Harvey is the way of the future (although
  it is certainly worthy of <br> serious consideration).
</p>
<p>============================================================================ <br> HOROSCOPES IN AZIMUTH <br> by Axel
  Harvey
</p>
<p>For over ten years I have been drawing clockwise horoscopes -- that is to say, <br> with the Zodiac going in the
  usual direction but with the houses proceeding <br> widdershins as in Figure 1.
</p>
<p>[Partial reproduction of Figure 1, using the medieval house wheel, <br> which is slightly easier to produce in ascii
  than a circle; the 10th <br> house follows the MC in a clockwise direction, where the 9th house <br> would usually be;
  the 1st house follows the Vertex is a clockwise <br> direction, and the 7th house follows the Antivertex in that
  direction:]

</p>
<p>The reasons for placing houses this way, contrary to zodiacal movement and <br> to the habits of the profession, did
  not all come to me at once. Perhaps <br> the best way to introduce the subject to readers is to retrace the steps <br>
  I followed as I gradually developed my techniques.
</p>
<p>Traditional houses are a riddle to anyone who stops to think about them. <br> No sooner has the Sun risen than it is
  in the twelfth house, having just <br> crossed the cusp of the first. In the following 24 hours it will cross <br> all
  the other cusps in reverse order, entering each house through the <br> back door. Yet the circle of houses is supposed
  to be a local image of <br> the great circle of the Zodiac. Why, then, is it so peculiarly arranged?
</p>
<p>The question must have occurred to thousands of young astrologers, whose <br> teachers serenely answered, "Ah, yes, a
  typical beginner's question -- <br> the stars go westwards in hourly motion and eastwards in zodiacal motion, <br> and
  there's nothing we can do about it."
</p>
<p>However, I felt there was something to be done about it. I tried various <br> combinations of house numbering, of
  placing each house behind or ahead of <br> its cusp, and of assigning starting points. The scheme I settled on had
  <br> the upper meridian as cusp X, like most systems, but the tenth house lay <br> clockwise from its cusp; then
  followed cusp XI and so on. Hence Figure 1.
</p>
<p>This sort of map had two advantages.</p>
<p>First, the planets now proceeded from one house to the next in rational order, <br> and entered each house by the
  cusp of that house. Diurnal movement thus <br> resembled zodiacal movement more closely, so that the ancient analogy
  <br> between signs and houses began to make more sense.
</p>
<p>Secondly -- and this must be the decisive point whenever anyone talks about <br> houses -- it worked better. Even
  though I applied the most literal, old- <br> fashioned interpretations to the houses, those interpretations gave
  better <br> results with the houses in their new places.
</p>
<p>You will have noticed that I took the Vertex, rather than the Descendant, <br> as cusp of the first house. Originally
  I made this choice on aesthetic <br> grounds. Edward Johndro, Charles Jayne and others had studied the prime <br>
  vertical and found that its western branch (the Vertex proper) was more <br> sensitive and important than its opposite
  (the so-called Electrical <br> Ascendant or Antivertex). Now if I were to choose the horizon to define my <br> cusps I
  and VII, the first cusp (Descendant) would end up being secondary <br> to the seventh (Ascendant); but if I chose the
  prime vertical then the <br> first (Vertex) would be more powerful than the seventh (Antivertex) -- <br> and this
  certainly seemed to be the more proper arrangement. It should be <br> added that the Ascendant continues to be a major
  point in the new system: <br> but it is no longer a cusp and moves around in houses V, VI, VII and VIII.
</p>
<p>As it turns out there are more rigorous reasons for preferring the Vertex <br> as Cusp I; we shall return to this
  issue at the end of this article.
</p>
<p>Since the Ascendant is no longer a cusp, I could not take just any popular <br> house system and number it backwards.
  However, the Vertex is always 90 <br> degrees from the meridian as measured along the horizon; therefore it <br>
  seemed natural to use a house system where the cusps were all 30 degrees <br> apart in azimuth ("azimuth," a term
  familiar to sailors, simply means <br> "distance measured along the horizon"). Such a system of houses must be <br>
  the simplest of all to demonstrate in the field. Stand up and face due <br> south. Raise your arm overhead and lower
  it until it points straight <br> before you, and you have drawn the upper meridian: cusp X. Now swing <br> your arm
  towards a point 30 degrees to the right and move it straight <br> up and down again from that point: you have drawn
  cusp XI. Go another <br> 30 degrees to the right and make the same gesture: there is cusp XII. <br> Do this once more:
  by now you have moved your arm thrice 30 degrees, <br> or one quarter-circle, from the meridian and you are drawing
  the prime <br> vertical in the West -- cusp I. And so on around the horizon.
</p>
<p>The Azimuth houses must be older than the constellations. You have just <br> repeated the gestures which would come
  naturally to a prehistoric queen <br> dividing a berry patch between clan houses, or to a shaman dividing a <br>
  hunting territory between twelve villages.
</p>
<p>The mathematically-minded will turn to the Appendix at the end of this <br> article for information about calculating
  the longitude of Azimuth cusps <br> and related matters.
</p>
<p>[An example horoscope deleted.]</p>
<p>A FEW APHORISMS</p>
<p>There is no room in an introductory article to discuss all the fine points <br> of interpreting Azimuth maps. The
  following notes are a rough-and-ready <br> guide for astrologers who wish to try Azimuth horoscopes but fear the <br>
  confusion which can arise from the simultaneous use of two maps.
</p>
<p>1. The Ascendant governs personality -- that is to say, how we appear to <br> reasonably acute and compassionate
  observers. It also indicates our <br> unconscious goals -- the values we adhere to even if we never think about <br>
  them, and to which we will remain loyal even in the most difficult times <br> (and even if we don't realize we are
  doing so).
</p>
<p>2. The Vertex answers the question, "Who do you think you are?" It also <br> corresponds to our will -- that is to
  say, the choices we make with open <br> eyes -- and the values we adopt consciously. Whether or not we can defend <br>
  these values successfully depends on various circumstances, such as aspects <br> to the Vertex and its ruler.
</p>
<p>3. Similarly the whole Zodiac map, with the Ascendant as cusp I, points to: <br> fate, heredity, social and physical
  influences, things that happen to us. <br> The whole Azimuth map points to: intentions, desires, opinions, how we <br>
  try to organize our lives, what we do.
</p>
<p>One can look at the stars passively, as coming from the East, or one can <br> think of oneself as a star like
  Paracelsus, and direct oneself westwards. <br> That is Zodiac-wise and clockwise thinking. To hold the first view <br>
  exclusively makes one a vegetable; the second, a fool.
</p>
<p>4. Since the planets, by diurnal motion, pass through Azimuth houses in <br> rational order, the Azimuth map is the
  ideal one to use for primary <br> directions. On the other hand, traditional houses are the correct ones <br> to use
  with transits. The general rule is: in predictive work, use a <br> house system that goes in the same direction as the
  significators.
</p>
<p>Solar returns are a special form of transit and should therefore be handled <br> entirely in the traditional
  framework.
</p>
<p>(Unfortunately I can't deal with primaries in this issue. Primary directions <br> mentioned in this article are
  directions in Azimuth, which differ from <br> classical methods.)
</p>
<p>5. The most useful map for delineation is the Zodiac map with Azimuth <br> cusps (e.g., Figure 1). It combines fate
  and will.
</p>
<p>6. The Ascendant usually, but not invariably, governs physical appearance. <br> A good example of a physique strongly
  coloured by the Vertex is that of <br> musician Mick Jagger, whose spare frame and de'sabuse' features owe more <br>
  to his Saturn-Vertex opposition than to his Jupiter-Ascendant conjunction. <br> (Data: 04:30 UT, 26th July 1943; 51N27
  00E12.)
</p>
<p>7. The lords of the Descendant and the Antivertex represent the two possible <br> types of spouse in the native's
  life.
</p>
<p>8. Zodiacal aspects may be reflected in totality or in great part by <br> identical aspects in the Azimuth map; or
  they may be almost entirely <br> absent from the Azimuth chart, being replaced by different aspects <br> involving
  different pairs of planets.
</p>
<p>In the first case we have a subject who always appears to know what he or <br> she is about; whose resources and
  ambitions are evenly balanced; who is <br> comfortable in the environment he or she was born to.
</p>
<p>In the contrary case we have both great over-reachers and under-achievers; <br> people who rebel against society, or
  who simply deny the importance of <br> historical or cultural roots.
</p>
<p>[Two examples deleted.]</p>
<p>MORE RIGOROUS THOUGHTS ON HOUSE SYSTEMS</p>
<p>I said that my original reasons for adopting a new house system were, firstly, <br> the intuitive requirement that
  planets should proceed in proper order through <br> the houses and that cusp I should be more important than cusp VII;
  secondly, <br> a crude, empirical satisfaction with the results.
</p>
<p>There still remained doubts about the symbolic correctness of the arrangement. <br> Astrologers have long believed
  that the diurnal cycle is manifested in the <br> polarity of day and night, that the (tropical) zodiacal cycle is
  manifested <br> in the polarity of Summer and Winter, and that an analogy between these <br> two polarities is
  significant.
</p>
<p>Now if we put the first house in the West, where the Sun begins his descent <br> under the Earth, it can hardly be
  paired with Aries where the Sun begins <br> his climb to the height of Summer. One might make things work by calling
  <br> Libra the first sign -- a practice endorsed by Jewish custom, in which the <br> day begins at sundown and the
  year in September. Such a symbolic revolution, <br> however, would be hard to accept for most Western astrologers: I,
  for one, <br> find it impossible to associate Mayday with the eighth house.
</p>
<p>It has struck me recently that there is no analogy between two polarities. <br> There is just one polarity: North and
  South. In Aries the Sun begins his <br> vernal ascent to the North. In the West the Sun begins his daily tour -- <br>
  northwards.
</p>
<p>...the horizon, which is none other than the "ecliptic" of the Azimuth <br> house system, [as] viewed from the centre
  of the celestial sphere ... <br> winds north [of the Equator], then south, then back to its starting point. <br> [When
  the] Zodiac ... is viewed from outside the celestial sphere [then in <br> both cases] house or signs follow one
  another in the familiar, natural order: <br> arithmetic and symbol both maintained. [In other words, both the Azimuth
  <br> houses and the Zodiacal signs follow a sinusoidal pattern with respect to <br> the Equator such that the nodes or
  zero-points are at Vertex/0-Aries and <br> Antivertex/0-Libra, the peak is in the north at 90 degrees, or IC/0-Cancer,
  <br> and the trough is in the south at 270 degrees, or MC/0-Capricorn.]
</p>
<p>So it turns out that my choice of the prime vertical to define cusps I and <br> VII was more appropriate than I had
  suspected. In order for a house system <br> to follow the North-South dichotomy rigorously, a point situated on cusp I
  <br> or VII should be exactly half-way between North and South. This is true of <br> a point anywhere along the prime
  vertical, which is 90 degrees from both <br> the North and South points of the horizon. It is *not* true of a point on
  <br> the Ascendant or Descendant, which may lie considerably closer to the <br> southern side (e.g. Sagittarius rising
  in the northern hemisphere) or the <br> northern side (e.g. Cancer rising in the northern hemisphere) of the <br>
  celestial sphere.
</p>
<p>(Australian readers will be dissatisfied with this explanation. As they can <br> find out on reading the Appendix, I
  have generalized the discussion by <br> referring to elevated and inferior poles instead of North and South. This <br>
  still does not answer the old question of whether people in the southern <br> hemisphere should begin their Zodiac in
  Aries or elsewhere -- a question <br> I leave unraised.)
</p>
<p>APPENDIX</p>
<p>The following notation is used throughout:</p>
<p>L Geographic (geodetic) latitude <br> E Obliquity of the ecliptic <br> a RAMC (right ascension of the upper meridian)
  <br> Ap, Dp Right Ascension and declination of a planet or other point <br> T, N Astrological azimuth and altitude
  <br> S Sign ( L ) = +1 for North latitudes <br> = -1 for South latitudes <br> n the appropriate cusp or house number
</p>
<p>The formulae given below make use of a three-variable function, R (A,B,C), <br> which produces a correct Ascendant
  when:
</p>
<p>A = a, the RAMC, <br> B = L, the latitude, <br> and C = E, the obliquity
</p>
<p>A practical form of function R is</p>
<p>R (a,L,E) = tan^-1 cos a /-g + H [where ^ means "to the power of"] <br> where H = 0, if -g &gt;= 0 <br> and H = 180
  dg if -g &lt; 0
</p>
<p>g = sin a cos E + tan L sin E</p>
<p>The astrological azimuth of a planet, T, measured from the Vertex through <br> the cardinal point of the horizon
  nearest the elevated pole, is found thus:
</p>
<p>(i) Let A = a - Ap - 90 dg <br> B = Dp <br> C = 90 dg - L
</p>
<p>(ii) Evaluate R. Subtract 90 dg from the result. Finally multiply <br> by S, to obtain T, the azimuth.
</p>
<p>T = S(R - 90 dg)</p>
<p>(iii) Altitude is <br> N = sin^-1 (sin B cos C - sin A cos B sin C)
</p>
<p>Azimuth cusp longitudes in the Zodiac are found by using the following <br> variables in R:</p>
<p>In all cases, <br> B = sin^-1 (cos L sin 30 dg[n + 2]) <br> C = obliquity, E
</p>
<p>Now let k = a - tan^-1 (sin L tan 30 dg[n + 2])</p>
<p>Then, for Cusps X, XI, XII and I: <br> A = k - 90 dg
</p>
<p>and for Cusps II and III: <br> A = k + 90 dg
</p>
<p>One can employ the usual formulae for the Midheaven and Vertex instead of <br> following the procedure given here for
  Cusps X and I.
</p>
<p>No further treatment of the result is needed in northern latitudes. For <br> southern latitudes the following shuffle
  is necessary:
</p>
<p>Cusp III + 180 dg becomes Cusp XI <br> Cusp II + 180 dg becomes Cusp XII <br> Cusp XII + 180 dg becomes Cusp II <br>
  Cusp XI + 180 dg becomes Cusp III.
</p>
<p>Azimuth houses are not defined on the Equator, and make confusing maps <br> inside 15 degrees of latitude North and
  South. On the other hand they <br> are increasingly well-behaved as they approach the poles. One cannot <br> expect a
  house system to have both (a) the horizon or prime vertical as <br> a cusp, and (b) validity at every point of the
  globe: it is wanting to <br> square the circle. Besides, if astrological factors interact with the <br> social or
  physical surroundings then it may be wrong to use the same <br> kind of chart for Colombia and Uganda as for Canada
  and Finland.
