  <p>Like no other UFO story before it, the <a href="../../../../../../science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Socorro">Socorro
    incident</a>
    managed to convince a whole generation of people that UFOs were not merely mystery objects flying around our skies,
    but that they ware probably piloted by denizens from another world. The Socorro case was by no means the first claim
    of an apparent encounter with extraterrestrials. Such stories had circulated for at least a half century. But until
    policeman Lonnie Zamora's sighting made the news in <time>1964</time>, all other accounts of meetings with the space
    people came from witnesses of dubious credibility and reputation. And their stories where laughable.
  </p>
  <p>Zamora's story was different. He was a <em>policeman</em>, a highly credible witness. So with the case, the
    widespread feeling — even among UFO believers — that there was something absurd, if not ludicrous, about
    humanoids, simply crumbled. From this point on, the diminutive pilots associated with the landings of mysterious
    objects called UFOs were irrevocably tied into the phenomenon.

  <h2>The Event</h2>
  <p>On the afternoon of <time>1964-04-24</time>, the sky over <span class="place">Socorro (Nouveau-Mexique)</span> was
    clear and sunny with just a few scattered clouds. The wind was blowing hard, however, and the law itself was hard
    after a speeder in a black Chevrolet. Lonnie Zamora, a police officer in Socorro, was driving police car No. 2, a
    white 1964 Pontiac, and chasing the offender at 5:45 that Friday afternoon when suddenly he heard a rorar and saw a
    flame in the sky. Thinking that a dynamite shack in the area might have blown up, Zamora wisely decided to abandon
    the chase and headed instead toward the mystery flame.
  </p>
  <p>Wearing green singlasses over a pair of prescription glasses, Zamora watched the flame descend slowly as he
    continued driving. The flame had a blue and orange color and was shaped like a funnel. It was twice as wide at the
    bottom than on the top and four times as high as ti was wide. Zamora could not see the very bottom of the flame,
    however, as it continued down behind a hill.
  </p>
  <p>The noise Zamora heard was a distinct roar, not a blast or a jet sound. As he drove with his windows rolled down on
    the rough gravel road leading up to the dynamite shack, the noise from the flame changed from a high frequency to a
    low frequency over a periode of about 10 seconds.
  </p>
  <p>During this time Zamora had considerable trouble driving up the steep, rough hill. The wheels of his car kept
    skidding on the loose gravel and rock, and he twice had to back up and try again. By the third attempt, he no longer
    noticed the flame or the noise, but he did finally make it up the 60-foot-long hill.
  </p>
  <p>Once at the top, Zamora traveled westward slowly on the gravel road but noted nothing for about
    <time>P15S/20S</time>.
  </p>
  <p>Looking around for the dynamite shack, whose exact location he could not recall, he suddenly noticed a shiny object
    to the south about 800 feet away. He stopped the car immediately and observed the scene for a few seconds.
  </p>
  <p>At first the shiny object up ahead looked to Zamora like a car turned upside down. Seeing two people in white
    overalls close to the object, he suspected that it had been turned over by some kids. The "car" looked white against
    the moss background and the two figures appeared normal to Zamora, who assumed they were either small adults or
    large kids. They were about one third the size of the object, or about four to four-and-a-half feet tall. One of
    them then turned in Zamora's firection and seemed startled.
  </p>
  <p>Hoping to be of assistance, Zamora started driving toward them quickly. On his way, he radioed the sheriff's office
    that he had found a possible accident and would be out of his car, checking out the situation in the arroyo, a dry
    shallow gully. While still talking on the radio, he stopped his car about a 100 feet from the "over-turned car." As
    he started to open his door, Zamora dropped his mike, which he picked up and replaced in the slot before getting out
    of the car. As this happened, Zamora heard two or three loud "thumps," a second or less apart. It was as if someone
    had opened and slammed closed a car door.
  </p>
  <p>Even before he turned to the scene, Zamora heard the roar again, which became louder as it rose from a low to a
    high tone. At the same time, he saw the flame under the object, which he finally realized was not a car at all. The
    object was rising straight up slowly, emitting from the middle of its underside a light blue flame, the bottom of
    which was orange in color. The flame seemed to be kicking up dust in the immediate area but there was no smoke.
  </p>
  <p>From a distance of about 800 feet Zamora got a good clear look at the object. It was egg-shaped and
    aluminium-colored. It had no doors, windows, or other features except some markings in red. These insignia-like
    markings measured about two and one half feet wide in the middle of the object. When the object was about three feet
    off the ground, Zamora noticed that it seemed to have "legs" on the bottom that were slanted outward toward the
    ground.
  </p>
  <p>As the roar increased, Zamora thought the object might blow up, so he turned away and, in a panic, ran back toward
    his car. At one point, as he looked back at the object, he bumped his leg on the back fender of his car, fell to the
    ground, and lost his glasses. He immediately got up, however, and kept running toward the edge of the hill. As he
    glanced back he noticed that the object had risen completely out of the gully and was now in the air at the same
    level as his police car.
  </p>
  <p>He was so scared of the rorar that he intended to continue running down the hill, but when he got there the roar
    stopped and he heard a sharp whine that lasted maybe a second. Zamora then ducked just over the hill, turned toward
    the ground, and covered his face with his arms. In the silence that followed, however, he decided to look up and
    when he did, saw the object going away in a southeasterly direction. It traveled in a straight line, about 10-to-15
    feet above the ground, clearing the eight-foot-tall dynamite shack by about three feet.
  </p>
  <p>Zamora then ran back to his car, keeping an eye on the object as it rose up and headed off cross country, silently
    and without a flame. He picked up his eyeglasses, but left his sunglasses on the ground, and hot into the car. He
    immediately radioed Ned Lopez, the police radio operator, and told him to "look out the window, to see if he could
    see an object." What is it, asked Lopez? "It looks like a balloon," replied Zamora, who could still see the object
    as he spoke to Lopez. It seemed to lift up slowly and to "get small" in the distance very quickly. After just
    clearing Box Canyon or Six Mile Canyon Mountain, it just disappeared.
  </p>
  <p>Zamora then gave directions to Lopez and Sergeant M. Samuel Chavez, a New Mexico State Tropper, on how to find him.
    As he waited, he got out his pen and drew a sketch of the insignia he had seen on the object. What he drew was a
    half circle over an arrow that pointed up from a straight line base. (There is some suspicion that Zamora's drawing
    was later "changed" by the US Army investigator and that Zamora originally described the insignia as "an inverted
    'V' with three parallel lines underneath.") Zamora then went down to where the object had been and saw the brush
    burning in several places. At that time he heard Sgt. Chavez calling him on the police radio in his car and asking
    for his location. So Zamora returned to his vehicle and told Chavez to look straight ahead — he was standing
    right there.
  </p>

  <h2>That Same Day in New York</h2>
  <p>At <time>1964-04-24 10:00</time> — about 10 hours before the Socorro event
    — Gary Wilcox, a farmer living in <span class="place">Tioga City, New York</span>, saw a craft that very much
    resembles the one seen in Socorro, as well as two similar figures who were dresed almost identically. Wilcox
    described seeing a shiny object in the woods. As he approached it, he saw a 20-foot long, egg-shaped object hovering
    two feet above the ground. When Wilcox began to examine the object, he was confronted by two beings, each about four
    feet tall and wearing silvery white outfits that covered their heads. The stocky figures were carrying trays of
    soil.
  </p>
  <p>One of the beings approached Wilcox and began talking to him in English. They spoke for two hours about such
    subjects as air pollution, space probes, agricultural methods, and the fact that the beings claimed to be from Mars.
    The Martians told Wilcox not to tell anyone about his experience, then entered their ship, which emitted an idling
    sound as it took off.
  </p>
  <p>Wilcox realized how absurd his story was and thought someone was playing a prank on him. He then called his mother
    to tell her what had happened, and eventually the story got out. In the days that followed, various people came to
    interview Wilcox, including the sheriff, two federal agents, UFO investigators, and newspaper reporters. They all
    found Wilcox an extremely reticent subject; certainly no one would accuse him of being a publicity seeker. Wilcox
    did not hear about the Socorro event until a week later when his father showed him a newspaper clipping about it.

  <h2>The Investigation</h2>
  <figure class="left side">

      object <a href="https://www.cufon.org/contributors/chrisl/astropower.htm"></a></figcaption>
    <img src="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Socorro/zamosign.jpg"
        alt="Police officer Lonnie Zamora produced this sketch of the insignia he observed on the still unexplained object"/>
  </figure>
  <p>Minutes after the encounter, the investigation of the Socorro incident began. Through both coincidence and
    circumstance, it would be one of the most heavily investigated UFO incidents in history.
  </p>
  <p>Sergeant Chavez of the New Mexico State Police pulled up in his car just moments after Lonnie Zamora had seen the
    object disappear in the distance. Chavez took one look at Zamora who was pale and sweating, and said: <q>You look
      like you've seen the devil.</q> Zamora replied: <q>Maybe I have.</q> When Zamora briefed the trooper on what had
    happened, Chavez was skeptical. Later he surreptitiously looked into Zamora's car to search for tools that might
    have been used to produce the landing marks they would discover. He found nothing to incriminate Zamora, however.
  </p>
  <p>When Zamora and Chavez first walked down the arroyo where Zamora had seen the object, they found burn marks here
    and there. Smoke appeared to be coming from one burnt bush, but there were no flames or coals. Chavez noted that the
    burned bush was in the center of four wedge shaped imprints. Chavez then broke a limb from the bush but it was cold
    to the touch. The four impressions on the ground had apparently been made by the legs of whatever it was that had
    landed there.
  </p>
  <p>Minutes later, State Policeman Ted V. Jordan, Undersheriff James Luckie, and cattle inspector Robert White, who had
    overheard the police radio traffic, all arrived and examined the site. Jordan took photographs. At 7 PM Chavez and
    Zamora left for the State Police office. When they arrived, Zamora spoke to <a href="/org/us/ic/fbi">FBI</a> agent
    J. Arthur Byrnes, Jr., who happened to be in the office on other business and had heard about the incident over
    police radio.
  </p>
  <figure class="right side">
    <img src="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Socorro/international-paper.jpg"
        alt="Artist's interpretation by Chris Lambright"/>
  </figure>
  <p>Byrnes immediately contacted the executive officer at White Sands Proving Grounds who in turn contacted Army
    Captain Richard T. Holder, the senior military officer in the immediate area. Holder arrived at the station 20
    minutes later, and both he and Byrnes interviewed Zamora. Later they visited the site along with several Socorro
    police officers. Then, after returning to the police station, Holder called in some military police, who roped off
    the site that very evening and, using flashlights, took measurements and collected samples. At one o'clock in the
    morning Holder completed his report on the incident. Still later that morning Holder would receive a call from a
    colonel in the war room of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon who wanted to be briefed on the incident over
    the scrambler.
  </p>
  <p>The Air Force then began its investigation. Major <span class="people">Hector V. Quintanilla</span>, who had been
    the director of Project Blue Book for the US Air Force for just a year when the Socorro case occurred, admitted that
    <q>all hell broke loose</q> when the story it the newspapers on <time>1964-04-25</time>. Reporters began calling
    Quintanilla early at home, so he left for this office immediately to direct the investigation. When he got there the
    telephones were <q>ringing, ringing, ringing</q>, he recalls; he had a dozen calls waiting for him. But he answered
    none of them. The first thing he wanted to do was reach Major William Connor, the UFO investigating officer at <span
        class="place">Kirkland Air Force Base</span> in <span class="place">Albuquerque, New Mexico</span>, 55 miles
    from Socorro. Though Conner was inexperienced, Sgt. David Moody, who was Quintanilla's chief analyst, just happened
    to be on temporary duty at Kirkland.
  </p>
  <p>It took hours to get the Air Force investigation under way. A Geiger counter had to found and the base photographer
    had to be located. Moody and Conner finally managed to check the site for radioactivity two days after the event,
    but the results were negative. They were also unable to locate any radar track of the object's passage. In addition,
    Moody and Conner obtained copies of Holder's preliminary investigation as well as the photographs that Undersheriff
    Jordan had taken.
  </p>
  <p>Soil samples taken from the scene on the evening of <time>1964-04-24</time> were analyzed by the Air Force
    Materials Laboratory. A spectrographic analysis completed on the <time>1964-05-19</time> revealed no foreign
    materials in the soil that would indicate the presence of a propellant. Nor did the lab find any significant
    differences in composition between the control and site samples. The lab concluded that there had been no foreign
    residue at the site.
  </p>
  <p>The news media pressed the Air Force Information Office for a response but, noted Quintanilla, <q>there was nothing
    from which we could draw a definite conclusion or a decent evaluation.</q> Quintanilla had no idea what Zamora saw,
    but he was determined to find out what it was. He decided to send Blue Book's scientific consultant, Northwestern
    University astronomer <span class="people">J. Allen Hynek</span>, to Kirkland to help with the investigation.
  </p>
  <p>Meanwhile, on -<time>1964-04-26</time>, Jim and Coral Lorenzen of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization in
    Tucson had arrived to conduct their own investigation. They found that the impressions made by the legs of the
    object measured 8 by 12 feet in area. The impressions were wedge-shaped and 3-to-4 inches deep. They also reported
    four circular depressions, about four-and-one-half inches in diameter and approximately three inches deep; they
    assumed these were made by the ladder the figures must have used to get in and out of the craft. Four other prints
    with a little crescent shape in the middle were found where the two figures stood; these were thought to be their
    footprints.
  </p>
  <p>Le <time>1964-04-28</time> saw the arrival of Ray Stanford, representing the National Investigations Committee on
    Aerial Phenomena, a private but high-profile UFO group based in Washington, DC. Stanford, a psychic who had seen
    UFOs many times himself, also interviewed Zamora, visited the site, and collected what appeared to be metallic
    scrapings from a rock in one of the depressions in the soil where the object had landed. A subsequent analysis by
    scientists at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland revealed that the material was simply silica
    — just sand. But Stanford insists that the scientist doing the analysis initially told him that the scrapings
    were a zinc-iron alloy unlike any known on Earth and indicated that the Socorro object could have been an
    extraterrestrial craft.
  </p>
  <p>Many people investigated the Socorro incident, but probably no one did a more thorough job of it than Ray Stanford,
    whose <em>Socorro Saucer in a Pentagon Pantry</em> (Blueapple Books, Austin, Texas, 1976) was the one and only book
    published on the Socorro incident. Despite its thoroughness, however, Stanford's investigation is heavily colored by
    a near-paranoid attitude, which was widespread at the time, about Air Force UFO secrecy. Stanford was convinced that
    the authorities had tried to cover-up their involvement in the Socorro case and conceal the evidence and its
    implications. Indeed, FBI agent Arthur Byrnes requested that his name not be mentioned as a participant in the
    Socorro investigation. Byrnes had also asked Zamora not to mention having seen the two figures associated with the
    object. And Army Captain Holder suggested to Zamora that he not mention the symbol he saw on the side of the craft
    to anyone except official investigators.
  </p>
  <p>Later, Stanford learned through James McDonald, a senior atmospheric physicist at the University of Arizona, that a
    radiological chemist with the Public Health Service in Las Vegas had analyzed materials gathered at Socorro,
    including some vitrified sand that had been collected at the landing site. But it seems that Air Force personnel
    took all the chemist's notes and materials and told her not to talk about it any more. The Air Force had also taken
    (and never returned) the photographs of the landing site that State Patrolman Ted Jordan had taken minutes after the
    object's departure; the reason the film was never returned to Jordan? The film was ruined, apparently irradiated.
  </p>
  <p>By the time astronomer Hynek arrived in Socorro for the Air Force, there was little he could do to add to the
    investigative effort that had already been carried out. Zamora re-enacted the entire episode for Hynek, who also
    wandered far from the actual scene of the incident in search of similar "landing marks" in the area but found none.
    "The marks themselves were only two or three inches deep, sandy, clayed and hard-packed, and they appeared to be
    scooped out, as though a heavy mechanical device had slid rather gently into position." Hynek personally observed
    some of the greasewood bushes that had been charred in the immediate vicinity of the incident.
  </p>
  <p>Hynek decided to focus his attention on the character and relationships of the people involved, and Zamora in
    particular. He hoped to invalidate Zamora's testimony somehow, but that effort failed. "It is my opinion," Hynek
    concluded, "that a <em>real, physical</em> event occurred on the outskirts of Socorro that afternoon..."
  </p>
  <p>Quintanilla meanwhile did his own checking. He called the Holloman Air Force Base Balloon Control Center in New
    Mexico to check on ballon activity in the area at the time of the incident. He and his secretary Marilyn Beumer
    Stancombe, called all the weather stations and Air Force bases in New Mexico for the release of weather balloons.
    They also looked into the possibility of helicopter activity, as well as government and private aircraft flights in
    the state that may have provided an explanation for the Zamora sightings.
  </p>
  <p>But everything came up negative. There had been no unidentified helicopter, balloon, or aircraft in the area, and
    the radar installations at Holloman and Albuquerque had observed no unusual blips, though the radar site closest to
    Socorro, the Holloman Moving Target Indicator Radar, had been shut down that day at 4 in the afternoon. Desperate,
    Quintanilla even called the reconnaissance division at the Pentagon and the Immigration Service. Finally, at wit's
    end, he decided to check with the White House Command Post. But that also proved to be a dead end — a General
    informed Quintanilla that the only activity they had in the area was some flights of the U-2, America's premier
    high-altitude spy plane at the time.
  </p>
  <p>After days of checking one thing or another, Quintanilla finally received Hynek's report on Socorro. But it added
    "practically nothing" to the report that Connor and Moody had submitted. In fact, Quintanilla was furious at Hynek
    for adding "more flame to the fire" at his press conferences on the matter. "I was determined to solve the case come
    hell or high water," Quintanilla noted. But Quintanilla, like Hynek, was convinced that an actual physical craft had
    been present. The question was: was it extraterrestrial or man-made?
  </p>
  <p>Quintanilla suspected that the solution to the case lay in a hangar at Holloman Air Force Base. After pulling some
    strings at the Pentagon, Quintanilla flew out to Holloman himself to interview the Base Commander at length. During
    his four day visit Quintanilla spoke to everyone and searched the base from one end to another. He even spent
    another day with the down-range controllers at White Sands Missile Range. But in the end he left dejected, convinced
    that the answer to the Socorro mystery did not lie at Holloman after all.
  </p>
  <p>On his way back to <span class="place">Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio</span>, Quintanilla came upon
    another potential solution to the Socorro mystery. Could Zamora have seen a prototype of the lunar landing module
    being tested in the field? As soon as he got back, he requested briefings on the subject, as research on the lunar
    lander for the Apollo moon program was being conducted right there at Wright Patterson. He spent a lot of time
    pursuing this angle, and for good reason. It was an excellent guess.
  </p>
  <p>In late <time>1962</time> <a href="/org/us/nasa">NASA</a> had selected Grumman to build this crucial piece of
    hardware for America's race to the Moon. The contract was signed on <time>1963-01-14</time> and Grumman spent the
    first three months establishing a practical external shape for the vehicle. Much attention was focused on guessing
    what the surface of the Moon would be like and how to design for a safe landing. The designers realized that they
    did not need an aerodynamic streamlined vehicle, as would be needed in the Earth's atmosphere. Since the craft was
    to operate solely in the vacuum of space, it could be as ungainly looking as was necessary. Like the Socorro craft,
    it would be a two-man vehicle.
  </p>
  <p>NASA decided that the lander's propulsion systems would be tested at White Sands. They also expected to flight test
    the lunar module in New Mexico, according to a NASA history of the program. But over the years, the design of the
    lunar lander changed considerably and in the end Grumman came up with a huge, spidery-legged bug quite unlike what
    Zamora saw in New Mexico in <time>1964</time>.
  </p>
  <p>In his quest, Quintanilla even wrote to all the companies involved with lunar lander research in the field, but all
    their answers came back negative. No lunar lander was operational in April of 1964.
  </p>
  <p>In the end, Quintanilla, forced to pronounce judgment on the case, labeled it "Unidentified." He did this although
    he felt that many essential elements of the case were missing, "intangible elements that were impossible to check."
    Writing in a journal called <em>Studies in Intelligence</em> in 1966, Quintanilla did not for a minute doubt
    Zamora's reliability: "He is a serious police officer, a pillar of his church, and a man well versed in recognizing
    airborne vehicles in his area. He is puzzled by what he saw, and frankly, so are we. THis is the best-documented
    case on record, and still we have been unable, in spite of thorough investigation, to find the vehicle or other
    stimulus that scared Zamora to the point of panic."
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Corroborating Witnesses</h2>
  <p>Determined as it was to explain away the case, the Air Force never tried very hard to find other witnesses to the
    Socorro event. But others apparently did see Zamora's object, including two men from Dubuque, Iowa whose testimony,
    however, later proved dubious. On the evening of the incident, the police radio dispatcher recieved three reports
    from locals who claimed to have seen a blue flame of light in the area, but he failed to enter their names in the
    log. An Albuquerque TV station reportedly received a call just before 5:30 from a caller who claimed to have seen an
    egg-shaped UFO traveling south toward Socorro. But again the caller's name was not recorded. Two women on the south
    side of Socorro claimed to have heard the roaring sound associated with the object, but they never saw the object
    itself.
  </p>
  <p>Two days after the incident, Opel Grinder, the manager of the Whitting Brothers Service Station, came forward with
    a fascinating, though unsubstantiated story. Grinder said that a group of tourists — a man, his wife and three
    boys — had stopped at the station late that afternoon and remarked that "aircraft fly low to the ground around
    here." When Grinder said there were many helicopters in the area, the tourist commented: "It was a funny looking
    helicopter, if that's what is was." The object had flown over their car, apparently heading right for the gully
    where Zamora had encountered the object. The man even commented that he had seen a police car — probably
    Zamora's — heading up the hill. But the man never came forward to identify himself once Zamora's sighting made
    the news.
  </p>
  <p>Years later still other witnesses came forward. Robert Dusenberry, who worked for Socorro Electric Corporation,
    claimed to have seen the object's departure along with two other men while they were driving by the "landing site"
    on that day. And several hours after the incident a master sergeant at the nearby Stallion Range Station of the
    White Sands Missile Range spotted a blue glow in the sky. As the glow intensified, the engine of his car died and
    its electrical system failed. But after the glow faded, he was able to start his car again. The glow had appeared in
    the southwest, just the direction the object was headed toward when Zamora lost sight of it.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The Sole Cry of Hoax</h2>
  <p>Only one person in Socorro actually thought that Zamora had fabricated the whole story and that dubious honor
    belongs to Felix Phillips. Phillips lived close to the landing site and was at home with his wife at the time of the
    incident. They lived so close, in fact — just a thousand feet away — that Phillips believed he should
    have heard the loud roar that Zamora had reported, especially since Zamora claimed to have heard it from 4,000 feet
    away over the sound of his own speeding police car. Although Phillips had several windows of their home open that
    afternoon, neither he nor his wife had heard any such sound.
  </p>
  <p>Phillips was the only person to regard Zamora as a hoaxer. But Hynek found the charge unacceptable. <q>Phillips was
    directly downwind from the gully</q>, states Hynek's official memo on the incident, <q>there was a very strong
    southwest wind blowing, and the gully is on the opposite side of the hill from where Phillips was listening. This,
    of course, can make a tremendous difference in the ability to hear.</q>
  </p>
  <p>In all the years, no other suggestion of a hoax would ever emerge. <q>It's shameful to pick on anyone as honest as
    Lonnie Zamora</q>, says investigator Ray Stanford today. "This man is as honest as the day is long."
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Theories and Explanations</h2>
  <p>Everyone believed that Zamora had seen <em>something</em>. But what was it? Despite the Air Force's own conclusion,
    the skeptics, like Donald Menzel, an astronomer at Harvard University and the leading UFO debunker of the time,
    thought someone had pulled a prank on Zamora. Menzel's elaborate scenario involved high school kids using a balloon
    and various chemicals to "get" back at Zamora for one reason or another. Years later, however, Menzel had changed
    his mind: perhaps, he thought, Zamora had seen a "dust devil."
  </p>
  <p>Initially, Philip Klass, a writer for <em>Aviation Week and Space Technology</em>, thought that Zamora had seen a
    plasma phenomenon related to the nearby high-voltage transmission lines. But he too changed his mind years later,
    and came to believe that Zamora had conspired with the mayor, who owned the property on which the incident took
    place, to make up the UFO story and attract tourists. If they did, it failed.
  </p>
  <p>Most people in Socorro thought the object Zamora had seen was probably a secret experimental device. UFO
    investigator <span class="people">Jacques Vallée</span> thought so, too. It was the insignia that Zamora had seen on
    the object which made him suspicious.

  <h2>The Insignia: What Could It Be?</h2>
  <p>Perhaps the most intriguing facet of Zamora's sighting is the insignia he clearly remembers seeing on the
    mysterious egg-shaped object. It's quite rare for UFO reports to contain description of any kinds of markings at all
    on the craft. Indeed, such markings are a particular feature of <em>man-made </em>aircraft for one purpose —
    identification. In theory, if we could match the markings that Zamora saw on the UFO with a known insignia, we
    should be able to determine the nature of the craft.
  </p>
  <p>Zamora's description of the markings on the object reminded J. Allen Hynek of a typical cattle brand, but oviously
    what Zamora had seen was no cow. <span class="people">Jacques Vallée</span>, who was working closely with Hynek at
    Northwestern University back in 1964, thought the insignia looked very much like the logo of <em>Astropower, </em>a
    subsidiary of the Douglas Aircraft Corporation. He had found the logo in an ad in a special computer issue of the
    <em>Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers</em> dated <time>1961-01</time>. The insignia made <span
        class="people">Vallée</span> suspicious. He had never heard of a genuine report of a saucer with an insignia
    painted on the side. This led him to wonder of the Socorro craft could be a military prototype of some kind. Like
    Quintanilla, <span class="people">Vallée</span> also suspected it might be a lunar lander prototype.

  <h2>Up, Up, and Away!</h2>
  <p>Larry Robinson thinks he knows what Lonnie Zamora saw that long ago day. Sometime between <time>1965/1967-02</time>,
    Robinson, now an engineer at Indiana University, remembers seeing a magazine article about a multi-state series of
    hot-air ballon flights. A map with the story showed the ballon landing points. One anecdote told of an amusing
    adventure along the way: <q>The balloon had an encounter with a lawman who they thought was going to shoot it out
      with them</q>, recalls Robinson. <q>The balloon freaked him out. They later found out he thought he was seeing a
      spaceship.</q> Unfortunately, Robinson has not been able to locate this article.
  </p>
  <p>Then in <time>1967-03</time> Robinson bought the <em>Look</em> magazine special issue on flying saucers and, for
    the first time, read the account of the Socorro sighting. The name Socorro was familiar to him because he had
    recently seen it on the map published with the magazine article.
  </p>
  <p>In <time>1968-06</time> Robinson saw for the first time the markings that Zamora had seen on the craft and
    immediatetly recalled an ad he had seen in another magazine back in 1963 or 1964 that showed a balloon belonging to,
    or sponsored by, the International Paper corporation. Their logo was a circle with an arrow made of the letters "I"
    and "P" pointing up. But he discounted a balloon explanation for the Socorro sighting because he did not know at the
    time that balloons could be so noisy.
  </p>
  <p>Then one day in the summer of <time>1976</time> Robinson heard his dog bark and a loud roar outdoors. When he went
    out into his yard, he saw a round object about 200 feet up. It was a manned hot-air ballon owned by a local winery.
    The ballon roared again and he saw a flame come from the burner that provided lift. When Robinson reread the Socorro
    account in February of 1996, everything fell into place.
  </p>
  <p><q>All of the observed effects tally nicely with what the balloon does</q>, concludes Robinson, who notes that
    these hot-air sport balloons were only a couple of years old in <time>1964</time>. <q>When the ballon landed, the
      pilots shut down the burner pilot for safety. They probably had the flat triangular platform used before <time>1966</time>.
      As it landed, il left three marks. The crew then set up a stand or heled the mouth ring to hold the envelope mouth
      open. In doing so they probably made the fourth mark and the footprints. They then relit the burner (i.e; the
      thumps Zamora heard) and refilled the envelope. The burner blasts sideways during refilling until the enveloppe
      lifts. This process probably set fire to the brush. With a possibly deranged cop hiding behind things, maybe ready
      to shoot it out with them, they beat a hasty retreat into the sky.</q>
  </p>
  <p>Robinson believes the markings Zamora saw on the object was the International Paper Corporation's logo and that the
    object was one of their balloons. But a check with International Paper's headquarters in Rye, New York failed to
    bear out this hypothesis. The International Paper logo that does indeed look like what Zamora saw was not used by
    the company until <time>1968</time>, four years <em>after</em> the Socorro incident. And it was not <em>red</em>, as
    Zamora described.
  </p>
  <p><q>I think I know what happened</q>, replies Robinson. <q>In balloon racing, the emblems on balloons must be
    readable from a distance to identify the balloon. The previous logo for International Paper would not suffice at all
    to identify a balloon to the officials. So the new logo may have had it's start here. Or someone else had a similar
    logo.</q>
  </p>
  <p>Or could the balloon have been a secret military project? An article by Peter Stekel on balloon pioneer Don Piccard
    notes: 'During his years at Raven (Industries), between <time>1962/1964</time>, Piccard devoted his energy to
    marketing the <em>Vulcoon,</em> one-man thermal balloons. Stressing his lack of security clearance at the time,
    Piccard says he worked strictly on sport balloons and had no contact with any of Raven's military contracts...
    Reflecting back to those days at Raven, Piccard thinks the company's sport ballon division was a cover-up for the
    military applications of ballooning. "The sport ballon program, which was not believed in by the Raven Industry
    management, was strictly getting this crazy guy who liked to fly in balloons and make cover. So, when one of these
    other balloons went down, it would just look like a sport balloonist." When the Navy terminated its contract with
    Raven, the sport balloon program died too. That was in <time>1964-12</time>.

  <h2>A Design with "Legs"</h2>
  <p>It is possible to deduce some information about the Socorro craft from the depression it left behind in the desert
    ravine. The object left behind four "landing pad" marks in an asymmetric arrangement. Three of the four marks were a
    couple of inches deep in the center with a mound of dirt two inches high pushed up away from center of each
    equilateral pad mark; the fourth mark was only one inch deep and ill-defined. It has been estimated that you would
    need the gentle settling of at least a ton to produce each of the pad marks left in the type of desert soil. The
    vehicle itself, then, could have weighed anywhere from 4 to 10 tons.
  </p>
  <p>Most peculiar, however, is the arrangement of the four "landing pad" marks on the ground. The marks suggest a
    quadrilateral figure with the distance between pad marks ranging from 9 feet 7-and-a-half inches, to 13 feet
    2-and-a-half inches. Significantly, when lines are drawn from opposite pad marks, they cross in the center at
    90-degree angles. A careful engineering analysis by William T. Powers in 1968 showed that the various measurements
    are internally consistent. Furthermore, Powers showed that if the center of gravity of the object was directly over
    the center burn mark, then equal weight would be supported at each midpoint of the lines drawn between the four
    landing pads — assuming the linkage among the "legs" was flexible.
  </p>
  <p class="answer">We must conclude," wrote Powers in <em>Flying Saucer Review,</em> "that everything argues in favour
    that a vehicle landed near Socorro, on four pads." Powers was surprised to find that the landing pads seemed to have
    been placed "to serve the convenience of those using the vehicle (the footprints, and presumably the door, are
    located next to the mark that appears most 'misplaced') rather than according to a compulsive attachment to
    symmetry..." And, it does so, Powers noted with considerable astonishment, "without sacrificing any requirements for
    good engineering."

  <h2>Insight into Lonnie Zamora</h2>
  <p>At the time of the incident, Lonnie Zamora was 31 years old, a stocky, bespectacled, 10-year-plus veteran of the
    Socorro, New Mexico, police force. No one has ever doubted that he did indeed see something on that fateful day of
    <time>1964-04-24</time>. And everyone has always had the highest praise for Zamora. To his supervisor, Police Chief
    Polo Pineda, Zamora was "a good guy," an expression that covers a lot of ground among police officers. Dr. Lincoln
    La Paz, who was director of the Institute of Meteoritics at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque at the time,
    had known Patrolman Zamora for 15 years. To La Paz, Zamora was an honest and reliable man. Sergeant Sam Chavez of
    the State Police, had the highest regard for Zamora's reliability and unquestionned integrity. He knew Zamora as a
    sober man who was dedicated to his work. And, supposedly, as if drinks had anything to do with it, the <em>last</em>
    drink Zamora had prior to the incident was two or three beers more than a month earlier.
  </p>
  <p>Lonnie Zamora's true name is Dionicio Zamora. He was born in Magdalena, New Mexico, on <time>1933-09-07</time>. At
    the age of 17, he joined the New Mexico National Guard and servied for 24 years. Though he never saw combat, he did
    help suppress some prison riots in the 1980s. Zamora joined the Socorro Police department as a part-time officer in
    <time>1951</time> and became full time at the age of 21.
  </p>
  <p>It seems that one of hte most significant UFO incidents of all time would change a man forever. Had this incident
    changed Zamora? I decided to find out. Locating Zamora was easy enough. He still lived in the same town. His phone
    number was the same and it was more that a quarter century ago. And at the age of 66 was still a working man. But he
    was very reluctant to talk to me.
  </p>
  <p>At first he attempted to dissuade me. <q>I don't even remember it now</q>, he said. <q>It don't do interviews
    anymore.</q> But he was too kind and gentle a man to insist and answered my questions anyway, however briefly.
    Zamora came accross as utterly sincere, though clearly he is still as bewildered by the incident today as he was
    then, 35 years earlier.
  </p>
  <p>I began the brief interview with a question about the length of the encounter. The litterature claims that less
    than two minutes elapsed between the time Zamora first saw the flame and the object's subsequent disappearance in
    the distance. But this seemed to me like an impossibly brief period of time to encompass the event, including his
    three attempts to get his police car up the hill. So I asked him if he remembered how long his sighting had lasted:
    <q>Yes, I remember. Oh, I'd say it was about six or seven minutes.</q>
  </p>
  <blockquote><p class="question">When you realized that the object was not an overturned car, what did you then think
    it was? </p>
    <p class="answer">I don't know. I didn't think nothing. I just ran, I didn't... I didn't... I was so scared, I
      didn't think.</p>
    <p class="question">What was it that scared about it? </p>
    <p class="answer">The noise. The appareance of the object.</p>
    <p class="question">What are your current thoughts about what happened back then, 35 years ago?</p>
    <p class="answer">I don't know. I don't think about it very much. I don't go there. I don't talk about that no more.
      But people are still calling me up about it.
    </p>
    <p class="question">Did this incident have a big affect on your life?</p>
    <p class="answer">It didn't affect my life at all. It's just something that happened and I just wen on from
      there.</p>
    <p class="question">Hiw king were you with the police department?</p>
    <p class="answer">Fifteen years total. But just for two years after the incident and then I quit. I got transferred
      to landfill, you know, filling in land. I'm still doing it today."
    </p>
    <p class="question">Has the town of Socorro changed since the incident?</p>
    <p class="answer">No, not at all. It's still a little town, nothing much.</p>
    <p class="question">What do you think it was that you saw that day in <time>1964</time>?</p>
    <p class="answer">I still don't know. It was nothing from here though. It's something from some other place, I
      guess. I don't think it was a secret project or nothing like that."
    </p>
    <p class="question">But the two figures you saw standing by the object, they looked pretty normal didn't they?</p>
    <p class="answer">I didn't see no figures. I just thought I did from way back up the road there. I didn't actually
      saw them. I thought I saw some coveralls there, but actually I didn't see them <span class="note">Two hours after the incident,
      when Zamora was first questioned about his sighting by <a href="/org/us/ic/fbi">FBI</a> agent Byrnes, Zamora was
      told that it would be better if he didn't mention seeing the two small figures in white, because no one would
      believe him. More than three decades later, Zamora still had a hard time admitting to strangers that he had indeed
      seen these figures. Or had he?</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="question">Did you ever figure out what those markins were on the object?</p>
    <p class="answer">No, I haven't figured it out. Nobody has, I guess.</p>
    <p class="question">One person has recently tried to explain your sighting by saying that there was a hot-air
      balloon race at the tome, and that what you saw was one of the balloons making a brief stop. What do you think of
      this idea?</p>
    <p class="answer">People have said all sort of things. At that time, everybody knew what it was. Everybody had an
      explanation. They said it was a 'pogo' <span class="note">a vertical takeoff and landing aircraft</span>, it was a
      hot air balloon, that it was a vortex, you know, one of those funnels that come down. They've said a lot of
      things, but I know what I saw. And it wasn't any of those things.
    </p>
    <p class="question">Have you seen anything else like it since?</p>
    <p class="answer">No.</p>
    <p class="question">Do you believe in extraterrestrial life?</p>
    <p class="answer">I don't know. Maybe. I saw something, but I don't know what it was.</p>
    <p class="question">What does your wife think about all this?</p>
    <p class="answer">She thinks I'm crazy. [Laughs]</p>
    <p class="question">All wives say that about their husbands, though.</p>
    <p class="answer">That's true. [Laughs]</p></blockquote>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Socorro incident stands as one of the most remarkable UFO cases of all time. Extensively investigated and
    thoroughly analyzed by some of the best minds of the time, the case is, notably, Blue Book's <em>only</em>
    unexplained case involving a landed craft and its occupants.
  </p>
  <p>There are several factors that elevate this case above most UFO sightings. The primary witness was a policeman and
    a highly trustworthy individual. A number of secondary witnesses also claim to have observed one aspect or another
    of the event, which occurred notably at close range in broad daylight. But perhaps most important, the event left
    behind physical evidence, holes in the ground and charred bushes, that were highly suggestive of a physical object
    having been present at the claimed landing spot. Another factor that casts this case in such a favorable light is
    what happened immediately after the sighting itself. No sooner had the object disappeared from sight than the first
    in a long series of investigations began.
  </p>
  <p>In sum, there is little doubt in anyone's mind that a real object was involved. But what was it? Many people were
    convinced that it was a secret military weapon or NASA device which made an brief emergency landing. But despite
    going through the highest channels, Blue Book director Quintanilla was never able to confirm such a possibility. And
    certainly, even if the secret had been kept from him, we would certainly expect to know what it was by now, more
    than a querter of a century later. But nothing like it has ever emerged from the black vaults of the Pentagon.
  </p>
  <p>Could it simply have been a hot-air ballon making a momentary pit stop, as Indiana engineer Larry Robinson
    suggests? <em>Possibly. </em>After all, as Robinson correctly points out, Zamora himself said it looked "like a
    balloon." But there are several factors that strongly mitigate against such an explanation. Zamora saw no basket,
    gondola, or platform under the balloon, no ropes either, and the flames that he saw came from the <em>bottom</em> of
    the object, not the middle, and they fired <em>downward</em>. Moreover, Zamora clearly panicked at the sight of this
    object; in his 13 years as a police officer he had never seen anything like it. Robinson insists the modern hot-air
    balloon was only two years old at the time of the sighting and that people were not yet familiar with the roar and
    flame of this new technology. No wonder Zamora was surprised. But if it was a ballon, how could it leave landing
    marks in the desert as if it were a 4- to 10-ton craft? Robinson thinks the impact of a balloon with a metal
    platform would have been sufficient to create these indentations. After all, he reminds us, the figures left
    footprints, too. "Were they overweight?" he asks.
  </p>
  <p>But one would think that such a mundane explanation would have been thoroughly investigated at the time. Had there
    been just the slightest chance that it was a balloon, Blue Book would certainly have jumped on it as their
    explanation. After all, Quintanilla was desperate for a solution. How could he — and everyone else —
    have missed something so simple? On the other hand, if Robinson is correct, who would think to ask a company that
    makes carboard boxes if they had a balloon in the area? While the balloon explanation is not impossible, it is
    highly unlikely. But perhaps not as unlikely as an extraterrestrial craft.
  </p>
  <p class="question">Could</em> it have been a craft from another world? The number of UFO sightings doubled in the
    month of <time>1964-04</time>, and this sighting seemed to be a prologue to the start of the 1960s UFO "flap." But
    if it was an extraterrestrial vehicle why then did it appear to be so "human" a craft? Loud roaring noises and
    bright flames are the exception rather than the rule in UFO reports. No, if it was from another world, if it was
    from another world, it must have been from our own — from our future perhaps. It's not clear, however, why a
    time machine would have to make so much noise and spit out such a huge flame.
  </p>
  <p>The truth is we just don't know what Zamora saw that day in a Socorro ravine. Perhaps one day there will be an
    answer. But 35 years later, that day clearly has still not come.
