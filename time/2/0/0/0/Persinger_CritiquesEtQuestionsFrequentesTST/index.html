<h2><a id="Introduction"></a>Introduction
</h2>
<p>Unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are contemporary terms that have been applied primarily to anomalous luminous
  phenomena (ALP). They display odd movements, emit unusual colors or sounds and occasionally deposit physical residues.
  When these phenomena closely approach a human observer, exotic forces and perceptions are frequently reported. Most
  ALPs display life times in the order of minutes and appear to show spatial dimensions in the order of meters. Despite
  their remarkably similar descriptions over time and across cultures, the transience and localized occurrence of these
  phenomena have limited their systematic investigation.</p>
<p>Explanations for these phenomena have ranged from social misperceptions and delusions to some variant of mystical or
  extraterrestrial intelligence. However the only testable concept that has been formulated to date is the Tectonic
  Strain Theory or TST. It states that <b>most UFO phenomena</b> (not due to frank misobservation) <b>are natural
    events, generated by stresses and strains within the earth's crust</b>. The phrase "most UFO phenomena" is
  emphasized because the primary measurement is still human observation and classification. Due to their limitations,
  overinclusion of events or experiences that are not coupled to tectonic stress or strain are expected. Highly unlikely
  but nonetheless possible episodes of extraterrestrial sources could be contained within that residual.</p>
<p>The TST was originated from inductive rather than deductive processes; the data themselves revealed the principle
  that allowed the development of the theory. Between 1969 and 1972 the several thousands of events referenced by
  Charles Fort were designated to several dozens of categories (Persinger, 1976; Persinger and Lafreniere, 1977).
  Because we assumed that transient, anomalous and dynamic phenomena required substantial sources of energy, measures of
  intense displays such as tornadoes, earthquakes and weather extremes were included in the analyses. The most
  consistent and strongest correlations in time and space occurred between what Fort had labelled "luminous phenomena"
  and the numbers of earthquakes. At about the same time we were completing these analyses, Paul Devereux had begun his
  field research and John Derr had focused upon the intriguing problem of earthquake lights.</p>
<p>A basic scientific motive, the understanding of nature and of the hidden mechanisms within it, has stimulated the
  development of the TST; it was never intended to serve a debunking function. The pursuit also has been encouraged by
  the prospect of practical application. If ALP are indices of tectonic strain and it generates earthquakes, then the
  possibility existed that some form of ALP, such as UFO reports, could be used to help forecast the locality or
  occurrence of earthquakes. A necessary consideration of the TST, although not directly related to its verification, is
  the consequences of both ALP and the beliefs concerning their origins upon human behavior and attitudes. They are
  often as important to scientific discovery as the physical principles themselves.</p>
<h2><a id="Large Scale Application of the"></a>Large Scale Application of the TST
</h2>
<p><b> </b> The TST predicts that most ALP and their contemporary equivalent, UFOs, are generated by natural geophysical
  forces. The major source is tectonic stress; it is primarily a consequence of the slow cooling of the earth. The
  stress occurs continually as a field within the earth's crust. However the direction and magnitude of stresses change
  over space and time. These changes induce strain within the local crust. In general the stresses are focused and the
  strain is induced within areas that contain the optimal geological architecture or that have traditionally undergone
  strain release. They include faults, rifts, many river systems and localities of enhanced compressional deformation.
</p>
<p> As stresses accumulate over time, UFO phenomena are generated. Generally there is a critical magnitude of stress
  that precipitates a sudden, substantial release in the strain energy: this is called an earthquake or a seismic event.
  According to the TST, <u>detectable earthquakes do not cause most UFOs</u>. Instead, both <u>UFOs or ALP and
    earthquakes are generated by the same process: earth stress</u>. Because earth stresses generally escalate over
  several months to years before earthquakes, most UFO reports should precede earthquakes. However variations in local
  stresses frequently follow strong seismic events; consequently a small proportion in the numbers of UFOs should occur
  during these adjustment periods.</p>
<p> There should also be a temporal distribution of UFO reports within the 24 hour period preceding and following
  significant releases of seismic energy. These ALP occur and have been called earthquake lights. If these ALP are
  generated by the same process that produces UFOs, then their properties should be similar. Even within classification
  systems (e.g., Galli, 1910, as reported by Terada, 1931) that were developed before the classic UFO period , the
  remarkable similarities between earthquake lights and UFO phenomena are evident. Major classes of earthquake light
  include luminous masses (some of which appear to rotate on axes); football or lantern shaped fireballs,
  metallic-looking forms; luminous columnar, funnel or trumpet shapes; and sprinkles. Comparable ALP are still reported
  today. The most recent earthquake-related ALP were documented by Marcel Ouellet (1990). They occurred around the
  Saguenay region in Quebec and were associated with the intense earthquake on November 25, 1988.</p>
<p> At this level of analyses, the TST's major limitation is similar to that encountered by any process that cannot be
  measured simultaneously in one place at a particular time. Although general patterns in tectonic stress can be
  interpolated using a variety of methods (Zoback &amp; Zoback, 1981), the simplest measure for analyses is the
  occurrence of discrete events that can be counted: earthquakes. Because the occurrence of earthquakes and more
  specifically the energy released by seismic events is assumed to generally reflect the amount of stress within the
  region, these measures are used to infer tectonic stress. Effectively the amount of energy release has been used as an
  index of strain. An analogous difficulty occurred in meteorology before the dense spatial grid of weather stations was
  established. Without the optimal instruments (barographs) and continuous measurements over multiple locations, the
  concept of a low pressure air mass could not have been envisioned or documented.</p>
<p>Despite the limit of direct strain measurement, there are precise extrapolations that can be generated and
  tested:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Because tectonic stress is never zero, UFO reports can occur anywhere but should occur more frequently in
    geological regions undergoing increases in stress accumulation.</li>
  <li>Because stress accumulation occurs gradually over time and then is associated with a sudden release, most UFO
    reports should precede increases in earthquake activity; in those areas in which strain continues to occur after a
    quake, UFO reports could also occur but their numbers should be diminished unless another major release of energy is
    imminent.</li>
  <li>Historical equivalents of UFO reports should have occurred frequently, especially in regions that have maintained
    earth stresses over decades or centuries ("window areas").</li>
  <li>Because UFO phenomena are generated by geophysical processes, the understanding and perception of UFO reports as a
    phenomenon is only evident within the spatial and temporal time frames required to understand seismic process, i.e.,
    hundreds to thousands of square kilometers and months to years.</li>
  <li>Any process or event that affects seismicity should affect the numbers of UFO reports; because some forms of
    seismicity are coupled to the solar cycle, UFO reports should reflect this periodicity or a subset of it, such as a
    single intense flare. Local factors, including large scale fluid injection into the crust or stress shifts (changes
    in major river, lake or reservoir volumes), could trigger episodes of ALP and UFO reports.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a id="Data and Procedures of"></a>Data and Procedures of Analyses
</h2>
<p>Since 1979, approximately 25 technical articles have been published that support the validity of the TST as an
  explanation for most reports within UFO or ALP data bases from a number of different places. There have been two major
  approaches to the problem. The first involves "local" episodes of reports within a diameter of 50-100 km; they include
  the Salisbury Uinta Basin episode during 1967 (Persinger &amp; Derr, 1985a), the Long-Vogel-Akers Toppenish Ridge
  Sightings between 1973 and 1977 (Derr &amp; Persinger, 1986), the <a href="/people/RutkowskiChris">Rutkowski</a>
  Carman, Manitoba occurrences between 1974 and 1977 (Persinger &amp; Derr, 1985b), the Rutledge New Madrid field study
  of 1973 (Persinger, 1988a) and the Zeitoun, Egypt phenomena that were reported during the years 1968 and 1969 (Derr
  &amp; Persinger, 1989a). </p>
<p>The second approach involves larger areas of space. These analyses have included the central-eastern U.S.A. record
  between 1945 and 1966 (Persinger, 1980; 1981a; 1983a), the Washington-Oregon analyses (Persinger &amp; Derr, 1984),
  the Charles Fort United Kingdom period between 1850 and 1920 (Persinger, 1983c), the New Madrid Region 1945-1977
  analyses (Persinger, 1981b, 1983b), the 1965 to 1977 Swedish series (Mattsson &amp; Persinger, 1986), the central
  U.S.A. 1947 to 1966 period (Derr &amp; Persinger, 1990) and the Rio Grande Rift (New Mexico-Colorado) area (Derr and
  Persinger, 1989b; Persinger &amp; Derr, 1990). With the exception of the United Kingdom, New Madrid Region and
  Mattsson sources, the data for these analyses were obtained from the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS).</p>
<p> Initially the analyses involved numbers of UFO reports and numbers of different intensity (Mercalli) earthquakes per
  unit time. In response to suggestions by John Derr and Chris Rutkowski, two major shifts in conceptualization have
  been employed. First, measures of seismic energy release replaced the use of numbers of earthquakes. The reasoning was
  simple. Release of seismic energy is more theoretically related to strain release than the numbers of earthquakes. If
  UFO reports are related to strain, then changes in their occurrence must be related to the amount of seismic energy
  release. Secondly, discriminative validity was pursued. Although most UFO reports are likely to be natural,
  geophysical phenomena, data bases are probably heterogeneous collections of human experiences. By differentiating
  between likely sources of ambiguous observations from more robust descriptions, in a manner similar to the strangeness
  scale employed by David Saunders for the CUFOS data, classic UFOs and ALP should be most correlated with indices of
  seismicity.</p>
<p> For the local studies, three major questions were asked: 1) is there a significant correlation between earthquake
  numbers (or energy release) and the numbers of UFO reports?, 2) what is the distance of earthquakes that are most
  correlated with UFO reports? and 3) what is the temporal relationship between the occurrence of the UFO reports and
  the occurrence of the seismic energy release? To minimize the problems that occur by including the extremes of
  temporal distributions of data, most analyses were completed for the intervals in which the cumulative numbers of UFO
  reports were relatively linear. Usually approximately 90% of the reports within a collection occurred within this
  period.</p>
<p> Increments of one month have been used primarily because the duration of the data bases were relatively brief, i.e.,
  in the order of years. The numbers of earthquakes (or the amount of energy release) per month was compared with the
  numbers of UFO reports or ALP per month. To determine the optimal distance of earthquake inclusion, correlational
  analyses were completed that incorporated earthquake measures from successively increasing distances from the focus of
  UFO reports until the magnitude of the correlation coefficient peaked and then deteriorated. Determination of the
  optimal temporal relationship between numbers of UFO reports and earthquakes was completed by the lag-lead procedure.
  Multiple regressions were completed between the seismic measures per month and the numbers of UFO reports or ALPs the
  same month or each of the three months before or afterwards.</p>
<p> The second approach utilized much larger areas. Numbers of UFO reports or ALP per six month increment (usually
  January-June, July-December) were correlated with the numbers of earthquakes or the amount of energy released during
  the same increment and for each of three increments before and afterwards. For control analyses, seismicity of the
  surrounding area was often included. Contrary to the critique of Rutkowski (1984) and Rutkowski and Del Bigio (1989),
  all of these procedures include routine analyses and are neither complicated nor contrived; they do require a
  rudimentary understanding of problem solving. Over the last 10 years the following major patterns have been found.</p>
<h2><a id="Spatial and Temporal Relationship Between UFO"></a>Spatial and Temporal Relationship Between UFO Reports
  and Seismicity Are Most Evident Within Geophysical Units
</h2>
<p> Except for some peak periods in UFO reports, a simple relationship in time between their numbers per day and the
  numbers of earthquakes are rarely statistically significant or obvious. Retrospective studies strongly suggest that a
  rapid onset of ALP and UFO reports have occurred during the approximately 10 days before some unexpected (no obvious
  seismological precursor) strong earthquakes in a region. Within: 1) large areas at the level of states or regions in
  the U.S. and smaller countries in Europe and 2) six month increments of analyses, the correlations are almost always
  statistically significant. When temporal increments that exceed 1 to 2 years are employed, the strength of the
  correlation weakens. When the area of inclusion exceeds regional geological boundaries of seismic patterns, the
  coefficients are diluted.</p>
<p> For six month increments the magnitudes of the coefficients between numbers of seismic events and numbers of UFO
  reports has ranged between 0.50 and 0.70 and usually involved 15 to 20 years (30 to 40 cases) of successive intervals.
  For fixed six-month analyses the strongest coefficients have been between the numbers of earthquakes and the numbers
  of UFO reports during <u>the previous six month interval</u>. These results support the hypothesis that both UFO
  reports and earthquakes are caused by stress and that UFO reports are generated by the temporally evolving processes
  that precede and create earthquakes.</p>
<p>More recent analyses of the Rio Grande Rift System and the central U.S.A. indicate that the numbers of UFO reports
  were significantly correlated (0.60 to 0.75) with the <u>amount of seismic energy release</u> within the region but
  <u>not within surrounding regions</u> that served as control areas. For these studies and for the Denver (Derby)
  episode between 1962 and 1967 (Derr &amp; Persinger, 1989), substantial increases in UFO reports occurred when the
  imminent energy release exceeded 1 x 10<sup>17</sup> ergs within a six month period or some variant of it. Because
  natural forces do not conform to arbitrary temporal increments (6 months) of analyses, the UFO-energy relationship is
  likely to be higher; in fact with variable interval analyses that optimally partition continuous intervals into
  increments of shared variance, the correlations between numbers of ALP and the amount of seismic energy release were
  marginally higher (0.70 to 0.80).</p>
<p> Even when the "local" episodes of UFO reports are analyzed, the optimal increments of analyses still involve months
  and the distances include hundreds of square kilometers. In all six of the these analyses, the UFO flap that generated
  the record keeping was associated with the most energetic seismic release in the region. Although the number of
  localities are too small to be conclusive, it is interesting that the optimal distances of earthquake inclusion that
  was required to obtain the strongest correlations between UFO reports and seismicity involved between 100 and 200 km
  within the Western U.S.A. and between 500 and 700 km for the central U.S.A.</p>
<p> These patterns support the hypothesis that the organization of the crust may in large part determine the effective
  "region" for analysis. In areas, such as the western U.S.A. (Uinta Basin, Toppenish Ridge) the crust is a collection
  of small accretions whereas in the central U.S.A. the crust involves a much larger plate that may be affected by
  extreme load variations on major river systems. This variability in the earth's crust must be accommodated in order to
  test the TST appropriately.</p>
<p>Determination of the optimal increment of space and time in order to perceive a phenomenon is a routine procedure in
  science. In order to perceive the gestalt of mountain one must not be too close or to distant. In order to perceive
  the action potential of a neuron the increments of time must be neither too brief (or the event is displayed as a
  horizontal line) nor too expanded (or the event transmutes into a vertical line). If UFO phenomena are coupled to
  geophysical processes, then the causality would be most apparent when the dimensions and temporal properties of the
  local stress fields are identified.</p>
<p>What does such a temporal and spatial perspective imply for UFO research? At too large a level of analyses, several
  strain fields are included and the maximum relationship may be obscured. At the optimal level, the relationship
  becomes clear (Figure 2). However as the spatial frame is reduced to the level of the local researcher and the time
  frame approaches the duration of human interest and activity, the relationship between UFO reports and earthquake
  activity is totally dissociated. Without fixed and reliable stations of data collection, in a manner similar to those
  required for weather forecasting, the picture will continue to be fragmented.</p>
<h2><a id="Equivalents of UFO Phenomena Have Occurred During"></a>Equivalents of UFO Phenomena Have Occurred During
  Historical Periods of Tectonic Stress Release
</h2>
<p>Although the term flying saucer and UFO emerged around 1947, UFO phenomena existed long before this period. Because
  human reports of anomalous phenomena are affected by the beliefs and expectations of the period, these phenomenon have
  been obscured. For example before the earthquake of 1663 in Quebec, people saw "fires, torches, and flaming globes,
  which sometimes fell to the earth and sometimes dissolved in the air...they saw fires of this sort five or six times
  at night". "Terrible specters" were also seen. Not surprisingly, there were the more strange antecedent psi-like
  experiences such as "wakening in her cabin while all other slept, she heard a distinct and articulated voice that said
  to her 'In two days, marvellous and astonishing things will come to pass'".</p>
<p>Comparisons of the numbers of UFO reports after 1947 with Fortean accounts of "odd luminosities" before 1920 for
  three regions: western Europe (Persinger, 1983d, 1984a), the United Kingdom (Persinger, 1983c) and the central U.S.A.
  (Persinger, 1983e) have shown that both UFO reports and ALP were correlated with increased seismicity and energy
  release. Empirical equations generated from LP and seismicity within Western Europe between 1850 and 1920 predicted
  peaks in these events between the years 1930 and 1970; these peaks corresponded with the "foo fighter" and UFO flaps.
  For the central U.S.A., the opposite procedure was employed. Multiple regression equations were determined empirically
  between the numbers of UFO reports and seismic events for the years 1950 through 1975; standardized measures were then
  applied to periods (1860 to 1945) before that time. Predicted peak periods of UFO reports were associated with Fortean
  reports of LP as well as the infamous mysterious airship episodes.</p>
<p>Although the 1896-1897 airship episode is certainly anecdotal and has been considered a hoax by some researchers, the
  geophysical conditions that were associated with the airship episode are commensurate with both the hypotheses and
  corollaries of the TST. Approximately 80 to 90% of these reports of odd lights and "airships" occurred at night. One
  of the greatest floods to have affected the Midwest occurred during the spring of 1897, stressing regional river
  systems. Between January and May, 1897, reports occurred within dozens of central and eastern states. The events were
  associated with the interval in which unusually intense earthquakes had been occurring (in inference of major stress)
  within the region and were terminated during the last of April; on May 31, the intense Giles County, Virginia
  earthquake struck.</p>
<h2><a id="Solar-Geomagnetic Factors Modulate Seismic"></a>Solar-Geomagnetic Factors Modulate Seismic Activity and
  Hence Affect the Occurrence of UFO reports in Strained Areas
</h2>
<p>The presence of a moderately strong temporal relationship between the approximately 11 year cycle in solar activity
  and terrestrial earthquakes is apparent in some seismic data bases (Mazzarella &amp; Palumbo, 1988). Deep earthquakes
  appear to be significantly affected by solar acceleration while more shallow ones are not (Jakubcova &amp; Pick,
  1986). More precise analyses indicates that only specific types of earthquakes, depending upon the type of fault
  system and the level of stress accumulations may be maximally affected by some factor associated with solar activity.
  As Louis Winkler has shown with several unpublished analyses, the role of solar activity in the occurrence of both
  earthquake lights and UFO reports may be more important than now predicted.</p>
<p> The most likely "factor" is geomagnetic activity. The majority of the variance in short-term (minutes to days)
  variation in the geomagnetic field are changes in either speed or density of the solar wind; these parameters are a
  function of solar activity. Geomagnetic activity is measured by referenced scales such as the Ap or aa indices. Within
  6-month timeframes, the variability in global geomagnetic activity is associated with the numbers of UFO reports and
  they are associated with earthquake activity during the following six months. However the geomagnetic correlation with
  UFO reports is not significant if the variance they share with imminent earthquake activity is removed (Persinger,
  1985). This results suggest that <u>extreme variability in geomagnetic activity facilitates the numbers of UFO
    phenomena within a region but only if strain is present </u>as defined by the later occurrence of earthquakes.
  During the Toppenish phenomena, ALP were significantly more likely to occur within months when single daily Ap indices
  exceeded 100 (extreme intensity), but only if nearby seismicity was increasing.</p>
<h2><a id="Variable Water Loads From Rivers (Floods), Rain"></a>Variable Water Loads From Rivers (Floods), Rain (in
  Valley Systems) and Variable Volumes of Reservoirs
</h2>
<p>Derr and Persinger (1993) re-evaluated the association between monthly volumes within the Mississippi River System
  and local seismicity in context of the third variable: luminous phenomena. McGinnis (1963) had suggested that
  seismicity, within the New Madrid System, was triggered by initial rates of change in volume of the annual water
  loads. Derr and Persinger found that within 320 km of the confluence of the Mississippi System, the numbers of
  luminous phenomena (reported as "UFOs") per month peaked <u>three to four</u> months (r=0.87) after the river had
  crested. However because of the intrinsic cyclicity of the seismicity, luminous phenomena and water levels the
  occurrence of some intrinsic dynamic could not be excluded.</p>
<p>Extreme but infrequent river loads my trigger "UFO flaps" or temporally and spatially clustered SLPs. One such
  episode involved the Red River System (Persinger and Derr, 1985a) within southern Manitoba and Minnesota/ North
  Dakota. A marked increase in luminosities (red, orange or white "bobbing balls of light") around Carman, Manitoba
  during early 1975 was followed two months later by an earthquake within 100 km from the twin cities of Breckenbridge,
  Minnesota and Wahpeton, North Dakota (where the confluence of the Bois de Sioux and Otter Tail Rivers converge to form
  the Red River) that was the most energetic in recent history. A potential trigger from spring water loads upon the Red
  River Basin was implicated. Whether or not the most recent floods of May, 1997 will precipitate SLP in the Winnipeg
  area will depend upon antecedent strain conditions.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most active (in addition to the New Madrid Region) and focal areas for earthquakes, seasonal
  variables in fluid load and numbers of UFO reports is the San Francisco Basin. As an extension of John Derr's fluid
  hypothesis, we recently evaluated the relationship between January rainfalls in that basin and UFO reports. More than
  50% of the variance (equivalent to a correlation of r=0.70) in numbers of annual UFO reports was explained by the
  amount of January rainfall. The effect was strongest for SLP within 100 km of San Francisco. The multiple r increased
  to 0.83 if the geomagnetic activity entered the equation.</p>
<p>Variable water loads within other depositories, such as reservoirs, could also evoke strain and trigger episodes of
  luminosities. John Keel, one of the most creative and intuitive field researchers, had noted that UFO reports and
  related phenomena, such as "odd humanoids", occurred near reservoirs. To discern if small variations in strain could
  be associated with UFO reports, Derr and I (1993) evaluated the temporal association between water levels within the
  Grand Coulee Dam (Lake Roosevelt) in Washington state and numbers of SLP within radial increments of 50 km to a
  distance of 200 km. We found that the <u>change</u> in volume (whose absolute value was about 2% of the total depth of
  the reservoir, i.e., 44 ft) was the most critical correlate. The numbers of UFO reports within 50 km were associated
  with an increase rate of change during the same month while the numbers of luminous phenomena within 100 km was
  associated with the amount of change in volume during the previous month.</p>
<h2><a id="Sites Of Major Fluid Injection May Serve As"></a>Sites Of Major Fluid Injection May Serve As
  Quasiexperimental Demonstrations Of The TST
</h2>
<p>Most of the empirical support of the TST has been correlational analyses. Although techniques of discriminative or
  convergent validity (Anastasi, 1976) can be applied to insure the specificity of the relationship between ALP and
  earthquakes, most scientists prefer experimental designs that allow control of the key variables. Man-made induction
  of earthquake activity by flooding, fluid injection or irrigation can serve as potential quasiexperimental
  verifications. There are many anecdotal candidates that suggest the feasibility of this approach. An example is the
  temporal relationship between the massive irrigation causing the slow depletion of the Aral Sea (in the Soviet Union)
  and the nearby Tashkent seismicity and earthquake lightning.</p>
<p>One of the most well known cases in the U.S.A. was the Derby quakes; approximately 1000 of these events were evoked
  during the years 1962 through 1967 near Denver, Colorado due to injection of several tens of millions of gallons of
  fluid into the bedrock. Once the quakes were initiated, they appear to have continued, despite curtailment of
  injection, resulting in the most energetic seismic events of the region. These events were studied extensively.
  Correlative with this energy release was an unprecedented number of UFO reports within the Denver area.</p>
<p>John Derr and I analyzed the monthly occurrence of ALP within 100 km, between 101 and 250 km and more than 450 km
  (used as the control region) from Derby. Within the Derby region LP were positively correlated with the volume of
  fluid injection of the same month; however for the adjacent region, the strongest relationships occurred <u>2 months
    after</u> the injections. There was no significant correlation between LP beyond 450 km and fluid injection. These
  results suggest that the same stimulus (fluid injection) that evoked earthquakes also evoked ALP. Our (Derr and
  Persinger, 1990b) analyses also strongly suggested that some process, coupled to the production of ALP, was diffusing
  away from the injection site at speeds between 50 and 100 km/month to distances as far as 300 km.</p>
<p>The possibility the man-made fluid injections could induce an aseismically propagating hydrological pulse that would
  be the physical manifestation of the hypothetical "strain field" was explored more fully within the areas of Attica,
  New York, Rangely, Colorado, Sanford (Amarillo), Texas and Hanford, Washington. Each of these areas had been subjected
  to man-made fluid injection by either aqueous loading of a lake or forced injection of millions to billions of gallons
  of fluid into crustal vaults. Luminous events, reported as UFOs, within 100 km of the injection sites peaked within
  two years. At larger radial distances, between 101 and 200 km and 201 km and 300 km, the peaks in UFO reports occurred
  after two years and were less intense. The results were consistent with the radial propagation of a strain field whose
  magnitude and speed diminished non-linearly with distance.</p>
<p>That injection of billions of gallons of fluid into oil fields, in order to enhance recovery of petroleum, may have
  been and may be <u>a</u> trigger for luminous displays such as the Marfa (Texas) lights can be demonstrated
  empirically. However quantitative data that includes the amount of fluid injected, the rate of fluid injected and the
  local tectonic strain status would be required in order to predict the occurrence of these lights. For most of these
  areas the natural topography encourages the occurrence of SLP. Frequently, there are historical antecedents or
  culturally-described references to these luminous events within the legends of Native Americans. Contemporary
  technology simply enhances the frequency and amplitude of the occurrences of the LP.</p>
<h2><a id="Implications of Luminous Phenomena (and UFO"></a>Implications of Luminous Phenomena (and UFO reports)
  Created by Man-Made Fluid Injections
</h2>
<p>There are four immediate implications that could be considered if fluid injections can evoke propagating strain
  fields. First, from a mundane but historical perspective, could the infamous 1947 observations that resulted in the
  term "flying saucers" have been initiated by man-made factors? These observations, that began in the western portion
  of Washington state, occurred approximately three years after the deposition of radioactive fluids into crustal vaults
  near Hanford, Washington.</p>
<p>Secondly, the possibility that injection of millions of gallons of fluid can propagate 100s of km from the site
  suggests that reports of LP could be employed as markers of diffusion from storage sites. Third, if components of the
  fluid propagate with the strain field, the constituents of some <u>single</u> UFO events could contain these
  materials. For example, would the infrequent episodes of radioactive burns or poisoning from animals or humans who
  were proximal to luminosities occur near sites where radioactive material was injected into crustal vaults? To answer
  these implications prudence rather than panic is required; such questions demand empirical analyses and evaluation.
</p>
<p>Fourth, any area where fluid injection or accumulation is occurring could become an experimental site to test the
  tectonic strain hypothesis. One candidate area, Marmora (near Peterborough), Ontario has been the site of luminous
  displays (reported as apparitions of the Virgin Mary), odd electromagnetic events, episodes of "visitations by small
  humanoids around the bed" and classic SLP. The spatial adjacent magnetite mine and quarries have been filling with
  water (several millions of gallons per month). Preliminary analyses have indicated (since 1995) an association between
  the numbers of reports of luminous experiences and seismicity within the region.</p>
<h2><a id="Visualization of the Moving Strain"></a>Visualization of the Moving Strain Field
</h2>
<p>Fields are difficult to perceive and must be both inferred and revealed by discrete effects upon matter. For example
  the presence of the field between the poles of a magnet is not obvious, until its effects on the orientation of iron
  filings are observed. The passage of a low pressure air mass is not apparent, until one constructs the daily isobars
  (lines that connect stations with similar barometric pressure). If strain fields exist, they would be apparent by
  viewing the weekly or monthly changes in the numbers of LP in space as the field moves through the crust.</p>
<p> In both the Uinta and Toppenish episodes, where earthquakes occurred in a quasicircular distribution around the
  concentration of ALP, they occurred primarily in the period between a seismic event on one side of the circle and a
  subsequent earthquake on the opposite side. This effect might be explained by the movement of a strain field; while
  moving between stress-release (epicenter) points, it traversed through the focal area and generated the ALP. Once the
  field passed through the area, the ALP were no longer produced and consequently UFOs were no longer reported.</p>
<p> The concept of a strain field existing around an epicenter is supported for <u>some</u> larger earthquakes.
  Earthquake lights are known to occur at distances of approximately 500 km from the epicenter of more intense seismic
  events. However, a moving strain field that converges upon an imminent epicenter would be more convincing. This
  pattern has been shown for some larger magnitude events. For example, the distance between all LP in the region and an
  imminent epicenter (near Tucumcari, New Mexico) gradually decreased over several months. For another intense seismic
  event within that region (Los Alamos) there were no ALP within 100 km of the imminent epicenter 15 to 21 months before
  the quake. Ten LP were observed during the period 7 months to 14 months before quake. However about 50 ALP were
  reported during the six month period that preceded the quake. After the quake, there were significantly fewer ALP and
  their distribution was totally random.</p>
<p>Of course the movement of a field-like pattern could have alternative, geophysical explanations. One of them, as
  suggested by John Derr, involves the movement of ground water. Lateral movement and percolation of the massive fluid
  reservoir through the earth's crust can certainly affect the distribution of forces along fault lines. Alterations in
  the distributions or levels of ground water, especially along river systems in response to load extremes (floods),
  could affect these forces in a manner that would be very similar to that proposed for moving strain fields. Maintained
  injection of fluids, such as within the Derby site and many major oil fields, might also be expected to influence
  hydrodynamic factors. It is important to emphasize that at least in the Derby case, both the numbers of LP and the
  numbers of earthquakes within the same month were most strongly correlated with the volume (in millions of gallons per
  month) of fluid injection.</p>
<h2><a id="Limitations of the"></a>Limitations of the TST
</h2>
<p>There are reliable relationships of moderate strength that exist in time and space between numbers of UFO reports and
  the amount of seismic energy release within a geological region. Because both types of discrete events are produced by
  tectonic stress and strain and they are not directly measured but only inferred, the TST has not been demonstrated
  conclusively. The situation is analogous to the relationship between a fever and the later development of influenza.
  Although both the fever and the flu are produced by a virus, the association between the two is limited unless both
  can be related to the virus. The pattern may display strong reliability, i.e., there is a systematic positive lagged
  correlation between the fever and then the flu. However the pairing does not necessarily demonstrate the validity of
  the hypothesized relationship: the virus causes both. The limit of the TST is analogous.</p>
<p>Most of the evidence that supports the TST is based upon correlational analyses and procedures that require a
  moderate level of appreciation for multivariate methodology. This feature is shared by many other areas of science,
  including epidemiology, meteorology, astronomy and of course seismology. The temporal and spatial correlations between
  UFO reports and earthquakes are comparable to the association between: 1) radon levels and lung cancer, 2) alterations
  in stratospheric constituents and global warming and 3) foreshock patterns and seismic events. Sometimes phenomena
  that involve statistical processes are difficult to perceive and, for some researchers, frustrating to understand.</p>
<p>The role of cognitive style in problem solving and the frequent incompatibility between discrete and probabilistic
  thinking are important variables in this area of research. For example one experienced exploration geologist felt that
  for the TST to be totally supported <u>each</u> ALP should be shown to be associated with <u>a</u> particular
  earthquake. Such an approach is comparable to attempting to equate each cough with a particular spot during an episode
  of measles. Like any field phenomenon, some measure of the field's property rather than its individual constituents is
  essential.</p>
<p>The third major limit of the TST is the subject matter. UFO reports are based upon human observation. Consequently
  issues such as sampling, estimates of how many true UFO <u>events</u> are represented by a single UFO report, and the
  general problem of consistent recording of odd events (even an anomalous event becomes routine if displayed frequently
  enough) are potential sources of variance that affect the magnitude of the relationship between UFO reports and
  earthquakes. It is likely that if these errors were minimal, the relationship between ALP and earthquakes would be so
  conspicuous that statistical treatment would not be required. Sampling errors generally dilute, not enhance, the
  strength of replicable relationships.</p>
<p>An important difficulty with UFO reports is that they probably represent heterogeneous phenomena. Whether or not: 1)
  unidentified lights moving in a straight line, 2) rotating red balls of light with multiple smaller balls along their
  periphery, and 3) metallic-looking shapes originate from different sources of variance or are different manifestations
  of the same source (tectonic strain) must still be established. The presence of this heterogeneity suggests that
  single UFO cases cannot be used to refute either the phenomena (in the tradition of Philip Klass) or the TST (in the
  tradition of Stanton Friedman).</p>
<p>Whether or not UFO reports in one part of the world are comparable to those reported in another must still be
  addressed. Indirect evidence suggests similarity because historical episodes of increased global seismicity have been
  associated with "world-wide epidemics of luminosities". In North America, there has been consistency in the proportion
  of different types of UFO reports within the Uinta, Rutledge, Yakima (Toppenish) and CUFOS collections. Most
  classified UFO reports are odd luminosities, comparable to CUFOS' classification Type III through Type VI ; the more
  strange observations constitute less than about 5% of the population of reports. The strongest correlations occur
  between classic ALP and earthquakes; the stranger the observations the less clear is the association to imminent
  seismic activity.</p>
<p>From an extreme behaviourist perspective, the persistent correlation between UFO reports and seismicity may only
  suggest that anomalous human behavior (in the form of strange perceptions) may precede earthquake activity in the
  region. Escalations of UFO reports could be considered as a type of epidemiological phenomenon that is analogous to
  other forms of odd animal behavior that may precede some earthquakes. This hypothesis can only be excluded when
  construct validity between UFO reports and other measures, e.g., photographs, spectral analyses, has been
  completed.</p>
<h2>Mechanisms and Features of the Specific UFO Event</h2>
<p><a id="What is the actual UFO"></a><b>What is the actual UFO event?</b></p>
<p>The logical extrapolation from the TST is that the individual UFO event, primarily an ALP, is the transformation of
  the energy associated with mechanical deformation within the earth's crust into electrical, light, magnetic, sonic or
  even chemical forms. The transformation is in principle similar to the transduction of any energy. However because the
  earth's crust is composed of heterogeneous materials with different thermoelectric, piezoelectric and chemical
  compositions, the conversions are more varied. This multivariate factor predicts that a <u>variety of different
    physical mechanisms are involved with the generation of UFO events</u>. If different mechanisms generate different
  products, then the rich variation in the physical properties of UFOs might be explained.</p>
<p> Despite this multiplicity of mechanisms, there should be predominant modes of transformation because the earth's
  crust displays larger percentages of certain types of minerals. Because quartz-containing rocks are so widely
  distributed, the piezoelectric form is one possible mechanism. An equally common process would involve a variant of
  the nucleation reaction that is hypothesized to precede earthquakes. Considering the magnitude and forces involved one
  would predict that most UFOs should generate substantial electromagnetic fields that could include the entire spectra
  of light (and color), biologically hazardous ionizing radiation, and even quasistatic magnetic field components that
  are sufficient to affect lighting and ignition systems.</p>
<p>No direct extrapolation from the TST can predict what actually happens when the <b>quantum of strain</b> is
  translated into the phenomenon that is then perceived as a UFO. Does this quantum of stress translate into a
  microearthquake? Is the gradual increase in stress before its catastrophic release (e.g. an earthquake) associated
  with an escalation in the numbers of microearthquakes and hence the "release" of UFO phenomena? Or is the quantum of
  strain transformed into the UFO event in lieu of the release of mechanical energy? What is the ratio of
  transformations of quanta of strain that are directly observable, i.e., are the (visible) UFOs only a <u>small
    fraction</u> of the actual numbers of strain quanta? Are the others released as pockets of radon gas or
  electromagnetic radiation? There are no contemporary answers to these questions.</p>
<p>The physical properties of the UFO event should reflect some fundamental feature of the local earth's crust and the
  mechanism through which the ALP is generated. We should find that the predominant red color of ALP should reflect a
  frequent chemical property that accompanies the transformation of the quanta of strain. The involvement of
  sulphide-based ores would be expected to generate sulphur-oxide or methylsulfonamide (the smell added to propane gas)
  correlative with the LP. Involvement of outcrops of acidious quartz diorite might promote the release of the
  relatively common radioactive gas, radon, and evoke reports of "residual radioactivity". Enhanced gas emissions and
  chemiluminescence have been postulated to generate at least some types of earthquake lights (Hedervari &amp;
  Noszticzius, 1985).</p>
<p>One would expect that measurable residues of LP, when they touch the ground, should reflect the primary constituents
  of crustal material. The few metallurgical analyses that have been conducted revealed oxidized forms of the most
  frequent elements of common rocks: silica, manganese, and aluminum. Quantitative estimates indicate that only a few
  grams of metal (Persinger, 1984b), dispersed along a strong electromagnetic surface, would appear as "metallic".
  Interestingly, the temporal association between some LP reported during the nineteenth century and the deposition of
  "slag" or metallic fragments was frequently reported by Charles Fort. If the ALP had been labelled "spaceship", then
  these materials would be attributed to "spaceship fragments".</p>
<h2><a id="Local Displays of ALP Should Be Distributed Around"></a>Local Displays of ALP Should Be Distributed Around
  Areas of Stress Accumulation and Release But Be Attracted to Geometries that Promote Charge Collection
</h2>
<p>The occurrence of specific ALP is predicted to occur in topographies that are associated with stress release.
  Consequently LP should be more frequent along fault lines or their topographic equivalents such as rivers and creeks.
  To test this prediction, a comprehensive knowledge of the local structural geology would be required. The systematic
  pursuit of this hypothesis has been completed almost exclusively by Paul Devereaux (1989) and his research group. They
  have shown that ALP are distributed along fault lines. In the U.S. the only comparable study involved the collections
  by Greg Long (1990) for the Toppenish Ridge ALP. There are likely to be hundreds of keen observers who have noticed
  the relationships between very local and brief displays of ALP, fault lines and seismicity. Without the implementation
  of Ron Westrum's (1982) concept of a social network, the presence of these observers would remain obscure.</p>
<p>If the individual UFO is primarily an electromagnetic phenomenon, it should follow those principles. Verification of
  this prediction would require classification of the natural and man-made structures of the local environment along a
  continuum of conductors to non-conductors. Classic UFOs or ALP would be expected to occur over powerlines, near the
  apices of structures (towers, steeples, hills); they would also be attracted to moving semiconductors such as trains,
  cars and the human being. Although qualitative descriptions support the general hypothesis, well designed quantitative
  studies are required.</p>
<h2><a id="Local Triggers of LP Involve Any Stress-Relevant"></a>Local Triggers of LP Involve Any Stress-Relevant
  Stimuli
</h2>
<p>Although tectonic stress must be present to generate ALP, their acute occurrence will depend upon probabilistic
  processes or the occurrence of a trigger. If the former occurs, then UFO reports could be distributed in a less
  conspicuous manner over several days to weeks. However there are several candidates that can affect local stresses and
  force the production of UFOs into narrower and more conspicuous temporal windows. Major triggers are: lunar tides, the
  passage air masses and geomagnetic storms. They have been found to trigger earthquakes (Latynina &amp; Rizaeva, 1976;
  Kilston &amp; Knopoff, 1983). A focal strain field associated with the moon rotating around the earth travels in the
  order of 1000 km/hr. Passage of air masses (Persinger &amp; Cameron, 1986), especially very energetic ones, have been
  associated with some UFO flaps, ghost lights (such as the Hookerman phenomenon in New Jersey) and earthquake lights
  (Yasui, 1974). The role of intense geomagnetic storms was discussed in the last section.</p>
<h2><a id="The Strangeness of the Individual UFO Event"></a>The Strangeness of the Individual UFO Event Reflects The
  Perspective of Observation
</h2>
<p>Strangeness or unusual properties frequently emerge when a phenomenon's level of discourse is traversed. At the level
  of 10 cubic centimetres a glass of water containing lipid membranes appears clear and homogeneous. Within a 1 cubic
  nanometer volume of that same fluid, odd and unusual properties emerge. There may be some (hydrophobic) regions where
  there are no water molecules; in other regions the electric charge disparity may be equivalent to a million volts per
  meter and protein chains may twist and rotate continually. The phenomena are anomalous because the observer has
  traversed a level of observation and is perceiving an extremely minute subset of the total set.</p>
<p>An analogous situation is predicted to be responsible for the fundamental strangeness of many UFOs. Because the
  observer is viewing a minute subset of the total phenomenon (the strain field), properties are apparent that would not
  be discernable at a regional level. This prediction is more metaphorical then empirical. However it opens the
  possibility for the discovery of unusual physical forces or their anomalous application and perhaps unexpected
  interactions between the electromagnetic correlates of human cognitive processes and the UFO phenomenon itself.</p>
<h2><a id="The Observer's Beliefs Affect the Description of"></a>The Observer's Beliefs Affect the Description of the
  UFO
</h2>
<p>Most UFO phenomena are measured by complex human processes that involve sensation, perception and memory. They are
  affected by the person's expectations, beliefs and learning history. The more dependent the description is upon these
  processes, the more they affect the details of the original sensation. If the label spaceship is used to label an ALP
  the recalled details can slowly change from a bright light in the sky to an object with windows, to a craft. Because
  memory is the "measurement" of experiences, the person cannot easily detect changes within the system. The fidelity of
  memory, especially for anomalous events, has been discussed elsewhere (Persinger, 1983f, 1984b).</p>
<h2><a id="Does the Increase in Stress Before Quakes Generate"></a>Does the Increase in Stress Before Quakes Generate
  More ALP or Evoke Qualitatively Different Phenomena?
</h2>
<p>The general tendency for most UFO to occur weeks to months before the release of seismic energy suggests that their
  temporal relationship is non-linear. If it were not, then more and more ALP should occur as the imminent earthquake
  approached. The absence of general linearity indicates that some restricted amount of stress or a particular rate of
  change in stress, early in the stress accumulation, is optimal for the generation of ALP.</p>
<p> The analyses of the Washington-Oregon data (Persinger &amp; Derr, 1984) indicated that the greater the amount of
  energy release, the greater the temporal lag in the antecedent peak in numbers of UFO reports. Peaks of LP in the
  Zeitoun episode (Derr &amp; Persinger, 1989a) preceded the major seismicity by almost a year. In an analogous manner,
  temporal clusters of anomalous seismic activity may occur several years before the occurrence of a major shock
  (Yoshida, 1987). These results suggest a "critical zone of stress magnitude" that could generate ALP. Depending upon
  the duration that this zone was maintained and the movement of the stress field, LP could be generated for several
  weeks (<u>without</u> concomitant seismicity), but then become less evident for years before a significant <u>major
    event</u>.</p>
<p>Whether or not other kinds of anomalous phenomena are generated by tectonic stresses before and after this critical
  zone is not clear. Only one analysis (Persinger, 1982) has shown that electrical anomalies (power failures) precede
  ALP that in turn precede more exotic displays, such as poltergeist-like events. The conceptual and spatial
  concomitance of LP with poltergeist, haunt and other phenomena was observed in the Toppenish, Uinta and Gold Hills,
  North Carolina (unpublished reports by Wayne Laporte) displays. The interrelationship between UFO and
  parapsychological phenomena has yet to be explored.</p>
<h2><a id="Limitation Of The TST Application To The UFO Event"></a>Limitation Of The TST Application To The UFO Event
</h2>
<p>Although there are many similarities between luminous phenomena generated by compressional stresses within the
  laboratory and the ALP that could be generated by tectonic strain, a mechanistic connection between the two is less
  clear. The fundamental assumption has been that laboratory models are valid representations of large scale
  equivalents. This assumption is prevalent in many scientific disciplines. Unfortunately there have been no published
  studies by physicists or geophysicists that have applied the discrete relationships of the laboratory to the
  large-scale field setting. If the essential phenomena are scale invariant, then the lifetime of the average UFO
  suggests that compressional energies involve hundreds of square kilometers of crustal space.</p>
<h2><a id="The Close Encounter"></a>The Close Encounter Problem</h2>
<p>The issue of abductions by alien intelligence, whether manifested as the angels of the sixteenth century, the fairies
  of the 19th century or space creatures of the present period, is not critical to the verification of the TST. These
  experiences involve no more than 1% of the total data set of UFO reports. However the powerful association between the
  explanations of UFO phenomena and the occurrence of these unusual experiences requires objective attention.</p>
<h2><a id="Contactee and Abduction Experiences are Variants"></a>Contactee and Abduction Experiences are Variants of
  Beliefs In Mystical Entities and Cosmic Experiences
</h2>
<p>The experienced clinician is cognizant that the concept of the human self is a fragile phenomenon whose integrity is
  maintained by systematized beliefs and expectations. They produce the sense of personal purpose and facilitate the
  creation of strategies that diminish the apprehension of personal death. Belief in omnipotent forces such as God or
  more contemporary equivalents, such as alien intelligence, is one obvious consequence of these processes. An
  indication of the intimate relationship between these beliefs and the integrity of the self is the anxiety, anger and
  flurry of verbal activity that are evoked when the beliefs are challenged. Such systematized beliefs are so common
  that by definition they are normal. Beliefs that dominate a person's life are considered delusions only when they
  deviate extremely from culturally acceptable concepts. Psychologically, there is no difference in the belief that God
  protects a person from harm and the conviction that Omnipotent Space Creatures are spiritual custodians.
</p>
<p>Anxiety, depression and dissociation are common features of everyday life. Although the prevalence of the first two
  are apparent, the incidence of dissociation is less widely known. The intensity of symptoms range from the occasional
  "staring into space" to large periods of missing time. Approximately 10% of the population dissociates frequently and
  at least half of the population dissociates during intense personal events, such as divorce, death and occupational
  disappointments. During these periods the person may experience missing time and report alterations in memory.
  Memories can be reorganized such that they are no longer accessible to consciousness. When this occurs the concept of
  self is sometimes changed; in more religious traditions the period coincides with conversions.</p>
<p>If a specific stimulus was associated with dissociation, then a later presentation of that stimulus or something
  similar to it can activate these alterations in memory. Because these "altered memories" are often odd or personally
  unacceptable, their revelation generates anxiety; consequently there are strong psychological forces that prevent
  their emergence. The person may remain vigilant (anxious) or display depression. During periods of personal stress,
  these dissociated memories, modified by beliefs and expectancies, occur as experiences that are perceived as
  originating "outside" of the self. These experiences are perceived as real and are frequently ascribed to religious or
  mystical intervention. The consequent conversion in cognitive structure, alters the perception of the self and the
  sense of purpose.</p>
<h2>Anomalous Experiences that Comprise Contactee and Abduction Reports Are Correlated With Enhanced Activity within the
  Temporal Lobes of the Human Brain
</h2>
<p>Although all portions of the brain are involved with experience, the temporal lobes have a major contribution. These
  regions contain the most electrically unstable structures of the brain; they are strongly associated with meaning,
  memory, visual and auditory imagery and the sense of self. Extreme electrical stimulation within these regions is
  associated with altered perception of normal events, the release of dream states into consciousness, feelings of
  personal destiny, concerns about the meaning of life, the compulsion to proselytize and an intense widening of affect
  such that mundane observations, from a crescent moon to a misplaced bracelet become components of a common theme
  (Persinger, 1983f). </p>
<p>The lability of temporal lobe activity displays a continuum; people who display limbic epilepsy, defined by focal
  electrical seizures that may or may not generalize to motor convulsions, occupy the extreme end of this continuum.
  Most normal people would show intermediate forms of activity. However this can be enhanced by physiological states,
  particularly those associated with elevations in the stress neuropeptides adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and the
  glucocorticoid, cortisol (Persinger, 1989). </p>
<p>The personalities of normal people who display enhanced temporal lobe activity are dominated by its features. These
  people usually display enhanced: creativity, suggestibility, memory capacity and intuitive processing (Persinger &amp;
  Makarec, 1987). Most of them experience a rich fantasy or subjective world that fosters their adaptability. Many of
  them are prone to bouts of physical and mental activity followed by mild depression during which self-questioning
  occurs. These people have more frequent experiences of a sense of presence during which time "an entity is felt and
  sometimes seen"; exotic beliefs rather than traditional religious concepts are endorsed. With the exception of panic
  and post-traumatic stress disorders, there is no evidence that the incidence of psychiatric disorders among people who
  display temporal lability is any greater than those less prone to this activity. The delayed emergence (15 years or
  more after the enhanced lability) of schizophreniform processes cannot be excluded.</p>
<h2><a id="Any Event That Fosters Dissociation and Focal"></a>Any Event That Fosters Dissociation and Focal Temporal
  Lobe Activity Might Precipitate Contactee or Abductee-Type Experiences
</h2>
<p>Most human cultures have developed techniques that facilitate periods of contact with and "abduction" by mystical
  entities. The common factor of these techniques is the capacity to encourage temporal lobe lability: fasting, hypoxia,
  and psychological or physical stress are effective stimulators. Their general consequences are similar. With the
  details of culture removed, there is little difference operationally between an American Indian encountering his
  spirit guide and being taken to "the land of the spirits" and the twentieth century North American encountering an
  alien and being abducted. The fragmented memories, parapsychological themes, missing time, episodes of torment or
  inspired "messages" and sense of personal significance remain the same. </p>
<p>Because most UFO phenomena are assumed to be energetic natural sources, close proximity to them would preferentially
  evoke electrical instability within the observer's brain (Persinger, 1983f). The types of symptoms and their intensity
  would vary as a function of the current induction within the brain. As the current density increases the consequences
  would change from tingling sensations or sense of a presence, to odd smells or sounds and then to the release of
  dream-like images. At very intense currents, partial amnesia might occur and severe hypertonus or convulsions would
  ensue. Very intense currents would be lethal; unless precise postmortems were completed, the symptoms would simulate a
  heart attack. If the body was associated with burns, death would probably be attributed to a lightening strike. </p>
<p>Even though disruptions in consciousness would occur, memory would still be consolidated. It would be affected by the
  label and the beliefs evoked by the person to describe the ALP just before the stimulation. Once the neuroelectrical
  equivalents of these experiences occurred, a process that involves only a few minutes, the memories would appear as
  real as those acquired under more mundane conditions. Any form of extraction, from free association to hypnosis, would
  simply reflect what the person believed happened rather than what necessarily occurred. Considering the predictable
  manner in which neurocognitive processes adjust to brain trauma, alterations in the "retrieved" experiences or
  "revelations" should be evident as cognitive dissonance is resolved and information acquired <u>after</u> the incident
  is incorporated into memory. These processes have been demonstrated experimentally in a variety of psychological
  contexts (Stern, 1985; Rossi, 1986). </p>
<p>There are important differences between the effects of current induction that can occur proximal to an ALP and those
  evoked by more mundane sources, such as electroconvulsive shock (ECS). The latter is quick, discrete and occurs within
  a relatively familiar context. The experimental procedure that evokes experiences most similar to the more extreme UFO
  encounters is the electrical stimulation associated with neurosurgery. It involves very focal current induction (about
  1 cc) within the brain (Persinger &amp; Cameron, 1986). These similarities suggest that the magnetic fields associated
  with ALP involve highly localized, flux line-like distributions of energy. Most medical utilizations of
  electromagnetic energy, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, are not representative of this process
  because they emphasize homogeneity of current distribution. </p>
<p>Because ALP generated by tectonic strain could affect the brain of the nearby observer, <u>some</u> abduction and
  contactee experiences might be attributable to this source. Considering the variety of psychological and physiological
  conditions that can affect temporal lobe lability, <u>the majority of these experiences should not involve ALP
    directly</u>. They would be the subject matter of the experts who study human cognitive processes. In light of the
  strong correlation between life-time histories of dissociation during stress and early histories of physical or
  psychological trauma, especially between the ages of 4 and 6 years, these factors would be expected to predominate.
  For these cases, the TST is simply not applicable.</p>
<h2><a id="Experimental Simulation of the Visitor/ Abduction"></a>Experimental Simulation of the Visitor/ Abduction

</h2>
<p>Epidemic reports of "visitations" and even "abductions", as defined by experiences attributed to "being taken" into
  another dimension, have occurred periodically in human history. The succubi and incubi, were nocturnal entities that
  allegedly visited Europeans during the Middle Ages. The "victim" was sexually explored and even abused. More recent
  epidemics have included the fairy visitations during the turn of the last century. </p>
<p> The experimental work of Laurentian University's Neuroscience Research Group has been primarily involved with
  understanding the neurocognitive correlate to the "sense of self", perhaps the last major challenge to modern
  neuroscience. The clinical applications of this work has been focused to help patients with subclinical partial
  complex (limbic foci) seizures, closed head injuries and some forms of depression. These patients often experience a
  fragmentation of the sense of self, the "sense of a presence", the apprehension of "going crazy" and multiple
  physiological symptoms including anomalous skin blemishes and sleep disturbances. Unless the symptoms are relieved,
  the concomitant stress biochemistry can produce adverse effects upon neurons </p>
<p>We have been applying very weak, complex magnetic fields transcerebrally (across the hemispheres of the brain). The
  strength of the fields are in the order of 10 milligauss (RMS) or 1 microTesla and are much weaker than the 60 Hz
  magnetic fields generated by hairdryers or a personal computer. The critical feature of these fields is that they are
  complex sequences of patterns containing information to which neurons and aggregates of neurons respond. Traditional
  medical applications of magnetic fields employ very high intensities of very symmetrical, redundant and neuronally
  meaningless forms. </p>
<p>When normal individuals are exposed to these complex fields, particulary over the right hemisphere (temporoparietal
  lobes) for 15 min and then over the left hemisphere, they experience the sense of "a presence". The presence is
  attributed to cultural labels brought by the subject into the experimental setting. Some subjects attribute it to a
  "spirit", others attribute it to mystical sources. The affective polarity of the experience, i.e., negative or
  positive, will determine if the attribution is associated with a positive (god) or negative (demon) label. </p>
<p>Our working hypothesis is that the sense of self is associated with linguistic processes that are typically
  associated with the left hemisphere. From this perspective the proclivity for people to fight or die to maintain their
  language and culture is not surprising. Altered culture and altered language are often associated with a change in the
  sense of self. However there must be a homologue of the sense of self within right hemispheric processes. When it is
  stimulated and the neuroelectrical pattern intrudes into left hemispheric awareness, the experience is that of an
  ego-alien "presence". Effectively this "presence" is the other "you". In most people, the presence is the right
  hemispheric equivalent of the left hemispheric sense of self. </p>
<p>Because the right hemisphere is associated with emotion and employs slightly different neuronal codes than left
  hemispheric processes associated with the sense of self, the "presence" will appear strange but have profound
  affective significance. Because the right hemisphere is associated with hypervigilance and anxiety, the entity is more
  likely to be experienced on the left side of the body and to be "negative" or "scary". Women often identify the
  "presence" as "male" while men report the presence as "female". The microstructural organization of the feminine brain
  encourages this type of brief intercalation between the right and left hemisphere. For example the normal right-handed
  woman and left-handed man experience the sense of presence more frequently (by a factor of about 2) than the
  right-hand man within the experimental setting. </p>
<p>Although we have partially simulated the phenomenon experimentally, it occurs naturally. For example, during some
  dream (REM) periods following personal distress or during suppression of nocturnal melatonin levels (e.g., increased
  nocturnal geomagnetic activity), the sense of a presence is more probable. It is the likely correlate of the sense of
  "Muses" or "Inspiration" reported by creative writers, musicians, poets and artists when they remain awake during the
  early morning hours (usually between 0200 and 0400 hrs local time). </p>
<p>The results of our experimental work suggest an association between subclinical electrical microseizure activity and
  the abduction experience. Although we have some cases where the nightly visits of "scintillating humanoids around the
  bed" disappeared once anticonvulsants were given, the similarity does <u>not</u> imply that the abduction experiences
  are simply a pattern of microseizures. In addition to the sense of a presence, which is attributed to the contemporary
  cultural label and explanation--an alien, demon or other-dimensional creature--, there are gender specific
  experiences. Because the insula, adjacent to the stem of the temporal lobe, appears to be involved with the process,
  women are more likely to experience uterine and inner vaginal sensations. The propensity for pseudocyesis (false
  pregnancy) in woman who are highly creative and display elevated temporal lobe signs may be one of the etiologies for
  the "stolen" embryo stories that are characteristic of many human cultures. For men, the major representation within
  the insula involves the intestinal and anal regions. </p>
<p>Our approach has emphasized understanding the portions of the brain that mediate the experience. Obviously, we cannot
  totally refute or support the experiences of people who report they have been abducted or visited by nocturnal aliens.
  We are more interested in isolating the portions of the brain or the type of neuroelectrical activity that encourage
  the experiences. The next step is to determine the, very likely, multiple stimuli--perhaps some not yet discovered,
  that generate these experiences or their variants. The goal is to control the phenomena. </p>
<h2>Some Important Considerations If The TST Is Valid</h2>
<h3><a id="The Role of Belief in UFO"></a>The Role of Belief in UFO Research</h3>
<p> The only relationship between UFO phenomena and alien intelligence is that both concepts are strange. Although UFO
  phenomena are veridical and alien intelligence somewhere in the universe is probable, there never has been any
  evidence that the two are related. A connection between a "crashed vehicle" and the millions of UFOs displayed as ALP
  is even less likely. For centuries now, some form of "extraterrestrial" intelligence has been the default explanation
  for anomalous events that appear in the sky. ETI for UFOs is an empty hypothesis because the intelligence is
  functionally defined, like the existence of God, in a manner that can never be tested by traditional scientific
  methods. </p>
<p> With each added anomaly to UFO phenomena, the description of alien causality becomes more and more bizarre. One
  believer in the alien hypothesis commented that even if the correlation between UFOs and earthquakes was perfect, it
  would only show that spaceships are following faults lines in order to obtain energy to traverse the fourth dimension.
  No amount of analyses can compete with intense belief. </p>
<p>However if it were not for such beliefs, tenaciously defended with sometimes religious fervour, the UFO data now
  available would never have been collected. These researchers were like the early astrologers who obsessively recorded
  the positions of the planets in order to find their personal future. If those data had not been collected, one wonders
  if <a href="/people/BraheTycho.html">Tycho Brahe</a> and <a href="/people/k/KeplerJohannes">Johannes Kepler</a>
  would have had the data base to test their theories of the physical solar system. Without the dedicated believers in
  extraterrestrial surveillance, government conspiracies and ultradimensional intelligence, UFO data would not have been
  collected systematically. Inductive hypothesis, such as the TST, could not have developed. The history of science will
  probably reference them for their perseverance as the data collectors. </p>
<p>The emergence of the TST and other testable competitive hypothesis will no doubt begin, sooner or later, to erode
  this belief. The systematic collection of data will subside and the empirical pursuit of the phenomena will falter.
  Science will not necessarily compensate for this deficit because scientists are human beings whose behaviours are also
  governed by belief. At present the study of UFO phenomena is believed not to merit scientific inquiry and remains in
  the realm of personal belief. The mentality is reflected in the comments by an anonymous referee who reviewed a
  manuscript by John Derr and me; the referee wrote: the relationship between ALP and the release of seismic energy in
  the central U.S.A. is only correlational and if I had a choice I prefer to believe that they are alien space craft
  rather than caused by tectonic strain. </p>
<p>If the strength of association between two phenomena of such great potential importance, such as UFOs and
  earthquakes, were found in physics, medicine or astronomy one doubts if the potential would be ignored so
  conspicuously. However until UFO phenomena are divorced from their association with concepts that are couched within
  personal beliefs, pursuit of understanding will remain in the periphery of science. Only a few protagonists and
  antagonists will remain, often at risk to their own reputations.</p>
<h2><a id="Medical Concerns and Implications"></a>Medical Concerns and Implications</h2>
<p>There are two major implications of the TST that deserve ethical consideration. First, if most UFO phenomena are
  generated by tectonic stresses and they are associated with the release of anomalous electromagnetic fields and
  radioactive gases, should epidemiological studies be recommended (Persinger, 1988b)? There are dozens of anecdotal
  cases of untoward biological effects, including premature mortality, following close proximity to intense ALP. Most
  UFO researchers are informed of at least one local case of a person becoming ill or dying shortly after close
  proximity to an anomalous light, especially when missing time is concomitant. </p>
<p> These cases are likely to be the extreme representations of exposure to the electromagnetic correlates of the
  processes that generate UFO phenomena and ALP. Experimental data clearly indicate that even weak time-varying magnetic
  fields can affect DNA activity and cell division (Liboff, et. al., 1984). The weak but significant relationship
  between cancer, including brain tumors, and certain types of EM fields cannot be denied (Persinger, 1988b). If most
  UFO events are associated with potentially hazardous forces, then risk assessment is a responsibility rather than an
  option for the cognizant scientist. </p>
<p>Repeated exposures to ALP, when attributed to religious sources, may subject the experients to greater health risks.
  For example two of the three children who were central to the Fatima (Portugal) episode earlier this century may have
  succumbed to cancer. One of the approximately five young people who were integral to the Medjugorje (Yugoslavia)
  Marian apparitions (that anteceded the political conflict) developed a brain tumour (the typical annual incidence of
  brain tumors is about 20 per 100,000 people). The incidence of cancer near the present Marmora site was sufficient to
  evoke concern among workers within the adjacent mine. </p>
<p>Of course a prudent balance between concern and prevention of undue alarm is essential. Except in cases where there
  are multiple close encounters with ALP or in certain "flap" areas where maintained concentrations of ALP occur over
  time, the risk of health hazards will probably be minimal. Perhaps the question is best phrased by a specific
  possibility. Who will be responsible for the child who is seriously affected by a close encounter to an ALP because he
  or she thought it was Spielberg's ET, returning? </p>
<p>The second consideration involves the psychological status of abductee and contactee experients. The majority of
  these individuals should be psychiatrically normal. The stress of an anomalous experience can be comparable in impact
  to that associated with the confrontation of verifiable memories of sexual assault or abuse. The fractionation of the
  person's world view can be as devastating and the sudden realization that one's spouse has displayed infidelity. These
  problems should be treated by a qualified mental health professional. </p>
<p>If the TST is appropriate for most ALP, then the <u>belief</u> concerning abductions and contactee by alien
  intelligence is not valid. The encapsulated "abduction experience" would be no more real or unreal, once it has been
  labelled within brain space as a memory, than any other experience. Confrontation with the delusional origin to the
  alien experience can be as devastating to the person's psychological state as proof that God is fantasy might be to a
  religious believer. Suggestions to the person that he or she only "thought" it happened, with or without the proximity
  of LP, only demeans the person. There is no requirement to establish or "to prove" if an anomalous experience "really
  happened". For the therapist, the goal is to facilitate the person's adaptation.</p>

<h2>The Most Frequent Criticisms and Questions Concerning The Tectonic Strain Hypothesis</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Most UFO reports are misperceptions; consequently any statistical analyses between these data and indices
    of seismic activity are flawed.</strong><br/> The squared correlation coefficients or coefficients of determination
    reflect the shared variance between two variables. This shared variance can be superimposed upon a minimum score of
    0 or a minimum score of 500. For example suppose a correlation of 0.70 exists between variable X that ranges from 0
    to 10 and variable Y that ranges from 0 to 10. If you add a constant, i.e, 500 to each of these values, the
    correlation is still the same, i.e, r=0.70, because the amount of shared variance remains unchanged. If we assume
    that misperceptions are more or less random per interval of observation, which is usually the numbers of UFO reports
    per month or per six month increment, then the numbers of these misperceptions become a type of constant. The actual
    variability that is superimposed upon this constant is the primary association with imminent earthquake activity.
  </li>
  <li><strong> The Tectonic Strain Theory attempts to explain all UFO reports.<br/> </strong> The TST is derived from
    empirical observations. Because the label UFO is an overinclusive term which is very likely to include phenomena
    with multiple and completely different etiologies, the TST cannot be expected to accommodate all of the variance in
    numbers of UFO reports. Allan Hynek and David Saunders were very aware of the overinclusive nature of the term "UFO"
    and consequently, like other researchers, developed a classification system that primarily reflected a continuum of
    strangeness. The strongest associations between luminous phenomena or UFO reports and various indices of earthquake
    activity have occurred for Type II and Type III through Type VI reports according to the old Hynek-Saunders
    criteria. The most strange reports, which include the close encounter-abduction reports are the most weakly (but
    significantly) correlated with imminent earthquake activity in the region. <br/> One of the goals of the TST is to
    accommodate as much of the variance in UFO reports as possible and to discern which reports or types of reports
    deviate from the predictions of the equations. By isolating or describing the characteristics of these "residuals",
    perhaps we can discovery still more intriguing phenomena that will challenge Science and help the human thinker
    understand the universe.</li>
  <li><strong> The association between UFO reports and earthquake activity is derived from correlational and not
    experimental analyses and consequently is subject to the same criticism of erroneous causality that emerges from any
    correlational study.<br/> </strong> The correlation between numbers of UFO reports and earthquake activity or the
    release of seismic energy does not prove that one causes the other. Both the analyses of the data and the TST
    presumes that there is a third factor, tectonic strain, that produces both. Until direct experimental manipulation
    of physical processes that satisfy the construct of tectonic strain are completed and luminous phenomena are
    generated in a systematic manner, the critique of correlational analyses must remain.<br/> However large scale
    sciences, such as astronomy, meteorology or geophysics, are often limited by the size and energies required to
    simulate natural processes. Until congruent laboratory models are isolated, the most powerful tool involves the
    multivariate analyses of geophysical variables during the periods of luminous displays. Field studies within areas
    prone to luminous events, specifically when an array of instrumentation is present, serve as quasiexperimental tests
    of the hypothesis. Such experiments have recently been reported by Paul Devereaux and his research group.</li>
  <li><strong> How do you know that UFOs are not due to ETI (Extraterrestrial Intelligence)?<br/> </strong>We do not.
    For most people interested in UFO phenomena the ETI is a cultural default response. For example, the person observes
    an odd light. The first response may be the light is a helicopter. However if the light does not meet this criteria
    of this verbal label, another label is given, e.g., an odd meteor. If all labels do not accommodate the observation,
    then the label given by contemporary culture is "UFO" or flying saucer. Previous cultures would have applied the
    label "spirit", "natural sprite" or "demon". To date the only empirical similarity between ETI and UFOs is that both
    are odd or strange concepts. There may be and probably are ETI within the universe but there is no empirical
    evidence that they are associated with the types of luminous phenomena now labelled as UFOs. Strange is strange; it
    does not necessarily imply alien.<br/> The intrinsic error for some researchers is that the source of UFO phenomena
    is attributed to some alien force defined in such a way that it is never testable. Arguments that require premises
    which are "nonphysical" or "other dimensional" are empty hypotheses because they preclude any direct testing.
    Although one could argue that the strong association between odd luminous events and earthquakes are caused by
    invisible nonphysical aliens, scientific parsimony favours a more direct and cognitively congruent explanation
    relevant to the observed phenomena: some as yet unspecified geophysical process associated with tectonic strain
    fields produce SLP and ALP. Of course we cannot prove that the aliens are not there. The argument would be similar
    to positing the hypothesis that the luminous events are due to nonphysical, invisible pink elephants occasionally
    urinating upon the earth. You may not find this explanation aesthetic. However, prove they are not there. </li>
