  <h2>Résumé</h2>
  <p>Les partisans du <a href="https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/SETI.html">SETI</a> et de l'<a
    href="https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/O/opSETI.html">OSETI</a> ont depuis de nombreuses années
    acknowledged that some of the possessors of their much-sought-for extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) might have
    discovered this planet a long time ago and sent out probes (see <a
      href="https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/etprobe.html">extraterrestrial probes</a>) to investigate. It
    is noteworthy that funded optical searches for such probes in the vicinity of the Earth-Moon <a
      href="https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/L/Lagpoint.html">Lagrangian points</a> were carried out during
    the years 1979 and 1981-82, without success. In strange contrast, there has been a sustained unwillingness to
    examine phenomenological evidence that might suggest that an Earth-monitoring activity was set up by ETI in the
    past, and is still operating. This paper, which presents such evidence for consideration, is the result of over
    three decades of private research by a professional aerospace engineer.
  </p>
  <p>The work took the form of an extended technical feasibility study, which began, in 1967, with a detailed
    examination of puzzling local reports of strange aerial craft (SAC). The conclusion drawn from the initial studies
    was that the reported objects had been real, but had displayed characteristics that placed them beyond human
    accomplishment. As there was much evidence to suggest that they had been engaged in low-level monitoring operations,
    and that they had originated from the sky and returned to it, the study became global in scope in an effort to find
    evidence of a causative astronautical activity. This section of the study led, eventually, to the recognition of a
    programmed strategy of engagement with the Earth, which had apparently overlain all the reported SAC activities
    within the atmosphere. From further development and rationalisation of this strategy, an empirical theory evolved.
    This is now referred to as the Astronautical Theory for SAC Encounters and details of its derivation are presented
    here for consideration, together with information about all the essential preceding steps, beginning with the early
    "hardware" studies. In addition, papers describing further exploratory development by the author are listed in the
    Bibliography.</p>

  <p>It is acknowledged that the work presented here is exploratory and unfinished. The current theory is provisional,
    but tests of it with new data appear to be overwhelmingly substantiating, despite those reservations. The
    Astronautical Theory is navigational in essence. It defines long-established approach and departure paths in space
    and predicts the most likely delivery and retrieval times for fully-automated probes within the atmosphere, at any
    given targeted location. These predictions have been used effectively by serious sky-watching groups and by an Irish
    astronomer who has set up a specialised OSETI observatory to gather recorded observational data that may serve to
    test the Theory. </p>
  <p>It is hoped that this paper will stimulate scientific discussion and suggest hitherto unconsidered ways of
    detecting and recording the activities of automated Earth-monitoring probes, which appear to be operating from
    sources within and in the vicinity of the solar system. Possible locations for those sources (bases) may also be
    inferred from the evidence presented. </p></section>

<h2>2. Early SAC Studies</h2>
<h3>2.1 Background</h3>
<p>A sheet of sketches, extracted from the collection of such sheets, is presented as Fig. 1 (to come). As mentioned
  earlier, these were crayoned representations of artificial objects described by eye-witnesses - and attempts were made
  to show changes of appearance with different modes of operation. Sometimes, entire craft seemed to have been glowing
  and colour changes had been observed to occur between the hovering and steady level-flight modes. The structure of
  such craft had seemed to have been in a state of electrical excitation, with the colour of the craft apparently having
  been dependent on its propulsive-energy state. Orange and red luminosity were commonly associated with hovering or
  low-speed manoeuvring and the frequency of the emanation had seemed, at times, to increase with increased speed,
  sometimes progressing through the remaining colours of the visible spectrum. Another feature frequently described was
  a collection of coloured lights, often said to have been flashing in different sequences, or projecting beams outwards
  and downwards.
</p>
<p>Geometrically, the craft seen at close quarters were generally bodies of revolution about a vertical axis, usually
  seen at night. They had seemed to have been operating in low-level surveillance mode, just above the treetops and,
  therefore, in radar ground-clutter. Since the sometimes-observed mode of departure had been described as a vertical
  climb with phenomenal acceleration, this again seemed to indicate that the objects would not have been detected by the
  radar scanners of that time.</p>
<h3>2.2 Craft characteristics</h3>
<p>Following a detailed study and assessment of some 30 SAC reports (the number of which had been supplemented by those
  extracted from Ref. 10.1), the following characteristics of vertical-axis craft were listed:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li> They produced very little or no noise; </li>
  <li> When hovering near the ground, they had created only localised disturbances directly beneath them;</li>
  <li> Some form of self-glow was often evident;</li>
  <li> Rotation of all or part of the craft was often witnessed when in hovering mode;</li>
  <li> Radio and TV receptions were sometimes disturbed by them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Much of this evidence suggested that the craft had been propelled by some kind of electrodynamic propulsion system,
  which seemed not to be related to the external configuration of the craft. The same principles had seemed to apply to
  them all, even to spheres, and to involve electrical excitation of all visible components. There were indications that
  acceleration in any direction might have been related to increased excitation of the leading part of the structure.
  There were, also aerodynamic clues, which had demonstrated the solidity of the witnessed craft on several
  occasions―and a freefall experiment carried out with a model seemed to confirm this. That experiment is described in
  Appendix 1 (to come).</p>
<p>The geometrical characteristics of the vertical axis craft were compared and, bearing in mind that the propulsion
  system had not seemed to have determined their shapes, they were found to be divided into several distinctly different
  kinds. These are shown by archive Fig. 2 (to come). Beginning, at the top, with the spheres (a small example of which
  had been reported as having spun rapidly about its vertical axis), then moving to the right-hand side of the diagram,
  a progression of shapes, through ovoid to hat, is drawn. On the left-hand side, the flattening of the sphere to
  produce discus shapes is represented. These latter shapes seemed to be configurations designed for relatively
  low-drag, edge-on, flight through the atmosphere and could have been used for surveying large areas. In contrast, the
  former group of objects seemed to be suited to low-level surveying of particuloar localities and had probably been
  released from unseen larger craft, hovering in the atmosphere quite close by. Generally, they seemed only to be suited
  to vertical descent and ascent. At the bottom of Fig. 2 (to come), the genre shown on the right-hand side of the
  diagram has been linked to the disc/dome types, which were generally larger. However, the relatively clean "edge-on"
  aerodynamics if the disc/domes also related them to the discus types. It was conceivable that such craft were capable
  of surveying wider areas without having to have a carrier crarft in the immediate vicinity of their activities.
  Indeed, they may very well have been used as carrier craft for smaller objects on some occasions.</p>
<p><i>It is important to stress that all of these craft of the 1960s had seemed to be fully automated and unoccupied</i>.
</p>
<p>Exceptionally, the extremely controversial craft allegedly photographed by the Californian George Adamski, during
  1952 (Ref. 10.2) was added to this early diagram for two reasons: firstly, two independent witnesses had reported
  similar bell-shaped craft, apparently in free fall, on separate occasions; and, secondly, another engineer, Leonard
  Cramp (Ref. 10.3), had found, by graphical analysis, that a blurred photograph taken by two young schoolboys in
  February 1954 had been of a craft having exactly the same geometry as the Adamski craft. In fact, the Cramp analysis
  was used to create the model for the free-fall model tests described in Appendix 1 (to come). The Fig. 2 diagram shows
  that there was a possible relationship between the Adamski craft and the disc/domes. In fact, the author's own careful
  study of the Adamski photographs suggested that the craft could have been of a variable-geometry variety, designed to
  carry occupants, and with the ability to retract the cylindrical "conning tower" into the ball-like flange. In that
  configuration, interior cabin height would have been only about 4 feet (1.3 m), but even human-sized occupants could
  have reclined on low couches in such a cabin. The craft would then have had the external appearance of a disc/dome
  configuration. Another practical possibility, suggested by features of the underside, was that the bell-like flange
  could have been moved downwards, relative to the cylindrical centre-body, to enable the projecting three hemispheres
  to act as supports for a flat-surface landing of the craft.</p>
<p>Finally, it has to be added that it had seemed very probable that all the craft analysed had been carried into the
  atmsophere by larger atmospheric crafrt (as had been claimed by the apparently fanciful Adamski). It seemed
  inconceivable that they had had the ability to reach the Earth's surface directly from space, but there seemed to be
  no reasonable cause for doubting the reality of their existence. Examination of the areas visited during the 1967
  outbreak of reports in Britain and, again, in 1971, further reinforced that conclusion, as will now be
  demonstrated.</p>
<h2>3. Areas affected within the U.K.</h2>
<h3>3.1 Geographical distribution, 1967</h3>
<p>The significant SAC events of 1967 were plotted on a large scale map of Britain, virtually as they occurred, and the
  development of the geographical distribution pattern was watched with interest. For some reason, the activity seemed
  to be concentrated in South Lancashire, South Cheshire, and North Staffordshire. The publication of Ref. 10.1 was a
  great asset and expanded the list of significant events quite substantially. It was realised that the author's own
  location in the North West, and the fact that Ref. 10.1 dealt with Staffordshire events, might have biased the
  selection very significantly, but attempts to obtain reports from other parts of the country had produced only a small
  number from scattered locations in Southern England. The result of this exerise is shown by Fig. 3, which is presented
  as it was drawn during 1968. </p>
<p>A narrow band, only 35 miles (56 km) wide and orientated roughly magnetic North-South was found to have enveloped all
  the recorded significant sightings between the Lake District and south of Birmingham. The scattered events in southern
  England could be similarly enclosed within a band some 70 miles (112 km) wide, orientated at right-angles to the
  North-South band. (By an interesting fluke, the centre lines of these bands intersected in the vicinity of Stonehenge,
  Wiltshire. This observation focused attention on possible links with ancient sites which caused them to be regarded in
  the next exercise to be described.) </p>
<p>It was realized that the North-South band of events had enclosed the route of the M6 motorway, which had been only
  partially opened in 1967. New flyovers and feeder roads had been still under construction. The then-usable motorway
  ran between Preston in the North and Stafford at its southern end, and these limits seemed to correspond to the limits
  of the concentrated SAC activity. This was another meaningful indication that systematic aerial surveillance had been
  carried out. </p>
<h3>3.2 Topographical study, 1967</h3>
<p>The interesting result obtained from the distribution exercise led into another study. Judging from the attention
  that had been apparently given to the areas of great topographical change surrounding the M6 motorway, it seemed that
  a topographical study of each of the affected areas might be revealing. Using large scale OS and local maps, a search
  was made for high-profile human developments that might have attracted attention from high altitude. Each location in
  which a SAC had been seen at close quarters was scrutinized to discover whether any such features existed within 1
  mile (1.6 km) radius of the reported event. As an afterthought, ancient and historical sites were included in the list
  of significant features when it was remembered that Stonehenge had incidentally featured in the previous study. The
  features which eventually proved to dominate the exercise were, in ascending order of importance: transmitting masts,
  military bases, reservoirs, power stations, industrial sites, transport systems (major roads, railways, airports and
  canals), and ancient/historical sites. The results are shown by another diagram from the archives, Fig. 4. </p>
<p>The predominance of old sites of human occupation was totally unexpected, but, as this diagram shows, 77% of all the
  significant cases had occurred very close to <i>known</i> ancient sites (there are many such sites still not yet
  marked on British maps) and 50% of all cases had been linked with remains of the Roman period. </p>
<p>65% of cases were linked with modern transport activities, major roads, including the M6, featuring largely. Of
  course, the relative abundance of the leading features could not be established and, consequently, this could not be
  regarded as a truly statistical result. Even so, it suggested a speculative explanation for the activity―it seemed
  that the areas being closelt surveyed were those in which modern developments were impinging upon and, sometimes,
  modifying the topography of those ancient landmarks. This led to the speculation that, perhaps, those ancient
  landmarks (linked with human activity over the centuries) had been used, from ancient times, as navigational markers
  for terrain-following and fully-automated reconnaissance craft―and whenever such sites were interfered with, it became
  necessary to re-program the onboard computers with the new topography. Consequently, it seemed that the then-suspected
  automated monitoring of human activities by ETIs had become even more feasible and resulted in continuation of the
  study. British SAC reports were then collected and studied until 1973. Another intense outbreak of aerial activity
  occurred in 1971 and the results from the study of that will be given next. </p>
<h3>3.3 Geographical distribution, 1971</h3>
<p>The outbreak of SAC activity in 1971 produced another interesting distribution result, as shown by archive Fig. 5.
  The North-South orientation of the very narrow band of events in North West England and the Midland was slightly more
  skewed than previously, but, again, followed the course of the M6 very closely. The nature of the events was generally
  less spectacular, with few close encounters reported. </p>
<h2>Les études de bolides</h2>
<p>British UFO reports during the 7-year period from 1967 to 1973 included a significant number of fireball events. The
  reported objects were often very mysterious and seemed to defy any mundane explanation. Descriptions given suggested
  that they were balls of highly energetic plasma, which were sometimes huge and blindingly brilliant. Usually, they had
  had no meteoric trails, they had been often slow-moving and, sometimes, had seemed to have been under intelligent
  control. Their colours had ranged from red, through green, blue, and white. As their brilliance had been so intense
  and sometimes flooded the countryside with light, and they had invariably occurred in still air conditions, they were
  obviously not forms of ball lightning. Furthermore, they had sometimes occurred suring periods of reported SAC
  activity. During 1974, the dates of these events were studied and a diagram was produced to compare them. This diagram
  is reproduced as archive Fig. 6. </p>

</table>
<p>From the diagram, it becomes very noticeable that no fireball reports had been recorded for 1970 and the outbreaks
  had been sporadic and infrequent during the other years. However, it became apparent that clustering had sometimes
  occurred. Further examination revealed that, overall, fireballs had been reported within +/- 6 days of 10
  equally-spaced dates of the year. This was an intriguing discovery, but it was suspected that those dates might be
  found to correspond with well-known periodic meteor showers. To investigate that possibility, the following table was
  produced. </p>
<p>A study of this table quickly dismissed the idea that the fireballs might have been positively associated with the
  well-known periodic meteor showers. Five of the ten fireball dates had no obvious connection with periodic meteors.
  Three others were sufficiently removed from the usual meteor periods of those months to be regarded as being
  unconnected. In fact, only fireballs of August and October might have been explained as being meteor-related. All
  aspects considered, it seemed that the fireball activity might have been intelligently contrived and, sometimes, had
  been circumstantially associated with SAC activity.
</p>
<p>Although this exercise was an interesting diversion from the main study, it was later to influence the manner in
  which the ensuing global study was conducted. </p>
<h2>L'étude globale sur les SAC</h2>
<h3>Collecte initiale des données</h3>
<p>En <time>1973</time> le besoin d'une étude étendue des événements mondiaux était devenu plus qu'évident. Si les SAC
  venaient de l'espace, comme l'étude britannique n'avait si clairement indiquée, il serait nécessaire d'examiner des
  rapports individuels d'autres continents et de rechercher des indices significatifs de schémas de surveillance
  globale. A cette époque, l'auteur avait été associé avec le groupe de recherché <a
    href="/org/uk/asso/DIGAP.html">DIGAP </a> basé à Manchester pendant 6 ans. Un des membres de ce groupe, <span
    class="people">Peter Rogerson</span>, un bibliothécaire, avait pendant des années compilé un <a
    href="/time/Catalogues.html">catalogue</a> des événements ovnis les plus étranges répertoriés, dans le monde entier,
  depuis le milieu des années 1800s. En <time>1973</time>, le <a
    href="/time/Catalogues.html">catalogue</a> de <span class="people">Rogerson</span>, IntCat, fut arrangé en série par
  le magazine de recherche amateur MUFOB (<em>Merseyside UFO Bulletin</em>). <span
    class="people">Peter Rogerson</span> fournit des numéros complémentaires de ce magazine pour permettre aux donneés
  d'être extraites. Cet acte généreux donna l'impulsion de lancer l'étude globale proposée.</p>
<p>L'année suivante, 150 événements SAC significatifs de la période de <time>1868/1954</time> purent être sélectionnés
  de divers numéros du MUFOB et les données pertinentes furent alors tabulées pour traitement. Pour chaque événement, la
  localisation en latitude/longitude dû être déterminée et le fuseau horaire identifié. Ceci se révéla être un processus
  très testeur, car certains des lieux étaient obscurs et les fuseaux horaires furent difficiles à déterminer, en
  particulier lorsque les événements avaient eut lieu à la fin des années 1800s. Parfois des approximations durent être
  faites : par exemple, si la ville importante la plus proche avait été mentionnée dans le rapport, la
  latitude/longitude de cette ville devait être utilisée, étant donnée l'absence de toute autre information — et les
  mêmes suppositions dûrent être faites sur le fuseau horaire. Certains cas très bons durent être omis de la liste
  initiale parce que les lieux ne pouvaient être déterminés. Le manque d'heures fiables amenèrent d'autres cas à être
  omis de la base de données créée pour un exercice ultérieur crucial.</p>
<p>Malheureusement, la publication sérialisée de IntCat fut soudainement interrompue lorsque l'edito du MUFOB déménagea
  en un autre lieu et on ne savait pas si la publication se poursuivrait. Cela signifiait que la disponibilité des
  événements catalogués ultérieurs à <time>1954</time> devenaient incertaine. Cependant, l'expansion de la base de
  données globale fut alors facilitatée par la publication d'un autre <a
    href="/time/Catalogues.html">catalogue</a> d'événements globaux significatifs par un groupe de recherche amateur du
  Staffordhsire (réf. 10.4). Comme pour IntCat, l'utilisation de ce nouveau <a
    href="/time/Catalogues.html">catalogue</a> fut facilité par l'association de l'auteur au <a
    href="/org/uk/asso/DIGAP.html">DIGAP</a>. </p>
<p>Des rapports intéressants pour la période de <time>1954/1971</time> furent progressivement extraits de la réf 10.4
  pour étendre la base de données globale à quelques 450 cas. L'annexe 2 (à venir) donne des exemples de cas extraits
  des 2 sources. Les listings ForTran furent créés en 1980, mais seuls quelques cas de test furent traités par un
  ordinateur mainframe.
</p>
<h3>Traitement initial des données globales</h3>
<p>Au début, le traitement commença en des tracés des lieux d'événements extraits des enregistrements IntCat sur une
  grande représentation par latitude/longitude cartésienne du monde. Ceci procéda, étape-par-étape, avec chaque numéro
  du MUFOB. Il devint rapidement clair que la plupart des événements avaient été signalés dans l'hémisphère nord, avec
  des groupes aux USA et au nord de l'Europe Occidentale qui en avaient largement. Après que l'ensemble des 150 cas de
  IntCat, couvrant la période de <time>1865/1954</time>, ait été rassemblés et leurs lieux aient été tracés, il avait
  semblé peu probable que des schémas de distribution significatifs soient trouvés simplement en utilisant la base de
  données entière. Un niveau de discernement plus élevé devait être exercé. Un traitement laborieux de re-tracé des
  lieux impliquant des événements de différentes catégories fut alors entâmé. Des collections d'événements qui avaient
  eu lieu durant la même période de date ; ou qui impliquaient des objets du même type ; ou avaient d'autres
  caractéristiques en commun, furent extraites. </p>
<p>Le chercheur français, <span class="people">Aimé Michel</span>, avait mis en avant l'idée, <time>1963</time>, que la
  distribution en ligne droite des lieux d'événements ovnis en France, qu'il avait observée auparavant, aurait pu
  constituer des indicateurs que des grands cercles géodésiques pourraient lier des lieux semblables dans le monde
  entier. </p>
<p>Comme les grands cercles n'étaient pas difficiles à calculer, une série d'entre eux, ayant [a range] d'inclinaisons
  vers l'équateur, furent tracés sur un papier de tracé comme surcouches des graphiques globaux, et les distributions du
  type de <a href="/people/m/MichelAime/index.html">Michel</a> de lieux de SAC furent recherchées. Le résultat le plus
  impressionnant de ces exercises fut fourni par un groupe de rapports d'objets entrant ou, en une occasion, sortant, de
  grandes étendues d'eau ― qui furent nommés "événements d'eau". Les événements dans cette collection couvraient une
  longue période d'années et étaient distribués dans le monde entier, comme motnré par la figure d'archive n° 7. Les
  lieux sont montrés sous la forme de points ave anneaux et les arcs sont des segments de grands cercles, déformés par
  la présentation cartesienne de la latitude et longitude. Les lieux d'événements furent trouvés être liés par 7 grands
  cercles, comme montré.</p>
<p>Après que la base de données ait été étendue par avec les cas extraits de la réf 10.4, des exercises semblables
  furent menés, mais sans de quelconques résultats significatifs.</p>
<p>Throughout that search for geodetic great circle distributions, it had been realised that the discovery of such
  distributions would not constitute proof that activity had stemmed from space. Such proof might be provided if only
  one group of events could be shown to be linked by a typical spiralling ground track (as traced out beneath it) of an
  Earth satellite. So, that was to be the next step ― which, ultimately, led to nowhere. Clearly, a new approach was
  required. </p>
<h3>The "favoured delivery track" concept</h3>
<p>The next idea to be followed was one which conceived the (albeit, remote) possibility that ET probes from space might
  approach the Earth from the same direction among the stars, and might then go into a short-term parking orbit to
  facilitate their surveillance activities. Archive Fig. 8 is a diagrammatic representation of this concept. It is shown
  that the times of day or night when these hypothetical orbiting craft passed over a given latitude on Earth would
  depend on the time of year. However, during that flyover, the stars overhead at that latitude would be that same at
  all times of year, i.e. the flyover at that latitude would occur at the same sidereal times. In fact, the entire orbit
  could be defined by the sidereal times corresponding to its flyovers of all other latitudes. The actual places
  overflown would depend on the Earth's rotational position, relative to the Sun, during the short orbiting period. It
  was also envisaged that surface-exploration craft would be delivered into the atmosphere and subsequently retrieved by
  the orbiter. To explore this idea, it would be necessary to determine the sidereal time at which each recorded event
  had occurred, before looking for meaningtful linkups. A meaningful indicator would be an arc of a celestial great
  circle which had linked several SAC events reported as being on, or close to, the Earth's surface. </p>
<p>The first problem to be faced was the doubtful availability of accurate timing information. Some of the cases used
  for the geographical distribution study lacked any timing information and had to be eliminated from the database
  required for this exercise. Thus, the number of timed events was only 368 and some of those times had been
  approximated. (In fact, the accuracy of eye-witness times are always suspect, since the last thing anyone thinks of
  doing, when suddenly confronted by a SAC, is to check the time.) Given all the caveats, the chances that anything
  meaningful would be revealed by this exercise seemed to be very low―but there seemed to be no other course left
  open. </p>
<h3>
  5.4 The search for sidereal connections
</h3>
<p>The task of determining the sidereal time corresponding to the reported time of each SAC event seemed to be
  formidable, given the spare-time nature of the studies. This led to a search for a shortcut method that would achieve
  the same end. After much consideration, the following solution presented itself. </p>
<p>The search would be for sidereal evidence of a favored celestial great circle arc, which connected several
  significant SAC events within the atmosphere and situated directly beneath it. As stated previously, the solar times
  of day and night corresponding to such an arc would be dependent on the latitude of each location and the position of
  the Earth in its orbit round the Sun at each time of year. During any given day of the year, the position of the
  terminator changes very little (sunrise and sunset times change by only a few minutes from day to day). As a
  consequence of this, a plot of mean solar time against latitude would effectively reveal if any such celestial arcs
  were produced by the solar times of SAC events on any given day. The reason for this form of presentation is that
  sidereal time (the meridians of which are the celestial equivalents of the longitude lines on the Earth) is celestial
  longitude measured in hours (rather than degrees) to facilitate observational astronomy. Thus, a celestial arc
  generated on a given day relates very closely to the solar times of the locations lying directly beneath it (see 5.3
  and Fig. 8). </p>

<p>The choice of the particular days chosen for this exercise was determined by the ten equally-spaced mean fireball
  dates identified in paragraph 4.When processing began, it soon became clear that insufficient numbers of events had
  occurred on those particular days throughout the 86-year period being considered. This necessitated the introduction
  of another expedient. The Earth's progress round the Sun causes the sidereal day to be four minutes shorter than the
  mean solar day and, consequently, at any given location, the same celestial meridian is directly overhead 4 minutes
  earlier per day as the year progresses. This fact was then used to convert the solar times of events on other dates
  into sidereal-equivalent mean solar times at the nearest selected date. Events at dates which were up to 18 days
  earlier than one of the selected dates had 4 minutes per day subtracted from the actual mean solar time of the event
  and, for those events up to 18 days later, 4 minutes per day were added to the actual time. In this way, meaningful
  numbers of sidereal-equivalent mean solar times were gathered for each selected date, as shown by the table
  below. </p>
<p>When the converted mean solar times for these events were plotted against latitude, some remarkable connections were
  discovered, as shown by archive Figs 9a and 9b.
</p>
<p>Mean solar time is plotted horizontally against latitude. The origin is placed at midnight on the equator. The events
  are identified by symbols which indicate the period of years during which they had occurred―and the curves drawn
  through them are segments of celestial great circles, which were obtained through a painstaking process of overlaying
  by a series of calculated great circles plotting on tracing paper. One of the most remarkable features to be revealed
  by this exercise was that the "best fit" arcs were those of circles with the same inclinations to the equator as that
  set of approximate geographical great circles found to be connecting those "Water Events" of para. 5.2. </p>
<p>The discovery of such a large number of interconnecting arcs was completely unexpected. Some of the interconnected
  points spanned long periods of time, suggesting that such tracks might have been long-established ones. The
  preponderance of segments having inclinations of between 52° and 54° was a very noticeable feature of these graphs.
  Such segments were identified at all times of the year and were well-defined by the points. Arcs with 43° inclinations
  were also clearly defined. </p>
<p>The next question that had to be addressed was whether there were common sidereal links between the arcs discovered
  for each of the selected dates. It was decided to investigate this by comparing the <i>mean solar times at maximum
    northern latitudes </i>on the great circle segments. This was done by plotting those selected datum times, read from
  Figs 9a and 9b, against days of the year, as shown by archive Fig. 10. (For "local time" read mean solar time.) The
  symbols identified the inclinations of the circles represented―and the superimposed sloping lines were lines of
  constant sidereal time. By careful study of all the points plotted, the best sidereal match was judged to be one which
  divided the 24-hour solar day into 22 equal divisions, as shown―and one of those sidereal lines seemed to be populated
  by a series of points which spanned from February 14 to October 28. It was estimated that this line corresponded to a
  sidereal meridian of 19:50 hrs right ascension (RA) and seemed to indicate that a favoured approach path from space
  had been established. In other words, <i>the exercise had apparently justified the search for such a path</i>. </p>
<p>But further scrutiny of Fig. 10 revealed another, unexpected, feature. A series of points representing great circles
  with inclinations between 52° and 54° seemed to have been related to the times of <i>northern sunset</i> at those
  latitudes, as shown. A similar curve superimposed to representsunrise times was not so well substantiated. This
  development seemed to indicate that on many occasions the great circles in space, which related to events in the
  atmosphere, had been arranged to coincide with the sunset terminator at their points of maximum northern latitude (or
  declination); that is, 52°-54° N. There was insufficient evidence to suggest that the <i>northern sunrise</i>
  terminator had been similarly used. </p>
<p>The discovery of these Sun-linked great circle arcs suggested that the hypothetical delivery spacecraft had sometimes
  followed paths along which they had approached the Earth, either, from the direction of the Sun, or, towards it. This
  provided evidence that they may have emanated from bases set up within the solar system―a pleasing result, but
  completely unexpected at outset. </p>
<p>Another interesting question raised by Fig. 10 was whether there might be a good explanation for those 22
  approximately equal sidereal divisions. It was noticed that there were sets of up to 5 points in consecutive mean
  solar time sequences at several of the chosen dates. Due consideration was given to these features and one explanation
  was that they might have been indications that continuous orbiting had taken place on some occasions, the inclination
  of the plane of the orbit having been changed after each completed circuit round the Earth. However, against this idea
  was the realisation that the celestial great circles represented by those points had been defined by events sometimes
  widely spaced in (albeit, recnt) history. In other words, they did not represent the consecutive series of orbits
  envisaged in that proposed scenario. A further objection was that no natural satellite could possibly orbit the Earth
  in 65.45 minutes, the lowest natural period being about 90 minutes for a low satellite. Nevertheless, after
  remembering the advance technology evidenced and with nothing to lose except time and patience, the concept was
  investigated further. </p>
<h3>
  5.5 The search for geographical evidence of "super-orbiting"
</h3>
<p>The first step in the required reexamination of the global distribution patterns was to create a set of pro forma
  curves (on tracing paper) to represent the over-the-ground tracks traced out beneath the envisaged "super-orbiters."
  Since satellites can move progressively, in the West-to-East direction of the Earth's daily rotation, or in retrograde
  motion, from East to West, two sets of these distinctly different curves had to be produced. Archive Fig. 11 comapres
  the Cartesian plots of ground tracks for progressive and retrograde super-orbiters travelling in super-orbits with
  four typical inclinations. Geodetic great circle arcs are also drawn for comparison. The full set of pro formas
  included ground tracks representing all the celestial great circle inclinations identified by the sidereal study.
  Overlaying of the global plots was then carried out, looking for unmistakable links between SAC events'
  locations. </p>
<p>The curve-matching exercise begun using the <i>progressive</i> set of arcs, but, very soon, it became clear that no
  meaningful alignments existed. However, this situation changed sramatically when the search was begun with the <i>retrograde</i>
  set. Almost immediately, a series of event locations along the east coast of the USA was seen to be linked, by a
  single track line, with similar locations in Europe and the Middle East. Then, very quickly, several other alignments
  were found with other track lines. From that initial search, 34 well-aligned ground tracks were identified and,
  subsequently, this total grew to become 66. <i>Each track was identified by its inclination and by the longitude of
    its intersection with the equator to the east of its northern segment</i>. The full listing is given by Table 1,
  which follows. </p>

<p>Two interesting observations were made from a study of this table:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Five of the Water Events great circles were shown to be approximations of those tracks numbered 5, 10, 11, 15,
    and 27. </li>
  <li> Some equatorial intersections were shared by tracks with different inclinations. This suggested that these might
    have been key navigational reference points from which the retrograde tracks had been generated. </li>
</ol>
<p>Further scrutiny of this almost unbelievable result revealed another unexpected feature of it. The new feature was
  confirmed during 1980, after colleagues in the Computer Services Department of British Aerospace, PLC, Manchester, had
  very generously given up several lunch periods to plot out the identified arcs and to extend each one of them to
  produce one simulated "super-orbit" of the Earth. These plots were superimposed on world globe presentations, using a
  mainframe computer, and they revealed the full global picture. A study of these presentations showed that, sometimes,
  the point where one retrograde super-orbit was completed at the equator virtually coincided with the starting point
  for another of the identified track lines. Examples are shown by archive Fig. 12. This suggested that the operational
  model contained elements of continuous orbiting sequences and led to further exploration of the possibilities.
  Eventually, archive Fig. 13 was produced to clarify the situation. </p>
<p>During the execution of one 65.45 minutes' super-orbit of the Earth, the planet would rotate through 16.36°
  longitude towards the East, and this interval would separate the equatorial start and finish points of one such orbit.
  Fig. 13 shows the equatorial intersections that defined the recognised ground tracks, superimposed on sloping lines
  with slopes of -16.36°. Three distinct super-orbit sequences became apparent from this graph and these were labelled
  "A", "B", and "C". </p>
<p>This discovery then suggested that other track/equator intersections (later called "track generators") might exist,
  which had not been revealed by synthesis of the empirical data. The best mean lines through the original track
  generator points also suggested that small corrections were required to them. The following table (Table 2) was
  produced to create a complete list of the revised generators and the new ones inferred by interpolation. </p>

<p>A review of Table 1 will show that only ground tracks corresponding to identified celestial great circles with
  inclinations of 43°, 54°, 67°, and 76° were considered during the initial curve-matching exercise. This situation
  arose because tracks with those inclinations were so easily identified as those linking the plotted geographical
  locations. Later studies, however, showed that tracks with 42°, 44°, 52°, 53°, and 63° were also evidence when
  generated from the same set of equatorial intersections. </p>
<p>At this stage of development, the possible tactical uses of this navigational model for SAC activity were
  considered―but, as those deliberations were superceded when the theoretical model had become more fully developed,
  they are now considered to be incidental to the main purpose of this paper. The next major staep was, more fully, to
  investigate the evidence for the validity of that fixed star-related celestial track orientation labelled 19:50 hrs RA
  by its northernmost point. </p>
<h3>5.6 Exercise to explore the fixed star-linked track orientation</h3>
<p>Using the navigational model as then defined, it was decided that a useful exercise might be carried out with a
  newly-formed database. This was brought together to include 36 cases selected from the global database, 22 outstanding
  reports from the intense outbreak of SAC activity in Dyfed (Wales) during 1977 and 17 cases extracted from the BUFORA
  Journal of 21st July, 1979―a total of 75 cases. Employing the tracing paper curve-matching techniques described
  previously, the ground tracks passing through each location were first identified. From the time of the event, the
  corresponding celstial orientation of each track was then determined and listed. Whenever more than one ground track
  passed through a location, the same number of possible orientations were associated with that event. This resulted in
  a total of 103 possible orientations for 75 events. Archive histogram Fig. 14 summarised the cumulative totals for
  each orientation. </p>
<p>The 19:50 hrs RA orientation period, though better than average, was shown not to be particularly outstanding. It
  was overshadowed by the peaks at 21 to 22 hrs RA and at 23 to 24 hrs RA. An interesting small peak was also evident
  between 11 and 13 hrs RA. Consequently, this exploratory exercise created doubts and uncertainties which were not
  resolved until the early 1990s.</p>
<h2>6. The local timings exercise</h2>
<h3>
  6.1 Basics
</h3>
<p>From the procedure that had been followed to carry out the investigation described in Para. 5.6 another idea had
  been created. If the global navigational model were to be assumed to be correct, a series of time predictions for SAC
  events could be produced for any given location, which could then be compared with the actual times of such events
  recorded from there. This would involve selecting a suitable location and then determining which of the identified
  ground tracks (from the global set) passed through, or close to, that site. There were 10 possible inclinations and 66
  nominal equatorial generatots to be considered. When the ground tracks had been identified, it would then be a matter
  of predicting the local times of events that might have been spawned from the associated great circles in space. The
  global study had produced two possible orientations for those circles, one related to the sunset terminator at 52°-54°
  N latitude and the other to the datum meriadian 19:50 hrs RA. The later study (Para 5.6) had suggested that there
  might be others. </p>
<p>Following the acquisition of a PC during 1988, a program was written to facilitate exploration of that local timings
  idea. To ensure that all the recognised possibilities were taken into account, this program included the set of 66
  rationalised equatorial generators plus non-conforming original generators which were displaced more than 1° longitude
  from the associated generators of the rationalised set. Given the latitude/longitude co-ordinates of a location and
  the Mean Solar Time of an event at that location, the program would then output each ground track passing within a
  specified lateral displacement tolerance of the location. It would also output the orientation of the celestial great
  circle associated with a particular ground track. Selected cases were processed and it was found that some
  orientations seemed to occur frequently. However, the same difficulties arose as those experienced during the previous
  (manually-processed) exercise―there were still too many possibilities and the concentrations between 11 hr and 13 hr
  RA and from 18 hr to 2 hr RA were still evident. Both Sunset and Sunrise orientations were also indicated. It seemed
  that another method would have to be contrived to clarify this promising but still-confused situation. </p>
<h3>6.2 Development of local timings graphs</h3>
<p>Since the local times related to the celestial orientations would be changing from day to day throughout any year,
  the obvious way to present the predicted timings seemed to be by means of a graph of local time (MST) plotted against
  days of the year. </p>
<p>Four possible datum timing lines, sunset, sunrise, 12 hrs RA (provisionally representative) and 19:50 hrs RA, could
  be drawn on this graph and timing lines for the identified ground tracks would be displaced by time increments (or
  decrements) from those datum lines. Thus, the basic graph would be similar to Fig 10, but with only the datum lines
  initially drawn in. The appropriate incremenets or decrements associated with each qualifying ground track would be
  determined in the manner shown by Fig 15. </p>
<p>Fig 15 is a graph of <i>celestial</i> great circle declination (or equivalent latitude) plotted against a six-hour
  scale of right ascension (RA). The origin is on the equator and at a nominal datum zero RA hours position, so that the
  6 hours to the right of it can be regarded as increments in RA hours. Superimposed upon this layout are curves, each
  representing one quarter of a celestial great circle with a given inclination to the equator. Suppose now that our
  location is somewhere in Britain―say, Warminster, Wiltshire. The latitude of Warminster is 51° 12', wherever that line
  cuts a curve will give the RA increment, in hours, which would apply for a ground track associated with the ecelestial
  great circle represented by that curve. Whether the time displacement from each of the datum lines would be an
  increment or a decrement would be determined by whether the track through the site is orientated approximately SE to
  NW or from NE to SW, respectively. (If the track lay exactly E to W, then there would be a zero time increment because
  the location would be lying at the latitude directly below the datum point on one of the identified celestial
  circles.) </p>
<p>The ground tracks passing within a specified lateral tolerance from the site's location would be identified by
  running the PC program with just a nominal event time input. The RA increments/decrements associated with each track
  in the output list would then be determined from Fig. 15. Lines parallel to the datum lines could then be drawn
  displaced by the appropriate increment or decrement. (Increments/decrements of RA are virtually the same as hours of
  mean solar time.) </p>
<p>Concurrent with this new objective, UFO reports, sometimes associated with the appearance of circular formations in
  the crops of Wiltshire and Hampshire, were being reported and, responding to an invitation from Mr. Colin Andrews (a
  now-famous researcher of the crop circles phenomenon), the author visited the area during the late summer of 1988. In
  view of this experience, it had seemed pertinent to produce the first, hand-drawn, timings graph for that affected
  region of England. After the graph had been drawn, a data sample for events recorded in that area was then required,
  to test it. </p>
<p>During 1989, Ref. 10.5 was published and provided 21 cases for consideration. These were added to by 3 other reports
  from other sources to produce a total of 24 timings for events reported between 1965 and 1990. Archive Fig. 16 shows
  how these timings plotted out, before the datum lines were drawn in. Sidereal trends were unmistakably in evidence.
  (This result was all the more surprising because some of the cases considered had not been UFO events. In fact, seven
  of them were associated with (sometimes) <i>witnessed</i> mysterious crop circle creation and four others were the
  times when strange vortices and whirlwinds had suddenly arisen, which had defied explanations. The remaining cases
  were typical UFO reports. The author of the book had put forward all those cases as evidence in favour of his natural
  "plasma vortex" hypothesis. However, the evidence of sidereal linking presented by Fig. 16 seemed to suggest they were
  more likely to be artificial phenomena connected with the global SAC activity. </p>
<p>(It is important to state, before further expansion, that the hand-drawn archival graphs, being referenced, label the
  time axis in various ways -- e.g. local time, true local time. These were terms used, provisionally, to communicate
  the discoveries to researchers and other interested people with little or no astronomical knowledge. In fact, they
  referred to mean solar time.) </p>
<p>When the newly-produced timings graph pro forma was superimposed on this set of data points, interesting
  displacements became apparent. It was found, by sliding the 19:50 hrs RA set of lines upwards, that a very good match
  was produced between the plotted lines and the data points. In fact, this occurred with the datum line then at 21:30
  hrs RA. With a similar displacement, downwards, of the 12 hrs RA set of lines, the points of the lower part of the
  graph were acounted for when the revised datum line was then at 11 hrs RA. These changes were considered to be
  important, as they promised to resolve the uncertainty about the sidereal orientations―but, clearly, the changes had
  to be tested, in the first instance, by SAC data gathered from that area of Southern England. At this juncture, a
  revised pro forma graph was produced, as shown by archive Fig. 17. </p>
<p>To provide data for the first test of the new predictions graph, 23 SAC cases were extracted from Ref. 10.6. These
  had been reported during the mid-1970s and the result obtained when their timings had been superimposed upon the pro
  forma is shown by archive Fig. 18. The result was an almost unbelievably-good match. It seemed that the lines had been
  drawn through the points, rather than vice-versa. Even the sunset and sunrise lines had been referenced. </p>
<p>Spurred by this result, hand-drawn pro forma graphs were produced for several other interesting locations. One such
  location was the region of East Norfolk and Suffolk, drawn with the alleged SAC activity during 1980, at the
  Woodbridge Air Base, in mind. Unfortunately, it had to be acknowledged that reliable dates and times for those
  particular events had not become available, but information had been obtained for other events in that general area
  and the times given for them were superimposed, as shown by archive Fig. 19. The outbreak of SAC reports from Belgium,
  some of which had involved the Belgian Air Force and gendarmes, prompted the plotting or archive Fig. 20. The
  correlation between the lines and the available data points was, again, very good. </p>
<p>After several pro forma graphs for various other locations had been produced by hand, in that fashion, it became
  clear that the process was far too labour-intensive and time-consuming and nneded to be computerised. If a
  sufficiently large number of locations could be considered, world-wide, and positive results were able to be obtained
  from them, then such a result would consitute proof of the validity of the model―which later became known as the
  Astronautical Theory for UFO Close Encounters. This resulted from the publication in 1995 of the Ashpole book (Ref.
  10.7), which referred to it as "a theory to predict Close Encounters". It is currently referred to as the <i>Astronautical
    Theory for SAC Encounters</i>, even though the acronym SAC is not yet in general use. </p>
<h2>7. The fully computerised model</h2>
<h3>7.1 Local timings graphs</h3>
<p>A typical computer-produced graphical output for local timings graphs is shown by Fig. 21, (incidentally) for a
  location in Wiltshire, England. It is the now-famous Alton Barnes, a small village south of Marlborough, which has
  become the scene of some of the most outstanding crop-formations of the past decade. Special crop and sky watches have
  been held there, utilising TV and LLTV cameras, IR cameras, radar and 24-hours-a-day visual watches during the summer
  months. Despite all this equipment, no one has yet managed to capture the creation of a crop-formation from the
  hilltop overlooking the targeted field. However, many kinds of anomalous phenomena have been recorded there, including
  SAC events. </p>
<p>Referring now to the archetypal Fig. 21, details of the chosen location are given at the top of the page. The
  tolerance value is the allowed maximum lateral displacement (degrees longitude) of any ground track from the given
  location and it is chosen to provide not more than seven tracks per site. The maximum value of tolerance is 1.0, but
  in practice lateral displacement rarely exceeds 30 nautical miles. The "y" factor merely compensates for printer
  distortion of th egrid map shown in the to R.H. corner of the page. The latitude/longitude grid map locates the chosen
  site as a ringed point and the ground tracks identified by the program are superimposed. The arrows on those lines
  indicate the retrograde motion of the hypothetical delivery/retrieval craft travelling in space, directly overhead.
  The model suggests that one track will be used to deliver a probe into the atmosphere and another track will be
  followed to retrieve the probe later. To the left of the grid map, the global identifiers of the selected ground
  tracks are listed. The tracks are numbered 1 up to 7, in order of recognition by the program. The next figure gives
  the inclination of the related celestial great circle and this is followed by the equatorial generator of the ground
  track. The final figure relates to the "super-orbit" sequence with which that track is associated. The computed
  predicted-timings graph occupies the lower part of the page. The date scale is divided into 3-day intervals to aid
  easy selection of a given date. The 24-hour timescale has been folded to facilitate continuous plotting of the lines
  of constant sidereal times―thus, both scales apply on any given day. The timescale is given as Zone Standard Time, the
  conversions to mean solar time now being carried out by the program. Corrections are necessary for clock times during
  Daylight Savings Time (DST or BST) periods of each year. Four distinct sets of timing lines are easily differentiated
  and they correspond to 11:00 hrs RA, 21:30 hrs RA, sunset and sunrise orientations. The timing lines in each set are
  labelled with the numbers of the related ground track lines. (Note: It will be found that some of the computed lines
  have Mean Solar Time equivalents in the hand-drawn Fig. 17.) </p>
<p>Numerous graphs of this kind have now been produced for sites all over the world and some of them are being used
  effectively by in-the-field observers. Fig. 22 is an example of such a graph with new test data superimposed. </p>
<h3>7.2 Numerical computer processing</h3>
<p>Useful and explicit though the graphical method is, it does not facilitate rapid processing of new data or the rapid
  expansion of the processed database. Programs for numerical processing of events have been created to meet this need.
  The latest development program to be used for this purpose was created three years ago. This processes the input data
  and creates a printed output which identifies each of the qualifying tracks and celestial orientation of each track,
  together with the difference between thegiven (input) time and the predicted time to the nearest minute. Solutions
  considered as confirming the Astronautical Theory produce time differences of not more than &plusmn; 20 minutes. Some
  two thirds of cases in the current processed database qualify in that way―but it is important to realise that the
  timing predictions are considered to be the expected times of arrival and departure of the atmospheric probes, and
  that the intervening period may not always be filled by totally clandestine activity. In other words, encounters can
  be expected to occur between arrival and departure on some occasions. Table 3 is an example of the output from this
  program. </p>
<p>After processing, the result is installed into one of the series of listings constituting the Processed Database. A
  listing exists for each decade since 1950 and each of these listings are linked to a sort program, which allows
  sorting of events by location, country, date, track inclination, track orientation, orbit sequence and type of object
  encountered―or any combination of two of these. There are currently over 900 processed cases listed and these do not
  include those events which provided data for the original global study. </p>
<p>Several other programs have been produced to facilitate specialised studies, one of which investigates the possible
  importance of the positions of solar system bodies in the automated navigational system apparently discovered. </p>
<h2>8. Discussion of features of the Theory</h2>
<h3>8.1 Review of the basic development process</h3>
<p>The delivery and retroeval, from space, of atmospheric probes utilising technology well beyond current human
  achievement, was a concept which arose from a study of SAC encounters reported in Britain during 1967. From those
  early feasibility studies, the search for incontrovertible evidence of a programmed astronautical monitoring activity
  developed. A reasoned approach led into a search for evidence of, perhaps, just obe favoured incursion path from
  space, which, it was thought, might be able to be found by use of a historical database derived from selected reports
  from the mid-1880s up to the early 1970s. That exercise, after many false starts, eventually produced a wealth of
  evidence that the early suspicions had been largely correct, except that it indicated the existence of several
  favoured approach paths, one set referencing the fixed stars and others the terminator, at sunset and, possibly,
  sunrise. A problem arose when, during later processing, the original sidereal orientation was found to be apparently
  just one possibility among many. Close examination of events recorded largely from southern England then seemed to
  resolve this difficulty, except that the original orientation, with its datum at 19:50 hrs RA, then seemed to have
  been superseded by another with its datum point at 21:30 hrs RA. The validity of this change seemed to be borne out by
  further investigations using new data. These later investigations also confirmed that the sunrise terminator had been
  referenced on some occasions. </p>
<p>The findings at this juncture were provisionally written into PC programs created to evaluate new data. A multitude
  of results obtained, to date, have seemed to verify the validity of this astronautical model and to establish the
  reality of programmed ETI surveillance activity. </p>
<h3>8.2 Exploration of the sidereal-orientation puzzle</h3>
<p>Attempts have been made to discover the reasons for the change in the favoured 19:50 hrs RA sidereal orientation that
  was so clearly indicated by the original global study result. There seem to be three possible explanations: </p>
<ol>
  <li> The original finding was just a fluke indication;</li>
  <li> The subsequent finding was incorrect;</li>
  <li> The source of that "star-linked" activity is orbiting the sun and is, therefore, causing the track orientations
    associated with it to move slowly round the sky as it progresses in its orbit. </li>
</ol>
<p>In view of all the successful PC processing carried out with data not used for the original global study, the output
  from which has shown the 21:30 hrs RA links to feature largely, the second possibility is currently being largely
  discounted. On the other hand, the first possibility cannot be lightly accepted. For these reasons, much attention has
  been given to the remaining explanation - but many, so far unresolved, problems have been encountered.</p>
<p>Close examination of the celestial great circles which were indicators of the original sidereal orientation revealed
  that they had been defined by events recorded largely during the 1950s and 1960s. However, other events from that
  period have been processed through the Pc programs and have been found to be consistent with the revised orientation.
  This opens the possibility that reprocessing with the original orientation programmed-in might also produce good
  correlation, but with tracks differently inclined. This potentially time-consuming experiment has not yet been carried
  out, because many other copnsiderations provide deterrents―not least, that consideration that the revised orientation
  was derived from data spanning the years 1965 to 1990, a period which, therefore, overlapped with the earlier period
  of definition.</p>
<p>Consideration of the idea of a source (ETI-established base) moving in solar orbit presents its own difficulties. For
  example, if it is considered that the 19:50 hr RA orientation applied at, say, 1950 and the 21:30 hr RA one to, say,
  1980, that might mean that the source had moved through 1:40 hr RA in 30 years, which would mean that its period round
  the Sun would be about 430 years. This would place it in the outer solar system, well beyond the orbit of Pluto. If,
  however, the period covered by the orientation change had been only 20 years, the period of the source's orbit would
  be some 290 years―and so on. The shorter the period is assumed to be, the more rapid the movement of the orientations
  round the sky and the less reliable the processed results from the PC.</p>
<p>Another arrangement that would produce very slow movement of the "fixed" orientations round the sky might be one in
  which the sources of monitoring activities, stemming from those particular paths in space, are situated in an
  extremely distant solar orbit, and have a period corresponding to the period of Earth's polar axis precession, 25,800
  years. This would place them at approximately 890 AU (0.014 light-year) from the Sun and in the plane of the celestial
  equator. If, judging from the witnessed performance capabilities of the exploration craft operating within the
  atmosphere, we consider it to be very likely that the delivery/retrieval spaceraft are capable of near light-speed
  transits, that capability would enable them to travel in virtual straight lines across the solar system. Such an
  arrangement would greatly facilitate programmed long-term monitoring of Earth by fully automated probes, since the
  programmed paths round the planet could be followed without the constant need ro amend the navigational programming.
  However, the movement in the sky of those programmed paths in space over a period of, say, 50 years, would be only 2.8
  minutes RA. This particular scenario does not therefore provide an answer to the 19:50/21:30 hrs RA problem. Much more
  work is required.</p>
<p>It has been noticed that all four approach/departure track orientations are in fact linked to the celestial sphere.
  The sidereal medidians coinciding with the track/terminator intersections at 53° latitude have been found to determine
  the orientations of all the sunrise/sunset-linked approach/departure tracks, whatever their inclinations might be. <i>This
    means, given the programmed nature of the model, that the obvious placement for the sources of all
    approach/departure tracks activity will be somewhere in the plane of the celestial equator, rather than in the
    ecliptic plane of the solar system</i>. </p>
<h3>8.3 Terminator-linked tracks</h3>
<p>Even though the terminator-linked track options, of all inclinations, are celestially determined and the obvious
  sources (bases) for craft using this kind of navigational programming would, therefore, be in the celestial equatorial
  plane, the fact that the sunset orientation has been found to be much used, at all times of year, indicates that
  navigation towards or away from the sun may be assisted by reference to conveniently placed solar system bodies. A
  pilot study has altready been carried out to assess that possibility, with very encouraging results. The report of
  that study will be referenced in the Bibliography sections at the end of this paper. The frequently-found links
  between reported SAc events and the sunset orientation may be biased by the fact that many people are outside during
  the evening period, between sunset and midnight―but it is important that reports of SAC seen during that period should
  not be cynically dismissed without investigation. It could be that this period, when many people are out and about, is
  also favoured for monitoring our activities.</p>

<h2>9. Conclusion</h2>

<p>The work descrobed by this paper has been carried out, with scientific objectivity, over a period of more than three
  decades. A step-by-step case has been built up in the same logical order as that followed by the actual work. Despite
  the dismissive attitude of many scientists towards the available phenomenological evidence, because it is often hidden
  within a plethora of UFO reports, it has been demonstrated that sober and methodological treatment of eye-witness
  reports of strange aerial craft (SAC), worldwide―and for a period of over a century―has provided adequate grounds for
  believing that regular monitoring activity of Earth is being carried out by ETI. To challenge this conclusion, in a
  scientific manner, ought to involve any challenger in a lot of hard work―nevertheless, it has been acknowledged that
  the work presented here should be regarded as exploratory and unfinished and in need of further attention.</p>

<p>Despite the obvious shortcomings of the present work, use of the indicators it has produced might greatly assist
  those scientists engaged in SET and OSETI activities, and others watching the skies for signs of further atmospheric
  ETI monitoring activity. Amateur skywatchers have already benefited from the timing predictions for SAC activity in
  localised areas and, as a result of several successful (predicted) observations of anomalous lights in the sky, an
  Irish astronomer recently presented a paper to an OSETI conference during January, 2001, telling of his intention to
  set up a special observatory at a promising location in Ireland (Ref 10.8).</p>

<p>Finally, it is hoped that publication of this paper will put an end to all the nonsense that has bedevilled and
  barred communication of this research throughout the years. A significant step forward seemed to be achieved during
  1998, when a paper co-authored with Edward Ashpole (Ref 10.9) was awarded a first prize in an essay competition
  organised by the National Institute of Discovery Science (NIDS), Las Vegas, but the authors have received little
  positive response to it, to date, despite its availability on the NIDS website. It is hoped that scientific minds
  newly-opened to the possibilities by this paper will want to read the other reports and papers written by the author
  since the formulation of the basic theory a decade ago. These additional papers have demonstrated, for example, how
  new events reported from several regions of Britain have correlated well with the predictions of the Theory; explored
  the tactics employed by the probes during short visits to the planet; explored the possible role of solar system
  bodies in facilitating automated operations in accordance with the programmed navigational system; demonstrated
  circumstantial links between SAC activity and truly inexplicable crop-circle formations. These papers will be listed
  in the Bibliography section and will be available on request.</p>
