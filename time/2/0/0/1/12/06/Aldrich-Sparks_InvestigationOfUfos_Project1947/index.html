<p>How does one investigate a transitory phenomenon which appears suddenly to unprepared observers over a very small
  area, and under conditions which are not understood? Various organizations and individuals have wrestled with this
  question for the last 50 years.</p>
<p>There are many phenomena which are extremely short-lived and cannot be readily reproduced in the laboratory, such as
  fireball meteors, mountain lights, earthquake lights, unusual displays of atmospheric electricity (ball lightning,
  sprites, superbolts, etc.). Most reports of the foregoing examples depend predominantly on eyewitness testimony.
  Analysis of such raw data poses many difficulties for the investigator. Witnesses not only include descriptions of the
  phenomenon, but often incorporate their impressions and biases into their accounts.</p>
<p>After more than three decades' experience in UFO investigations, <span class="people">Brad Sparks</span> offers the
  following advice for obtaining the most useful data from any UFO observations:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The most important data to obtain from a visual UFO observer are in rough order of importance:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Duration</b>. This should be obtained by <em>Timed Re-enactment</em> of the sighting since most witnesses do
      not use a clock or stopwatch to time a sighting. Casual estimates are usually very inaccurate.</li>
    <li><b>Angular size</b>. This should be obtained by having the witness recall the sighting and mentally compare the
      UFO at its closest/largest to the <em>full moon</em> and a <em>star/point source</em> and/or to <em>known
        objects</em> (such as aircraft) of a <em>known size</em> at <em>known distances</em>, all of which should be
      given in the sighting report. The fact that it represents the largest and closest point in the sighting must be
      noted in the report along with how much time the UFO was that close. The angular size(s) for the rest of the
      sighting should be obtained and given in the report. If it is a Close Encounter (CE) at close range, the angular
      size is not necessary if the object's actual size and distance are accurately estimated, and most witnesses will
      not be able to accurately estimate large CE angular sizes such as "100 Full Moons in size," etc.<br/><br/> The
      object-held-at-arm's length method of comparison is very inaccurate because most witnesses highly exaggerate the
      size of objects in the sky, e.g., most people would be very surprised to learn that the Full Moon is only the size
      of an aspirin tablet at <em>arm's length</em>, and most think it's the size of a large coin or marble, or even a
      tennis ball or baseball! If arm's length is used the arm's length (from the handheld <em>object</em> to the <em>eye</em>
      — <em>not</em> the actual arm) needs to be <em>measured</em>, as everyone's arms have different lengths from
      person to person and different ways of holding up objects in front of them. In reality we do not measure the
      "arm's length" at all, but the distance from the witness' eye to the handheld object used as a comparison to the
      UFO as recalled by the witness.
    </li>
    <li><b>Location</b>. Exact location of witness and approximate location of UFO. Preferably GPS coordinates if
      possible, including elevation above mean sea level (MSL). Multiple ways of specifying location should be used in
      addition to GPS coordinates where available: Street address and city, with location by distance and direction from
      the house or landmark. Landmarks used should be highly defined, not large nebulous areas such as large cities or
      mountains (e.g., "10 miles East of Los Angeles" is virtually meaningless; Los Angeles itself is at least 30 miles
      wide so where does this distance count from, the center, the nearest boundary?)</li>
    <li><b>Date and exact time with time zone</b>. The lighting conditions should be specified (day, night, dawn, dusk,
      etc.) to help eliminate uncertainty and if the time is close to 12 Midnight the dates before and after should be
      given so there is no 1-day ambiguity.<br/> <br> For example, a sighting at 11:50 PM on March 20 would be given as
      11:50 PM on March 20-21 so no one will get confused and think it might have been on March 19 instead. (If you <em>don't
        know</em> for sure <em>say so</em>.) If at 12:05 AM on March 21, say 12:05 AM on March 20-21. Even better
      practice is to say, 11:50 PM on the night of March 20-21, or 12:05 AM on the night of March 20-21, to continue
      these examples. The U.S. military believes the 24-hour clock system and use of Z-time (GMT or UTC) eliminates
      these ambiguities but they are only as accurate as the fallible humans that make the time zone conversions.
      Erroneous or confusing time zone conversions have been part of major international incidents such as the Gulf of
      Tonkin incidents in 1964 and the Soviet shootdown of KAL 007 in 1983.
    </li>
    <li><b>Direction (Azimuth or Compass) and elevation angles</b>. For UFO when first seen, last seen, and all points
      in between as applicable. If a magnetic <em>compass</em> is used this fact must be noted. Directions can be
      obtained by use of a protractor and other simple instruments using straight line landmarks such as streets as a
      reference, and later these can be converted to true <em>azimuths</em> or magnetic compass points by using maps.
      (In most places on earth the True North differs from Magnetic North and changes from year to year; exact values
      can be obtained on the Internet from the <a href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/">U.S. National Geophysical Data
        Center</a> and other sources such as aeronautical and nautical charts, and such sources and their date must be
      noted in the sighting report). North is 0°, East is 90°, South is 180°, West is 270°, and North is 360° or back to
      full circle 0° again. <em>Elevation angles</em> can be obtained using a protractor and hanging a weight from a
      string as a plumb line. The horizon is at 0° elevation; straight overhead Zenith is 90° elevation. Surveyor's
      transits, navigational sextants and other instruments would be ideal to use but not likely to be available in many
      cases.<br/> <br/> The reason <em>duration</em> and <em>angular size</em> are so important is because they describe
      and limit the maximum amount of visual data a witness can possibly see of a UFO. (These data could actually be
      converted into video data file sizes, though in actuality it will be very difficult for most witnesses to fully
      describe a sighting second-by-second, or fraction-of-a-second by fraction-of-a-second.) If a sighting lasts only
      say 1 second, it does not matter how large and how close a UFO might have been it is simply impossible for a
      witness to see very much and the possibility of error is very high. If a UFO is only a pinpoint or star-like point
      source it does not matter how long, even hours, it may have been observed, the possibility it was a star or an
      insect or firefly will remain very high (unless more detail was observed by other witnesses or by using optics or
      if tracked on radar, etc.)
    </li>
    <li><b>How to record sighting data</b>. The best way to record a witness' data on a sighting is by <em>step-by-step
      re-enactment</em> with each step recorded on sheets of paper like a cartoon animation or map of the sky, or
      both.<br/> <br/> The <em>elapsed time</em> must be recorded on each data sheet along with <em>Time/Time Zone,
        Date, Location, Direction (Azimuth/Compass), Elevation Angle</em>, and <em>Name</em> of person making the
      drawing (witness or investigator) as well. For example, if a drawing shows the UFO at about 10 seconds after first
      seen then that <em>elapsed time about 10 secs</em> should be noted on the drawing, etc. — Brad Sparks.
