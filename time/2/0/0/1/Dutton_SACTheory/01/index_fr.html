<p>Funded optical scans of the Lagrangian points within the Earth-Moon system were made, in 1979 and 1981-82, by
  professional astronomers searching (in obvious solar system locations) for the automated probes of ETI. Inconsistent
  with such expectations has been the neglect of phenomenological evidence suggesting that an automated Earth-monitoring
  system may be in operation. It is hoped that the research described here will change that still-prevailing situation.
  This paper describes serious scientific work carried out over a period of more than three decades to assess reports of
  <i>strange aerial craft (SAC)</i> for which mundane explanations could not be found. The work took the form of an
  extended technical feasibility study, devoid of any initial assumptions, which was begun thirty-four years ago and
  then developed as more information became available.
</p>
<p>When, during 1967, sightings of strange aerial craft began to be reported in increasing numbers from the Manchester
  area of North West England, the author, then a young aeronautical engineer, employed and living in that area, became
  intrigued. Having spent the opening years of his career engaged in feasibility studies of advanced launcher and
  spacecraft concepts, those reports of SAC provided an incentive to reapply his acquired analytical expertise.
  Necessarily, the work had to be done in spare time and without the aid of a PC or, even, a hand calculator. In fact,
  the early material to be presented here was processed and derived using only graph paper, logarithmic tables, drawing
  instruments, a slide rule, local maps, and a good atlas. Initially, information had to be obtained from eye-witnesses,
  newspaper reports, magazines and books; and those cases selected as being worthy of study were listed in penciled
  tables, prior to processing. At the outset, penciled diagrams were drawn to depict the objects described by
  eye-witnesses, and coloured crayons were used to portray the colour of those objects and any lights they were said to
  have displayed. These humble beginnings, from which so much developed, have presented problems. Early data tables were
  often hurriedly scribbled out. Those old records have paled with age and have proved difficult and, sometimes,
  impossible to reproduce satisfactorily. Even so, reproduction of some of the early ("archive") material has been
  thought to be necessary to authenticate this long-overdue paper.</p>
<p>Work began with technical feasibility studies of the objects (SAC) themselves. These exercises very quickly led to
  the conclusion that the technology being featured was far beyond any known form of human technology. Even so, some of
  the objects had exhibited evidence of being real and solid, despite their phenomenal performance capabilities, which
  had seemed, at times, to defy Newtonian laws. Very soon it had to be provisionally accepted that the artificial
  objects reported from North West England and the Midlands had been real, but had not been humanly-produced. In
  addition, further investigation had indicated that, overall, the operations had had all the charactersitics of a
  well-organised aerial surveillance activity. Sometimes the objects had descended from the sky and had been seen to
  return to it. It therefore seemed logical to look for their sources in space; i.e. for extraterrestrial origins.</p>
<p>A collection of historical global data was then begun, to facilitate exploration of global SAC reports patterns. The
  extraction of SAC evidence from two published catalogues of the strangest UFO reports greatly expedited the next step,
  which was to look for meaningful geographical distributions possibly indicative of organised activity from space.
  After much vain effort had been applied to that geographical-patterning idea, linking of reported SAC events with the
  sidereal times of those events was found to produce meaningful patterning of groups of events relative to the stars.
  From these simple observations, a model of a programmed astronautical activity evolved and, eventually, became the
  testable theory which is now known as the <i>Astronautical Theory for SAC Encounters</i>. The step-by-step
  evolutionary process that led to the formulation of that empirical theory will now be described.</p>
