<p>This study was conducted by RoperASW via OmniTel, a weekly national telephone omnibus service. The sample consists of
  1,021 male and female adults (in approximately equal number), all 18 years of age and over. </p>
<p>The telephone interviews were conducted from August 23 through August 25, 2002, using a Random Digit Dialing (RDD)
  probability sample of all telephone households in the continental United States. </p>
<p>Interviews were weighted by five demographic factors: age, sex, education, race and geographic region. Weights were
  applied to ensure accurate representation of the adult population in each of these areas. </p>
<p>The margin of error for the total sample is +/- 3 percent.</p>
