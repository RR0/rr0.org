<h2> Most Americans Psychologically and Spiritually Prepared for Proof of Extraterrestrial Life</h2>
<p>Most Americans appear comfortable with and even excited about the thought of the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
  Three-quarters of the public claim they are at least somewhat psychologically prepared for the discovery of
  extraterrestrial life, and nearly half are very prepared. </p>
<p>Such a discovery would not be difficult for most Americans to reconcile with their religious beliefs. Should the
  government make an announcement about the discovery of extraterrestrial life, only a very small proportion expect it
  to change their religious beliefs at all. </p>
<p>Furthermore, slightly more than half of Americans are at least somewhat interested in personally encountering
  extraterrestrial lifeforms here on earth. This is particularly true of males and of 18-to-24-year-olds.</p>
<h2> Government Knows More Than It Is Telling</h2>
<p>In the view of many adults (55 percent), the government does not share enough information with the public in general.
  An even greater proportion (roughly seven in ten) thinks that the government does not tell us everything it knows
  about extraterrestrial life and UFOs. The younger the age, the stronger the belief that the government is withholding
  information about these topics.</p>
<p>This is not a situation that most Americans would like to have continue. Provided national security is not at risk,
  most believe that the government should share information it has about other intelligent life and UFOs with the
  public. Males and adults below the age of 65 are more inclined to support the declassification of government
  information relating to such phenomena. Naturally, those with a belief and an interest in extraterrestrial life are
  also more likely proponents of revealing such information to the public.</p>
<h2> The Alien Next Door?</h2>
<p>Perhaps Americans expect to take a government announcement about extraterrestrial life in stride because many
  Americans already believe in the extraterrestrial. Two-thirds of Americans say they think there are other forms of
  intelligent life in the universe and nearly half say they believe that UFOs have visited the earth in some form over
  the years (48 percent) or that aliens have monitored life on earth (45 percent). In fact, more than one in three
  Americans (37 percent) believe that humans have already interacted with extraterrestrial lifeforms. These beliefs tend
  to be more prevalent among males and among adults under the age of 65. </p>
<p>When it comes to alien abductions, one in five Americans in general and more than half (57 percent) of those who say
  that humans have already interacted with extraterrestrial life believe that abductions have taken place. Once again,
  males and 18-to-64-year-olds are most likely to hold such a belief. </p>
<h2>Alien Encounters</h2>
<p>One in seven Americans say that they or someone they know has had at least one "<a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/classification/hynek/rr/index.html">close encounter</a>" of the "First,"
  "Second," or "Third" kind. The largest proportion (12 percent) say they or someone else they know has seen a UFO at
  close quarters. Much smaller proportions say they or an acquaintance have seen a UFO cause a physical effect on
  objects, animals, or humans (3 percent) or have had an encounter with extraterrestrial life (2 percent). Among those
  who believe in abductions, one-third claim to have experienced, or know someone who experienced, a Close Encounter of
  their own. </p>
<p>When it comes to other unusual personal experiences, 1.4 percent, or 2.9 million Americans, say they have experienced
  at least four of five key events that believers of UFO abductions have identified as being of particular interest in
  examining whether UFO abductions might actually have taken place. Perhaps not surprisingly, those who believe in
  abductions and who have experienced, or know someone who experienced, a Close Encounter are more inclined to report an
  occurrence of at least four such events.</p>
