  Announcement Regarding the Discovery of Intelligent Extraterrestrial Life

  <li>Those with household incomes of $50,000 or more (85%) </li>

  <p>Americans who believe in extraterrestrial phenomena and who claim to have had, or know someone who had, a <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/classification/hynek/rr/index.html">Close Encounter</a> of their own are
    also significantly more likely to say they are psychologically prepared for the discovery of intelligent life. </p>
  <h2>Announcement of Extraterrestrial Life Would Not Prompt a Religious Crisis</h2>
  <p> Very few Americans say that an official government announcement about the discovery of intelligent
    extraterrestrial life would cause them to question their religious beliefs. A full 88 percent say that such an
    announcement would have no impact on their religious beliefs. </p>

    <p>As age increases, so does the likelihood that religious beliefs will not be changed by the discovery of
      extraterrestrial life. Those 50 years of age and over are significantly more likely than 18-to-24-year-olds to
      claim that such a discovery would have no impact on their beliefs at all. </p>

      <p>Those who say that they are "very psychologically prepared" for the discovery of extraterrestrial life are more
        inclined to believe that their religious beliefs will not be affected by such a discovery. However, the reverse
        is true of those who are "very" interested in encountering an extraterrestrial themselves — they are less likely
        to state that their religious beliefs would not be changed by the discovery of intelligent life. </p>

        <p>When it comes to encountering extraterrestrial life forms themselves, more than half (52%) of Americans say
          they would be very or somewhat interested. Interest is especially strong among males and among 18-24 year olds
          as opposed to those 50 and older. </p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, believers of extraterrestrial phenomena and those with personal experiences relating to
          such phenomena are more inclined to take an interest in meeting intelligent life forms themselves. Interest is
          also higher among Americans who believe the U.S. government does not share enough information with the public
          and does not tell us everything it knows about extraterrestrial life and UFOs. </p>
