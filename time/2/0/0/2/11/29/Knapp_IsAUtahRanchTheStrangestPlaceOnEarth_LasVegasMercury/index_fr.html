<p>Ceci est le 2nd des deux rapports sur des récits persistents de phénomènes anomaux dans une section du nord-est de
  l'Utah. The activity, as reported by hundreds of witnesses over several decades, includes UFOs, unusual balls of
  light, animal mutilations and disappearances, poltergeist events, sightings of Bigfoot-like creatures and other
  unidentified animals, physical effects on plants, soil, animals and humans, and a vast array of other unexplained
  incidents.</p>
<p>The activities seem most concentrated on a 480-acre cattle ranch owned by the family of Tom Gorman. (Gorman isn't his
  real name.) In <time>1996</time>, the ranch was purchased by Las Vegas businessman <span
      class="people">Robert Bigelow</span>, who arranged for an intense, ongoing scientific study of events at the
  ranch. By agreement with Bigelow, and at the request of many of the witnesses, a few names have been changed or
  omitted to protect those who don't want to be hassled by media outlets or UFO enthusiasts.</p>
<p>It began as a dull white light, appearing out of nowhere in the darkness of the middle homestead of the Gorman ranch.
  Tom Gorman saw it. So did a researcher named Chad Deetken. It was nearly <time>1997-08-28 02:00</time>. Gorman and
  Deetken were out in the pasture as part of an ongoing effort to document unusual activity on the property.</p>
<p>Both men watched intently as the light grew brighter. It was as if someone had opened a window or doorway. Gorman
  grabbed his night vision binoculars to get a better look but could hardly believe what he was seeing. The dull light
  began to resemble a bright portal, and at one end of the portal, a large, black humanoid figure seemed to be
  struggling to crawl through the tunnel of light.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, the humanoid figure wriggled out of the light and took off into the darkness. As it did, the
  window of light snapped shut, as if someone had flicked the "off" switch. Deetken had the presence of mind to snap a
  few photos of the event, but would later learn that his film had recorded little of what the two men had
  witnessed.</p>
<p>Tom Gorman, his wife, two teenage kids and several extended family members had grown accustomed to weird things
  happening at the ranch. They had seen numerous UFO-type craft, as well as balls of light that seemed to be
  intelligently controlled. Their neighbors had seen them too. Residents of this basin have been reporting similar
  phenomena since the '50s. Native Americans say the sightings extend back even further. But aerial anomalies weren't
  the strangest occurrences on or near the ranch, not by a longshot.</p>
<p>In his two years on the property, Tom Gorman had lost 14 head of cattle from his hybrid herd. Some animals simply
  disappeared, as if plucked from the sky. Others were carved up with surgical precision. Family members and neighbors
  had also seen Bigfoot-like creatures, oversized wolves, animals and birds that no one could identify. Their horses had
  been attacked, their dogs incinerated, their cats abducted.</p>
<p>The Gormans themselves were bedeviled, almost daily, by odd little household incidents that, separately, wouldn't
  amount to much, but when considered together, were hard to dismiss. Windows and doors in their home would rip open or
  slam shut, seemingly on their own. Frequently, when Mrs. Gorman would take a shower, she'd emerge from the tub to find
  that her towel and personal items had been removed from inside the locked bathroom. On one occasion, she returned from
  town with a large haul of groceries and other supplies. She carefully put the provisions away in various cabinets,
  walked into another room for a few minutes, and returned to find all the supplies back out on the kitchen table.</p>
<p>Clothing, tools and appliances seemed to develop lives of their own. But this wasn't the equivalent of socks
  disappearing in the laundry. For example, Gorman's son worked up a considerable sweat to meticulously stack a one-ton
  pile of cord wood on the south side of a treeline in the middle homestead. He took a 30-minute water break and
  returned to find that the ton of wood had been moved 100 yards to the north side of the tree line. Tools often
  disappeared, then reappeared on the range. In one instance, a heavy post hole digger vanished. It was finally
  discovered, days later, high up in the branches of a cottonwood tree, as if placed there by a crane. The uneasy
  feeling grew among family members that they were constantly being watched, but they had no idea who, or what, was
  doing the watching.</p>

  <h2>Arrive Robert Bigelow et le NIDS</h2>
  <p>Las Vegas businessman <span class="people">Robert Bigelow</span> first heard about the Gorman ranch in the summer
    of <time>1996</time>. A small newspaper article about mysterious events at the property prompted Bigelow and his
    team to fly to Utah. Bigelow bought the ranch and convinced Tom Gorman to stay on as caretaker, against the wishes
    of his family.
  </p>
  <p>Bigelow is the founder of <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a>, the National Institute for Discovery Science,
    a Las Vegas research organization dedicated to the study of unexplained phenomena. <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a>
    staff members include highly trained and educated scientists, engineers and former law enforcement personnel with
    solid credentials, degrees and experience. Although the organization investigates seemingly bizarre events, it has
    no preconceived ideas about the true nature of the subject matter and is primarily interested in getting to the
    truth, wherever that truth leads. (This observation is a personal one, based on more than six years of interaction
    with the NIDS organization.)</p>
  <p>NIDS staffers emphasize that they are constantly drilled by Bigelow and by his Science Advisory Board to rigidly
    adhere to the scientific method. (<q>The Science Board really holds our feet to the fire</q>, one staff member
    confides.) Because the subject matter itself is so controversial in science circles, NIDS realizes that any
    deviation from the scientific method would mean a loss of credibility. If they were deemed a crackpot organization,
    their findings, no matter how profound or well-documented, would be dismissed out of hand.</p>
  <p>The Gorman ranch presented a unique opportunity to study a rich tapestry of strange stuff. It was as if someone had
    ordered up the Weirdness Pizza With Everything on It. UFOs and Sasquatch, balls of light and cattle mutilations,
    poltergeists and crop circles, psychic manifestations and Native American legends--the ranch sounded like a unique
    place in all the world. <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> staffers knew they had to be careful but also knew
    they couldn't merely dismiss the stories told by locals.</p>
  <p><q>Nous n'avions aucune idée préconçue sur ce qui se passait, mais nous avons décidé d'adopter une approche
    'open-filter' pour collecter des informations</q>, dit un senior <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS </a> staffer.
    <q>Nous avions beaucoup de réserves sur les légendes relatives aux skinwalkers, observations de Bigfoot, toutes ces
      choses que la famille dit avoir vues, mais nous avons décidé de recueillir toutes les données que nous pouvions,
      sans les écarter outright, et figured we could evaluate it all later.</q></p>
  <p>The NIDS team set up shop. They installed a command post, positioned video and other monitoring equipment around
    the ranch, built new fencing around the perimeter of the property to better control access to the site, constructed
    observation posts in the pastures and staffed the property with trained observers. The effort constitutes the most
    intense and thorough surveillance of a UFO hot spot ever undertaken.</p>
  <p>UFO researchers were incensed at being excluded from the study. They floated rumors that Bigelow was working for
    the CIA, that he and NIDS were already in contact with E.T., and that whatever information was gleaned from the
    ranch probably would be locked away in dark vaults under the Pentagon. The constant criticism prompted the
    publicity-shy Bigelow to grant a rare interview. He told a Utah newspaper that NIDS was not communicating with
    either extraterrestrials or lizard people. He appealed, perhaps in vain, for a reasonable amount of time, free from
    outside interference, so a legitimate study might be undertaken.</p>
  <p><q>We know so little in terms of what the overall scope of the phenomena are that it's just embarrassing to try and
    make some conclusions at this point</q>, Bigelow said. He admitted that the activity at the ranch seemed to be <q>selective
    in how it exposes itself and to whom,</q> suggesting that a tailgate-party atmosphere where people sit around
    outside the ranch, barbecueing hot dogs while awaiting flying saucers, would not be conducive to a scientific study.
    Not surprisingly, this plea for sanity fell on deaf ears among the UFO faithful. They were so busy expressing their
    outrage over being barred from private property that they failed to grasp the major clue dropped by Bigelow during
    his interview.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Une intelligence pré-cognitive</h2>
  <p>Contrary to some predictions, the odd phenomena at the ranch didn't evaporate under the glare of scientific
    scrutiny. Activity continued, but grew even harder to comprehend. <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> staffers
    saw the same balls of light, even UFO-type craft that the Gormans had seen. But their attempts to photograph or
    videotape the sightings were largely futile. Team members, accompanied by Gorman and former lawmen who were hired
    for the study, often saw anomalous aerial phenomena, with their eyes, their binoculars and with night vision
    equipment. With few exceptions, though, the images inexplicably could not be recorded on film or video.</p>
  <p>A confidential report prepared for <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> board members and obtained by this
    reporter documents dozens of encounters involving <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> staffers, the Gormans
    and other witnesses. After several months of round-the-clock surveillance, a mind-boggling pattern began to emerge.
    The phenomena, whatever they represent, seemed capable of anticipating the moves of the scientists. If they placed
    extra cameras and personnel in the southern field, the activity would pop up in the northern pasture. If they
    concentrated their observations in the center homestead, the activity might move to the ridge overlooking the ranch.
  </p>
  <p>Skeptics might suggest that such an explanation for a lack of photographic evidence sounds a little too convenient.
    But something happened on <time>1998-07-19</time>, that sheds further light on the challenge faced by the research
    team. Soon after arriving at the ranch, NIDS had installed three telephone poles in one of the pastures. Atop each
    pole was a sophisticated package of sensoring equipment, including multiple video cameras. The cameras had a full
    view of that section of the ranch and were connected to video recorders back in the command post. At exactly 8:30
    p.m., the three cameras on the westernmost telephone pole were suddenly disabled. When <a
        href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> staffers went to check out the problem, they saw that something had
    shredded their electronic equipment. Wires had been ripped out of the cameras with considerable force. Plastic
    brackets were snapped in two. Thick layers of duct tape that had been used to secure the equipment had been ripped
    away. A foot-long piece of TV cable was missing. Analysis of the remaining cable showed it had been slashed with a
    knife.</p>
  <p>Team members excitedly returned to the command center, knowing that the telephone pole that had been assaulted was
    in full view of cameras positioned atop the second pole, located about 200 feet away. The assumption was that,
    whatever had ripped the guts out of the first camera would be clearly visible on video recorded by the second. But
    when they rolled the tape back, they saw nothing. At the exact moment the first camera package was being vandalized,
    nothing visible could be seen anywhere near the second telephone pole. This incident set a pattern for what was to
    follow.</p>
  <p><q>I came up with a term for it</q>, says Col. <span class="people">John Alexander</span>, a retired Army
    intelligence officer who still works on classified projects with Los Alamos National Laboratory and remains an
    adviser to <a
        href="/org/int/otan">NATO</a> organizations. <q>I called it a pre-cognitive sentient intelligence. It certainly
      seemed to be intelligent, and it seemed to know what we were going to do even before we did it.</q></p>
  <p>Alexander is a former adviser to <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> who made the trip to the ranch to see
    what was going on. As a scientist and military insider, he is reluctant to jump to any conclusions about the nature
    of what has happened there. But he suspects, after exploring the property and reading the witness reports, that
    there is an intelligence behind the assorted phenomena and that it almost seems to be playing a game with those who
    are trying to observe it.</p>
  <p>Another <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> staffer arrived at a similar conclusion. He has a doctorate in
    physics, a long list of peer-reviewed papers about cutting-edge scientific concepts, and a lengthy employment
    history with prominent think tanks and classified military programs. He asked that his name not be used in the
    belief that he would never again be hired for sensitive scientific work if his involvement with the ranch were made
    public.</p>
  <p><q>It's a very messy affair. Nothing is clear cut. It isn't as simple as saying that E.T.s or flying saucers are
    doing it</q>, the scientist said. <q>It's some kind of consciousness, but it's always something new and different,
    something non-repeatable. It's reactive to people and equipment, and we set up the ranch to be a proving ground for
    the scientific method, but science doesn't seem amenable to the solution of these kinds of problems.</q></p>

  <h2>Glace et dinosaures</h2>
  <p>As if to punctuate the point, the phenomena at the ranch seemed to constantly evolve. One of the most recent
    incidents occurred on a cold morning in February. The caretaker for the property was patrolling the grounds early in
    the morning. As he walked past a watering hole, he noticed an odd circular impression in the thin ice that had
    formed overnight. Something had carved a perfect circle in the ice. The circle was just under <span itemscope
        itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">6</span> <span itemprop="unitCode" content="FOT">feet</span>
    </span> in diameter and seemed oddly reminiscent of the crop formations seen in English wheat fields.</p>
  <p>The cuts extended only a quarter-inch into the ice and the ice itself was perhaps another quarter-inch thick. The
    question arises, how could this have been done? Someone standing on the muddy bank would have left footprints. The
    only prints were cattle tracks. The ice itself was so thin that it could support almost no weight and certainly
    would have cracked and broken if someone stood on it. Could someone have suspended themselves above the ice patch
    and then somehow carved a perfect circle? How, and more importantly, why? <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a>
    staffers, following the scientific method, collected and analyzed ice shavings from the spot, took readings for
    magnetic fields and EM radiation, checked for tracks throughout the area but found no clues. There is no natural
    explanation for such a subtle event, and it has never been reported again.</p>
  <p><a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> employees compiled a confidential report containing information about all
    the assorted incidents on the ranch. Reading this report will make the hair stand up on your neck. To date, the
    researchers have recorded seven distinct incidents involving magnetic abnormalities. Simply put, their compasses
    went nuts while out on the range. The needles of the compasses either spun out of control, or pointed straight down
    at the ground. No one has a reasonable explanation.</p>
  <p>There were several instances involving some sort of invisible force moving through the ranch and through the
    animals. One witness reported a path of displaced water in the canal, as if a large unseen animal was briskly moving
    through the water. There were distinct splashing noises, and there was a foul pungent odor that filled the air but
    nothing could be seen. A neighboring rancher reported the same phenomena two months later. The Gormans say there
    were several instances where something invisible moved through their cattle, splitting the herd. Their neighbor
    reported the same thing.</p>
  <p>Of all the strange incidents at the ranch, this one may take the prize. It occurred on the night of <time>1997-03-12</time>.
    Barking dogs alerted the team to something lurking in a tree near the ranch house. Tom Gorman grabbed a hunting
    rifle and took off in his truck toward the tree. Two <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> staffers followed in
    another vehicle. Up in the tree branches, they could make out a huge set of yellowish, reptilian eyes. The head of
    this animal had to be three feet wide, they guessed. At the bottom of the tree was something else. Gorman described
    it as huge and hairy, with massively muscled front legs and a doglike head.</p>
  <p>Gorman, who is a crack shot, fired at both figures from a distance of 40 yards. The creature on the ground seemed
    to vanish. The thing in the tree apparently fell to the ground because Gorman heard it as it landed heavily in the
    patches of snow below. All three men ran through the pasture and scrub brush, chasing what they thought was a
    wounded animal, but they never found the animal and saw no blood either. A professional tracker was brought in the
    next day to scour the area. Nothing.</p>
  <p>But there was a physical clue left behind. At the bottom of the tree, they found and photographed a weird
    footprint, or rather, claw print. The print left in the snow was from something large. It had three digits with what
    they guessed were sharp claws on the end. Later analysis and comparison of the print led them to find a chilling
    similarity--the print from the ranch closely resembled that of a velociraptor, an extinct dinosaur made famous in
    the Jurassic Park films. (For the record, no one at <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> is saying he shot a
    velociraptor. They don't know what it was.)</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Encore du bétail mort</h2>
  <p>Two days before the above incident, another animal was found mutilated on the ranch, and it is the only case from
    the ranch that <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> has publicly confirmed before this article. Gorman and his
    wife spent a bright Sunday morning tagging the ears of newborn calves. They put a tag on the ear of a calf born near
    the ranch house, then wandered out into the pasture for a period of <time>P45M</time>. In that interim period, with
    the Gormans only 200 yards away in the pasture, the calf was completely stripped of flesh. The Gormans were alerted
    by a wail from the mother of the calf. The calf's entrails had been placed, almost ritualistically, on the ground,
    but all of its flesh was simply gone, leaving only bone and hide behind. There was no blood on the ground or on the
    animal.</p>
  <p>A <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> team was at the ranch and quickly scoured the area for evidence. The
    remains were sent to two pathology labs. Both pathologists concluded the calf had been butchered by two distinct
    instruments, something like a heavy machete and something like sharp scissors. How this was done in broad daylight,
    in an open pasture and in clear sight of the ranchers remains a mystery. (A second calf disappeared that same
    morning after being tagged and was never found. In all, 12 cattle have met a similar end since <a
        href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> has been on the ranch. A full report on the calf incident can be found on
    the <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> website.)</p>

  <h2>Alors, que se passe-t-il ?</h2>
  <p>Le capitaine Keith Wolverton a été plus de 20 ans enquêteur dans le département du sherif du comté de Cascade à
    <span class="place">Great Falls (Montana)</span>. Au milieu des années 1970s, cette région connut un vague semblable
    d'observations d'ovnis et de <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MutilationsBetail">mutilations de
      bétail</a>, comme d'observations de Bigfoot, et Wolverton enquêta sur toutes.</p>
  <p><q>I asked my boss back then to give me six weeks to solve the mystery</q>, dit Wolverton. <q>It's 30 years later
    and I'm still left with a lot of questions but no answers.</q></p>
  <p>Wolverton wrote a book about his Montana experiences. He came to the ranch to share his expertise with <a
      href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a>, and while there are similarities between the things that happened near
    Great Falls and at the Utah ranch, Wolverton says he's never heard of any place with such a concentration of weird
    activity as the Gorman ranch. Microbiologist Colm Kelleher has reached a similar conclusion.</p>
  <p><q>I thought that if we threw enough personnel and equipment at this one, pull out all the stops, adhere to the
    scientific method, that we would probably get answers</q>, Kelleher says. <q>We have all of these strange cases,
    close to 100, many of them well-documented, but if you try to call that scientific evidence of anything, you'd be
    laughed at</q>.</p>
  <p>The main reason <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> has been unwilling to go public with information about
    the ranch is there isn't much that can be said. For a scientific organization to merely toss out a lot of scary
    stories would be counterproductive, especially if it resulted in hordes of UFO nuts flooding the property and
    interfering with whatever goes on there. Make no mistake, the activity at the ranch certainly seems to have an
    interactive component. It responds to people, events and disturbances. In many instances, it seems capable of
    anticipating things that were about to happen.</p>
  <p><q>The only thing that jumps out of the data is how unreproduceable these things are,</q> Kelleher notes. <q>No two
    events ever repeated themselves in the same fashion. It's almost as if it's a learning curve and we were being led
    along. It's the only thing consistent here.</q></p>
  <p>What could possibly explain all that has happened at the ranch? Natural predators, rustlers or pranksters might
    conceivably be responsible for some of the events, but certainly not all of them. <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a>
    staffers considered the possibility that Indian shaman or black magic practitioners might have been carrying out
    some sort of ritualist campaign at the ranch. They note that the Ute people consider the ranch to be an unholy
    place, a forbidden place, but that explanation falls far short on many levels.</p>
  <p>Hardcore UFO believers have proposed an E.T. connection to events at the ranch, but <a
      href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> staffers say there isn't an iota of evidence to prove such a hypothesis.
    The possibility exists that unknown military units might be capable of producing nearly all of the events that have
    been reported in the area, perhaps as an experiment in psychological warfare. (Tom Gorman was convinced of this for
    a long time, but came to realize the theory was more than a stretch. Someone, somewhere would have seen these
    military men operating in such a rural area.)</p>
  <p>That doesn't leave much. There is one possibility that's worth considering. Cutting-edge physicists have proposed
    the existence of alternate dimensions or parallel universes. Quantum physicists believe that portals may exist
    between our world and other worlds. The concept of wormholes is no longer considered to be the stuff of science
    fiction. New York physicist and author Michio Kaku theorizes that there are 11 dimensions in our universe, although
    humans have only identified four. Might a wormhole resemble the portal of light that was seen on the ranch? And if
    such portals do exist, could they allow beings on the other side to travel into our world? As wacky as it all
    sounds, leading scientists believe that wormholes and alternate dimensions are perfectly consistent with known laws
    of physics. If so, then it isn't much of a leap to suggest that UFOs, aliens, Bigfoot beings or other creatures,
    even poltergeists or spirits, could come and go and never be detected by puzzled, mystified humans.</p>
  <p><q>Aliens may be here now</q>, says Kaku, <q>here in another dimension, a millimeter away from our own world</q>.
  </p>
  <p>Admittedly, it all sounds farfetched. But if anyone has a better explanation, let's hear it.</p>

  <h2>A final note</h2>
  <p>For further discussion of the Gorman Ranch mystery, along with a few personal observations, check out the Knappster
    column elsewhere in this issue. Also, the website of the National Institute for Discovery Science is packed with
    information and research papers concerning these and other issues. Anyone with information or insight about the
    ranch, UFOs or mutilations is welcome to contact NIDS through the website. All such contacts will remain
    confidential.</p>
  <p>Another word of warning to UFO diehards: It is probably futile to ask for restraint on the part of the faithful,
    but here goes anyway. Visitors are not welcome at the Gorman ranch. The ranch is patrolled 24 hours a day, seven
    days a week, and <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> emphatically declares that trespassers will be arrested
    and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. One of the principal caretakers of the property is a 20-year
    veteran of Utah law enforcement and will not hesitate to bust people who mess with the property, the animals or the
    staff. The people who live in the area do not want to be hassled. So leave them alone. Don't be a jerk.</p>
  <p>De plus, quiconque espérant trouver le ranch et voir des ovnis ou un Bigfoot seront profondément déçus. L'activité
    paranormale sur la propriété a all but disappeared over the past year, which is a primary reason that access was
    obtained from NIDS for this article.</p>
  <p>The NIDS website is at www.nidsci.org. The <a href="/org/us/asso/NIDS.html">NIDS</a> online report form, where
    people can electronically report UFO sightings, animal mutilations, etc., is at www.nidsci.org/reportform.html. The
    NIDS UFO hotline number is 702-798-1700.</p>
