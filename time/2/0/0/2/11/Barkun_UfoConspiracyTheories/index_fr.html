<p>Immediatement après l'attentat à l'explosion d'Oklahoma City au printemps <time>1995</time>, les américains moyens
  prirent soudain conscience de l'existence d'une sous-culture politique radicale en leur sein. Avec l'arrestation de
  Timothy McVeigh et de Terry Nichols et la couverture mediatique de leurs vies, attitudes et associations, le public
  fut brusquement introduit au monde jusqu'ici insulaire des milices, émissions sur ondes courtes antigouvernementales
  et à la littérature raciste. Un roman raciste (écrit par Andrew Macdonald, également connu sous le nom de William
  Pierce), <em>The Turner Diaries ― </em>pouvant être obtenu par des librairies conventionnelles ― devint l'objet d'un
  intérêt intense après que l'on apprit que McVeigh l'avait lu et recommandé, et il fut révélé que le roman contenait un
  épisode étonnamment similaire à l'attentat contre le bâtiment fédéral. Une avalanche de récits télévisuels, dans les
  magazines et les journaux dévoilèrent l'existence de croyants à la <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/scenario/conspiration/index.html">conspiration</a> obsédés par des
  hélicoptères noirs et armés contre ce qu'ils pensaient être une invasion imminent par des forces du Nouvel Ordre
  Mondial <span

</p>
<p>Plus que tout autre événement, l'attentat à la bombe de Oklahoma City porta les idées du Nouveau Ordre Mondial à
  l'attention du public. Mais les idées du Nouvel Ordre Mondial avaient commencé à infiltrer des segments plus large de
  la conscience américaine plus tôt encore. Pat Robertson avait publié son livre <em>The New World Order</em> en <a
      href="../../../../../../1/9/9/1/index.html">1991</a>. La version de Robertson de la conspiration (ce qu'on
  pourrait appeler le "Nouvel Ordre Mondial allégé") est doux comparé à celui que de figures de la milice comme Mark
  Koernke ; néanmoins, son livre est rempli d'avertissements de mauvaise augure : <q>Les religions de la Nouvelle Ere,
    les croyances de l'Illuminati, et la Franc-Maçonnerie Illuminée semblent tous se déplacer sur des pistes parallèles
    au communisme mondiale et à la finance mondiale. Leur appels varient quelque peu, mais essentiellement ils luttent
    pour la même effrayante vision</q>. Robertson déclare qu'un réseau d'élite des superriches, agissant à travers des
  sociétés secrètes, est sur le point de prendre un contrôle indisputé du monde. Au même moment, des références au
  Nouvel Ordre Mondial commençaient aussi à apparaître dans les discours d'une autre figure publique conspicuous, Pat
  Buchanan, qui liait de telles préoccupations à des menaces sur l'indépendance économique de l'Amerique <span
      class="source">Pat Robertson, <em>The New World Order </em>(Dallas:  Word, 1991), p. 185. "Buchanan Promises 'Millennial Struggle' against  World Government," <a
      href="https://www.cnn.com">CNN</a>, 6 janvier 2000;  (7 janvier   2000).</span>.</p>
<p>Thus in the early 1990s New World Order conspiracy theories ceased to be beliefs that circulated only in an obscure
  political underground and began to penetrate some channels of mainstream discourse. In fact, however, the most
  dramatic New World Order penetration came not from Robertson, Buchanan, or coverage of the Oklahoma City bombers.
  Rather, it occurred earlier, in a segment of American culture that straddles the divide between "mainstream" and
  "deviant" and encompasses millions of people―the UFO community. Those who are interested in UFOs, believe in them, or
  claim to have been contacted or abducted by them form a subculture knitted together by lecture circuits, Web sites,
  magazines, and conventions. Depending on how it is defined, it is also a subculture of immense size. </p>
<h2>Ovnis et opinion publique</h2>
<p>The number of Americans who actually participate in the UFO subculture―by buying books, magazines, and videotapes;
  attending conferences; visiting Web sites; and engaging in similar activities―cannot be precisely estimated. But
  survey data make clear that those who do participate represent merely a fraction of a vast number of people interested
  in the subject. Whether they are open-minded or simply credulous, it remains the case that millions of Americans view
  UFOs with considerably less skepticism than do the government and the academy. </p>
<p>Within a few months of the first modern claim of a flying saucer sighting in June 1947, polls showed that 90 percent
  of the population had heard of them. By 1966, that figure had risen to 96 percent, and, more important, 46 percent of
  all Americans believed UFOs actually existed. More than a decade later―in 1978―30 percent of college graduates
  believed they existed. At that time, the number of Americans who believed UFOs were real reached its highest level, 57
  percent. The number fell to 47 percent in 1990 but was still at 48 percent in a 1996 Gallup poll, nearly half a
  century after the first sighting <span class="source">Phil Patton, "Indeed They Have Landed. Look Around," <em>The New York Times,</em> June 15, 1997, section H, 38.

</p>
<p>The Yankelovich polling organization interviewed 1,546 adults in mid-January 2000 for <em>Life</em> magazine.
  Forty-three percent of respondents believed UFOs were real as opposed to "the product of people's imaginations," and
  30 percent thought intelligent beings from other planets had visited the earth. Six percent had seen a UFO, and 13
  percent knew someone who had. Seven percent claimed to have "had an encounter with beings from another planet" or knew
  someone who had <span class="source">Cynthia Fox, "The Search for Extraterrestrial Life," <em>Life </em>(March 2000): 56.</span>.
</p>
<p>A 1997 <em>Time-</em>CNN poll (presumably commissioned in connection with the fiftieth anniversary of the Roswell,
  New Mexico, UFO "crash") indicated that 17 percent of Americans believed in alien abduction. An even stranger result
  had appeared in a 1992 Roper survey, which suggested that 2 percent of Americans (roughly 3.7 million) believed they
  themselves had been abducted. While the Roper result is almost certainly inflated, a number even half as large would
  be extraordinary <span class="source">Dean, <em>Aliens in America, </em>pp. 30, 52</span>.</p>
<p>Two aspects of these figures are particularly striking. First, they have remained astonishingly stable over a
  fifty-year period. What might have been an early Cold War fad clearly came to occupy a semipermanent niche in the
  American psyche. Second, the level of belief was not only relatively stable; it was extraordinarily high, regardless
  of when the survey was taken or by which polling organization. Even if one compensates for problems of sampling or the
  wording of questions, tens of millions of Americans accept the reality of UFOs. In a survey of 765 members of the UFO
  community, Brenda Denzler found her respondents to be anything but "fringe." They were predominantly white, male,
  middle-class college graduates, with incomes just slightly below the national median <span class="source">Brenda Denzler, <em>The Lure of the Edge: Scientific Passions, Religious Beliefs, and the Pursuit of UFOs</em> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001), pp. 164―167</span>.
</p>
<p>At the same time, attitudes about UFOs contain the seeds of conspiracist thinking, for public attitudes are clearly
  at variance with the official position that there is no credible evidence that UFOs exist. Indeed, in the 1996 Gallup
  survey when subjects were asked, "In your opinion, does the U.S. government know more about UFOs than they are telling
  us?" 71 percent answered yes. In the Yankelovich poll in 2000, 49 percent believed that the government was withholding
  information about UFOs <span
      class="source">"Gallup UFO Poll." Fox, "The Search for Extraterrestrial Life," p. 56</span>.</p>
<p>Thus an extremely large number of people hold beliefs that contradict official government positions and believe that
  government concealment explains the discrepancy. Belief in a government cover-up runs deep in the ufology community,
  especially among those who are professional or full-time UFO writers or investigators. Because government
  investigations have failed to satisfy believers, the existence of a cover-up appears logical to them. Even so, early
  ufologists did not generally advance a broader political agenda. While steadfastly maintaining that military and
  intelligence organizations were concealing the truth from the public, they did not extend that suspicion to embrace
  any larger ideology of conspiracy. In short, ufology's early political program did not extend beyond a general desire
  to see revealed what was believed to be concealed. </p>
<p>But by the late 1980s, elements of the UFO community began to link their interest in explaining flying saucers with a
  larger political vision. Receptivity to New World Order ideas in some UFO circles was facilitated by two legends
  peculiar to the ufology milieu: the "men in black" story and the tale of underground bases. </p>
<p>The legend of the men in black originated in the early and mid 1950s and quickly became a staple of UFO folklore.
  According to this legend, people whose experiences or research brought them too close to the truth were apt to be
  stalked, harassed, or even killed by small groups of men―usually two or three―in dark suits who did not identify
  themselves. Their ambiguous appearance has led to a number of explanations: to some, they are secret government
  operatives; to others, representatives of a conspiracy that controls the government; to still others, they are aliens
  whose appearance is close enough to that of humans to allow them to pass. In any case, their appearance and demeanor
  make them a potent symbol of mysterious but pervasive evil <span class="source">"Men in Black," in <em>The UFO Encyclopedia, </em>ed. John Spencer (New York: Avon, 1993), pp. 210―211.

The first book on the subject, which initially appeared in 1956, was by Gray Barker: <em>They Knew Too Much about Flying Saucers,</em> repr. (Lilburn, Ga.: IllumiNet, 1997)</span>.
</p>
<p>The underground-bases legend is part of a larger complex of beliefs about secret installations where (depending on
  the version) captured or crashed alien craft or aliens themselves may be kept. In the most dramatic versions, the
  aliens actually control parts of the installation, either by themselves or in concert with secret government agencies.
  The most famous base is Area 51, also known as Groom Lake and Dreamland, north of Las Vegas, Nevada; but the most
  elaborate tales involve labyrinthine subterranean caverns, tunnels, and chambers such as those allegedly near the town
  of Dulce, New Mexico. These stories have led to belief in a hidden world variously inhabited by alien beings or evil
  human forces, in which conspirators can both conceal their enterprises and seek safety when disasters overtake the
  earth's surface <span class="source">The literature on each is very large; but the nature of the material  can be gleaned from the following.

</p>
<h2>Ovnis et Nouvel Ordre Mondial</h2>
<p>Gradually, parts of the UFO community began to adopt elements of the conspiracy theories described in the previous
  two chapters, and by the end of the 1980s virtually all of the radical right's ideas about the New World Order had
  found their way into UFO literature. Ufology's adoption of the New World Order was by no means universal, but those
  who have found it attractive have been able to create a version of New World Order theory with some distinct political
  advantages. </p>
<p>The most immediate advantage for New World Order ideas of being placed in a UFO context has been a reduction in
  stigma. Although UFO ideas have often been the target of ridicule, the enormous size of the UFO-accepting public has
  made it impossible to stigmatize UFO beliefs so completely that they are banned from public discussion. Far from
  it―UFO ideas have ready access to such avenues of distribution as cable television, mainstream bookstores, and
  magazine publishers. They fall into the realm of stigmatized knowledge discussed in chapter 2, in that they are
  rejected by science, universities, and government, but the level of stigmatization has not been so great as to exclude
  them from popular culture. </p>
<p>By contrast, the views of the radical right have been so excluded, through an unstated yet powerful pattern of
  self-censorship on the part of the mainstream. This voluntary silence has denied access to beliefs deemed racist,
  bigoted, completely unfounded, or likely to justify or promote violence. Tales of secret Illuminati conspiracies,
  imminent UN invasions, and Jewish, Masonic, or Jesuit plots, for example, have been informally banned from media,
  classrooms, and other mechanisms of knowledge distribution. Unlike beliefs about flying saucers, considered eccentric
  but socially harmless, many conspiracy ideas deemed both false and dangerous have been banished from the mainstream
  discourse. </p>
<p>Le fait de relier les idées de Nouvel Ordre Mondial avec les ovnis a donné au former a bridge to the territory of
  semirespectable beliefs. Ufology became, as it were, the vehicle for the New World Order to reach audiences otherwise
  unavailable to it. To be sure, New World Order ideas occasionally reached mass audiences, as the cases of Pat
  Robertson and Pat Buchanan have shown. In both cases, however, the conspiracies were presented in highly diluted
  versions; and in Robertson's case, even his weak version produced significant political problems. </p>
<p>L'histoire du lien Nouvel Ordre Mondial―Ovnis est celle d'idées allant dans 2 directions, pas 1 seule. Dans le
  mouvement initial (examiné plus tard dans ce chapitre), les croyances du Nouvel Ordre Mondial se sont entrelacées avec
  les croyances liées aux ovnis. Une 2<sup>nde</sup> migration a suivi dans les années 1990s, dans laquelle les idées du
  Nouvel Ordre Mondial avec leurs nouveaux ajouts liés aux ovnis sont retournées dans le milieu de droite où elles
  s'étaient développées en premier. Dans ce milieu, la combinaison a mené au développement de 2 synthèses diamétralement
  opposées. Dans l'une, exemplifiée par l'auteur et conférencier britannique <a href="/people/i/IckeDavid/index.html">David
    Icke</a> (discuté en longueur dans le chapitre 6), les conspirateurs humains feared by the radical right are
  actually doing the bidding of forces extraterrestres malveillantes dont le but à terme est de contrôler la Terre. Dans
  l'autre, incarné par la vision de <a href="/people/c/CooperWilliamMilton/index.html">Milton William Cooper</a> à la
  fin de sa vie (adressé plus tard dans ce chapitre), il n'y a en fait aucun extraterrestre. L'apparence d'un agression
  extraterrestre sur la Terre est fabriquée par les conspirateurs humains pour fournir un pretexte à the assumption of
  global dictatorial powers. </p>
<p>The first movement, when New World Order ideas left the hermetic world of the extreme right and began to seep into
  ufology, is the more significant of the two. As the preceding discussion suggests, there were factors in ufology that
  made this penetration seem logical, but it was not inevitable. It does not seem to have been consciously undertaken by
  conspiracists or done for opportunistic reasons, even though in the end it provided a large new audience. Rather, it
  began in a disorganized, piecemeal fashion, and it provides a case study in the migration of deviant ideas. </p>
<h2>Conspirationnisme Ovni : la 1<sup>ère</sup> phase</h2>
<p>Le développement des théories de conspiration du Nouvel Ordre Mondial au sein de l'<a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/index.html">ufologie</a> peut être mieux compris comme le produit de 2 phases séparées. La
  1<sup>ère</sup> ― d'environ <a href="../../../../../../1/9/7/5/index.html">1975</a> à <a
      href="../../../../../../1/9/8/0/index.html">1980</a> ― introduisit des motifs de plus en plus conspirationnels
  dans la spéculation sur les ovnis, mais sans liens discernables avec les idées de conspiration qui prévalaient alors
  dans l'extrême-droite. Il semblait y avoir 2 voies conspirationnistes distinctes se développant indépendamment l'une
  de l'autre. Cette absence de connexion entre les 2 est particulièrement frappante parce que la fin des années <a
      href="../../../../../../1/9/7/index.html">1970s</a> était une période d'activité substantielle à droite, avec la
  croissance de mouvements comme l'Identité Chrétienne et le Posse Comitatus. Le Posse était un mouvement
  antigovernemental constitué de groupes paramilitaires locaux actifs dans l'ouest et le midwest durant les années <a
      href="../../../../../../1/9/7/index.html">1970s</a> et 1980s. Ils pensaient que la seule autorité gouvernementale
  légitime était le county sheriff's posse, sous la forme des hommes adultes armés d'une communauté. There is no
  evidence that ufologists were aware of, interested in, or sympathetic to those tendencies. </p>
<p>During this initial phase, some important themes emerged in the UFO literature that were eventually integrated into
  more elaborate conspiratorial structures. One of these concerned small devices allegedly implanted in the bodies of
  UFO abductees. Although such stories were not numerous, they implied the existence of a powerful technology for
  monitoring and controlling victims' behavior. Thomas Bullard's detailed analysis of 270 abduction stories (most of
  them dating between the 1940s and 1980) reveals only thirteen cases of reported implants―barely 5 %. These were almost
  uniformly distributed among the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Despite their small numbers, however, the implant stories
  contained two points of potential connection with the independently developed New World Order conspiracy theories
  described earlier. First, they offered apparent confirmation of the mark of the beast associated with the Antichrist.
  Second, they also appeared to validate the mind-control fears of more secular conspiracists <span class="source">"Abduction Phenomenon," in <em>The UFO Encyclopedia, </em>ed. Jerome Clark, vol. 1 (Detroit: Apogee, 1990), p. 4. Thomas E. Bullard, <em>UFO Abductions: The Measure of a Mystery </em>(n.p.: Fund for UFO Research, 1987), vol. 1, pp. 87―88.</span>.
</p>
<p>About the same time, in 1976, a Toronto-based neo-Nazi and Holocaust denier, Ernst Zundel, published the first of
  several reports linking flying saucers with the Nazis. In the strangest version of this tale, Nazis, not aliens, had
  invented flying saucers and, with the regime's defeat, had fled to subterranean bases in Antarctica with their
  invention. The suggestion that flying saucers had been under development by the Third Reich and were spirited out of
  Germany appears to have emerged first among German nationalists in the 1950s. It was quickly assimilated into legends
  of Hitler's supposed escape to South America or the Antarctic. By 1960, comparable tales were circulating in English,
  though their full elaboration had to await the efforts of Zundel and other neo-Nazis a decade and a half later. While
  this scenario begged the question of how so technologically advanced a government could manage to lose the war, it was
  a story that turned out to have a long life for two reasons. First, it introduced the idea that a secret group of
  human beings might in some conspiratorial fashion develop such devices. Second, it established a link between UFOs and
  the much older occultic tradition of an "inner world" beneath the earth, discussed in detail in chapter 7 <span

The Nazi-UFO stories have been most fully reconstructed by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke in <em>Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity</em> (New York: New York University Press, 2002), chap. 8</span>.
</p>
<p>The year 1976 was also the year that some ufologists began to link UFOs with cattle mutilations. Stories of mutilated
  cattle, mostly in western states, began to appear in the late 1960s and became numerous and the subject of national
  media coverage by the mid 1970s. Although they were occasionally connected to reports of UFO sightings, a number of
  alternative explanations were offered, including satanic rituals, "hippies," and natural enemies. The carcasses were
  often missing portions of soft tissue, and some reports claimed that cuts were made with a precision inconsistent with
  animal predators <span class="source">"Animal Mutilations and UFOs," in <em>The UFO Encyclopedia, </em>ed.  Jerome Clark, vol. 3 (Detroit: Omnigraphics, 1996), pp. 18―25. George  E. Onet, "Animal Mutilations: What We Know," National Institute for  Discovery Science, https://www.nidsci.org/articles/animal1.html  (September 13, 2000). Idem, "<a
      href="https://www.nidsci.org/articles/animal2.html">Animal Mutilations: What We Don't Know</a>",  National Institute for Discovery Science,  (September 13, 2000).</span>.
</p>
<p>In 1979, Linda Moulton Howe, a Denver filmmaker, began work on a documentary that alleged a mutilation-UFO
  connection. The film, <em>A Strange Harvest, </em>was broadcast in 1980. She later stated that "I am convinced that
  one or more alien intelligences are affecting this planet. I would like to know who they are, what they want and why
  the government is silent." Howe and others, influenced by her film and subsequent publications, began to speculate
  that aliens mutilated cattle in order to secure body parts or biological substances they needed for their own
  survival, and that the U.S. government was complicit in these efforts. The idea that aliens were engaged in some
  obscure effort to "harvest" or otherwise retrieve biological substances from the earth has turned out to be a fertile
  subject for speculation, which eventually came to include such suggestions as the breeding of alien-human hybrids. The
  ease with which stories of cattle mutilation were assimilated into the UFO literature was a paradigmatic case of
  fusing disparate forms of stigmatized knowledge. If cattle mutilations and alien spaceships could be connected, why
  not other stigmatized knowledge claims as well? <span class="source">"Animal Mutilations and UFOs," pp. 18, 23.</span>
</p>
<p>Speculations about an alien harvest soon coalesced with aspects of the abduction stories. Nearly half of the
  abduction tales examined by Bullard featured invasive, often painful physical examinations. A number of accounts
  included examinations of reproductive organs, and about half a dozen individuals reported sexual intercourse with
  alien beings. Out of this body of narratives came suggestions that aliens were seeking either to harvest substances
  from human bodies or to create a race of alien-human hybrids. Because the "other" here was alien in every sense, it
  was easy to blur the distinction between procedures performed on cattle and those performed on human beings; in the
  more sinister interpretation, it suggested that human beings were being treated like breeding stock, presumably to
  compensate for some biological defect in the aliens <span class="source">"Linda Moulton Howe: The 'Alien Harvest' and Beyond," transcript of a conversation in <em>UFOs and the Alien Presence: Six Viewpoints, </em>ed.

</p>
<p>In 1977, UFO speculation took a different turn with the broadcast by Anglia TV in Great Britain of the strange
  purported documentary <em>Alternative 3. Alternative 3 </em>claimed to expose a secret plan, approved at the highest
  levels of the U.S. and Soviet governments, to launch a program of space colonization that would allow a select few to
  flee the earth before environmental calamities made the planet uninhabitable. The show strongly implied that a secret
  joint base already existed on the far side of the moon, that another existed or would shortly be established on Mars,
  and that the Martian surface, contrary to general belief, was hospitable to human life <span class="source"><em>Alternative 3</em> (videotape; Beverly Hills, Calif.: Underground Video, 1996); originally broadcast on <em>Science Report,</em> Anglia Television (U.K.), April 1, 1977.</span>.
</p>
<p><em>Alternative 3</em> was clearly a hoax―and not only because it was broadcast on April Fool's Day. The interviews
  with supposed scientists, astronauts, and others were far too dramatically polished to have been spontaneous, and in
  any case the program's closing credits named the actors who took the roles of interviewees and correspondents. Though
  artfully produced, the show's counterfeit documentary style could scarcely have been expected to fool many. As an
  Anglia TV spokesman put it, <q>we felt viewers would be fairly sophisticated about it</q>. They apparently were not;
  television and newspaper switchboards were swamped after the broadcast. Anglia found it prudent to sell off the book
  rights. The 1978 book version, by Leslie Watkins, continued the pretense of factuality. It also reached countries,
  including the United States, where the broadcast had not been aired. Whenever the book was unavailable, believers
  attributed its absence to the conspirators' attempts at suppression. This type of quasiparanoid fear is a particularly
  strong tendency in the United States. And the story lent itself to conspiracist interpretations―who were the elite the
  secret space program was intended to save? Even those willing to acknowledge that <em>Alternative 3 </em>was trumped
  up insisted that its core argument might very well be true―another instance of the demolition of the fact-fiction
  boundary discussed in chapter 2 <span class="source"><em>Alternative 3.</em> Leslie Watkins, <em>Alternative 3 </em>(London: Sphere, 1978). Jim Keith, <em>Casebook on Alternative 3: UFOs, Secret Societies and World Control </em>(Lilburn, Ga.: IllumiNet, 1994). Idem, <em>Mind Control and UFOs: Casebook on Alternative 3 </em>(Lilburn, Ga.: IllumiNet, 1999). Bob Rickard, "Hoax: Alternative," <em>Fortean Times </em>64 (August―September 1992): 47―49.</span>.
</p>
<p><em>Alternative 3 </em>does not mention UFOs or aliens. As discussed in chapter 6, its role in the growth of
  conspiracy theory lay in a later permutation, according to which UFOs and the threat of an alien invasion of the earth
  are believed to have been invented by the shadowy elite in order to gather sufficient power and resources to complete
  the space-colonization enterprise. When the scenario of Alternative 3 came to be enfolded within ufological
  conspiracism, it suggested that UFO conspiracy theories could go in two different directions. The first insisted on
  the reality of a threat from outer space, with human conspirators involved as the aliens' lackeys or collaborators.
  The other direction, following the Alternative 3 suggestion, claimed that UFOs from outer space were a deception
  concocted by the conspirators for their own malevolent purposes, in order to deflect attention from the real evil.

  les <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/index.html">documents du MJ-12</a>. </p>
<p>Le <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> ― parfois désigné comme Majestic-12 ou
  Majic-12 ― purports to be a document prepared for President Dwight Eisenhower, to which was attached a memo from
  President Harry Truman to his defense secretary, James Forrestal. Though made public in 1987, <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> had a history that went back to 1984. </p>
<p>According to those involved, on December 11, 1984, Jaime Shandera, a film producer, received a package anonymously
  sent from Albuquerque, New Mexico, containing an undeveloped roll of film. He and UFO writer William Moore developed
  the film, which they said contained images of les <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/index.html">documents
    du MJ-12</a>. Although the documents were not made public until June 1987, when they were revealed at a UFO
  conference in Washington, D.C., UFO publications referred to them as early as 1985. Facsimile copies were reproduced
  in the British edition (and later the American edition) of Timothy Good's <em>Above Top Secret, </em>and have appeared
  elsewhere many times since <span

</p>
<p>Les <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/index.html">documents du MJ-12</a> take the form of a
  briefing paper for the newly elected president, informing him of the existence of a supersecret group of the same
  name, allegedly established during the Truman administration, that consists of a dozen high military and scientific
  figures. The documents describe crashes of UFOs and the recovery of their occupants' bodies, which established them as
  of indisputably extraterrestrial origin. </p>
<p>Le <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> polarisa immédiatement the UFO community
  into believers and skeptics. Among the skeptics was Jacques Vallee, who compared the incident to the activities of
  "Deep Throat" during the Watergate scandal. He suggested that the documents' sender was more likely interested in
  disinformation than in whistle-blowing, and implied that the documents were forged. Even more dismissive was Philip J.
  Klass, a longtime debunker of UFO hoaxes, who argued that the format and language of the documents pointed to forgery

<p>In the years since les <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/index.html">documents du MJ-12</a> became
  widely known, they have taken on a life of their own. Additional, related documents periodically appear, some as
  recently as 1998. Just as with the Kennedy assassination, <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> has generated a cottage industry of
  commentators, authenticators, and critics. More broadly, <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> laid the foundation for elaborate
  conspiracy theories by suggesting that UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin, that the federal government was aware of
  them as early as the late 1940s, and that a secret bureaucracy had been created to study and control the situation.
  These claims allowed some ufologists to shift from observation of flying saucers to attempts to unravel alleged
  government machinations. The proliferation of <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/index.html">documents
    du MJ-12</a> and theories not only identified the enemy as a segment of the government, but―inasmuch as this "secret
  government" was supposed to have hidden all relevant information―allowed great latitude in what might be "revealed."
  It mattered little whether publicly available evidence confirmed a claim; its author could always respond, <q>The
    government knows it, but won't tell you</q> <span class="source">For example, "Declassified Documents Confirm Recovery of Alien Craft and Bodies!" <em>Nexus</em> 6 (February―March 1999): 55―60.</span>.
</p>
<p>The first such revelation occurred on December 29, 1987, a few months after the release of the <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/index.html">documents du MJ-12</a>. It took the form of a statement
  by John Lear, estranged son of inventor William Lear. Building upon the original <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/index.html">documents du MJ-12</a>, Lear constructs a far more
  elaborate edifice of intrigue and dissimulation. The Lear statement narrates the purported history of the relationship
  between the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> group and the extraterrestrials
  from 1947 to 1987. Although Lear cites few sources and offers no documentation, his statement, like many conspiracy
  narratives, is striking in its specificity. </p>
<p>The "horrible truth" to which <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> was allegedly
  privy was so frightening that it drove at least one member―Secretary of Defense Forrestal―to suicide, his death
  disguised as the result of mental illness. According to Lear, the U.S. government began to hold meetings with the
  aliens on April 30, 1964, and by 1971 had negotiated a "deal." Its terms called for transfer of the aliens' technology
  to the government, in exchange for which the government would acquiesce in cattle mutilations and in the temporary
  abduction of American citizens. The abductees would be implanted with tracking and control devices, given posthypnotic
  suggestions, sometimes used as guinea pigs in genetic engineering and cross-breeding programs, and occasionally killed
  <span
      class="source">"Statement Released By: John Lear, December 29, 1987," William F. Hamilton III, <em>Alien Magic</em> (Glendale, Calif.: Uforces, 1989).</span>.
</p>
<p>Lear's text alleged that the "EBEs" (extraterrestrial biological entities) have a "genetic disorder" that has caused
  their digestive system to atrophy. They can survive only by ingesting biological substances obtained from cows or
  humans, or by creating an alien-human cross-bred race. This need led to the construction, under government auspices,
  of gigantic laboratories, not only to receive the aliens' technology but also to allow them to conduct biological
  experiments. These laboratories included Groom Lake, Nevada (better known in the ufology literature as Area 51 or
  Dreamland), and several in New Mexico, notably near the small town of Dulce. There, Lear claims, a joint <a
      href="/org/us/ic/cia/index.html">CIA</a>-alien laboratory provides facilities for unspeakable experiments on
  abducted subjects. Indeed, the aliens' behavior was so repugnant that in 1979 a subterranean battle supposedly took
  place between them and U.S. military personnel, in which sixty-six U.S. troops were killed <span
      class="source">Ibid.</span>.</p>
<p>The battle at Dulce was the beginning of a crisis for <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a>, which gradually became aware of the "Grand
  Deception"―namely, the failure of the aliens to live up to their agreement. Their technology turned out to be only
  partially usable, they were abducting far more Americans than they had agreed to, and they were mistreating them.
  Faced with this situation, <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> supposedly
  decided it was foolhardy to attempt immediate resistance and instead opted to develop weapons that might permit
  effective resistance at some later time. This weapons development program was the Strategic Defense Initiative,
  disguised as a Cold War project <span class="source">Ibid.</span>.</p>
<p>The Lear statement is brief―only seven printed pages―but dizzying in its claims. It elevates <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> to a conspiratorial position nowhere hinted
  at in the original papers themselves. It implies a web of subsidiary conspiracies―to silence the news media and the
  academic community, and to mislead the UFO community as well. According to Lear, ufologist William Moore, the figure
  most identified with the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> papers, was
  probably himself a disinformation agent in the hire of <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a>. The statement ends with a litany of
  rhetorical questions―a common device in conspiracy literature―all implying that the aliens' ultimate aim is the
  conquest of the earth, and that the conspirators in government, centered in <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a>, are powerless to prevent it <span
      class="source">Ibid.</span>.</p>
<p>Although Lear did not employ the term <em>New World Order,</em> he managed to bring together a number of elements
  compatible with New World Order theory, including mind-control implants, a government within the government, and the
  kidnapping of hundreds of thousands of Americans. Lear's claim of having been a <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/index.html">CIA</a>
  pilot only added to the sense that this was an insider's view, notwithstanding the paucity of evidence <span
      class="source">A brief biographical statement precedes the text of Lear's statement.</span>.</p>
<p>If Lear had been alone in his bizarre allegations, they would have disappeared from view. But they were quickly taken
  up and amplified by a figure who was to prove central to the convergence of UFO and militia positions: Milton William
  Cooper, the most famous of UFO conspiracists. <a href="/people/c/CooperWilliamMilton/index.html">Cooper</a> also had a
  military background, having served in the air force and later the navy, from which he was discharged in 1975. Between
  his discharge and his ufology debut, he apparently received some training and experience in photography as well as
  working at administrative jobs in vocational colleges. Best known in ufology circles for his bitter conflicts with
  rivals and critics, his conspiracist reputation rests primarily on a 1991 book, <em>Behold a Pale Horse. </em>While it
  may not be, as <a href="/people/c/CooperWilliamMilton/index.html">Cooper</a>'s Web site biography claims, <q>the best
    selling underground book of all time</q>, it is widely available and, apparently, widely read in ufology,

</p>
<h2>The Cooper Narrative</h2>
<p><a href="/people/c/CooperWilliamMilton/index.html">Cooper</a> presented his own <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> account in a series of related documents
  released between December 1988 and the end of 1989. Coming as they did immediately after both the <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> release and the Lear statement, Cooper's
  claims caused a sensation in ufology circles. In a series of Internet postings and in an appearance at the Mutual UFO
  Network (MUFON) symposium in Las Vegas in July 1989, Cooper claimed to have seen an astonishing array of secret UFO
  documents during his naval career. His earliest accounts, from December 1988 and January 1989, closely parallel the <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> papers and the Lear statement, yet they
  mention neither Moore nor Lear. Instead, Cooper claimed independent knowledge, asserting that in 1972, while in the
  navy, he was shown sets of documents and photographs dealing with UFOs, their extraterrestrial passengers, and
  relations between the extraterrestrials and the federal government <span class="source">Don Ecker, "Dead Man Talking," <em>Fortean Times</em> 155 (March 2002): 38.</span>.
</p>
<p>The earliest statement of <a href="/people/c/CooperWilliamMilton/index.html">Cooper</a>'s views―"Top
  Secret/Majic"―was, according to Linda Moulton Howe, posted on the CompuServe and Paranet networks on December 18,
  1988. It purports to summarize the material Cooper says he saw sixteen years previously. While the substance is
  closely related to the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> and Lear materials,
  the structure of Cooper's statement is quite different. It is neither a set of primary documents nor a narrative. Most
  of it consists of brief sections, often no more than a paragraph, each of which describes or defines a name or term
  Cooper said he encountered in the original navy material. Many are names of projects or operations allegedly initiated
  by the government to deal with extraterrestrials, giving the entire statement a decidedly bureaucratic tinge <span
      class="source">The December 18 statement is reproduced in Howe, <em>An Alien Harvest, </em>pp. 177―196.</span>.
</p>
<p>Several details of <a href="/people/c/CooperWilliamMilton/index.html">Cooper</a>'s account are noteworthy, either in
  the manner in which they distance themselves from Moore and Lear or by suggesting new political implications. The
  latter are particularly important, because in the 1990s Cooper emerged as the most conspicuous link between UFO
  conspiracists and militia circles. </p>
<p>Les variations de <a href="/people/c/CooperWilliamMilton/index.html">Cooper</a>, bien que minimes, augmentèrent la
  congruence entre les conspirations sur les ovnis et les histoires de plans circulant dans l'extrême-droite, bien qu'il
  n'y ait aucun élément explicite indiquant que <a href="/people/c/CooperWilliamMilton/index.html">Cooper</a> était
  familier de la littérature de droite à l'époque. Dans sa version, le groupe <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> est une partie relativement réduite d'une
  entreprise de gouvernement bien plus large visant à comprendre les extraterrestres, traiter avec eux et empêcher la
  connaissance d'atteindre le grand public. Sans surprise, la <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/index.html">CIA</a> est décrite
  comme centrale à l'enterprise, une déclaration également faite dans la description de la conspiration par <a
      href="/people/a/AndrewsGeorgeC/index.html">Andrews</a> en <a href="../../../../../../1/9/8/6/index.html">1986</a>.
  Les hélicoptères noirs font aussi une apparition, qui accompagneraient des vols d'essais d'appareils exrtaterrestres
  récupérés au-dessus du désert du Nevada. Bien qu'<a href="/people/a/AndrewsGeorgeC/index.html">Andrews</a> n'a pas
  spécifiquement mentionné d'hélicoptères <em>noirs</em>, il a bien rapporté des transformations dans lesquelles les
  soucoupes se changeaient en hélicoptères et vice versa <span class="source">Howe, <em>An Alien Harvest, </em>pp. 183, 184―185. Andrews, <em>Extra-Terrestrials among Us, </em>p. 184.</span>.
</p>
<p><a href="/people/c/CooperWilliamMilton/index.html">Cooper</a> did not mention the Trilateral Commission, but he
  introduced motifs that were to make its future inclusion appear natural. He referred to teams called Delta that, he
  claimed, provide security for all projects related to the aliens and whose members in fact are the legendary men in
  black. Later on, others more explicitly identified this group with the well-known Delta Force counterterrorism
  organization. Cooper's references to Delta are closely related to his lengthy discussion of what he called "a
  trilateral insignia" allegedly found on alien spacecraft. He claimed that the Delta security guards wear red badges
  with a black triangle, similar to the "alien flag" of a triangle divided by parallel lines. His linking of the terms
  <em>delta, trilateral,</em> and <em>men in black</em> offered the possibility of conspiracy in which U.S. military
  forces, aliens, and the Trilateral Commission collude <span class="source">Howe, <em>An Alien Harvest, </em>pp.  185, 190―191. Milton William Cooper, "<a
      href="https://server.wizards.net/mac/handy/incoming/cooperdoc.html">The Cooper Document: The Absolute  True Information Regarding the Alien Presence on Earth</a>" (1989), posted  October 29, 1997  (November  6, 1997); capitalization in original.</span>.
</p>
<p>Like Lear, <a href="/people/c/CooperWilliamMilton/index.html">Cooper</a> alleged that the aliens came to Earth not
  out of mere curiosity but because some biological flaw made them dependent on substances, including blood, that could
  be obtained from human and animal bodies. According to Cooper, they might have evolved from plants, because they use
  chlorophyll to convert food into energy and excrete waste products through the skin. How this mechanism related to the
  need for human and animal blood was not explained <span
      class="source">Howe, <em>An Alien Harvest, </em>pp. 187―188.</span>.</p>
<p>In early 1989, <a href="/people/c/CooperWilliamMilton/index.html">Cooper</a> issued a revised version of this
  document. It has since been frequently posted on the Internet. Not all versions, however, are identical. As is often
  the case with Internet documents, there is no way to determine definitively if changes have been made since the date
  the document bears <span
      class="source">There are some discrepancies in dates for Cooper material between Hamilton, <em>Alien Magic, </em>and Howe, <em>An Alien Harvest, </em>pp. 290―291.</span>.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these difficulties, the later Cooper document is interesting in its own right. In the first place,
  Cooper attributed the differences between this and the earlier version to his having undergone "hypnotic regression in
  order to make the information as accurate as possible." He did not indicate who performed the hypnosis, when, or under
  what conditions. The second version also contains a much-elaborated description of the <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs/MJ-12.html">MJ-12</a> group itself. It allegedly consists of the
  twelve senior members of a thirty-two-member secret society called the Jason Society, which was "commissioned" by
  President Eisenhower to "find the truth of the alien question" <span class="source">Howe, <em>An Alien Harvest, </em>pp. 292―294.</span>.
</p>
<p>Identifying a complete and accurate text of the second Cooper document is difficult. Howe's published version
  contains elisions. An Internet version is considerably longer and places material in a somewhat different order. It is
  also more overtly political, with references to the Kennedy assassination, the Rockefeller family, black helicopters,
  and the trilateral insignia; and it charges that the activities described violate the Constitution, as well as "the
  human rights of every citizen of the world." This longer text may well have been written as early as the printed one
  (i.e., January 10, 1989), but the technology of the Internet makes the date impossible to verify <span class="source">Cooper, "The Cooper Document."</span>.
</p>
<p>Cooper's claims in the second document regarding abductee implants and concentration camps were equally sweeping. One
  in every forty Americans has allegedly been implanted, which would amount to several million individuals. The
  concentration camps are part of a plan in which, under the pretext of a terrorist nuclear threat, martial law would be
  declared and the media nationalized <span class="source">Howe, <em>An Alien Harvest, </em>pp. 297―298.</span>.</p>
<p>Cooper's next text, dated May 23, 1989, was an Internet document made public at a UFO symposium in Las Vegas on July
  2 of that year. It subsequently formed part of a chapter in <em>Behold a Pale Horse. </em>Here, too, the political
  element was conspicuously present: the <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/index.html">CIA</a> was created to deal with the alien
  threat, Secretary of Defense Forrestal was an abductee, and the presidents were kept in ignorance <span
      class="source">Cooper, <em>Behold a Pale Horse, </em>p. 198.</span>.</p>
<p>Up to this point, Cooper had suggested little in the way of political action beyond recommending that Congress be
  informed. Sometime in 1989, however, he associated himself with an anonymous document labeled "Petition to Indict." In
  his undated accompanying letter, Cooper spoke of "Many other signatures . . . on the original copy," presumably in
  addition to his own. He begged Congress to act on the petition, but "not to trust any other government agency with
  these matters because this conspiracy runs deep within the government" <span class="source">Letter from Milton William Cooper, published in Hamilton, <em>Alien Magic, </em>unpaginated section.</span>.
</p>
<p>The "Petition to Indict," which runs somewhat more than four typed pages, appears in some places to be addressed
  simply to "the government," at others more specifically to Congress. It charges that "the government" entered into "a
  secret treaty with an Alien Nation" in violation of the Constitution. In addition to repeating many of the points
  already made by Lear and Cooper, it charges that the resources to fund secret, alien-related projects came from <a
      href="/org/us/ic/cia/index.html">CIA</a> involvement in the international drug trade <span class="source">"Petition to Indict," published in Hamilton, <em>Alien Magic,</em> unpaginated section.</span>.
</p>
<p>The petition is also significant for its lengthy references to the involvement of then-president George H.W. Bush.
  Calling Bush "the most powerful and dangerous criminal in the history of the world," the petition charges that Bush's
  involvement in the international drug trade went back to his days in the oil business and continued throughout his
  tenure as <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/index.html">CIA</a> director. Bush's associations with Skull and Bones and the
  Trilateral Commission have made him a favorite target of conspiracy theorists <span class="source">Ibid.</span>.</p>
<p>Because the petition asks full disclosure of government plots by May 30, 1989, it can reasonably be dated to early
  that year, that is to say, roughly contemporaneous with the revised version of the Cooper document. The petition is
  vague about what might happen if no government action is taken on its charges. But it warns that failure to act will
  make every member of the House and Senate "accessories to the conspiracy and the crimes outlined in this document,"
  and the signatories "swear on the Constitution" to bring "all guilty parties . . . to justice." How they might do this
  is not specified <span class="source">Ibid.</span>.</p>
<p>The "Petition to Indict" bears some similarities to the "Constructive Notices" sent in <a
    href="../../../../../../1/9/8/6/index.html">1986</a> to a judge and to Internal Revenue Service personnel in Nevada.
  The "Constructive Notices" were purported indictments issued by the Committee of the States, an entity created by
  Christian Identity preacher and tax protestor William Potter Gale. The "Constructive Notices" threatened the lives of
  the recipients, and in October 1987, Gale and his associates were tried and convicted of interfering in the
  administration of the tax laws. In retrospect, it can be seen that the Committee of the States affair anticipated such
  developments as so-called common-law courts among antigovernment groups in the 1990s. There is no direct evidence that
  Cooper or the anonymous drafter or drafters of the "Petition to Indict" were familiar with Gale's activities.
  Nonetheless, like the Committee of the States and many subsequent examples of right-wing shadow legal institutions,
  the petition implies the authority to bring malefactors to justice if formal legal institutions do not <span

</p>
<p>By the late 1990s, Cooper had moved away from the ufology community, where he had first appeared a decade earlier, to
  the subculture of militias and other antigovernment groups. His Web site circulated conspiracist versions of the
  Oklahoma City bombing, and he spoke in the name of a shadowy organization called the Second Continental Army of the
  Republic (Militia), about which little is known. As Gale had, Cooper also took on the Internal Revenue Service <span
      class="source">Milton William Cooper, "The Plot Thickens,"  https://harvest-trust.org/plot.htm (June 30, 1998). Idem, "<a

</p>
<p>Cooper became convinced that he had been targeted by "The Illuminati Socialist President of the United States of
  America, William Jefferson Clinton" as well as "by the bogus and unconstitutional Internal Revenue Service." His
  conflict with the latter resulted in an arrest warrant issued in July 1998. As of fall 2000, it still had not been
  executed, which resulted in Cooper's being named a "major fugitive" by the U.S. Marshals Service. The government's
  reluctance to arrest Cooper was apparently a reflection of his conflict-laden rhetoric: "We are formed as the
  Constitutional and Lawful unorganized Militia of the State of Arizona and the united [<em>sic</em>] States of America.

  as a result of an incident unrelated to his tax problems. This bizarre conclusion to a strange life is described more
  fully in chapter 10 <span class="source">For Cooper's quotation, see "<a

<p>Cooper was not the only figure in the UFO subculture who was elaborating politically charged conspiracy theories by
  the end of the 1980s. The year 1989 marked the beginning of the activities of John Grace, also known as Val Germann
  and Val (or Valdamar) Valerian. Grace was an air force enlisted man stationed at Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas,
  where he apparently came into contact with Lear. About 1988, Grace-Valerian founded the Nevada Aerial Research Group
  in Las Vegas, but soon relocated it to Yelm, Washington, under the name Leading Edge Research Group. He has been an
  extraordinarily prolific writer and publisher, claiming to have issued tens of thousands of pages. His central works
  are the massive, ongoing series of <em>Matrix</em> volumes, of which at least six have appeared, and the serial
  publication <em>The Leading Edge</em> <span class="source">"<a href="https://www.ufomind.com/people/g/grace">Unofficial Link Page for John Grace</a>", (September 16, 1998). "Animal  Mutilations and UFOs," p. 34. Valdamar Valerian, <em>Matrix II: The Abduction and Manipulation of Humans Using Advanced Technology, </em>3d ed. (Yelm, Wash.: Leading Edge Research Group, 1990―1991). Idem, <em>Matrix III: The Psycho-Social, Chemical, Biological and Electromagnetic Manipulation of Human Consciousness</em> (Yelm, Wash.: Leading Edge Research Group, 1992).</span>.

<p>It is impossible to summarize Valerian's system. Indeed, it may well be one of the most complex superconspiracy
  theories ever constructed. Scarcely any major organization or institution escapes inclusion. One diagrammatic
  representation requires six pages to lay out the connections among elements of the plot, including the Gestapo, the
  Mafia, and the Wobblies (IWW). Valerian ranges not only across the usual UFO and conspiracist terrain but across
  politics, religion, science, and history. He clearly regards his system not merely as an explanation of flying saucers
  or contemporary politics but as a synoptic vision of all knowledge <span
      class="source">Valerian, <em>Matrix III, </em>vol. 1, pp. 632―637.</span>.</p>
<p>Cooper edged gradually toward more ambitious conspiratorial schemes, but even at his most sweeping he never sought to
  cover areas such as the sciences (about which, in fact, he claimed ignorance). Valerian, by contrast, takes
  conspiracism to its logical conclusion by suggesting that all true knowledge has been deliberately hidden, and that
  attempts to reveal it in one area will inevitably reveal the entire structure, if only one digs widely and deeply
  enough. Anything that is available and obvious is false, while what is hidden has to be true; its hiddenness can have
  occurred only because those who truly know do not wish it to be revealed. As Valerian puts it, "As a result of the
  suppression and compartmentalization of information, cultures have been fragmented into several distinct groups and
  mind sets which both co-exist and oppose each other." He clearly believes that he has discovered the suppressed
  synthesis <span class="source">Valerian, <em>Matrix II, </em>p. v.</span>.</p>
<p>Leading Edge's location, Yelm, Washington, is also the home of J.Z. Knight, a channeler who claims to be the medium
  transmitting the words of a 35,000-year-old warrior named Ramtha. The Ramtha School of Enlightenment in Yelm was
  founded in 1988 or 1989, about the time Valerian arrived. There appear to be no direct links between Valerian's
  organization and Knight's, but they do share common themes. Ramtha asserts that the UFOs carry aliens who are "your
  higher brothers." Valerian, like Knight, employs the <em>entity</em> terminology standard in channeling circles, and
  he includes favorable material about Ramtha in the <em>Matrix</em> volumes. There are some differences: for instance,
  like many conspiracy-minded ufologists, Valerian believes that there are many alien races, some of which are
  malevolent. For their part, Knight and Ramtha identify evil with a conspiracy of international bankers who include the
  Rothschilds and the Federal Reserve. The Ramtha School's book service sells works by <a
      href="/people/c/CooperWilliamMilton/index.html">Cooper</a>, <a href="/people/i/IckeDavid/index.html">David
    Icke</a>, and Jim Keith, and the Ramtha newsletter has published lengthy interviews with Mark Phillips and Cathy
  O'Brien, with their tales of CIA mind-controlled sex slaves. Notwithstanding the lack of formal connections, Valerian
  and Knight clearly seem to tap into the same cultic milieu <span class="source">J.

<p>A partir du début des années 1990s, par conséquent, au moins une partie de la littérature ufologique est passée par
  plusieurs transformations. Elle est devenue intensément politisée. Elle insista sur le fait que des éléments puissants
  au gouvernement U.S. étaient en collaboration continue avec une race extraterrestre maléfique. Et elle prétendait que
  pour protéger cette information, le gouvernement secret était préparé à détruire les libertés américaines. De <a
      href="../../../../../../1/9/8/6/index.html">1986</a> jusqu'à <a
      href="../../../../../../1/9/9/0/index.html">1990</a> à peu près, les activités de <a

<p>Much of this material was either strikingly similar to or compatible with the conspiracy ideas simultaneously
  circulating in the militia and militant antigovernment subculture. The mythology of concentration camps, secret
  government security forces, wholesale violation of the Constitution, and control of the state by a hidden elite are
  themes prominent in both domains. Yet any link between them in the 1980s appears circumstantial. The UFO conspiracists
  were especially active in the West, where the extreme right was particularly evident; even so, no evidence exists at
  this time of direct contact between them. But convergent ideas are bound to meet, and as the next chapter shows, this
  occurred in the early 1990s.</p>
