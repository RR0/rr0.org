<p class="abstract">Since <time>1965</time> I have been culling systematically from the literature of science those
  observations that challenge reigning paradigms. The tangible result of the thousands of hours spent in libraries has
  been a series of Sourcebooks, Handbooks, and Catalogs that, at present, describe and evaluate roughly 2,000
  anomalies—about one-half of my total collection. Some of these anomalies are truly profound and have important
  implications for science, such as the quantization of astronomical redshifts; others are less significant, as is the
  recent discovery of that curious little door in one of the Great Pyramid’s "air-shafts." Overall, this immense
  accumulation of anomalies will hopefully encourage new research projects, some paradigm shifting, perhaps even the
  emergence of yet-undreamed-of hypotheses that will better describe nature. This historical essay begins in 1951 with
  my astonishment at my unexpected discovery that important scientific anomalies not only exist but also are pervasive
  and abundant in the professional journals. The essay continues with the translation of these two epiphanies into the
  Sourcebook Project and the 36 books on anomalies that it has published so far. This is largely a personal story and is
  therefore told in the first person. I believe this saga, conducted mostly in libraries, will be relevant to anyone who
  has also perceived some of the multitudinous cracks, big and small, so obvious in the foundation of the Temple of
  Science. </p>
<p>Keywords: anomalies — Sourcebook Project </p>
<h2>The Pivotal Role of Serendipity</h2>
<p>The Sourcebook Project really germinated in 1951 in an unexpected manner. To begin my search for anomalies, I first
  had to learn that they existed— a reality not broached in the usual college science curriculum. I came across
  anomalies by accident. </p>
<p>In 1951 I was working on the 184-inch cyclotron at the Radiation Laboratory of the University of California. On a day
  off, I happened to pick up for $2.00 in one of Berkeley’s bookstores a used copy of George McCready Price’s 1926 book,
  Evolutionary Geology and the New Catastrophism. That the word ‘‘catastrophism’’ would appear in the title of any
  geology book was shocking in those days, for uniformitarianism was dominant in the earth sciences. I do not recall my
  geology professor ever mentioning "catastrophism"! Even more surprising were Price’s field observations that
  challenged what I thought were well-established truisms. To illustrate, Price pointed out many places on the planet
  where older rocks are superimposed upon younger rocks; for example, at Chief Mountain in Montana. There, an entire
  mountain of older rock rests upon much younger sediments. Price’s book contained many more geological anomalies, some
  of which are now explained but many more that are not. So it was George McCready Price, who would today be called a
  creationist, who first made me aware that anomalies exist, at least in the field of geology. </p>
<p>My second unanticipated discovery made me realize that anomalies were common in all branches of science. This
  happened in 1953 in the library at the University of Colorado when I was trying to find out what was known about the
  solar spectrum in the far ultraviolet. (The Physics Department had spectrograms of the sun taken at high altitudes
  during flights of captured V-2 German rockets.) Right next to a book I desired was Charles Fort’s The Book of the
  Damned. Naturally, I had to take out that book, too. It turned out to be chock full of anomalies of all sorts, all of
  which Fort had extracted from major science journals prior to 1930. Fort designated these anomalies as ‘‘damned’’
  because they were generally ignored by mainstream science. Fort’s book concentrated on astronomy and geophysics. I was
  particularly intrigued by the examples of those strange explosive sounds heard in coastal regions around the world.
  The Barisal Guns in the Ganges Delta are perhaps the most famous. Around the coast of the North Sea, they are called
  ‘‘mistpouffers’’ or ‘‘fog guns.’’ It was all certainly very fascinating, but I had to finish my education and start
  making some money for my family. Nevertheless, I now knew that scientific anomalies not only existed but were also
  spread throughout all of science. </p>
<p>Serendipity struck again a decade later. By 1963 I had become disenchanted with industry and had started a career in
  freelance writing. (My wife said she would give me five years to make a go out of it.) Fortunately, I had a head
  start. I had already written a book on space propulsion, based on a course I taught at General Electric in Cincinnati,
  which had been published by McGraw-Hill (Corliss, 1960). This helped me get writing contracts with the National
  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), and the National Science Foundation
  (NSF). These efforts took me frequently to Baltimore’s Enoch Pratt Free Library. These visits gave me the opportunity
  to verify some of the anomalies I had read about in Fort’s The Book of the Damned, especially those curious
  mistpouffers! As I leafed through the pages of Nature circa 1898–1900, I found that Fort’s research had been accurate
  but rather narrow. He had missed a lot of anomalies. Fort, it seems, was not particularly interested in archeology,
  geology, or biology. He had not even picked up on all those intriguing British stone circles, which were a favorite
  subject of Norman Lockyer, the editor of Nature around the turn of the century. </p>
<p>Thus, it was once more made obvious to me that anomalies were ubiquitous and present in greater numbers than I had
  dreamed. Fort had been selective and had explored only part of the science literature and then only up to about 1930.
  There was a whole universe of anomalies waiting for me in the dusty stacks of Baltimore’s main library and the easily
  accessible Library of Congress. </p>
<p>At this point in the history of the Sourcebook Project (which hadn’t even been christened yet), there was no thought
  of making a business out of anomalies. I first had to satisfy NASA, AEC, and NSF. Between 1963 and 1981, I wrote
  thirteen books for NASA on space flight (for three examples, see Corliss, 1965, 1967, 1972), a dozen educational
  booklets for AEC, and the same number of articles for Mosaic, a now-discontinued, bimonthly magazine published by NSF.
  There were also several books written for New York publishers, including one I coauthored with Glenn Seaborg (Seaborg,
  1971). </p>
<p>A point to be made here is that a freelancer usually has extra time now and then to turn to other projects of
  interest; in my case, anomalies. And in the back of my mind, as you would expect in a writer, was the possibility of a
  book on anomalies. Something like The Book of the Damned, but updated and wider in scope. Because this book or,
  possibly a series of books, would be ferreting out and organizing anomalies from a wide spectrum of sources, I decided
  to name the venture The Sourcebook Project.</p>
<h2> Curiosity-Indulgence and Profitability</h2>
<p>In 1965, the major goal of the nascent Sourcebook Project was to satisfy personal curiosity. Such indulgence costs
  little, but to probe the unknown deeply and widely and then publish the anomalies uncovered requires more than casual
  interest. Organization, infrastructure, and funding are required. The present Sourcebook Project—still only a
  one-person endeavor—took 20 years (until 1985) to coalesce into a self-supporting enterprise. The profitability motive
  that was and still is absolutely essential to Project viability has necessarily produced an operating philosophy that
  differs somewhat from most other inquiries into the nature of the cosmos. I had and still have no institutional
  funding or infrastructure. This disconnect from most mainstream science efforts can be seen in the following three
  objectives that guide Sourcebook Project activities.</p>
<ol>
  <li> The primary objective of the Project has always been that of satisfying the curiosity of the author. This
    proclivity stimulated the search for anomalies and has sustained it for almost four decades. This innate curiosity
    has been vital because the financial rewards would have been much greater in my first career in engineering
    management. </li>
  <li>Secondly, the Sourcebook Project must be self-supporting financially and develop its own infrastructure. As in any
    business, viability is one of the primary goals. This commercial focus had to exist because government, foundation,
    and private support have never been deemed likely. This premise has proven correct over the last four decades.</li>
  <li>The third objective is the only overtly altruistic one. That is the potential value to science of the information
    acquired through the thousands of hours in libraries and its consolidation into accessible form both in books and
    CD-ROMs. </li>
</ol>
<h2>The Search and Collection</h2>
<p>Beginning in the mid-1960s, every time I visited a library, I spent an hour or two combing through old volumes of
  science journals. The obvious place to begin was with the major, general-science journals Nature and Science. Every
  one of the hundreds of volumes of each of these two journals was scrutinized for anomalies. I moved next to American
  Scientist and science magazines such as New Scientist and Scientific American. There were also the major specialized
  journals to attend to: Geology, Monthly Weather Review, Icarus, American Journal of Psychiatry, Antiquity, etc. Over
  the years, some 15,000 volumes of major science publications have been examined. </p>
<p>The identification and collection of anomalies was (and still is) a rather tedious task. The reward is that every
  trip to a library adds new anomalies to the burgeoning collection. It is a bit like fishing; boring most of the time
  until the big one bites! Obviously, I did not read every word of every article. Title pages were helpful. My eyes were
  peeled for key words like "enigma," "mysterious," "puzzling," "unsolved," "singular," and so on. The word "anomaly"
  was rarely used in the 1960–1990 time period in its present sense. Without question, I have missed many anomalies in
  my surveys. Some of these were discovered later when reference lists and relevant books were analyzed. Reviewers have
  pointed out others. </p>
<p><em>Nature</em> has been far and away the most useful general source. Its productivity, though, has changed with its
  editors. The <em>American Journal of Science</em>, founded in 1820, was a gold mine of anomalies of all sorts in the
  beginning. Now, 400 volumes later, it publishes mostly long, highly technical articles on geology and rarely provides
  me with new material. Science, too, has been variably useful. To illustrate: In its infancy, Science did not avoid <a
      href="/science/para/index.html">parapsychology</a> because its editor at the time, Simon Newcomb, like many
  prominent scientists in the late 1800s, did not discount psychic phenomenon. </p>
<p>Bit by bit my anomaly collection grew. Unlike <a href="/people/f/FortCharles/index.html">Fort</a>, who had to jot
  down telegraphic (often unreadable) notes about phenomena, I had access to photocopiers. Today, my files bulge with
  perhaps 50,000 articles, letters, and brevia dealing with anomalies. I now estimate my collection holds about 4,000
  distinct anomalies. This number could easily be increased simply by spending more time in libraries and tackling the
  thousands of unscanned journals. </p>
<p>To appreciate what I have been extracting from the science literature, see the Appendix for a selection of about 100
  anomalies from my files. Then multiply by 40! </p>
<p>By 1972 I had enough material on hand to think about publishing some of it. I knew that no commercial publisher would
  sign on to a series of perhaps two dozen books. Just as certainly, no government agency or foundation would want to
  commit to such a long-term, controversial project. (While I was doing contract writing for NSF, discreet inquiries had
  validated this conclusion.) My decision was to self-publish my collection of anomalies and try to make it a profitable
  enterprise to boot. </p>
<p>The Sourcebook Project has evolved in three phases, although the last two phases were not in the original plan.</p>
<h2> Phase I. The Sourcebooks</h2>
<p>In 1974, as an experiment, I began self-publishing a series of 10 loose-leaf notebooks called ‘‘Sourcebooks.’’ The
  name was apt because they contained direct quotations from the older science journals with minimum interpretation and
  commentary. The first two volumes, entitled <em>Strange Phenomena I </em>and <em>II</em>, typify the set. They
  collected and categorized many of the geophysical anomalies I had gleaned from the literature. I engaged John C.
  Holden, a well-known science illustrator, to provide drawings for some of the phenomena. I continued the series with
  two volumes on archeology (<em>Strange Artifacts I</em> and <em>Strange Artifacts II</em>). Between <a
      href="../../../../../1/9/7/5/index.html">1975</a> and <a href="../../../../../1/9/7/8/index.html">1978</a>,
  Sourcebooks in the fields of geology, astronomy, biology and psychology came off the press. Even though the
  Sourcebooks are now some 20 years old, a few orders for them still trickle in. About 30,000 copies have been sold down
  the years.</p>
<p>Of course, orders for the Sourcebooks did not sell without some advertising effort. I used commercially available
  mailing lists and a few half-page display ads in <em>Science</em>, <em>Nature</em>, <em>Science News</em>, and a small
  handful of other science journals and magazines. Interestingly, the most productive ad appeared in <em>Sky &amp;
    Telescope</em>. Individual books in the series were reviewed in <em>Nature</em>, <em>American Scientist</em>, and
  several other publications, including (to my astonishment) the <em>Village Voice</em>. These reviews obviously helped
  sales.</p>
<p>The Sourcebooks differ markedly from the books of <a href="/people/f/FortCharles/index.html">Charles Fort</a> (<em>The
  Book of the Damned</em> was the first of a series of four). The material in the Sourcebooks is organized by subject
  and dispenses with the many brickbats tossed at science-in-general by <a
      href="/people/f/FortCharles/index.html">Fort</a>. The Sourcebooks are not confrontational but rather
  matter-of-fact quotations from the journals with minimum commentary. </p>
<p>Phase I of the Sourcebook Project was financially successful, but not enough so as to sustain my family and put four
  children through college. In the <a href="../../../../../1/9/7/index.html">1970s</a>, I continued to write, mainly for
  <a href="/org/us/nasa/index.html">NASA</a>, under contract. The resulting books were published by the U.S. Government
  Printing Office and, in a few cases, by commercial publishers under contract to <a
      href="/org/us/nasa/index.html">NASA</a>. One, entitled <em>Teleoperators and Human Augmentation</em>, was
  republished commercially. The last book I wrote for <a href="/org/us/nasa/index.html">NASA</a> was published in <a
      href="../../../../../1/9/8/1/index.html">1981</a>, bearing the title: <em>Wind Tunnels of NASA</em>. </p>
<p>The Sourcebooks, it turned out, had a unacceptable deficiency from the viewpoint of many libraries. They were
  ring-bound, and the pages could be and were removed by library clients. I could have gone on generating dozens of
  additional Sourcebooks, but to satisfy the library market, a new strategy was required. </p>
<h2>Phase II. The Handbooks</h2>
<p>Basically, the Sourcebooks were converted into hardcover books, but with more commentary, newer material, and many
  additional illustrations. The first Handbook, Handbook of Unusual Natural Phenomena, was self-published in <a
      href="../../../../../1/9/7/7/index.html">1977</a>. The response was very encouraging with more good reviews in key
  science and library journals. In fact, the book caught on so well that Doubleday asked me to write a popularized
  version for them. This version appeared first as a quality paperback in <a href="../../../../../1/9/8/3/index.html">1983</a>.
  It was later republished in hardcover form by two other publishers. Approximately 100,000 copies were sold altogether.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the other five books in the Handbook series were being self-published. The second in the series,
  Ancient Man, has been reprinted several times and is still one of the Project’s best-sellers. The final Handbook, <em>Unfathomed
    Mind</em>, came out in <a href="../../../../../1/9/8/2/index.html">1982</a>. It is now out of print.</p>
<p>Like the Sourcebooks, the Handbooks were marginally rewarding financially, and they were still fundamentally only
  reproductions of anomaly descriptions derived from the science literature. Background and significance were usually
  lacking. Furthermore, new anomalies were being added to the files at such a rapid rate that a new format was needed to
  accommodate this influx. More importantly, something had to be added to the books that indicated the potential impact
  of each anomaly and the quantity and quality of the observations that supported it.</p>
<h2> Phase III. The Catalog Series</h2>
<p>The ‘‘Catalog’’ concept goes far beyond the simple republication of the anomalous observations that characterize the
  Sourcebooks and the Handbooks. In the Catalogs, anomalies are singled out, closely defined, and then evaluated in
  terms of the quality of supporting data and how challenging they are to mainstream paradigms. Quotations from the
  original sources are still employed but they are shorter. More space is devoted to the background of the phenomena. I
  include examples of the anomalies and many references to aid future researchers. </p>
<p>The catalog volumes are more focussed than the Handbooks. For example, the four geophysics Catalogs are specialized
  as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Luminous phenomena </li>
  <li>Weather phenomena </li>
  <li>Atmospheric-optics phenomena </li>
  <li>"Oscillatory" phenomena (i.e., waves, tides, sound, earthquakes, etc.) </li>
</ul>
<p>The four Catalog volumes in geophysics were published by the Sourcebook Project between 1982 and 1984. (All
  Sourcebook Project publications in print are listed on <a href="https://www.science-frontiers.com">my web site</a>)
</p>
<p>The Catalog concept advanced with three volumes on astronomy between 1985 and 1987. Geology came next, then biology
  and archeology. Roughly one Catalog volume has been published each year. As of 2002, there are 20 catalog volumes on
  the shelf. The task, however, is far from over. I contemplate six more volumes in archeology and three in psychology.
  Some time, I hope to return to biology, where the six extant volumes deal only with humans, the other mammals, and
  birds. I have immense, unused files on reptiles, fish, the arthropoda, plants, invertebrates, microorganisms,
  genetics, etc. Once I had hoped to complete the Catalog series in 25 volumes. Now, a total of 35 seems probable. The
  universe of anomalies has turned out to be expanding like the cosmos itself. </p>
<p>On the economic front, the Catalogs have kept the Sourcebook Project solvent. Reviews have generally been very
  favorable. To maintain sales volume, I have relied mostly upon word-of-mouth and a mailing list developed over 35
  years. My bimonthly mailings feature my newsletter, Science Frontiers, plus advertisements for related books by other
  publishers. Display ads and commercial mailing lists are now too expensive to employ. Happily, the Internet has come
  along and my web site has made up for the abandoned display ads and mailing lists. </p>
<p>So much for the business aspects of the Sourcebook Project. Book marketing has made the Project viable and kept it
  free from the vicissitudes of commercial publishers and the dictates of institutions. </p>
<h2>Sourcebook Project Interfaces</h2>
<p>The Sourcebook Project has never solicited members, just customers. It is strictly a business without narrow
  philosophical or political goals. Over the years, though, some interesting interfaces with other organizations have
  developed.</p>
<h3> Fortean groups</h3>
<p>Relations have always been amicable with the International Fortean Organization (INFO), the Society for the
  Investigation of the Unexplained (SITU, publisher of Pursuit), and the UK’s <em>Fortean Times</em>. Although <a
      href="/people/f/FortCharles/index.html">Fort</a>'s methodology has been valuable in developing the Sourcebook
  Project, I have tried to avoid the Fortean tendency to ridicule established science. Such bizarre and improbable
  Fortean phenomena as pyramidology and psychic archeology have generally been avoided. Indeed, the Project has been
  criticized as not being sufficiently Fortean; that is, not bizarre enough. This is quite true and can be explained by
  my almost total dependence upon mainstream science literature for source material. Newspapers are rarely used, the
  Internet is avoided totally. I very rarely use fringe magazines and the personal accounts that frequently turn up in
  the mail. </p>
<p>As a result, perhaps, there are only a few dedicated Forteans on my customer list. Velikovskians, too, tend to ignore
  my self-published books, as do the cryptozoologists, ufologists, and those into psychic phenomena. However, the
  Sourcebook Project also carries roughly 100 books from other publishers. These cover topics usually excluded from my
  Catalogs, such as Atlantis, intelligent design, the yeti, and even magic squares and humor. </p>
<h3>Creationists</h3>
<p>An interesting, informal, reciprocal interface prevails between the Sourcebook Project and the various creationist
  groups. The Catalogs and Handbooks, for example, contain much of interest to creationists in the fields of biology and
  geology. This occurs because I have amassed reports of phenomena that apparently challenge neo-Darwinism. Flowing in
  the other direction are observations that creationists have discovered in journals that I do not have the time to
  monitor. In addition, some individual creationists are particularly adept at finding flaws in widely accepted science
  paradigms, such as the continuity and integrity of the geological column and the utility of so-called vestigial
  organs.</p>
<p>In this context, I emphasize that the Sourcebook Project intends to be value-free. Let the facts fall where they
  may! This Fortean skepticism about the value of theories-in-general doubtless annoys both creationists and their
  opponents. Theories are ephemeral, but facts live forever. </p>
<h3>The Skeptics</h3>
<p>One would expect a lively interface between the Sourcebook Project and the several groups of skeptics, as typified by
  the <a href="/org/us/asso/csicop/index.html">Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP)</a>.
  After all, my Catalogs do challenge those paradigms the skeptics defend so ferociously. Actually, there has been no
  traffic whatsoever in either direction. While mainstream Nature has reviewed five of my books, the skeptics have shown
  no interest in evaluating any of the Sourcebook publications. The skeptics, it seems, are never skeptical of
  established paradigms, only those observations that threaten to disestablish them. </p>
<h3>The Media</h3>
<p>The results of contacts with talk radio, TV programs, and newspapers have been disappointing. Since 1990 I have
  rejected all invitations for interviews and media events. The major factors in keeping the media at arm’s length are
  their tendency to distort facts and not allow my review before publication or airing. Invitations from major
  publishers to write books on anomalies are now routinely turned down but usually for a different reason: It is more
  profitable and satisfying to self-publish and be able to control the format, content, and market-longevity of my
  books. </p>
<h3>Mainstream Science</h3>
<p>Early on, I hoped that experts in various disciplines would be interested in providing information or at least
  comments on drafts of material before publication. This interface was never established. Of course, a scientist’s time
  is valuable and I cannot be considered a "colleague"! The Sourcebook Project is hardly part of the scientific
  community. There have been a few individual exceptions, but the reaction of mainstream science has been mainly via
  book reviews (generally favorable) and occasional references to my books in the journals. Some scientists do purchase
  books from the Project, including even some Nobelists. Generally speaking, though, mainstream scientists are not good
  customers, despite the good reviews and several selections by book clubs.</p>
<h2> Some General Observations</h2>
<p>Who, then, does buy enough books to keep the Sourcebook Project in the black? Tests with ads and mailing lists
  indicate that it is not the Forteans, the creationists, the UFO crowd, the cryptozoologists, the parapsychologists,
  the Velikovskians, subscribers to Fate, or mainstream scientists. In fact, as Henry Bauer indicated in a recent <em>JSE</em>
  editorial (Bauer, 2001), it is not members of the SSE either. My theory is that each of the groups mentioned contains
  only a few "general-anomalists"; that is, individuals whose interests are much broader than those of the group
  they are associated with. The Sourcebook Project has tapped this dispersed population and is thus able to survive.
</p>
<p>It may be of interest to SSE members that only about 2% of them are on my mailing list, which length-wise is somewhat
  larger than the SSE membership list. This surprisingly small figure is also typical of members of Fortean groups, in
  fact, of all the speciality groups mentioned in the previous paragraph. </p>
<p>Despite its charter, I believe the SSE is composed mainly of several small groups of specialists, with only a few
  generalists. That this may be so can be seen by comparing the subject matter in the Tables of Contents of several
  issues of the <em>JSE</em> with the topics listed in the Appendix. I see a wide disconnect between the two lists of
  topics. But it may be that those submitting articles to the <em>JSE</em> are not typical of the membership-as-a-whole.
  I don’t know. </p>
<p>Many of my customers also come from the general population of people with scientific training and interest, but who
  are not in academia or members of the speciality groups mentioned above. Medical doctors and engineers are perhaps the
  most prominent in this regard. </p>
<p>Over the years, the archeology books offered by the Sourcebook Project have sold the best; those on parapsychology,
  the worst. In contrast, articles with a slant toward parapsychology are frequent in the JSE while archeology articles
  are nearly nonexistent.</p>
<p>I have also noticed that scientists who specialize (and most do) will readily admit that anomalies exist in their
  fields of endeavor. In fact, they sometimes take pains to point out anomalies that I somehow missed in my literature
  research. However, these same scientists are often reluctant to admit that all other branches of science also exhibit
  anomalies. A scientist who admits the possibility that Nessie lives will not doubt the reality of the expanding
  universe. A scientist favorable to UFOs will not question neo-Darwinism. </p>
<p>Scientists, like everyone else, prefer a broad, stable frame of reference, one without too many unknowns and
  uncertainties. But the Sourcebook Project claims that thousands of anomalies pervade all fields of knowledge. This
  assertion may be a little too unsettling to many. </p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The long hours spent in the dusty library stacks have proven intellectually rewarding to me. I intentionally avoid
  theorizing about what I have found over the past 40 years, for that would taint the objectivity of my continuing
  search. I claim only that there are a lot of anomalies out there, and that there are many more that I have not yet
  added to my collection. Every week the science journals bring new mysteries into my ken. I collect them like a
  philatelist does stamps. For every anomaly I have to remove from my album as having been explained, two new ones
  arrive to take its place with the next delivery of mail. Anomaly-collecting is obviously not science, for it
  assiduously eschews theories and the testing of theories. As I see it, the value of the Sourcebook Project to science
  is in its long lists of potential research areas. These lists demonstrate that science is far from complete. The
  Handbooks and Catalogs have the potential to stimulate the progress of science—and that is good. The more anomalies
  that are recognized, researched, and explained, the more accurate is our picture of the universe. </p>
<h2>Appendix: A Few Selected Anomalies</h2>
<h3>ARCHEOLOGY</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The "pit bands" of the Andes. The pits are about a meter deep and arranged regularly in bands about 24 meters
    wide. The bands run along the ridges for miles. </li>
  <li>The stone meanders and labyrinths of the western U.S. </li>
  <li>Boulders with triangular holes. Called "Viking mooring stones," there are hundreds in northeastern U.S. </li>
  <li>Hundreds of large precision-crafted stone spheres in Costa Rica. These are near-perfect spheres made of hard
    granite! </li>
  <li>The East Bay and Point Reyes walls, California. Builders and purpose unknown. </li>
  <li>Incan stone masonry. Interlocking, precision-fitted, multi-ton stones, some with many corners. </li>
  <li>Ancient Baalbek’s massive, dressed Monolith, in Lebanon. (Weight: 1,100 tons) </li>
  <li>The enigmatic stone blocks at Tiahuanaco (Bolivia) and at least one Inca site. These are huge, geometrically
    complex, fashioned out of hard rock, and seem to have no discernable purpose. </li>
  <li>Scotland’s ancient vitrified stone forts. (How did they melt granite?) </li>
  <li>Enigmatic structures within the Great Pyramid. Examples: so-called air passage with secret door, sand-filled
    cavities, layered granite beams in King’s Chamber, the mysterious sliding plugs, and several more really perplexing
    structures. </li>
  <li>Ancient skeletons in North America with Caucasoid features, such as Kennewick Man, and others less-famous. </li>
  <li>Trans-oceanic, pre-Columbian diffusion of plants and their products. Examples: maize to India, cocaine to Egyptian
    pharaohs, cotton, pineapples, and many more. </li>
  <li>The Nazca lines, Santa Valley geoglyphs, and the huge Candelabra of the Andes—the latter visible from far out at
    sea! </li>
  <li>Near-global existence of the cup-and-ring motif in old petroglyphs. </li>
  <li>The ability of the ancient Egyptians to fashion narrow-necked, hollow vases out of obdurate granite with only
    copper tools. Also relevant, the precisely made. polished, multi-ton granite slabs in the Great Pyramid. </li>
  <li>Mysterious Olmec origin. Their articles display apparent Chinese symbols and cultural characteristics. </li>
  <li>Miniature buildings at some Maya sites and miniature subterranean tunnels (i.e., much too small for normal
    humans)! </li>
  <li>The famed Baghdad battery 19. The ancient Greek analog "computer." </li>
</ol>
<h3>ASTRONOMY</h3>
<ol>

  <li>Historical record of bright objects appearing close to the sun. (Vulcan, the intramercurial planet.) </li>
  <li>Mercury’s puzzling high eccentricity, inclination, and its unexpected and offset magnetic field. </li>
  <li>Anomalous transits of Jupiter by the Galilean satellites. Double shadows thrown on Jupiter; "hot" shadows, dark
    transits. </li>
  <li>Lunar concentrations of mass (mascons), magnetism (magcons), radioactivity (radcons). </li>
  <li>Transient Lunar Phenomena (TLPs). (Flares, color changes, obscurations, etc.) </li>
  <li>Martian surface asymmetry. Half the planet is highly elevated; half, low. </li>
  <li>Magnetic stripes on Mars. </li>
  <li>Globular-cluster enigmas. (Great age, non-participation in galaxy motion, etc.) </li>
  <li>Anomalous accelerating expansion of universe. </li>
  <li>Anomalous precession of DI Herculis. (Challenges Einstein) </li>
  <li>Quantized redshifts. Puts expanding-universe paradigm at risk. </li>
  <li>Source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. </li>
  <li>Absence of antimatter in universe. Should be as common as normal matter. </li>
  <li>Anomalous rotation of galaxies implies existence of so-called "dark matter." </li>
  <li>Discordant redshifts. Some objects, seeming physically connected, have radically different redshifts. (Halton
    Arp’s heresy!) </li>
  <li>Meteorite distribution anomalies. Concentrations in Antarctica and on Australia’s Nullarbor plain. The "Iron
    Alley" in U.S., etc. </li>
  <li>Antarctic meteorites differ markedly from those picked up elsewhere. </li>
  <li>Meteors seen at altitudes so high that there should not be enough air-friction to make them visible. </li>
</ol>
<h3>BIOLOGY</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Avian feather-pattern-generation mechanisms not understood. Also applies to colorful seashells, butterflies, and
    other patterned organisms. </li>
  <li>Inherited callosities in birds, such as the Ostrich. </li>
  <li>Physiological convergence of Arctic and Antarctic birds, especially the alcids. They look alike but are not
    closely related. </li>
  <li>Brood-parasitism anomalies, as in mimicry of appearance and voice by nestlings. </li>
  <li>Unknown mechanism of inheritance of instincts. How is migratory information passed on genetically to young birds
    travelling without parents? (Example: the bronzed cuckoos of Australasia) </li>
  <li>Avian "courts" and executions. </li>
  <li>Unique, complex respiratory system of birds completely unlike any suggested ancestors. </li>
  <li>Avian homing and navigation feats. Examples: homing pigeons and Arctic Terns. </li>
  <li>Disturbed human behavior correlated with sun and moon. </li>
  <li>Human intelligence correlated with birth-order and season of birth. </li>
  <li>Anomalously large number of breaths and heartbeats per human lifetime as compared with other mammals. </li>
  <li>Rapid, quantized growth spurts in human children. </li>
  <li>Lack of biochemical value in human sleep. </li>
  <li>Human mitochondria vastly different from those in other mammals. </li>
  <li>Immortality of cancer cells. </li>
  <li>Higher cancer incidence correlated with greater organism complexity. Why? </li>
  <li>Fetal-graft enigma. Why does immune system not reject fetus? </li>
  <li>Presence of much subcutaneous fat in humans as in many marine mammals. (The aquatic-ape theory.) </li>
  <li>Experimental lack of memory traces. How is information stored in brain? </li>
  <li>Human navigation sense. Human homing experiments. </li>
  <li>Human diving reflex and, contradictorily, drowning proneness. </li>
  <li>Parasite manipulation of human behavior. (Same for other mammals, birds, etc.) </li>
  <li>Limits on the variability of domestic animals. No new species in breeding experiments. A big Darwin worry. </li>
  <li>The puzzle of flavor aversion, especially in rats. </li>
  <li>Deliberate use of medicinal plants by non-human mammals and birds. </li>
  <li>Survival of the thylacine (marsupial wolf). (Some pretty good data here.) </li>
  <li>Inheritance of the behavioral effects of rotation in rats. </li>
  <li>Plants mimicking other plants even though they lack eyes. (Example: some mistletoes.) </li>
  <li>Fishlike lures evolved and used by mussels, snapping turtles, and other species. </li>
  <li>Worldwide synchronous flowering of bamboos. </li>
  <li>Selfish DNA (or genes or viruses or proteins): the ultimate parasites. </li>
  <li>Interplant communication ("tree-talk," for example), especially via airborne chemical signals. </li>
  <li>Directed-mutation experiments </li>
  <li>Unknown cause of the Cambrian explosion of new life bauplans; (i.e.; new phyla). </li>
</ol>
<h3>GEOLOGY</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Controverted source of deep-focus earthquakes. </li>
  <li>How are concretions formed? They exist in bizarre shapes in untold numbers. </li>
  <li>The surprising existence of life at great depths in the earth’s crust; that is, in the crevicular domain. </li>
  <li>Unexplained origin of dolomite, some limestones, <a href="/science/discipline/hard/nat/mat/chim/mol/methane">methane</a>-hydrate
    deposits, and several other types of sedimentary rocks. The dolomite problem has bothered geologists for 100 years!
  </li>
  <li>Coal anomalies. (Examples: anomalous fossils, frequent absence of plant fossils and vegetable structure, coal beds
    50 feet thick and more present over wide geographical areas, and many more) </li>
  <li>Cyclothems and rhythmites. Repetitious strata, sometimes hundreds of thousands of layers. </li>
  <li>Polystrate fossils, especially vertical tree fossils penetrating millions of years (supposedly) of deposits, as at
    the Joggins formation in Canada. </li>
  <li>Oriented lakes (Alaska) and the famed Carolina bays, the latter present in hundreds of thousands—all oriented. A
    meteor storm? </li>
  <li>Cookie-cutter holes and resulting giant divots.Surprising number of these. </li>
  <li>Several examples of devastated areas, especially in Brazilian jungle, suggesting recent Tunguska-like
    impacts. </li>
  <li>The missing crater associated with the immense deposit of Australites (tektites). Given the extent and quantity of
    these tektites, there should be an immense, 700,000-year-old crater somewhere. </li>
  <li>The famous mima mounds. Present in incredible numbers. How created? Some say "pocket gophers"! </li>
  <li>Giant expansion-and-contraction polygons in soils. Hard-to-explain long- range order. </li>
  <li>"Missing" strata at Grand Canyon and associated anomalies of formation. 15. Ancient, uneroded, elevated plains.
    Why no erosion over the eons? </li>
</ol>
<h3>GEOPHYSICS</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Ball lightning in its many guises. </li>
  <li>Luminous bubbles in the atmosphere. Too many observations to dismiss offhand. </li>
  <li>Earthquake lights. Abundant observations, especially from Japan. Mechanism uncertain. </li>
  <li>Cold, ground-level flames and lights. (Will-o’-wisps) Not really explained completely. </li>
  <li>Marine light wheels. One of the great unexplained phenomena. (Hundreds of sound observations) </li>
  <li>White water or milky seas. Here, too, we have hundreds of good observations. </li>
  <li>Shadow bands during solar eclipses. Many anomalous appearances; for example, giant bands, colored bands, bands
    moving in the wrong direction. </li>
  <li>Conical hail, bizarrely shaped hail. These objects are reproduced and fall by the millions. The creative mechanism
    is unknown. </li>
  <li>Hydrometeors. Some are from aircraft but others seem to be extraterrestrial. </li>
  <li>Brontides and mistpouffers. Examples: Barisal guns, Lake Seneca guns, etc. Some are due to small <a
      href="/science/discipline/hard/nat/mat/chim/mol/methane">methane</a>-hydrate blowouts, particularly those in North
    Sea. </li>
  <li>Sound of the aurora. Sounds from high-altitude meteors. Both species are thought to be electrophonic sounds. Also,
    some people "hear" radar pulses! </li>
  <li>Rainbows with offset white arcs. They defy optical theory. </li>
  <li>Offset solar halos and anomalous arcs. Also unexplained. </li>
  <li>Sea seiches and "death waves." These are not tsunamis. </li>
  <li>Transient all-sky brightenings. Good observations. Some are probably meteoric, others are unexplained. </li>
  <li>Mountain-top glows, such as the famed Andes Lights. Often associated with seismic activity. </li>
  <li>Luminous cores of some tornados. Probably related to the electrical effects of some strong tornadoes, as in
    burning and dehydration along paths. </li>
</ol>
<h3>PSYCHOLOGY</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The break-off phenomenon experienced by pilots. </li>
  <li>Why do we need to sleep and dream? </li>
  <li>Mathematical, calendar, and musical savants. </li>
  <li>Genius correlated with mental illness! </li>
  <li>Eidetic imagery. Usually lost in adulthood, but can sometimes be restored by hypnosis. </li>
  <li>Exceptional and photographic memories </li>
  <li>Synaesthesia. Comes in many forms. Usually numbers or words and rendered in different colors. </li>
  <li>Results of reincarnation research. Many examples from India of accurate memories of past lives, birthmark
    phenomena, etc. Can't really dismiss completely. </li>
  <li>Hypnosis and its effect on color blindness. </li>
  <li>Death and the "birthday phenomenon." </li>
  <li>Phantom-limb phenomena. Many anomalies here. </li>
  <li>Stigmata. </li>
  <li>Blister-raising and skin-writing via hypnosis. </li>
  <li>The Princeton experiments in psychokinesis. </li>
