<p class="abstract">In <a href="/people/s/SaganCarl">Carl Sagan</a>'s novel <em>Contact</em>, heroine Ellie
  Arroway manages to travel through worm-holes into uncharted regions of the universe, rendezvous with intelligent
  extraterrestrial life, and return safely to earth to tell her colleagues about her amazing journey <span
      class="source"><a
      href="/people/s/SaganCarl">Sagan, C.</a>: 1985. Contact. NewYork: Simon &amp; Schuster.</span>. There's only
  one problem: no one believes her. Ellie's entire adventure occurred within a span of a few moments, and observers did
  not even see her spacecraft leave its launch site. Unable to document her reported experiences, Ellie's colleagues
  conclude that there is simply no compelling evidence that her adventure actually happened.</p>
<p>Of course, as readers of the novel, we know that Ellie is right and her colleagues are wrong. Why then don't they
  believe her? They doubt her story because, as good scientists, Ellie's peers examine all hypotheses using die honored
  principle of <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>'s Razor. That is, with all other things being equal, <q>the
    simplest hypothesis is most likely to be correct</q>. They scrutinize Ellie's elaborate claim, involving
  mind-boggling excursions far beyond the range of established <a href="/science">science</a>, and find the story to be
  fantastically improbable. Even Ellie must admit that the finely honed blade of <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>'s
  Razor seems to slice her tale to pieces.</p>
<p>Although Ellie and her plight are fictitious, her harrowing brush with <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>'s
  Razor raises interesting questions for skeptics. Like Ellie's scientific colleagues, we have learned to accept <a
      href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>'s Razor as a powerful tool for weeding out bogus theories. But how do
  we know that die maxim "simpler is better" will always lead us down the royal road to truth? How can we say, prior to
  further investigations, that simple theories are automatically more likely to be true than complex theories? Might not
  <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>'s Razor, thought by many skeptics to be the surest weapon against
  pseudoscience, simply be an unproven philosophical assumption? If so, perhaps we will share the fate of Ellie's peers
  and reject the correct answers simply because they don't conform to prior expectations.</p>
<p>This article presents a brief historical sketch of the principle, and cites examples of the misuse of <a
    href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>'s Razor to support dubious theories and how that misuse led to the
  rejection of good science. This discussion leads to an attempt to identify the limitations and qualifications needed
  to apply the principle properly when choosing among various theories. I then try to determine what justification, if
  any, we can have for using <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>'s Razor, and argue that skeptics should
  learn to use the principle carefully in conjunction with other criteria of theory selection. I hope to show that
  Ockham's Razor is a dangerous weapon if mishandled, but that those who follow the proper safety precautions will find
  it to be a very helpful tool for evaluating theories.</p>
<h2>The History of Ockham's Razor</h2>
<p>The principle of <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>'s Razor is named after <a
    href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">William of Ockham</a> (1285-1349), a distinguished medieval philosopher and
  theologian. Contrary to popular assumptions, Ockham did not invent the principle that has become associated with him.
  The idea that simplicity and efficiency are important advantages of a theory dates back at least to <a
      href="/people/a/Aristote.html">Aristotle</a>, who stated that <q>the more perfect a nature is, the fewer means it
    requires for its operation</q> <span class="source">Ross, W. D. 1930. <em>The Works of Aristotle</em>, Translated into English, vol. II. Oxford: Clarendon.</span>.
  Centuries after <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>'s time, <a href="/people/n/NewtonIsaac.html">Isaac
    Newton</a> would also cite the principle of simplicity in his Principia Mathematica: <q>We are to admit no more
    causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances</q> <span
      class="source"><a href="/people/n/NewtonIsaac.html">Newton, I</a>.: 1999. The Principia: Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Berkeley: University of California Press.</span>.
</p>
<p><a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a> emphasized the principle of parsimony as an antidote to the various
  unwarranted assumptions he perceived in the philosophy of his time. He used a number of different formulations of the
  principle in his writings. He stated, for example, that <q>it is futile to do with more what can be done with
    fewer</q>, and perhaps most famously, that <q>plurality should not be assumed without necessity</q> <span
      class="source">Boehner, P.(ed.) 1957. Ockham: Philosophical Writings. Edinburgh: Nelson.</span>. A common term for
  this concept is parsimony. Ockham's formulations match up quite well with modern definitions of parsimony, which state
  that the most parsimonious models are those requiring the fewest assumptions <span class="source">Schick Jr, Theodore &amp; Vaughn, Lewis. 1999. <em>How to Think About  Weird Things</em>. 2nd Ed. Mountain View, California: Mayfleld Publishing.  For an excellent overview of the methodology used to evaluate new scientific theories, consult Friedlander, Michael W. 1995. At the Fringes of Science. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.</span>.
</p>
<p><a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>'s use of the principle was specifically targeted at the champions of
  the philosophical school known as realism, who argued for the reality of traits called universals. Universals are
  concepts pertaining to the characteristics of individuals or groups of individuals. For example, suppose we were
  talking about the wisdom of <a href="/people/a/Aristote.html">Aristotle</a>, or the heroism of Socrates. A realist
  would claim that these ideas of wisdom and heroism are not just concepts created by our mind, but eternal truths about
  reality as well. Nominalists such as <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a> and his mentor Duns Scotus
  rejected the concept of universals as an unnecessary assumption that does little to improve our understanding, and
  perhaps even confuses us <span class="source">McGrath, Allster: 2001. Christian Theology: An Introduction. Oxford: Blackwell.</span>.
  Universals may be useful for visualizing and talking about our perceptions of the world, but they don't necessarily
  exist in objective reality. And if there really is a shadowy realm of unchanging universals out there somewhere, we
  don't need to assume the existence of this realm in order to fully explain and understand the world. Why not just
  avoid assumptions that aren't needed?</p>
<p>As skeptics, we may ask how <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a> reconciled his support of philosophical
  parsimony with his theological beliefs. After all, isn't belief in God the ultimate example of the kind of universal
  <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a> was rejecting? We can certainly argue that the concept of God simply
  represents the synthesis of all of the concepts about life we care most deeply about-love, justice, and mercy, for
  example. We can describe and discuss these concepts without having to propose the existence of a deity. Perhaps we
  also know that many cosmologists believe that the universe in some way has always existed, and we can see that there
  are no scientifically or logically necessary reasons to believe in God, <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>,
  however, did not use the principle of parsimony to question the existence of a deity. While he always maintained that
  plurality should not be assumed without necessity, his life and personal habits of thinking convinced him that God's
  reality was indeed necessary. Likewise, he found revealed religion as recorded in the Bible to be absolutely essential
  for understanding the nature of this God.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this is meant to belittle <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>, or to imply that proper
  use of <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockam</a>'s Razor compels us to reject belief in God. However, the
  preceding example does show that reliance on parsimony will not lead all of us to the same conclusions. Some of us may
  regard a certain idea as essential, while others will think differently. In fact, both the supporters and enemies of a
  certain theory often use the principle of <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>'s Razor with equal passion.
  Since both sides cannot be right, it should go without saying that Ockam's Razor doesn't always lead to the best
  possible theory.</p>
<p>Although some of us may wish to believe otherwise, too much reliance on "simplicity" leads to error more often than
  it leads to truth. By endorsing any theories that subjectively seem simpler than rival theories, we risk paying too
  little attention to other important criteria for evaluating theories. And when perceived simplicity of a theory
  commands too much of our attention, the door is opened to reject any and all theories we personally find too complex
  to understand.</p>
<h2>Abuses of Ockham's Razor</h2>
<p>Examples of abuse of <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>'s Razor in support of worthless theories are
  abundant. Pseudoscientists often invoke Ockham's Razor to defend apparently simple theories discredited by mainstream
  science. They regale us with stories about ghosts, aliens, forest monsters and other "unexplained" phenomenona, and
  then shake their heads impatiently when scientists deny the validity of their "evidence." Aren't scientists just
  grasping at straws when they refute the stories of the thousands of people who have experienced these strange
  happenings? The simplest explanation of paranormal events, at least to the paranormalists, is that the events are
  exactly what they seem. Why do we need complex scientific explanations of ghost photos, for example, when we can just
  assume that the unidentified patch of light in our photo from Gettysburg is the specter of a Civil War soldier?</p>
<p>Creationists are especially good at using apparent simplicity to attack established science. Who needs this
  far-fetched theory of evolution, they ask? We don't need to review all of this research from geology, genetics,
  developmental biology, and anatomy purporting to show that all life on earth slowly evolved by descent from common
  ancestors. It's much simpler to just say "God did it" and end it there. By allegedly adopting the principle of <a
      href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>'s Razor, creationists give their theories the veneer of intellectual
  rigor. They claim to be more scientific than scientists, who just want to overcomplicate everything with their
  convoluted theories and denials of simple faith in biblical authority.</p>
<p>Sometimes, abuses of simplicity strengthen stereotypes about certain groups. For example, some social scientists
  argue that genetic inferiority is the simplest and therefore most likely explanation for the lower measured abilities
  of nonwhites on standardized intelligence tests <span class="source">Gould, Stephen Jay. 1996. The Mismeasure of Man. New York: W. W. Norton.</span>.
  After all, it's much "simpler" to just assume that nonwhites are inferior instead of accounting for the complex
  effects of culture, history, economics and racism on their test performances. On the other hand, behavioral
  geneticists and evolutionary psychologists argue that their explanation for group differences are more complex than
  social and cultural explanations, and thus the charge that <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>'s Razor
  applies to sociologists and not sociobiologists.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even skeptics are known to enlist <a href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>'s Razor in the
  defense of dubious theories. Allegedly following the scientific method, these skeptics maintain that <a
      href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume">Ockham</a>'s Razor is simply an example of the principle of reductionism, which
  attempts to explain complex phenomena in terms of simpler models. These skeptics claim that reductionism is the very
  basis of scientific inquiry. To an extent, they are right, since a theory must be simpler than the phenomenon it seeks
  to explain if it is to be of any use. However, skeptics sometimes take reductionism a bit too far.</p>
<p>Let's consider the examples of evolutionary psychology and its closely related cousin, memetics. While many
  evolutionary psychologists are modest and responsible when discussing the reach of their theory, some of their peers
  are not so cautious. Overzealous evolutionary psychologists seek to explain all of human nature, including
  consciousness, sexual attitudes, religious beliefs and moral sentiments in terms of evolutionary advantages conferred
  by those traits. At some point in our ancestral environment, the traits we associate with human nature developed and
  caused those people (or proto-people) who possessed these traits to reproduce more successfully than those who lacked
  these traits. Therefore, evolutionary psychologists reason, every aspect of human nature exists because it served an
  important function in our evolutionary past, and contributed to the selective fitness of the species. Even something
  as apparently trivial as our sweet tooth may have evolved for good reasons, since it may have conferred an advantage
  on our ancestors when supplies of sugar were relatively scarce <span class="source">Wright, Robert. 1995. The Moral Animal: Why We are the Way We Are. New York: Vintage Books.</span>.
  According to some evolutionary psychologists, natural selection acts as a "universal algorithm," determining nearly
  everything about human nature <span class="source">Dennett, Daniel. 1995. Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life. New York: Touchstone Books.</span>.
</p>
<p>Memetics takes the idea of natural selection as a universal algorithm even further by postulating the existence of
  entities called memes, defined as hypothetical units of information transferred from person to person. A meme can be
  anything from a guitar solo, a stanza of poetry, a religious dogma, or political slogan <span class="source">Blackmore, Susan. 2000. The Meme Machine. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</span>.
  Memes either survive and reproduce or disappear, in a manner analogous to the natural selection of genes. To
  memetecists, this theory explains why some ideas spread and establish themselves more successfully than others.
  Religious ideas, for instance, allegedly reproduce the way viruses reproduce in the body of a host organism: they
  infect an otherwise healthy and rational person and fill his head with pleasant absurdities about the existence of a
  God and an afterlife. Indeed, one of the main appeals of both evolutionary psychology and memetics to some skeptics is
  the simplistic materialism of both theories, and their usefulness in dispensing with religious claims.</p>
<p>All of these abusers of Ockham's Razor fail to understand that simplicity is not a criterion to use in isolation from
  other important evaluative factors. The principle of Ockham's Razor doesn't tell us that simpler is always better, it
  merely says that the simpler theory is better if all other factors are equal. Thus, simplicity must be considered as
  one factor among several. Other factors used to assess the value of a particular theory include the following <span
      class="source">Schick &amp; Vaughn, 1999. Op. cit.</span>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Testability</strong>: A hypothesis should ideally predict something other than the phenomenon it was
    introduced to explain, and these predictions should be open to verification or falsification. For instance, there is
    a law of physics that tells us that force is the product of an object's mass and its acceleration. To test this
    theory, we could apply a force to a particular object and then measure its acceleration. If the acceleration has the
    value expected, we show that this law of physics passes the criterion of testability.</li>
  <li><strong>Fruitfulness</strong>: A hypothesis should ideally make novel predictions about currently unknown
    phenomena that could not have been made without the hypothesis. Einstein's theory of relativity predicted that
    starlight passing near a large body such as the sun should show an apparent deflection from its true position.
    Physicist Arthur Eddington measured this deflection during a solar eclipse in 1919 and discovered that it was equal
    to the amount predicted by relativity theory. Einstein used his theory to successfully predict a phenomenon that no
    one previously knew existed, and demonstrated the fruitfulness of relativity.</li>
  <li><strong>Scope</strong>: Ideally, hypotheses should explain or predict a wide variety of phenomena, and should
    organize our knowledge of the world better than competing theories. Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection not
    only explains how new species develop from other species, but reveals new insights about anatomy, physiology,
    embryology, microbial pathology, and every other area of the biological sciences. The theory allows us to gain a
    deeper understanding of biology that is simply unattainable without the use of the theory. As the great biologist
    Theodosius Dobzhansky once remarked, "nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution." Therefore,
    we say that the theory is preferable to other theories partly because of its wider scope.</li>
  <li><strong>Conservatism</strong>: A hypothesis should not conflict with well-established knowledge, or background
    knowledge. If a conflict seems to occur, the hypothesis should account for the discrepancy, and incorporate all of
    our previous knowledge about the phenomenon under investigation into a new and better model. Relativity theory may
    seem to contradict some of the predictions of a purely Newtonian model, but Einstein showed that relativity theory
    actually incorporates Newtonian physics, and makes additional predictions unattainable without using relativity.
    Relativity did not refute Newtonian mechanics. It conseived the information contributed by the theory and added
    additional explanatory and predictive power to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no rigid rules for applying or weighing these criteria, but good theories tend to satisfy one or more of
  them. Inadequate theories, on the contrary, consistently fail to meet most of these criteria. For example, let's
  consider the proposition that the hazy patch of light in my Gettysburg photo is a ghost. We can say that this theory
  is certainly not testable, since there is no way to confirm the presence of the ghost. The ghost hypothesis also is
  not fruitful, because it is just an ad hoc hypothesis invented to explain a single anomaly in our photograph. The
  theory doesn't add anything to our understanding or knowledge, so it has very poor scope. It isn't conservative,
  either, because it contradicts a great deal of background knowledge. This background knowledge tells us, among other
  things, that a hypothetical noncorporeal entity such as a ghost couldn't possibly show up in a photograph, because it
  would have to possess matter in order to reflect light toward our camera lens. Finally, the notion of a ghost is far
  from simple, since it proposes a being with alleged characteristics and powers that not even paranormalists seem able
  to consistently describe.</p>
<p>Now, let's consider the alternate hypothesis that the image in our photo is merely an aberration caused by technical
  problems with our camera. This theory is testable, because we can experiment with various settings on our camera to
  reproduce images similar to those in our ghostly photo <span class="source">Nickell, Joe. 2001. "Ghostly Photos." In Real-Life X-Files: lnvestigating the Paranormal. Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky, 128-132.</span>.
  The theory is also fruitful, because it allows us to predict that certain camera settings will cause specific kinds of
  "spectral images," even if ghost hunters haven't reported these kinds of images yet. The theory also has good scope
  and conservatism, because it allows us to explain a wide variety of "mysterious" photographic images in a manner fully
  consistent with our established knowledge about the world. And yes, it's a simpler theory because it doesn't require
  us to make complicated or dubious assumptions. No wonder that polls of scientists belonging to the <a
      href="/org/us/NAS.html">National Academy of Science (NAS)</a>, an elite organization consisting of the best
  scientists in their field, consistently show that almost no <a href="/org/us/NAS.html">NAS</a> members believe in
  ghosts. Familiarity with the criteria of good science breeds contempt for ad hoc explanations.</p>
<p>Let's not be too smug, however. We've seen that even scientists and skeptics can overemphasize simplicity in their
  efforts to evaluate theories, as in the cases of overambitious evolutionary psychologists and memeticists. Each of
  these groups of alleged skeptics would do well to review the criteria of testability, fruitfulness, scope and
  conservatism a bit more. In their extreme emphasis on natural selection, these groups ignore the fact that much
  evolutionary change is not completely adaptive, but results from a plurality of factors such as genetic drift and
  contingency <span class="source">Ridley, Mark. 1996. Evolution. Oxford: Blackwell.</span> <span class="source">Gould, Stephen Jay. 1997. "Evolution: The Pleasures of Pluralism." The New York Review of Books, June 26.</span>.
  Both theories are unconservative, since they contradict well-established knowledge, and they're not fruitful because
  they don't predict or explain phenomena better than competing theories. Memetics, for instance, distorts and sometimes
  completely contradicts the complex model of cultural transmission of ideas presented by mainstream social sciences
  <span class="source">Polichak, James W. 1998. "Memes: What are They Good For? A Critique of Memetic Approaches to Information Processing." Skeptic, Vol.6, No, 3, 45-53.</span>.
  When scientists forget to use parsimony in careful conjunction with other criteria, they don't perform much better
  than pseudoscientists in separating the good science from the bad.</p>
<p>Therefore, we see that parsimony is one criterion among several for evaluating theories, and none of these criteria
  has clear priority over the others. But we still haven't determined why simplicity should be a criterion for assessing
  the merits of a theory. Why is simplicity a virtue when it comes to scientific theories?</p>
<h2>Justification for Ockham's Razor</h2>
<p>Before we can determine why parsimony tends to be an attribute of good scientific theories, we have to determine our
  ultimate goal in selecting a theory. That is, what do we hope to accomplish? Clearly, we must know what we want before
  we can justify the best ways to accomplish it. The answer that immediately comes to mind is that we wish to determine
  which theories are true. After all, the pursuit of truth seems to be the whole point of doing science. However, there
  are times when the true theory, at least in the strictest sense, may not be the best choice.</p>
<p>Let's review an example adapted from an important paper by philosopher of science Elliot Sober <span class="source">Sober, Elliot. "Instrumentalism, Parsimony and the Akaike Framework." 2000. Proceedings of the Philosophy of Science Association. Available online at www.philosophy.wisc.edu/sober /papers.htm</span>.
  Suppose we are interested in measuring the effects of a new fertilizer on the growth of corn. We measure the heights
  of corn in two large populations, consisting of one population grown with the new fertilizer and one grown with the
  old fertilizer. Then, we compare the mean heights of the populations. If u(f) and u(o) are the mean heights of the
  corn populations with and without the new fertilizer, respectively, then the two hypotheses under consideration are
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Null: <em>u(f) = u(o)</em></li>
  <li> Diff: <em>u(f)</em> &Sigma; <em>u(o)</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The null hypothesis says that there is no difference between the mean heights of the two populations. We know that
  there must be some difference in the mean heights of two populations containing, say, thousands of ears of corn
  apiece. Yet, scientists justifiably do not reject the null hypothesis unless the difference between the two means is
  statistically significant. That is, scientists provisionally accept a hypothesis they know to be technically
  false.</p>
<p>Why would scientists do such a thing? They refuse to reject null hypotheses under these circumstances because a major
  goal of science is predictive accuracy. As we have previously seen, scientific theories should make testable and
  fruitful predictions to be of use to us. In order to maximize the predictive power of their theories, scientists are
  willing to settle for a lower degree of truth. In many cases, including the two corn populations in our current
  example, null hypotheses do a better job at predicting new data than hypotheses meeting a more rigid defnition of
  truth.</p>
<p>Of course, it's worth stressing that pursuit of predictive power doesn't mean abandoning the quest for truth.
  Theories that predict more accurately must possess some degree of truth. As science philosopher Ernest Nagel pointed
  out, there is little or no difference between actively seeking theories with predictive accuracy and those with claims
  to realism <span class="source">Nagel, Ernest: 1979. <em>The Structure of Science</em>. Indianapolis: Hackett.</span>.
  If true theories make the most accurate predictions, then maximizing prediction will lead to some degree of truth.
  It's just that the best theory probably will not perfectly match our empirical observations. That is, there will
  probably not be a perfect "goodness-of-fit" between our observations and the values predicted by our theory. Models
  with perfect fit may simply be a reproduction of our empirical observations, and may fail to predict new data sets.
</p>
<p>As a further example, suppose we are interested in determining the relationship between an independent variable (x)
  and a dependent variable (y). We perform a series of measurements of x and y, and plot the results on a coordinate
  graph. The result of our plot is a cluster of points roughly following a straight line, as shown in figure 1. The most
  accurate model of this data would be a complex function connecting all of the points. However, most scientists would
  say that we are justified in modeling the points as a straight line with slope m and y-intercept c as shown in the
  figure.</p>
<p>There are at least two reasons for doing so. First, even in the best of all situations, some deviation between a
  parameter's actual value and measured value will occur. If the actual relationship between x and y is represented by
  the straight line, then a complex, jagged curve connecting the points will be wrong, even though it exactly matches
  the empirical data we collected! Second, as we've seen, a model should be selected partly based on its ability to
  predict new data. The process of data selection is twofold: we evaluate empirical data to choose the most likely
  models, and then subject those models to further tests based on their predictions <span class="source">Forster, Malcom. "The New Science of Simplicity." In A. Zellner, H.A. Keuzenkamp, and M. McAleer (eds.) 2001. Simplicity, Inference and Modeling. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 83-119.</span>.
  Simpler models may help us make better predictions with greater ease than more complex models.</p>
<p>Thus, we want theories that approximate what we commonly think of as truth, but also enable us to make useful and
  testable predictions. And it aims out that the simplicity of a theory has some bearing on its predictive abilities.
  The simplicity of a theory, measured in terms of the number of variables or adjustable parameters it contains, affects
  the accuracy and scope of its predictions. For instance, hypothesis (1) above is a simpler theory than (2), since
  there is only one model showing that the mean heights of the populations are the same, and many possible models
  showing that they are different. But in our case, the simpler null hypothesis does a better job at predicting new data
  than the more complex hypothesis (2), Under the range of data sets under investigation, the simpler hypothesis is
  superior, because it trades a statistically insignificant loss of "truth" with a greater increase in predictive
  power.</p>
<p>A relationship between simplicity and prediction is demonstrated in FIGURE 2 below. Suppose we have two models that
  fit our empirical data about equally well: a simple hypothesis represented by H<sub>1</sub>, and a complex hypothesis
  represented by H<sub>2</sub>. The simple hypothesis H<sub>1</sub> makes a limited range of predictions, but it
  predicts the data in region C<sub>1</sub> more accurately than the more complex hypothesis H<sub>2</sub>. Thus, we
  prefer H<sub>1</sub> if our data set falls within the range represented by C<sub>1</sub>, but we may prefer
  H<sub>2</sub> if the data falls outside that range.</p>
<p>These examples show that model selection is a complex process involving the consideration and reconciliation of
  several evaluative criteria. How we weigh and apply these criteria depends, in part, on our ultimate goals, for
  example, do we wish to maximize goodness-of-fit, predictive accuracy, or scope? Our choice will determine the relative
  importance we assign to simplicity in choosing our theory. Luckily, mathematical models exist to help us quantify
  exactly what we gain and lose in our trade-offs among different criteria. FIGURE 2 above is a model derived using a
  statistical theory known as Bayesian theoiy that rewards simpler models for their sharper predictions in certain data
  ranges. As we've already seen, this model allows us to determine the relationship among predictive power, simplicity
  and scope. A mathematical tool known as the Aikake method also allows us to quantify the degree with which simplicity
  and goodness-of-fit both contribute to the expected predictive accuracy of a model <span class="source">Forster, Malcolm and Sober, Elliot. 1994. "How to Tell When Simpler, More Unified, or Less Ad Hoc Theories Will Provide More Accurate Predictions." British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, Volume 45, 1-35.</span>
  <span class="source">Aikake, H. 1973. "Information Theory as an Extension of the Maximum Likelihood Principle." In B. Petrov and F.Csaki (eds.) Second International Symposium on Information Theory. BudapestAkademia Kiado, 267-281.</span>.
  We have choices in selecting a theory, but not arbitrary choices. The use of mathematical models such as the Bayesian
  and Aikake methods gives us reliable estimates of the relative roles of simplicity and other factors in determining
  the value of a given theory.</p>
<p>These models also allow us to finally answer the question of whether Ockham's Razor rests on unproven philosophical
  assumptions. The answer is a resounding "no." Simplicity is not an arbitrary yardstick for assessing theories, or a
  whim of skeptics and scientists. We apply Ockham's Razor to theories because of empirical evidence that it works, and
  we have the mathematical models to show how and why it works. Simplicity has a definite and demonstrable relevance to
  the value of a theory, and interacts in important ways with other evaluative criteria. And contrary to some critics of
  Ockham's Razor, our use of simplicity as a criterion does not imply a belief that the world itself is simple. Rather,
  we have learned that better theories tend to be no more complicated than necessary to explain the world around us, in
  all its wondrous complexity. Even chaos theory, with all of its inherent unpredictability, is expressible in
  comparatively simple mathematical equations <span class="source">Stewart, lan. 1991. "Portrait of Chaos." In Nina Hall (ed.), Exploring Chaos: A Guide to the New Science of Disorder. London: W. W. Norton.</span>.

<p>This means, of course, that we must take great care in application of Ockham's Razor. We should not be heedless
  reductionists, clinging to simple theories regardless of their adequacy. Instead, we should use mathematical models
  such as Bayes theorem and the Aikake network to model our models, and determine how much simplicity contributes to
  their utility. Then we will be well equipped to measure the strengths and weaknesses of scientific theories, and can
  use Ockham's Razor without injuring the reliability of our knowledge.</p>
<h2>Using Ockham's Razor Safely</h2>
<p>I began this article with a fictional example of the failure of Ockham's Razor. How can we be sure that our own use
  of Ockham's Razor won't compel us to reject valid ideas, or to embrace dubious theories?</p>
<p>The short answer is that we can't be sure. However, we can use Ockham's Razor more carefully, using mathematical
  models to determine the costs and benefits of simplicity in our theories, always mindful of our ultimate goals in
  choosing theories. We can also do our best to acquire higher quality data with which to form and evaluate these
  theories.</p>
<p>We should also remember that science is always provisional. Theories currently meeting all of our criteria of
  selection may be unsatisfactory for future applications. Still, science progresses through the careful amending and
  acquisition of knowledge and the use of empirically validated methods. Ockham's Razor is an important method of
  improving this knowledge acquisition. Even safe use of Ockham's Razor will not eliminate error altogether, but it will
  at least minimize our errors relative to other, less reliable methods of evaluating theories.</p>
