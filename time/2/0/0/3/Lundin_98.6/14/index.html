<p>In general, I pack the following items in my kit, but as I mentioned earlier, people's needs are different. I'm not
  you, and vice versa, and we won't be there to sing "Kumbayah" to each other if the ship goes down. High grade what you
  want from my list, add want you want from yours, and scrap the rest. I modify kits as necessary, depending on
  geographical life zones, weather factors, the number of people in my group, terrain issues, the accessibility of the
  area to rescue teams, or whatever other factors I feel are important.</p>
<p>Don't let your kit become a static lump that never sees the light of day until it's needed. I'm constantly dinking
  around, replacing this, repairing that, adding something here, or taking something out. Certain core items, however,
  have remained intact for several years. I won't replace matches with something else anytime soon, if ever, and some
  elements are so basic to regulating body temperature or signaling for rescue that they have become crucial. Their
  importance in helping us survive will be around as long as the physical laws that govern this planet. Next to each
  item in the list, I've included its weight in ounces.</p>
