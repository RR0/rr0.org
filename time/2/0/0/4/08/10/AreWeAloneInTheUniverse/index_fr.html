<p class="Author">Rees, Martin (Sir): 2004-8-10</p>
<p>Il y a plus de 400 ans, <a href="../../../../../../../../people/b/BrunoGiordano/index.html">Giordano Bruno</a>, un moine italien, écrivit : <q>Dans l'espace, il y a d'innombrables terres tournant autour d'autres soleils, qui pourraient porter sur elles des créatures semblables ou même supérieures à celles sont notre Terre humaine</q>. Bruno mérite to be remembered in the millennium year --  il fut brûlé at the stake, à Rome, en l'an 1600.</p>
<p>A la fin du 19<sup>ème</sup> siècle, la <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/culture/litterature/index.html">science-fiction</a> de <a href="../../../../../../../../people/v/VerneJules/index.html">Jules Verne</a> et de <a href="../../../../../../../../people/w/WellsHerbertGeorge/index.html">H. G. Wells</a> popularisa l'idée de vie extraterrestre. <a href="../../../../../../../../people/l/LowellPercival/index.html">Percival Lowell</a>, un riche américain, construisit son propre observatoire à Flagstaff, en Arizona,  principalement pour étudier <a href="../../../../../../../../place/systeme/solaire/planete/mars/index.html">Mars</a>. He believed that its surface was criss-crossed  by 'canals', dug by an advanced civilisation to channel water from the  frozen polar caps to the 'deserts' near the Red Planet's equator.</p>
<p>En 1900, une fondation française offrit le Prix Guzman de 100 000  francs poru le 1<sup>er</sup> contact avec une espèce extra-terrestrie ; mais la prudence leur fit exclure <a href="../../../../../../../../place/systeme/solaire/planete/mars/index.html">Mars</a> -- on pensait que détecter des martiens était trop facile !</p>
<p>Comment la vie a-t-il commencé, et existe-t-elle ailleurs reste une des questions les plus fascinantes de toute la <a href="/science/index.html">science</a> — de fait, vous n'avez pas besoin d'être un <a href="../../../../../../../../people/scientifiques.html">scientifique</a> pour s'interroger là-dessus. Mais nous ne connaissons toujours par la réponse. Nous sommes moins optimistes au sujet de <a href="../../../../../../../../place/systeme/solaire/planete/mars/index.html">Mars</a> que de nos ancêtres l'étaient il y a une centaine d'années. Même si de la vie s'y trouve, ce ne serait rien de plus que des "insectes" microscopiques tels qu'il en exista sur la Terre au début de son histoire — il n'y a certainement rien sur <a href="../../../../../../../../place/systeme/solaire/planete/mars/index.html">Mars</a> de semblable aux "martiens" des <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/culture/litterature/index.html">fiction</a> populaires.</p>
<p>De fait, personne ne s'attend aujourd'hui à trouver une "vie avancée" sur aucune des planètes ou satellites naturels de notre <a href="../../../../../../../../place/systeme/solaire/index.html">Système Solaire</a>. Mais notre Soleil n'est qu'une étoile parmi des milliards.  Et dans l'immensité de l'espace bien au-delà de notre <a href="../../../../../../../../place/systeme/solaire/index.html">Système Solaire</a> nous ne pouvons rien exclure. Des astronomes ont découvert, dans ces 5 dernières années seulement, que beaucoup d'étoiles avaient leurs propre cortège de <a href="/science/discipline/hard/nat/univ/astro/superamas/amas/galaxie/etoile/planete/index.html">planètes</a>. Il y a des millions d'autres systèmes stellaires. Et il doit sûrement y avoir, dans ce grand nombre, de nombreuses planètes ressemblant à notre <a href="../../../../../../../../place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/index.html">Terre</a>.</p>
<p>Certaines de ces <a href="/science/discipline/hard/nat/univ/astro/superamas/amas/galaxie/etoile/planete/index.html">planètes</a>, orbitant autour d'étoiles, pourraient-elles porter des formes de vie bien plus intéressantes et exotiques que tout ce que l'on pourrait trouver sur <a href="../../../../../../../../place/systeme/solaire/planete/mars/index.html">Mars</a> ? Pourraient-elles mêmes être habitées par des êtres que nous pourrions reconnaître comme intelligents ?</p>
<p><a href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/FermiParadoxe.html">Si des extraterrestres intelligents étaient courants, ne devraient-ils pas nous avoir déjà visités</a> ? Certaines personnes, bien sûr, prétendent que des extraterrestres nous ont effectivement visités. Mais les <a href="/science/Preuve.html">preuves</a> de l'existence des ovnis ne sont pas meilleures que celles de l'existence des <a href="/science/sur/fantome/index.html">fantômes</a>, et je suis personnellement peu convaincu. Certains <a href="../../../../../../../../people/astronomes.html">astronomes</a> citent ceci que une <a href="/science/Preuve.html">preuve</a> que les extraterrestres sont rares. Ils font remarquer que certaines étoiles sont des milliards d'années plus vieilles que notre <a href="../../../../../../../../place/systeme/solaire/Soleil/index.html">Soleil</a>, et avancent que, si la vie était courante,  son émergence aurait dû avoir un 'head start' sur des planètes autour de ces vieilles étoiles.</p>
<p>But the fact that we haven't been visited doesn't, in my view, imply  that aliens don't exist -- the question remains open. It would be far  harder to traverse the mind-boggling distances of interstellar space  than to send a radio signal. That's perhaps how aliens would reveal  themselves first. The nearest stars are so far away that signals would  take many years in transit. For this reason alone it makes sense to  'listen' rather than transmit --- if a signal were detected, there  would be time to send a measured response, but no scope for quick  repartee! (Aliens equipped with large radio antennae could in any case  pick up the combined output of all our TV transmitters -- if they could  decode them, it's hard to think what they might conclude about  'intelligent' life on Earth!).</p>
<p>Des tentatives pour trouver de tels signaux ont eut du mal à obtenir des fonds publics (même au niveau des tax revenues de 1 seul film de <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/culture/litterature/index.html">science-fiction</a>) parce que le sujet est encombré par des associations 'flakey'  avec les ovnis, etc. Mais il existe un effort sérieux en Californie, backed by hefty donations from some silicon-valley  millionaires.</p>
<p>We have no idea what intelligent aliens would look like -- it would  depend on the habitat that their 'home planet' offered. They could be  balloon-like creatures floating in dense atmospheres; they could be the  size of insects, on a big planet where gravity pulled strongly. Or they  may be freely-floating is space. They could even, as some science  fiction reminds us, be super-intelligent computers, created by a race  of alien beings that had already died out.</p>
<p>Even if intelligent aliens existed, they may not be transmitting any  signals; and their brains and senses may be so different from ours that  we couldn't recognise them. There may be a lot more life out there than  we could ever detect -- absence of evidence wouldn't be evidence of  absence. There are heavy odds against such searches succeeding.</p>
<p>But I'm enthusiastic about these searches, because of the import of  any manifestly artificial signal. Even if we couldn't make much sense  of it, we'd have learnt that 'intelligence' wasn't unique and had  emerged elsewhere. Our cosmos would seem far more interesting; we would  look at a distant star with renewed interest if we knew it was another  Sun, shining on a world as intricate and complex as our own.</p>
<p>If we ever established contact with aliens, what could we discuss  with them? I've argued in a new book that we're assured one common  interest. We'd belong to the same universe of stars and planets, all  made of similar atoms and governed by universal laws. We'd all trace  our origins back to a single 'genesis event' -- the so-called 'big  bang', which happened about 12 billion years ago.</p>
<p>To firm up the odds on alien life, we need to understand how life  begins and evolves. An extraordinary precession of species (almost all  now extinct) have swum, crawled and flown during the Earth's 4.5  billion year history. For a billion years, primitive 'bugs' exhaled  oxygen, transforming the young Earth's poisonous atmosphere and  clearing the way for our eventual emergence. We know from fossils that  a cornucopia of swimming and creeping things evolved during the  Cambrian era 550 million years ago. The next 200 million years saw the  greening of the land, offering a habitat for exotic creatures  ---dragonflies as big as seagulls, millipedes a yard long, giant  scorpions and squid-like sea-monsters. Then came the dinosaurs. Their  sudden demise opened the way to mammals -- to the evolution of apes and  us. We are the outcome of time and chance: if evolution was 're-run',  there would be no humans, and we can't predict whether any other  species would achieve our dominant role. So we can't lay firm odds on  whether 'intelligence' would emerge on another Earth-like planet.</p>
<p>We know this happened on Earth, but we'd dearly like to discover a  second example where even the earliest stages of life might exist. Mars  remains the best place to look. Three years ago, American scientists  announced evidence for fossil 'bugs' on a meteorite that had come from  Mars. This claim, hyped up at a press conference attended by President  Clinton himself, was dubious and premature -- NASA has been  backtracking on it ever since. We'll learn more from a series of space  probes that will be sent to Mars in the next decade, to study its  surface, and eventually return samples to Earth. And there are  longer-term plans to search elsewhere -- for instance, a submersible  robot will probe the ice-covered oceans of Jupiter's moons Europa and  Callisto.</p>
<p>All this depends on the space programme. For most of the present  century, space travel was a futuristic concept, familiar from comics  and corn flakes packets. But in July 1969, Neil Armstrong's 'one small  step' made space travel a reality. Those of us who are now middle-aged  can remember viewing 'live' the murky TV pictures of that event: it  seemed a high point in a decade blighted by the arms race and the  Vietnam war.</p>
<p>Another lasting image from the 1960s was the first photograph of the  entire round Earth, taken from the Moon. Our habitat of land, oceans  and clouds was revealed as a thin delicate-seeming glaze. Our home  planet -- the 'third rock from the Sun' -- is very special. The beauty  and vulnerability of 'spaceship Earth' contrasts with the stark and  sterile moonscape on which the astronauts left their footprints.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, the first brief excursions to the Moon seemed just a  beginning. We imagined follow-up projects: a permanent 'lunar base',  rather like the one at the South Pole; or even huge 'space hotels'  orbiting the Earth. Manned expeditions to Mars seemed a natural next  step. But none of these has happened. The year 2001 will not resemble  Arthur C. Clarke's depiction, any more than 1984 (fortunately)  resembled Orwell's.</p>
<p>The programme, announced by President Kennedy in 1961, 'to land a  man on the Moon before the end of the decade, and return him safely to  earth', was lavishly funded because America wanted to beat Russia.  Their pride had been badly dented in 1957, when Russia launched the  first 'Sputnik', and this was a chance to recapture the lead in the  space race. Reaching the Moon was an end in itself: the last lunar  landing was in 1972.</p>
<p>Manned spaceflight now seems a rather jaded spectator-sport: the  veteran senator John Glenn's recent trip in the Space Shuttle may have  been a morale-booster for elderly Americans, but it didn't recapture  the excitement of his pioneering flight 36 years earlier. We admired  the Russian cosmonauts more for their fortitude and DIY skills than for  anything else, as they coped with one malfunction after another in the  decrepit Mir spacecraft.</p>
<p>Nationals of other countries have hitched rides into space. The  British astronaut Michael Foal heroically survived the hazards of Mir,  the Russian Space Station. French, Bulgarian and Mongolian astronauts  have also made the trip. But none of this has recaptured public  enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The practical case for manned spaceflight was never strong, and it  gets weaker as robots and computers get more powerful. Space technology  -- now funded commercially as well as by governments -- has abundantly  proved its value. Thousands of small unmanned objects have been  launched into orbit.</p>
<p>Satellites are routinely used for long distance telephones and <a href="https://www.satellite-tv-system.tv/">satellite tv</a> broadcasts. The 'global positioning satellites' allow planes or ships  to navigate precisely -- and allow solo hikers or sailor to locate  themselves accurately anywhere on Earth, with a pocket-sized  instrument. Weather forecasts depend on pictures and data from space.</p>
<p>Space exploration need not involve humans. It can be better (and far  more cheaply) carried out by fleets of unmanned probes, exploiting the  advances that have given us mobile phones and high-powered personal  computers.</p>
<p>Cameras and scientific instruments have beamed back pictures from  the other planets of our Solar system. And the Hubble Space Telescope  has imaged stars and galaxies so deep in space that their light set out  on its journey towards us billions of years before our Earth and Sun  were born. The cosmos is fantastically larger and more complex than  could have been imagined by the ancients who first mapped the  constellations.</p>
<p>The cosmos confronted with huge spans of time, as well as stupendous  expanses of space. Life on Earth has evolved for billions of years, but  our Sun has burnt up less than half its fuel, and will keep shining for  another five billion years. If life isn't prematurely snuffed out, our  remote progeny will surely -- in the aeons that lie ahead -- spread far  beyond this planet.</p>
<p>We plainly can't forecast the vastly remote future. But what might  happen in the first decades of the new millennium? How long will it be  before people return to the Moon, and perhaps explore still further  afield?</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the current US programme is the new International  Space Station: this will be in orbit a few hundred miles up, and the  size of a football field. It will be the most expensive artifact ever  constructed, costing its own weight in gold. Even if it is finished --  something that seems uncertain, given the immense and ever-rising  costs, and prolonged delays -- it will be neither practical nor  inspiring. Thirty years after men walked on the Moon, a new generation  of astronauts will be going round and round the Earth, in more comfort  than Mir can offer, but much more expensively. The astronauts will be  able to do experiments, but most of those could be done more cheaply by  robots in smaller free-flying satellites.</p>
<p>The Space Station would make somewhat more sense as a staging post  on the way to other planets. But no such follow-up will materialise  unless public enthusiasm revives, or unless some technical breakthrough  renders space travel much cheaper and easier than it now seems.</p>
<p>Present launching techniques are as extravagant as air travel would  be if the plane had to be rebuilt after every flight. Spaceflight will  only be affordable when it adopts the same techniques as supersonic  aircraft. Tourist trips into orbit may then become routine. And wealthy  adventurers may boldly go further. Future Richard Bransons, for whom  round-the-world ballooning seems too tame and routine, could aim for  the Moon. If Bill Gates seeks a challenge that won't make his later  life seem an anticlimax, he could sponsor the first expedition to Mars.</p>
<p>Some people use the so-called 'insurance policy argument' to  advocate a manned space programme. There is an ever-present risk  (though fortunately a small one) that a comet or asteroid will hit the  Earth. The craters on the Moon's surface are records of these impacts.  An impact on Earth - leaving a huge undersea crater near Chicxulub in  the Gulf of Mexico, probably sealed the fate of the dinosaurs 65  million years ago.</p>
<p>There is about one chance in 10000 that, within the next 50 years,  the Earth will be hit by an asteroid large enough to cause world-wide  devastation -- ocean waves hundreds of feet high, tremendous  earthquakes, and changes in global weather. This chance is low - but no  lower than the risk (for the average person) of being killed in an air  crash. Indeed, it's higher than any other natural hazards that most  Europeans or North Americans are exposed to.</p>
<p>The ever-present risk from nature has been augmented since humankind  entered the nuclear and biotechnological age. Humanity will remain  vulnerable to these (probably increasing) hazards so long as it is  confined here on Earth. But once self-sustaining communities exist away  from the Earth -- on the Moon, on Mars, or freely floating in space --  our species would be invulnerable to any global disaster, and whatever  potential it has for the 5-billion-year future could not be snuffed out.</p>
<p>Whether on not humans spread beyond the Earth during the next  millennium, we'll still want to know whether we are alone. It would in  some ways be disappointing if searches for alien intelligence were  doomed to fail. On the other hand, it would boost our 'cosmic'  self-esteem. If our tiny Earth were a unique abode of intelligence, we  could view it in a less humble cosmic perspective than it would merit  if the Galaxy already teemed with complex life. We'd have even stronger  motives to cherish this 'pale blue dot' in the cosmos, and not  foreclose life's future -- a future that could be even longer than the  time span over which simple life has evolved into humans. That is why  we should expand our cosmic vision in the new millennium.</p>
