<p>What would happen if the existence of alien life - and the fact that it lives among us - was confirmed? The answer is
  in the hands of the military, who possess the documents and evidence regarding UFO sightings, handled by the United
  States as super-secret information. The disclosure, says Mario Zegarra, a [UFO researcher] would prove that man is
  only a primitive creature in the face of extraterrestrial intelligence. </p>
<p>Mario Zegarra claims that the Peruvian Armed Forces, specifically its Air Force (FAP) conceal information on UFOs
  seen in various parts of the country, which is made known not to the national government, but to the U.S. and the
  agencies researching the areas where the strange craft were detected. </p>
<p>The armed forces and senior police officials cover up the information, considering it to be top-secret. "Claiming
  that extraterrestrial life exists not only in other galaxies, but upon Earth itself, is a rejection of scientific
  theories on human evolution; in other words, the humanity's forebears are not apes, but aliens," explained ufologist
  Mario Zegarra. "Being a superior civilization and possessing advanced knowledge, it would dismantle U.S. power. The
  military itself has sighted UFOs from its craft. However, they must hold their peace, as it is classified information
  that is best kept from the public." </p>
<p>The spacecraft described by the military are allegedly manufactured using a solid material that is different from
  materials on Earth. Zegarra adds that we are on the brink of another UFO wave as intense as those which have been
  occurring at periodic intervals for the last 40 years. </p>
<p>One of the top secret documents presented by Dr. Zegarra states that on May 9, 1980, while a group of military
  officers from the FAP were beginning their daily formation on the Mariano Melgar air base in the La Joya district
  (Arequipa), they detected the presence of a UFO at the end of the runway and at a height of 1,800 feet above the
  surface. The object, resembling a weather balloon used for maritime navigation, was moving over the area near the
  airport. For this reason, Oscar Santa Mar&iacute;a, the pilot of one of the fighters, was given the order to take off
  and intercept the object. After a third pass, the pilot opened fire on the object without causing any apparent damage,
  moving away quickly. </p>
<p>The second sighting has a special characteristic, as it is described as a shining object, according to a translation
  of the official Pentagon report, a document made available through the Freedom of Information Act and featuring the
  eyewitness account of Maj. Santa Maria Huertas (Ret.)'s persecution of a UFO aboard his Sukhoi Su-22. </p>
<p>At Puerto Maldonado in <time>1952</time>, customs chief Domingo Troncoso managed to photograph a UFO. The object was
  moving along in silence, leaving a long and dense contrail in its wake. Its estimated speed was fifteen hundred miles
  an hour. </p>
<p>In <time>1967</time> another flying saucer was photographed by Augusto Arranda in Yungay, as he hiked the soaring
  mountains of the region. In 1966, an extraterrestrial object came in for a landing at the Talara air base. </p>
<p>In <time>1979</time>, a three-legged extraterrestrial vehicle landed in Chachapoyas. The following year a FAP
  interceptor pursued a UFO but was unable to reach it on account of its speed. This incident took place in the vicinity
  of La Joya in Arequipa. </p>
<p>Mario Zegarra states that the persons holding the proof are the military and the intelligence services. The accounts
  provided by Dr. Zegarra coincide with the ones given by researcher J.J. Ben&iacute;tez, who states that military
  personnel having access to this information insist that the public is not ready to know the truth. </p>
<p>Researchers Zegarra and Ben&iacute;tez claim that there have been hundreds of UFO sightings over or near military
  bases, atomic silos, warships, transport and combat aircraft, due to the potential for destruction they can cause. In
  this regard, anyone who dares disclose secret documents kept in any army, police or air base could even be
  "terminated".</p>
