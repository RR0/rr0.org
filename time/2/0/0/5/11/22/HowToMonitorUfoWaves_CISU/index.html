<p class="abstract">UFO waves studies usually focused on the search for a periodical pattern or some other feature
  giving insights about the nature of UFO phenomena and the forecasting of UFO waves. Here we prefer a more modest
  approach, aiming at real-time UFO waves monitoring: we describe a statistical instrument specifically designed to
  signal the presence of a significantly high number of UFO reports.</p>
<p class="abstract">To do that we need to seasonally adjust the UFO data and to find out which statistical distribution
  they follow. Knowing the distribution of seasonally adjusted UFO data, we can decide whether a number of UFO reports
  is significantly high from a statistical standpoint, thus signalling the likelihood of a wave occurring.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> UFO waves studies went along with ufology since the beginning; it couldn't be otherwise, as the UFO era just started
  with a "wave" in July 1947 in the USA.</p>
<p> Studying UFO waves usually aimed at seeking specific periodic patterns or other features able to provide insights
  about the nature of the UFO phenomenon. A basic aim was of course the ability to forecast a wave, allowing for the
  falsification of the proposed forecasting model. At the current state of the art, it seems that no theory is able to
  explain all the UFO waves data available.</p>
<p> A different problem relates to the wave definition criteria: what parameters we have to consider, and what threshold
  should they exceed to let us speak of "waves" in a proper way? UFO waves are usually recognized after they occurred,
  for example comparing the number of sightings during the alleged wave with the number of sightings during "normal"
  periods.</p>
<p> However, it seems important to be able to recognize an UFO wave when it is still happening, and even better when it
  just started: this ability allows ufologists to study the phenomenon with a greater awareness and, hopefully, a
  greater organization than otherwise possible.</p>
<p> In this article we therefore prefer a more modest approach: if we cannot forecast UFO waves, can we at least
  real-time monitor them? It's apparent that any ufologist who regularly follows the evolution of the UFO phenomenon has
  an opinion about whether a wave is actually occurring.</p>
<p> However, a criterion based on measurable parameters would be preferable, as it would be less subjective than the
  personal intuition. During 2003, following a suggestion by Giuseppe Stilo (CISU), we designed a statistical tool to
  monitor the frequency of UFO reports collected by CISU from different sources <span class="source">Abraini, G. : "Come monitorare le ondate"</span>.
  The tool, although useful, proved to be not fully reliable, as it was too much dependent on data seasonality and it
  was based on the assumption of Poisson-distributed UFO reports: this assumption proved to be incorrect, as section 4
  will explain.</p>
<p> In order to improve that first monitoring tool, a three-step approach was defined:</p>
<ol>
  <li> seasonally adjust UFO data, to avoid distortions caused by seasonality;</li>
  <li>find a statistical distribution, if any, that properly describes the data;</li>
  <li>check whether the number of UFO reports received was consistent with an UFO wave.</li>
</ol>
<p>Further discussions at the CISU 2005 annual meeting, devoted to UFO waves, prompted suggestions on how to examine UFO
  data in a wave context.</p>
<p> In the following, section 2 describes the data used; section 3 describes the seasonal adjustment; section 4
  describes the search for a suitable statistical distribution; section 5 describes how to apply the previous results to
  the wave monitor; section 6 concludes.</p>
<h2> Data</h2>
<p> Since 2000 the CISU put in place a mailing list to collect every piece of information related to Italian UFO
  sightings. However, a monthly update of the Italian catalogue started only towards the end of 2001. Looking at raw
  monthly data one can notice a distortion in Month over Month (MoM) and Year over Year (YoY) comparisons: if we are in
  September 2005, for example, we had two months to collect July sightings and only one month to collect August
  sightings. Therefore it's not surprising to see that in August there were less sightings than in July; likewise, it's
  not surprising that in August 2005 there were less sightings than in August 2004, for we had one whole year to collect
  August 2004 reports.</p>
<p> To avoid such distortion, only first-update figures have been considered: e.g. the number of reports attributed to
  February 2003 is that known at the monthly update of March 2003, not the last figure available now. Let's call this
  adjustment "update-date adjustment" (uda). As stated before, the monthly update is available only from the end of
  2001: therefore, only UFO reports uda since January 2002 have been considered in the analysis.</p>
<p> The Italian catalogue includes reports that relate to strict-sense UFOs as well as conventionally explainable
  sightings of objects not recognized by the witness (wide-sense UFOs), reports of events the witness considers related
  to the UFO phenomena (e.g. crop circles), photos of objects unseen by the photographer and so on. The Italian
  catalogue thus collects a very broad range of reports, but the informations are stored in such a way that the
  ufologist can easily distinguish them according to his criteria.</p>
<p> Someone might object that some of these reports (e.g. abductions, crop circles, ORBs, etc.) have nothing to do with
  the real UFO phenomenon; some other people might remark that, since we are dealing with UFO waves, explained reports
  represent a "noise" that should be excluded from the analysis. My opinion is that, when we talk about UFO waves, we
  talk more about a social climate than a real increase in unexplained reports; and this social climate comprises any
  phenomenon the witnesses relate to the UFOs, not only classic "lights" or "objects". It is widely known, for example,
  that meteor flaps played a crucial role in the development of many UFO waves. But even if most sightings were due to
  meteors, nevertheless an UFO wave took place, because "everyone saw UFOs", no matter what UFOs actually were.</p>
<p> However, to prevent such critics, in the first two steps of the approach described in the introduction (seasonal
  adjustment and statistical distribution) we used data on both all reports available and only UFO reports, thus
  excluding reports of lights or objects without actual sighting (e.g. crop circles, photos of invisible objects, etc.)
  and reports potentially explained with ordinary causes (such as meteors, planes, balloons, etc.). What remains are
  reports of sightings of lights or objects not immediately explainable <span class="note">That doesn't mean of course that all those reports are unexplainable: at the moment and with the available data they are just not yet explained</span>.
</p>
<p> Moreover, a different distortion is caused by extensive flaps: when a big fireball is observed, we receive many
  reports related to the very same event; this inflates the number of reports, even if the number of actual UFO events
  is not particularly high. To avoid such distortions we used also data on events, rather than reports.</p>
<p> Therefore, the analysis have been performed on the following monthly data series:</p>
<ol>
  <li>All UFO and IFO <strong>reports</strong>, uda</li>
  <li>All UFO and IFO <strong>events</strong>, uda</li>
  <li>Only UFO <strong>reports</strong>, excluding no-sighting reports, crop circles, etc., uda</li>
  <li>Only UFO <strong>events</strong>, excluding no-sighting events, crop circles, etc., uda</li>
</ol>
<h2> Seasonal Adjustment</h2>
<p> In updating every month the Italian UFO Catalogue one can notice a recurrent increase of UFO sightings in the
  summer, as well as a recurrent decrease in the spring: this is typical of a seasonal phenomenon. Seasonality is a very
  well-known feature of many economic data: gross domestic product, prices, consumer confidence, industrial production,
  retail sales, these all are example of seasonal data. Also non-economic data can be seasonal: rainfall is an apparent
  example. Statistic methodology and software have been developed to take in account the seasonality and produce
  seasonally adjusted (sa) data <span class="note">To illustrate the concept of seasonality and seasonal adjustment, let's consider the Italian industrial production: this suffers a severe fall every August, not because of economic recession, but only because of
  holidays. Therefore, the economists seasonally adjust the data obtaining an industrial production which is not
  affected by the holidays effect: as such, the seasonally adjusted data better reflect the economic 
  environment.
  The X-12 software has been used for the computations. It is freely available (along with documentation and
research papers) from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/srd/www/x12a">US Census Bureau website</a>.</span>. </p>

<p>The seasonal adjustment, through the computation of moving averages, splits the original data (X) in three
  components: an underlying "trend" (T), a "seasonal" factor (S) and an "irregular" component (I), such that the
  following relation holds:</p>
<p> X = T + S + I <span class="note">This is true only if an additive relationship holds between the three components. In some cases a multiplicative relationships is more suitable, in which case X = T * S * I. This is particularly useful when X (and
  thus its components in absolute terms) tends to increase over time: an example is the gross domestic
  product. UFO data from the Italian Catalogue proved to be quite stable over time, therefore the additive
relationship looked more reasonable.</span></p>
<p> The seasonally adjusted series Xsa will therefore be: X<sub>sa</sub> = X - S = T + I.</p>
<p>The most interesting outputs are of course T and S: the first gives insight on the current trend of UFO observations;
  we can have a declining trend even with increasing UFO reports, depending on the value of S and I. The second shows
  which months tend to be positively or negatively affected by seasonality: some months tend to have more sightings than
  others because of seasonality. The overall effect of the seasonality over one year should be neutral (the seasonal
  factors of each month sum up to zero). </p>
<p>The seasonal adjustment applied to Italian UFO data shows a statistically significant seasonality, especially for
  series 3 and 4 <span class="note">The F-statistic for all series is significant at 1% level, meaning that the probability of a wrong result from
  the test is less than 1%. See Appendix A</span>. The seasonal factors are positive for months June to September, and
  negative for the remaining months: this holds for all the analysed series. </p>

<p>The strong seasonality in the summer is unmistakable, and seems consistent both with data from other researchers, and
  with pre-2000 Italian data <span class="note">In the literature of UFO-applied statistics I've found only one article explicitly related to the seasonal
  adjustment of UFO time series: it is F. Fernandes, J.M. Ferreira, "An&aacute;lise da distribuiç&atilde;o temporal do
  fen&oacute;meno OVNI na pen&iacute;nsula ibérica (1950-1977)". In the article the authors use a multiplicative model and
  find a seasonal index greater than one for months from July to December, with a peak in August. However,
  it is not clear how they compute the seasonal index.<br/>
  Also A. Petukhov ("The UFO phenomenon in the mirror of statistics"), with only descriptive statistics, found
  stable peaks in January and July based on 1900-1980 Russian data.<br/>
  The SOBEPS ("OVNI: un phénomène parasolaire?"), using a slightly different approach on a world-wide
  database from 1940 to 1976, found that the number of UFO sightings reach the yearly maximum mostly in
  July and August.<br/>
  Rutkowski and Dittman (UFOROM), in "The 2004 CANADIAN UFO SURVEY", conclude that the number of
  UFO sightings "is not linked to warmer weather and the increase in potential witnesses in the outdoors" that
  can be expected in the summer (page 13). However, the seasonal adjustment applied to 1989-2004
  Canadian UFO data, shows that the seasonal effect is on average positive just in the summer months (July to
  September), although the seasonal pattern shows some changes over time.<br/>
  The seasonal adjustment had been also performed on 1946-1990 Italian data (all reports of known and
unknown objects): on average, the summer months show the strongest positive seasonality.</span>.-</p>
<p> Like many statistical procedures, seasonal adjustment is only an estimate of T, S, and I: as time goes on and new
  data are added, the previous estimates can change. Therefore, seasonally adjusted data can be used to make two types
  of comparison:</p>
<ol>
  <li> MoM and YoY comparison with the latest available estimate: e.g. is the number of UFO reports rising or falling on
    a seasonally adjusted basis? This can differ from trends based on original data;</li>
  <li> comparison of the estimate changes: e.g. are the seasonal factors the same as the previous months?</li>
</ol>
<p> By the way, seasonally adjusted data could prove useful also to forecast the number of UFO reports or UFO events in
  the next months: since the irregular component, by definition, should be unforecastable, the best forecast of next
  month reports could be the forecast of the trend component plus the proper estimated seasonal factor.</p>
<h2>Are UFOs Poisson-Distributed?</h2>
<p>That was the title of an article by E. Berger <span class="source">E. Berger, "Are UFOs Poisson-distributed?"</span>:
  the author used a sample of Austrian UFO cases to check whether their distribution was similar to the Poisson
  distribution. The Poisson distribution is a random distribution for Bernoulli trials, i.e. trials that can have only
  two outcomes: success and failure; the distribution is described by one parameter, the average number of successes in
  a unit of time <span class="note">Mathematically speaking, the Poisson distribution is derived from a Binomial distribution Bin(N, p), where N
  is the number of independent Bernoulli trials and p is the probability of success in each trial. When N tends
  to infinite and p tends to zero, with N*p=lambda, the Binomial distribution Bin(N, p) becomes a Poisson
  distribution Poiss(lambda). Therefore the Poisson distribution is useful to describe random events that occur
  seldom themselves but depend on a great number of trials: for example, the probability that one person see
  a UFO is very small, but given the number of people (i.e. number of independent trials), there's a given
probability that some UFO is actually seen over a certain period (day, week, month…).</span>.</p>
<p> Berger's reasoning was simple and powerful: "In case the […] daily number of reports during a wave is
  Poisson-distributed we may conclude that the main characteristic of that wave is the broader documentation of usual,
  random observations stimulated by the press and social interaction […]. However, if the daily reports are no Bernoulli
  trials and not independent, one is right to postulate an &lsquo;outside drive' for the rising and falling of the
  &lsquo;activity'" <span class="source">E. Berger, cit.</span>.</p>
<p>Berger's results, as corrected by Ballester-Olmos <span class="source">V.J. Ballester-Olmos, "On UFO and the Poisson distribution".</span>,
  showed that the Austrian sample was significantly different from a Poisson sample. The same holds for raw Italian UFO
  reports or events: it seems that their distribution is quite different from the Poisson.</p>
<p> However, as previous section showed, UFO reports are to some extent seasonal: that means that non-seasonally
  adjusted data, while maintaining the same monthly average, show a greater variance because of seasonality <span
      class="note">The variance of a dataset is a measure of its variability. It is computed averaging the squared differences
  between each data and the sample average: Var= (1/(N&minus;1)) &Sigma;(N, i=1) (x<sub>i</sub>&minus;moy(x))<sup>2</sup></span>.
  In a Poisson distribution, the average lambda is also equal to the variance of the population; thus, the distributions
  of seasonally and non-seasonally adjusted data cannot be both Poisson-distributed, for the average is the same but the
  variance is different.</p>
<p> Berger tested the null hypothesis <span class="note">In statistics, the hypothesis testing procedure distinguishes between a "null" hypothesis (the one we are interested in) and an "alternative" hypothesis: a proper statistical test let us decide whether reject or not reject (i.e. accept) the null hypothesis.</span>
  of Poisson distribution on non-seasonally adjusted data: would the result have been different when applied to
  seasonally adjusted data?</p>
<p> Looking at the Italian seasonally adjusted series is more encouraging: the null hypothesis of Poisson distribution
  has been checked using a statistical test different from the one used by Berger. Berger used a Chi-squared test <span
      class="note">The Chi-squared test compares the actual number of observations with the expected value according to
  the null hypothesis, for each class of observations. For example, let's suppose there have been 3 months
  with less than 10 UFO reports, while according to the Poisson distribution there should have been 4 such
  months. The Chi-squared test compares the differences between actual and expected numbers for each class
  (the classes are "less than 10 UFO reports", "11 to 20 UFO reports" and so on, for example) and returns a
  number that allows to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. The point is that the choice of the classes is to
  some extent subjective, and the result of the Chi-squared test depends on the classes chosen.</span>, which suffers
  from some limitations and seems too much dependent on the choice of classes for which we need to compute the expected
  value under the null hypothesis.</p>
<p> That's why we chose to use a different test, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov: this compares the cumulative distribution
  functions (cdf) <span class="note">The cumulative distribution function of a dataset is a function that cumulates the percentage of
  observations less than or equal to any given value X. For example, in our UFO data we can have that 11% of
  the months have X&lt;=10 (at most 10) UFO reports; 24% of the months have X&lt;=20 reports; 28% of the
  months have X&lt;=30 reports; and so on. Thus the cdf will have value 0.11 at X=10, 0.24 at X=20, 0.28 at
  X=30 and so on. In general the cdf has values ranging from zero to 1 (for example if the maximum number
  of monthly reports is 119, then 100% of the months have at most 119 reports, and the cdf has value 1 when
  X=119).</span> of the actual data and of the null hypothesis, and computes the maximum difference between the two
  functions. Like the Chi-squared test, also the Kolmogorov-Smirnov has at least one drawback, but nevertheless it's
  more reliable <span class="note">The drawback is that the test is designed for continuous distributions, while the Poisson is a discrete
  distribution, i.e. the probabilities can be computed only for integer values. However, extensive simulations
  show that the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test applied to discrete distributions reject more often than usual the null
  hypothesis when this is true: that means that whenever the test does not reject the null, the result should be
  absolutely reliable.</span>. The test, when applied to seasonally adjusted UFO data, does not reject the null
  hypothesis of Poisson-distributed data. This holds in particular for the series 3 and 4, as Appendix B shows. </p>

<p>However, there is a problem: when the average number of monthly reports is too high, the Poisson distribution becomes
  almost identical to a normal distribution <span class="note">The normal, or Gaussian, distribution is one of the best known distribution: bell-shaped, it is often used to
  describe measurement errors, which concentrates around the mean with a certain dispersion.</span>, as figure 2 shows:
  unfortunately, the number of monthly reports in seasonally adjusted series is just so high that a Poisson distribution
  with that average is very similar to a normal distribution.</p>
<p> So, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test seems inconclusive for our purposes: it tells us that the actual data uda sa fit
  well enough the Poisson distribution, but it would also tell that they fit the normal distribution as well. We cannot
  decide whether the data fit the Poisson distribution more than the normal one, or viceversa <span class="note">We could discriminate between Poisson and Normal distributions only if the average number of reports is
  low: using a weekly frequency could serve for the purpose, but unfortunately it is difficult to compute
  seasonally adjusted data on a weekly frequency. An attempt to compute seasonally adjusted weekly data
  resulted in a controversial outcome.</span>. However, the results seem encouraging as they at least do not reject the
  Poisson distribution hypothesis: if this is the case, the result should be interpreted in the sense that UFO reports
  and events follow a random process, on top of which seasonal factors are applied. Seasonal factors, plus IFO and
  no-sighting reports make the underlying random structure hidden in a sociological over-structure, more difficult to
  interpret.</p>
<h2> Monitoring UFO Waves</h2>
<p> The combined results of seasonal adjustment and statistical distribution of UFO reports and events let us prepare a
  simple and useful tool for monitoring UFO waves. The basic principle is the same of the tool used for the past two
  years <span class="source">G. Abraini, cit.</span>: the statistical distribution let us compute the threshold above
  which the number of UFO reports is deemed statistically significant; the seasonally adjusted data let us avoid false
  signals due to seasonality, and a more reliable threshold.</p>
<p> As far as the statistical distribution is concerned, we could use the Normal distribution as well as the Poisson
  distribution: since we cannot discriminate between them, the computed threshold would be very similar for both
  distributions. As an alternative, we could also use the empirical cdf <span class="note">In contrast with a theoretical cdf, the empirical one doesn't rely on a mathematical formula but only on the actual observed data: as such, it can be to some extent "irregular".</span>,
  which takes in account also the extreme values that we could observe in the actual data: because of that, the
  threshold computed with the empirical cdf would be higher than the one computed with a Poisson or Normal distribution.
</p>
<p> To compute the absolute threshold we need to set a threshold in terms of relative frequency: for example, one may
  decide that a wave occurs only once every 100 months; that means that the relative frequency of the wave is 1% <span
      class="note">It would be nice to set this frequency threshold based on historical data: for example, if in the past 50
  years (600 months) there have been 23 months deemed as UFO waves, the relative frequency should be
  3,8%. However, as far as I know such computations do not exist on a historical basis.</span>. In statistics, a usual
  threshold is set at 5%, meaning that there is 5% probability to observe a UFO wave: therefore we can compute the
  absolute value such that there is 5% probability to observe an even higher value. As said above, if there are extreme
  values the empirical cdf would provide the greatest of such thresholds (at least for small probabilities), compared to
  theoretical cdfs: so, thresholds computed with the empirical cdf would be more conservative than others, because it's
  more difficult to observe values greater than that threshold. That's why we decided to use the empirical cdf in
  monitoring UFO waves. </p>

<p>In practice, the monitoring tool will work this way:</p>
<ol>
  <li> set a relative frequency threshold (say 5%);</li>
  <li> compute the corresponding absolute value, based on the empirical cdf of UFO reports (or events) uda sa (for
    example, this value is 32: i.e. only 5% of the observed monthly frequencies are greater than 32);</li>
  <li> add to the value computed in 2 (i.e. based on seasonally adjusted data) the seasonal factor expected in the next
    month (e.g. 4, such that the real threshold number of non-seasonally adjusted UFO reports/events would be
    32+4=36)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, if the next month the actual number of UFO reports/events is greater than 36, we can say that the number is
  significantly high from a statistical viewpoint: therefore, we can say that a UFO wave is likely (at 5% probability)
  occurring. The following figure explains the concept in graphical terms, only for explanation purposes.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Past ufological research seems to have focused on forecasting UFO waves: the ability to predict future waves
  certainly fascinates UFO researchers, but the task proved to be much difficult. Not only the occurrence of UFO waves
  does not seem to follow any recognizable rule, but we must be aware that UFO reports dynamics indicates a quite strong
  seasonality over time, which makes even more difficult understanding UFO wave patterns.</p>
<p> In this article we chose to take a more humble approach: if we cannot forecast UFO waves, can we at least monitor
  them? To monitor UFO waves we need to clean the data, to remove accidental reports (e.g. photos of object unseen by
  the photographer), to consider UFO events rather than UFO reports, and above all to remove the seasonality present in
  the raw data. We also need to find a statistical distribution the data fit well in: this allows us to recognize with a
  proper statistic measure whether the number of UFO reports actually received is significantly high or not.</p>
<p> After removing the seasonality, data seem to fit well enough both a Poisson and a Normal distribution: this is
  because, for high average number of UFO reports, the Poisson and Normal distribution almost coincide. Given this
  uncertainty and to have a more conservative decision rule, the empirical distribution looked more suitable to verify
  whether the number of incoming reports is actually "high" or not. This is done computing a threshold for significantly
  high number of reports and taking in account also the seasonal effect of each month: a high number of reports is
  considered as a signal that an UFO wave is likely occurring.</p>
<p> No real back-test has been performed, due to lack of data: however, a simple application of the procedure to
  seasonally adjusted 1946-1990 Italian UFO reports proved that the monitoring tool is able to detect the main UFO waves
  occurred in Italy (Appendix C).</p>
<h2> APPENDIX A : Statistical significance of seasonality</h2>
<p> Result of the F-test for seasonality significance, as at November 2005.</p>
<p>For each analysed series is shown the value of the F-statistic and the associated p-value (if less than 5% the
  seasonality is present at a significant level, if greater than 5% the seasonality is not present at a significant
  level). The null hypothesis is "no seasonality present".</p>
<h3> Series 1</h3>
<p> All UFO and IFO <strong>reports</strong>, uda<br/> F-test: 3.894<br/> p-value: 0.11%</p>
<h3>Series 2</h3>
<p>All UFO and IFO <strong>events</strong>, uda<br/> F-test: 7.548<br/> p-value: 0.00%</p>
<h3>Series 3</h3>
<p>Only UFO <strong>reports</strong>, excluding no-sighting reports, crop circles, etc., uda<br/> F-test: 7.656<br/>
  p-value: 0.00%</p>
<h3>Series 4</h3>
<p>Only UFO <strong>events</strong>, excluding no-sighting events, crop circles, etc., uda<br/> F-test: 7.598<br/>
  p-value: 0.00%</p>
<p> Series 2, 3 and 4 have the lowest (most significant) p-value, therefore they are the series for which the
  seasonality is most evident.</p>
<h2> APPENDIX B : Test for Poisson distribution</h2>
<p>Result of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for Poisson distribution, as at November 2005.</p>
<p>For each analysed series is shown the null hypothesis, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test statistic, and the associated
  p-value (if less than 5% we reject the null hypothesis, i.e. the data are not Poisson-distributed; if greater than 5%
  we cannot reject the null hypothesis, i.e. look Poissondistributed).</p>
<h3> Series 1</h3>
<p>All UFO and IFO reports, uda<br/> Null Hypothesis: Poiss(41)<br/> KS-test: 0.1885<br/> p-value: 6.65%</p>
<h3>Series 2</h3>
<p>All UFO and IFO events, uda<br/> Null Hypothesis: Poiss(33)<br/> KS-test: 0.1569<br/> p-value: 18.92%</p>
<h3>Series 3</h3>
<p>Only UFO reports, excluding no-sighting reports, crop circles, etc., uda<br/> Null Hypothesis: Poiss(17)<br/>
  KS-test: 0.1367<br/> p-value: 33.30%</p>
<h3>Series 4</h3>
<p>Only UFO events, excluding no-sighting events, crop circles, etc., uda<br/> Null Hypothesis: Poiss(17)<br/> KS-test:
  0.1312<br/> p-value: 38.25%</p>
<p>Series 3 and 4 have the highest (least significant) p-value, therefore they are the most likely Poisson-distributed
  data.</p>
<h2> APPENDIX C : Tool back-testing</h2>
<p> Result of the tool back-test, as at October 2005.</p>
<p>It is not a real back-test, due to lack of data: rather, it's only an evaluation of the tool's ability to signal the
  UFO waves based on 1946-1990 data. The back-test procedure has been as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li> seasonally adjust the data (not uda); for every month Mt, starting from Jan 1947:</li>
  <li>compute the 95% percentile (i.e. the 5% threshold as described in section 5) based on sa data from January 1946 up
    to Mt-1;</li>
  <li>check whether the number of reports in Mt minus the corresponding seasonal factor is greater than the value
    computed in 2; if so, highlight the month as a likely "wave" month.</li>
</ol>
<p>And here's the result; the following are the "wave" months highlighted:</p>
<p> Aug/1947<br/> Mar/1950<br/> Apr/1950<br/> May/1950<br/> May/1952<br/> Jun/1952<br/> Jul/1952<br/> Aug/1952<br/>
  Oct/1954<br/> Nov/1954<br/> Dec/1954<br/> Aug/1957<br/> Jul/1967<br/> Aug/1968<br/> Feb/1971<br/> Oct/1971<br/>
  Sep/1973<br/> Oct/1973<br/> Nov/1973<br/> Dec/1973<br/> Jan/1974<br/> May/1974<br/> Jun/1974<br/> Jul/1974<br/>
  Aug/1974<br/> May/1976<br/> Mar/1977<br/> Apr/1977<br/> May/1977<br/> Jul/1977<br/> Aug/1977<br/> Mar/1978<br/>
  Apr/1978<br/> May/1978<br/> Jun/1978<br/> Jul/1978<br/> Aug/1978<br/> Sep/1978<br/> Oct/1978<br/> Nov/1978<br/>
  Dec/1978<br/> Jan/1979<br/> Nov/1980<br/> Jun/1983<br/> Aug/1988<br/> Mar/1989<br/> Apr/1990</p>
<p> The tool catches correctly the 1950, 1952, 1954, 1973, 1977, 1978 waves, and also identifies some more peak partly
  due to wide flaps (e.g. June 1983).</p>
