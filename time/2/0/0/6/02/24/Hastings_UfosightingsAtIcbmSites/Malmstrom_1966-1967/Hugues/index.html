<p>Former Air Policeman, 341st Combat Defense Squadron, Malmstrom AFB, Montana</p>
<p>Hughes stated, “I was stationed at Malmstrom from January 1966 through August 1967. I was an Air Policeman, assigned
  to ‘B’ Flight, with the 341st Combat Defense Squadron. I worked at the Foxtrot [Flight Launch Control Facility]. Many
  nights we observed a light in the sky between Choteau and Augusta, Montana.” </p>
<p>He continued “This light would move at incredible speeds, make right-angle moves, and continue for hours. When
  seeking further information from wing command, we were often insulted when told it was a Telstar satellite. On one
  occasion we were told by other friends working in the [air traffic control] tower at the base that aircraft had been
  launched to seek to identify a strange radar echo that had appeared on their screens and on the screens of the local
  airport. This was later denied the next day, but if memory serves, the local newspaper had an story on it the next
  day. This must have happened sometime in early 1967, or late 1966.” </p>
<p>Hughes concluded, “All I know is that some strange things consumed our attention many nights while on patrol. We
  patrolled from Augusta to Choteau each night and [frequently] saw something that lent credance to the UFO concept. To
  us, ‘UFO’ simply meant it was an Unidentified Flying Object, either from our military or some unknown source. We never
  believed the satellite story. However, when we learned that the jets had been scrambled and the next day it was
  denied, then we knew something was up.”</p>
