<h4>UFO sighting by a Minuteman missile maintenance technician, who requests anonymity, as reported to Tech. Sgt. Jeff
  Goodrich (USAF Ret.)—Former Team Chief of Missile Handling, 341st Maintenance Squadron, Malmstrom AFB, Montana:</h4>
<p> In the early hours of <time>1995-01-20</time>, an Alert Response Team, composed of two security police, had been
  driving to the India Flight Launch Control Facility when they noticed a strange light in the southern sky. As they
  passed by Minuteman silo I-4, one of the men radioed a missile maintenance team working there, and asked its leader
  whether he could see the light too. The response was affirmative.</p>
<p> The missile maintenance technician who later reported the sighting to Goodrich said that the light was “large”, and
  displayed numerous smaller lights—red, orange, yellow, green, and blue in color—across its surface. The UFO had been
  moving very slowly across the missile field, at low altitude. The technician insisted that the object was not an
  airplane or helicopter. Because he was a member of the missile maintenance team, and not a security policeman, he did
  not know whether the Alert Response Team had subsequently reported the UFO to the Flight Security Controller at the
  India Flight Launch Control Facility. </p>
<p>Comment: This UFO was not the first to be reported in Montana during January 1995. A brief entry in the sighting
  database published by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) indicates that on the evening of January 5th, an
  unnamed Air Force officer at Malmstrom AFB had called NUFORC to relay a sighting report which he had just received
  from someone in the town of Shelby. At about 9 p.m. the unidentified person had observed two objects moving silently
  through the sky for about two minutes. Although their shape could not be determined, the absence of any sound had
  apparently struck the sighting witness as unusual, and so a call was made to Malmstrom. Shelby is located almost
  exactly on the northern boundary of the Quebec Flight Minuteman missile field—with silo Q-18 situated less than two
  miles east of town, just north of Route 2. </p>
<p>Another entry in the NUFORC database indicates that two days later, on January 7th, at about 3 p.m., an unidentified
  woman had called Malmstrom AFB regarding a UFO sighting. Unfortunately, the location of the sighting is not specified
  in the entry. </p>
<p>A third call to NUFORC occurred on January 18th—just two days prior to the incident at India Flight reported to Tech.
  Sgt. Jeff Goodrich. The reporting center’s log states, “An anonymous caller reports multiple UFO sightings reported
  between Fairfield and Deer Lodge, Montana. Background noise during call sounds like communications noise from some
  kind of operations center.” The caller told NUFORC that he had received multiple UFO sighting reports, over the period
  of an hour, from persons located between Fairfield and Deer Lodge. Perhaps significantly, Fairfield lies near the
  geographic center of the Hotel Flight Minuteman missile field, with silo H-9 situated at the western edge of town,
  just north of Route 408. Furthermore, if one leaves Fairfield and travels southwest—in a straight line toward Deer
  Lodge—one will eventually exit the Hotel field and cross directly into the Golf Flight missile field. </p>
<p>In short, nearly half of the countryside between Fairfield and Deer Lodge lies within the boundaries of Malmstrom’s
  Minuteman missile fields. Although no evidence has yet surfaced which would place the reported UFOs in close proximity
  to specific silos within either Hotel or Golf Flight, the caller from Deer Lodge was nevertheless relaying sighting
  reports made by persons calling from the heart of “Rocket Ranch” country. The three sighting reports published by
  NUFORC may be found at https://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxlMT.html. </p>
