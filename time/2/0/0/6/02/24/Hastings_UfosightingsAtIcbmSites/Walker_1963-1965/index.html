<p>Comment: Florida Today newspaper columnist Billy Cox conducted the initial interviews with Jerry Nelson and Gene
  Lamb. His article, “UFOs Haunt Missile Crew”, was published in June 2001. </p>
<h4>1st Lt. Jerry C. Nelson—Former Atlas ICBM launch officer (Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander), 579th Strategic
  Missile Squadron, Walker AFB, New Mexico: </h4>
<p>Nelson states that on several occasions, while on alert in the underground launch capsule at Atlas Site 9, missile
  guards at ground-level had frantically reported a silent, very bright UFO hovering over the site. As he told Florida
  Today columnist Billy Cox, "The guards were scared. These objects would hover over the silo and shine lights down on
  them without making any noise.” Nelson told me that he had personally been involved in “probably more than three but
  fewer than ten” such incidents, over a period of a month or so. He also remembered that the sightings had occurred “at
  least six months, maybe more like a year” after the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962, when the squadron had been
  placed on high-alert. </p>
<p>Oddly enough, when Nelson notified the missile squadron’s Command Post about the incidents, his reports met with
  apparent indifference. Only much later did he learn that agents from the Office of Special Investigation had
  interviewed another individual regarding his knowledge of a similar incident. </p>
<h4>1st Lt. Philip Moore—Former Atlas ICBM launch officer (Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander), 579th Strategic
  Missile Squadron, Walker AFB, New Mexico: </h4>
<p>Moore, who retired as a Lieutenant Colonel, states that one night in the fall of 1964, while on alert in the launch
  capsule at Atlas Site 7, his missile commander, Major Dan Gilbert, received an extraordinary call from one of their
  “sister sites”, either Site 6 or Site 8. The commander at the other site reported that an extremely bright light was
  repeatedly hovering directly over the site, racing away, returning, and hovering again. Apparently, one of the
  enlisted men at the site, perhaps the security guard, had observed this activity and reported it to the missile
  commander. </p>
<p>Moore states that some of Site 7’s own enlisted men, including Tech. Sgt. Jack Nevins, were ordered up to the “silo
  cap” to monitor the situation. Moore states, “They reported the UFO zooming from the direction of Site 6 to the
  direction of Site 8 and hovering for awhile at the end of the movement…They all described it as a silent light that
  moved extremely rapidly—instant go and instant stop, no getting up to speed or slowing down. The common comment I
  remember was that everyone thought it was a UFO, and that it was hovering directly over Sites 6 and 8 and nowhere
  else. Thus, it was specifically interested in those sites.” </p>
<p>Moore states that the Site 7 crew were never debriefed and never warned not to discuss the incident. “In other
  words,” he said, “there was no official discussion or acknowledgment.” Moore concluded, “I personally believe that
  there is something to the UFO/ICBM connection. I know the Air Force covers-up when it feels the official need. UFOs
  over ICBM sites could be one of those official needs.” </p>
<h4>Airman 1st Class Thomas Kaminski—Former Atlas ICBM Launch Facilities Specialist, 579th Strategic Missile Squadron,
  Walker AFB, New Mexico: </h4>
<p>Kaminski states that he had been at one of the Atlas ICBM launch sites northeast of Walker AFB one evening in 1964,
  possibly 1965, when the missile commander, Captain D------, directed him topside to view unexplained lights which had
  been reported to the site. Kaminski states he observed two star-like objects at a great distance, moving in
  unison. </p>
<p>When he reported his observations to the missile commander, Kaminski was told that the base was tracking the objects
  on radar and had scrambled two jet fighters to intercept them. Shortly thereafter, he observed the jets attempting to
  approach the unidentified lights, which then put on a burst of speed and outran the interceptors. The lights
  disappeared into a Cumulous cloud, followed by the fighters. Moments later, the jets emerged from the cloud but the
  lights were no longer visible. The fighters changed course and returned to base. </p>
<p>The next morning, upon returning to Walker AFB, Kaminski’s missile team was routinely debriefed. He states, “During
  that briefing, my captain asked, ‘Whatever happened to the two UFOs?’ The response was, ‘What UFOs?’ My captain said,
  ‘The ones you sent the fighters up after!’ They said, ‘We didn’t sent up any fighters.’ We knew that was the end of
  that conversation!” </p>
<p>Kaminski also states that he had once observed another UFO display, not at one of the remote missile sites but at
  Walker AFB itself. “At least half of my barracks saw this,” he said, “It was at night and there were two or three
  lights—possibly four or five—that were moving around in the sky. They looked like stars but, from time to time, they
  did 90-degree turns. Not all at once though—they moved independently. They obviously knew that they wouldn’t run into
  each other. I don’t understand why we didn’t hear any sonic booms. That bothers me. They stayed in the same general
  area [of the sky]. After about 15 minutes, zoom, they were gone.” Then he added, “Actually, [sightings of UFOs] were
  fairly common on base. I think that a lot of guys saw them. It wasn’t something that you discussed.” </p>
<h4>1st Lt. Eugene Lamb—Former Atlas ICBM launch officer (Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander), 579th Strategic Missile
  Squadron, Walker AFB, New Mexico: </h4>
<p>Lamb states that while he had not personally witnessed any of the UFO-related incidents at Walker’s Atlas sites, he
  had once spoken to a former missile crew commander who had. This individual admitted, decades later, that he had
  briefly left the launch capsule to go topside to observe strange aerial lights being frantically reported by the
  missile site’s guard. According to Lamb, the officer told him that the lights were unsettling because they had been
  moving erratically, and faster than jets. He told Lamb that he was familiar with all types of aircraft but had never
  seen anything like the extraordinary display in the sky above the Atlas silo. According to Lamb, the former officer
  had said, “These were not just lights. This was something else.” </p>
<p>Lamb concluded, “People talked about [the sightings] at Happy Hour, after work, or after we got off-site, but it was
  kept pretty quiet as far as official statements went. To my knowledge, we were never briefed about it as a unit.” </p>
<h4>Airman 2nd Class Barry L. Krause—Former Atlas ICBM Missile Facilities Specialist, 579th Strategic Missile Squadron,
  Walker AFB, New Mexico: </h4>
<p>I did not personally interview Krause, who died in 1973. However, on December 20, 1964, he wrote to a civilian UFO
  research organization, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), to report an ongoing series
  of UFO-related incidents at his squadron's Atlas ICBM sites. In the letter, Krause stated that some of the missile
  security police whom he had queried about the sightings had deflected his questions by saying that the incidents had
  been classified "top secret." Krause also stated that, at one point, the UFO incidents had become so numerous, and
  ominous, that some of the missile guards were balking at reporting for duty. </p>
<p>Comment: Krause’s 1964 letter to NICAP, written while the UFO incidents at Walker AFB were ongoing, is extremely
  important because it provides an unsolicited, contemporary account of some of the sightings at the missile sites. I
  would like to thank Richard Hall for sharing Krause’s letter with other researchers.</p>
