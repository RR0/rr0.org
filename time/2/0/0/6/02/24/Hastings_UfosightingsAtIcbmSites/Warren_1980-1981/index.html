<h4>Airman 1st Class Jay DeSisto—Former Air Policeman (Law Enforcement), 90th Security Police Squadron, F.E. Warren AFB,
  Wyoming: </h4>
<p>Comment: Jay DeSisto’s “UFO” experiences are somewhat different from those reported by my other former/retired USAF
  sources. For that reason, I have chosen to include his statement to me in its entirety. </p>
<p>DeSisto states, “I was an Airman First Class while stationed at FE Warren, in 1980-81. I worked as an LE (Law
  Enforcement) with the 90th Security Police Group. I was assigned to base patrol and very soon promoted to the position
  of Desk Sergeant, even though I was only an airman. Thinking back, I can recall numerous occasions when I was on duty
  as Desk Sergeant when the security personnel at the Weapons Storage Area would contact me and report ‘lights’
  overhead. I would usually dispatch a base patrolman to the area to confirm the sightings but I cannot recall any
  specific outcomes. I am sure I would have reported these incidents in the desk blotter.” </p>
<p>“While I never experienced or heard of any ‘UFOs’ while stationed there, there were several times when we were called
  in for duty on our days off to patrol the base perimeter because there were satellites allegedly overhead taking
  pictures. I always wondered what those recalls were about. It was strange. Again, no one ever mentioned UFOs, it was
  always ‘satellites’. None of those recalls happened while I was on duty as the Desk Sergeant.” </p>
<p>“The ‘satellite’ incidents were clustered, not spread-out, during my tenure at Warren. I seem to recall they would
  occur two or three nights in a row. I recall three times when my flight had to report for extra duty. One time we had
  been out at a bar off-base and when we returned to the base, the gate guards told us to immediately report to the
  armory to obtain weapons. Even though we had been drinking, they issued us weapons and we were posted on the perimeter
  of the nuclear Weapons Storage Area on base. It was unusual to use Law Enforcement personnel for this duty in that it
  was normally a function of the Security Police personnel.” </p>
<p>“On two other occasions we were contacted at our barracks and told to report to the armory and obtain weapons. One of
  those times, I was posted at the Weapons Storage Area and another I was posted at the Combat Command Center doorway.
  Each time I was recalled for duty, our Flight Chief, a Tech Sergeant name Robert Moore, explained the situation
  regarding the satellites. During these instances our group headquarters was very active. Our squadron commander, Major
  Bernal F. Koersen, was usually present.”</p>
<p>“It really did not make sense to us that we were being called in for duty because of a satellite overhead. It seemed
  odd to have us don combat gear and weaponry. We just accepted the explanation of ‘satellites’ but, because of the way
  we were rousted for duty and the command activity present, we knew these incidents were very different from any type
  of readiness response exercise we had participated in, which were frequent and routine. We were often called in for
  extra duty during DoD inspections or Global Shield exercises, but again, during the satellite incidents, there was a
  different feel to the situation and the hurried and tense demeanor of command-level staff was quite different.” </p>
<p>Comment: One of my other sources suggests the possibility that the mysterious satellites reported above FE Warren
  were actually Soviet satellites involved in the verification of the 1979 U.S./Soviet SALT II agreement, which limited
  the number of strategic missile launchers in each country. However, given the specifics of DeSisto’s statement, this
  theory seems unlikely. Regardless, the Soviet satellite scenario would not explain the unidentified lights reported
  hovering at low altitude above the base’s nuclear Weapons Storage Area. </p>
<p>DeSisto states that those sightings, by Air Force Security Police, had occurred on “numerous occasions” during 1980
  and/or 1981. It should be noted that declassified documents from the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI)
  confirm similar reports of UFOs, in August 1980, near the Manzano Weapons Storage Area, outside Kirtland AFB, New
  Mexico. </p>
<p>Furthermore, another UFO was observed in December 1980, as it directed laser-like beams of light down into, or near,
  the Bentwaters AFB Weapons Storage Area, during the now-famous series of sightings at the Anglo-American base, in
  Suffolk, England. </p>
