<p>Although the vast majority of Americans are completely unaware of its existence, the UFO/Nukes Connection is now
  remarkably well-documented. Air Force, FBI, and CIA files declassified via the Freedom of Information Act establish a
  convincing, ongoing pattern of UFO activity at U.S. nuclear weapons sites extending back to <time>1948-12</time>.
</p>
<p>For more than 30 years, I have been interviewing former and retired U.S. Air Force personnel regarding their direct
  or indirect involvement in nuclear weapons-related UFO sighting incidents. These individuals—from retired colonels to
  former airmen—report extraordinary encounters which have obvious national security implications. In fact, taken to
  their logical conclusion, the reported incidents have planetary implications, given the horrific consequences that
  would result from a full-scale, global nuclear war.
</p>
<p>At the time of their experiences, my former/retired USAF sources held positions ranging from nuclear missile launch
  and targeting officers, to missile maintenance personnel, to missile security police. The incidents described occurred
  at <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/Malmstrom">Malmstrom</a>, Minot, F.E. Warren, Ellsworth, Vandenberg, and Walker AFBs,
  between <time>1963/1996</time>. Other sources were stationed at Wurtsmith and Loring AFBs, where B-52 nuclear bombers
  were based during the Cold War era.
</p>
<p>To date, I have interviewed over 50 individuals who were involved in various UFO-related incidents at Strategic Air
  Command bases or remote sites. I have selected the statements of 20 of those persons for presentation here. An
  expanded discussion of this material will appear in my forthcoming book, The UFO/Nukes Connection.
</p>
<p> The testimony below is admittedly anecdotal evidence. Nevertheless, it is offered—often reluctantly—by persons who
  were entrusted by the U.S. government with the operation or security of weapons of mass destruction. As such, each
  source was subjected to, and passed, rigorous background checks and personality tests designed to ascertain, with a
  reasonable degree of certainty, their psychological stability and reliability.
</p>
<p>For the moment, the international tensions of the Cold War era have receded. Consequently, the U.S. and Russia are
  currently downsizing their nuclear arsenals. Nevertheless, vast numbers of nukes still exist and may be unleashed at a
  moment’s notice. Therefore, these weapons remain a potential threat to the future of the human race.
</p>
<p>The events described below leave little doubt that our nuclear weapons program is an ongoing source of interest to
  someone possessing vastly superior technology. Significantly, the reported UFO activity occasionally transcends mere
  surveillance and appears to involve direct and unambiguous interference with our strategic weapons systems.
</p>
<p>Considering these and similar accounts—too numerous and credible to dismiss—I would argue, as others have before me,
  that the heightened presence of the UFO phenomenon since the end of World War II is a direct consequence of the advent
  of the Nuclear Age. To suggest that this is the only explanation for widespread UFO sightings during our own era would
  be presumptuous, simplistic, and undoubtedly inaccurate. Nevertheless, I believe that the nuclear weapons-related
  incidents are integral to an understanding of the mystery at hand.
