  <p>Brothers and Sisters,</p>
  <p>Right now, around the world volcanos are erupting. What an awesome sight.</p>
  <p><i lang="lat">Virtus junxit mors non separabit</i>, <q>Whom virtue unites, death will not separate.</q></p>
  <p>That was a well-played game. Congratulations to all who participated. But, it was time to wake up. So, here I
    am.</p>
  <p>I’d like to welcome those who accepted our invitations for membership during the game. We couldn't have done it
    without you.</p>
  <p>I took on this endeavor to find the truth. But, not for its own sake. In accepting this quest for the truth, I
    hoped to make myself, with the help of others, into a man worthy and ready to receive it.</p>
  <p class="v2">I stand before you a man who understands the purpose and value of our secrets. That's why I cherish them
    as secrets.</p>
  <p>Members of The Council, please note, that I will lend careful consideration to the traditional responsibilities, in
    light of these proceedings, and I will satisfy the standard request of the council, at the appropriate time.</p>
  <p>Again, well done to all who participated. I expect the council has invited all the players who gave their lives to
    this pursuit back so they might join us here: Thom Hickling, Rayburn, Batchelder, Joan Tellini, Stanley Kubrick,
    Donna, Christopher Reeves, Porfiria Rosado.</p>
  <p>Fare thee well, Rob Rosenberg</p>
  <p>--</p>
  <p>Before I continue with my instructions for the council and claim the prize for my service, I’d like to allow Porter
    Stansberry to claim his prize. Now, Porter don’t (wadre?) these words by claiming something I’ll just take back.</p>
  <p>--</p>
  <p>Now that the game is finished, I expect the council to recuperate those who have given time and talent to this
    venture. Along with myself, these players should be made 5 years younger by the council: Maria Rivera <span

  <p>Porter Stansberry [if he didn't do it himself]</p>
  <p>Brothers and sisters, our land of attachments(achievements?) has seen many ideas become new innovations since my
    game began:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Radio-frequency identification</li>
    <li>Digital music players (portable and otherwise)</li>
    <li>Hybrid Engines</li>
    <li>The __________symphony</li>
    <li>_________ing systems</li>
    <li>Portable Data Assistants</li>
    <li>Flash drives</li>
    <li>Using gas to drill in shale</li>
    <li>CD, VCD, DVD, HDVD</li>
    <li>HDTV</li>
    <li>The Human Genome</li>
    <li>Genetic Engineering</li>
    <li>Cloning</li>
    <li>Sudoku</li>
    <li>Viagra-type drugs</li>
    <li>The Fuel Cell</li>
    <li>Overnight Express Shipping</li>
    <li>Wi-fi</li>
    <li>Internet</li>
    <li>Ethernet</li>
    <li>Bluetooth</li>
    <li>MPEG</li>
    <li>JPEG</li>
    <li>MP3</li>
    <li>AJFF</li>
    <li>Invisalign</li>
    <li>The Davinci Surgical Robot</li>
    <li>Muscle Milk</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The rights, patents and proceeds for all of them should have been transferred to me by now. I know that our friend
    Porter Stansberry has created a way for you to do so.</p>
  <p>To arrange for future transactions you should visit me at any of the properties that I will resume control of:</p>
  <p>My primary residence which includes a beautiful piece of property in Northern Argentina, and I’m told, the biggest
    mansion in Buenos Aires. Well done, Porter.</p>
  <p>In Europe you can find me at the flat in Nice or in Madrid. Although, if I’m in Spain, I’ll probably be at the
    castle. In Asia you will be able to find me in Thailand. Another job well done, Porter.</p>
  <p>I will keep the two houses in Los Feliz, California and The one house in San Francisco. Although I’ll be looking
    for a new place in Baltimore and perhaps some other cities.</p>
  <p>I’d like to briefly mention some movies, books and music I found very inspired and compelling. I’d love to meet any
    of you who helped contributed to these works.</p>
  <ul><li>The Matrix 1, 2 & 3</li>
    <li>The Family Man</li>
    <li>National Treasure</li>
    <li>The DaVinci Code</li>
    <li>Eyes Wide Shut</li>
    <li>Confessions on a Dance Floor</li>
    <li>Demon Days</li>
    <li>Ten Summoner’s Tales</li>
    <li>November Rain</li>
    <li>Home By Now – The Animators</li>
    <li>Meet Joe Black</li>
    <li>Minority Report</li>
    <li>Star Wars 1-3</li>
    <li>Lord of the Rings 1-3</li>
    <li>Fight Club</li>
    <li>Seven</li>
    <li>The Game</li>
    <li>Paycheck</li></ul>
  <p>And specifically let me say that I expect M. Night Shyamalan to continue coming up with great ideas and making
    great movies. I certainly enjoyed his movies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wide Awake</li>
    <li>The Sixth Sense</li>
    <li>The Village</li>
    <li>The Others</li>
    <li>Signs</li>
    <li>Unbreakable</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I’d also like to single out Keith Richards. You had a great run buddy. But, what’s mine is mine. The game is up.
    The deed’s been done. It’s time for some shut eye.
  </p>
  <p>Lastly, I expect to (end?) myself and I am (jealous) and one ____________________________________ given that height
    of TV</p>
  <p>I expect that my success has helped those that have helped me. And I expect that the (focus) of (what) could again
    include (Archania?). So, let me leave you with a phrase that helps give meaning to the game!</p>
  <p>Human progress is our cause, liberty of thought our supreme wish, freedom of conscience our mission, and the
    guarantee of equal rights to all people everywhere our ultimate goal.</p>
  <p class="v2">Life is a test to see if you can control your spirit.</p>
  <p>Take care and enjoy the festivities.</p>
