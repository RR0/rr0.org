    <span class="source">Sturma, 2000</span>. Tandis que cette recherche offre une contribution int�ressante pour
    comprendre les croyances aux ovnis, elle tend � se focaliser presque exclusivivement sur les perceptions et
    exp�riences des peuples "blancs" "occidentaux", ignorant les interpr�tations de groupes minoritaires indig�nes
    habitant les �tats du 1<sup>er</sup> monde mais poss�dant des histoires sociales et cosmologies diff�rentes. Depuis
    <time>1969</time>, lorsque le chef Q�tshongva a d�clar� que des extraterrestres avaient influenc� l'histoire et la
    culture du peuple Hopi, des Native Americans have publicly asserted that UFO phenomena have always been an accepted
    reality of indigenous life <span class="source">Rothstein,
  2003, p. 261</span>. En <time>1996</time>, Sioux, Hopi, Iroquois, Choctaw, Oneida, Seneca, Yaqui, Mayan, Maori, and
    Saami individuals participated in the Star Knowledge Conference, a forum in which indigenous knowledge of
    extraterrestrials was shared with non-indigenous UFO enthusiasts <span class="source">Boylan, 1996</span>.
    Throughout the world, colonised minorities in settler states where UFO beliefs are popular, such as the United
    States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have been considered to possess a special awareness of
    extraterrestrials.1 Despite the prevalence of indigenous UFO beliefs, scholarly research that grounds these
    narratives in the social, cultural, or economic setting of indigenous communities within first world nation states
    is noticeably absent.</p>
  <p> In Australia, as in other settler states, there exists an indigenous minority who were forcibly settled on
    reserves and compelled to speak a language not their own. Today Aboriginal people across Australia suffer from
    higher rates of unemployment, violence, poverty, and ill health than do non-Aboriginal people. Consequently,
    differences between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people can be a source of tension, complaint, and resentment. This
    is certainly true in the remote regions of the continent, where indigenous Australians live in small settlements,
    rely upon services provided by non-Aboriginal people, and share a cosmology that is tied to the Dreaming and
    ancestors. But despite the remoteness of many Aboriginal communities, television and video players abound which
    expose indigenous individuals to popular media messages, including those of UFOs.</p>
  <p>While conducting fieldwork in a remote Aboriginal community in Central Australia from 1996 to 1999, I discovered
    that discussions regarding extraterrestrials and flying saucers were common. Many residents considered the community
    to be a centre of UFO activity. I encountered a number of people who imparted detailed information regarding the
    activities of the aliens and interviewed 18 individuals who claimed to have personally sighted a UFO.2 Descriptions
    of UFOs appeared to combine elements of popular media with themes of belonging and protection reminiscent of
    Aboriginal cosmological beings, notably the rainbow serpent. Furthermore, because UFO narratives comment upon issues
    such as racial difference, land ownership, and Aboriginality, they are capable of reflecting attitudes regarding the
    social environment of the community. Stories of superhuman extraterrestrial beings demonstrate and legitimate
    Aboriginal identity and the right of Aboriginal people to traditional land.</p>
  <p>Building on the theories of other social scientists examining UFO narratives, I will begin by reviewing the origins
    of popular conceptions of UFOs, and examine how otherness can be portrayed through encounters with
    extraterrestrials. Then, after discussing the history and social and social environment of an Aboriginal community
    in Central Australia, the UFO beliefs of local inhabitants will be outlined. While employing concepts from popular
    media, Aboriginal UFO narratives are nevertheless situated within the local historical, cosmological, and social
    setting. Consequently, Aboriginal discussions of extraterrestrials demonstrate how global ideas can be borrowed and
    shared with others, while also incorporating and naturalising local social identities.</p>

  <h2> Encounters with Otherness</h2>
  <p> Almost all popularised ideas and beliefs surrounding UFOs involve flying saucers <span class="source">Saler
  et al., 1997, p. 134</span>. On 24 June 1947 while flying his private plane near Mt Rainier, Washington, Kenneth
    Arnold saw nine shining discs which he described as flying 'like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water'
    <span class="source">Peebles, 1994, p. 9</span>. Arnold's statement was misquoted in the press and flying saucers
    were born. Although Bartholomew and Howard (1998, p. 189) note 'there is not a single recorded episode involving
    mass sightings of saucer-like objects before 1947', the concept of flying saucers spread quickly. A poll taken a few
    months after Arnold's sighting showed that only one out of two Americans had heard of the Marshall Plan but nine out
    of ten had heard about flying saucers <span class="source">Lagrange, 2000, p. 34</span>. Initially most saucer
    sightings were thought to be secret government aircraft but by the end of the 1940s the predominant explanation was
    extraterrestrial visitors <span class="source">Bartholomew &amp; Howard, 1998, p. 193</span> <span
        class="source">Curran, 1985, p. 16</span> <span class="source">Peebles, 1994, p. 24</span>. The inhabitants of
    flying saucers were believed to be superhuman, possessing superior technology and intellect <span class="source">Rothstein, 2003, p. 29</span>
    <span class="source">Saler et al., 1997, p. 131</span>.</p>
  <p> Another predominant element in popularised UFO dialogues is a belief in the government suppression of information
    regarding flying saucers and extraterrestrials <span class="source">Saler et al., 1997, p. 68</span>. Allegations of
    crashed saucers, recovered alien bodies, and government cover-ups were present in one of the first full length books
    dedicated to UFOs, Behind the flying saucers <span
        class="source">Scully, 1950</span>),but it was 30 years later before these ideas gained wider acceptance and
    currency. This change was precipitated by Berlitz and Moore's (1980) published account of an alleged flying saucer
    crash at Roswell New Mexico on 8 July 1947 that was subsequently denied by the government. A popular television
    series, The X-Files echoed conspiracy theories and portrayed members of the government as a sinister force acting in
    league with extraterrestrials to facilitate alien colonisation of the planet.</p>
  <p> Currently, the most prevalent element in accounts of UFO phenomenon is alien abductions. Publications on
    abductions significantly outnumber all other UFO materials combined <span
        class="source">Whitmore, 1995, p. 66</span>. The first, or at least first publicised, abduction story occurred
    on 19 September 1961, when Betty and Barney Hill were escorted aboard a landed saucer by short beings with large
    eyes, small mouths and grey skin, who communicated telepathically and conducted medical examinations on the couple
    <span class="source">Fuller,
  1966</span>. More recently, Whitley Strieber (1987) has described his experiences of forced abductions and horrific
    physical examinations. Painful, and often sexual, procedures are one of the most common themes of abductions <span
        class="source">Partridge, 2004, p. 172</span>. Abductees and 'believers' studying abductions tend to state that
    the alien concern with human reproduction is linked to extraterrestrial plans to colonise the earth and the possible
    creation of a hybrid human-alien race to replace humanity <span class="source">Dean, 1997, p. 57</span>. Abduction
    narratives repeatedly cast the aliens as malevolent, demonic beings that show little concern for human life or
    dignity, and whose primary purpose is the destruction or significant alteration of humankind.</p>
  <p> It is settler societies such as the United States, Australia, and New Zealand that have been more receptive to UFO
    beliefs <span class="source">Ellwood, 1995, p. 167</span>. While studies have shown that media portrayals effect
    perceptions of UFOs <span class="source">Bullard, 1989</span> <span class="source">Newman &amp; Baumeister,
  1996</span> <span class="source">Saler et al., 1997</span> <span class="source">Sparks et al., 1995, 1998</span>, the
    prevalence of such media around the world would seem to indicate that other factors also contribute to this trend.
    One explanation asserts that popularised UFO beliefs reflect both historical and contemporary anxieties that
    accompany life in a multi-cultural state. For instance, several researchers have noted a family resemblance between
    current attitudes toward UFOs in the United States and those toward Indians during the frontier period in American
    history <span class="source">Panay,
  2004</span> <span class="source">Pfitzer, 1995</span> <span class="source">Sturma, 2000, 2002</span> <span
        class="source">Whitmore, 1995</span>. Outer space has become the final frontier that, like the historic American
    West, is considered populated by hostile beings seeking to destroy civilization. Extraterrestrial plots to colonise
    earth, secret alien treaties with the government, alien abductions, and human-alien hybridization schemes are
    reminiscent of settler fears of Indian attack and conquest, government treaties that limit settler expansion,
    captivity at the hands of Indians, and the dilution of racial purity through sexual intercourse with Indians.</p>
  <p> Abduction narratives are also considered to reflect current racial, ethnic, and crosscultural anxiety in a
    post-colonial globalising world through a portrayal and emphasis of otherness <span class="source">Dean, 1998</span>.
    Captors do not speak to abductees nor does there seem to be any type of shared understanding between human and
    alien. The encounters are fearful, degrading, and devoid of humanity. Panay <span
        class="source">Panay, 2004, p. 214</span> writes that UFOs relate to cultural anxieties of personal invasion and
    community security, the meanings of progress and colonization, the construction of identity in perilous environments
    and the identification of 'others'.</p>
  <p> In a world where peoples and cultures are intermingling, if not colliding, UFOs are one vehicle through which
    individuals are able to address issues of both race and culture. While examining responses to globalisation and
    cross-cultural interaction, most analyses of UFO beliefs do so from the perspective of non-indigenous people living
    in the first world. But if UFO narratives are capable of expressing concerns over otherness, and if the aliens
    resemble Indians, then how do the proverbial 'Indians' - indigenous people - conceptualise UFOs? I believe that UFO
    narratives among Warlpiri people in Central Australia also reflect attitudes towards cross-cultural interactions but
    from an indigenous perspective. Although concepts such as UFOs originated among non-Aboriginal people, Aboriginal
    discussions of extraterrestrials are nevertheless situated in both local cosmology and the social realities of
    settlement. Consequently, before examining Warlpiri UFO beliefs, it is important to review the history and social
    environment of the community.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2> The Community</h2>
  <p> Prior to contact with Europeans, Warlpiri people were hunters and gatherers walking among sites in the Tanami
    Desert, where possessing an accurate knowledge of water sources was essential for survival. As European miners and
    pastoralists began to explore and settle Central Australia, violent disputes with Aboriginal people over the use of
    both land and water occurred <span class="source">Peterson et al., 1978</span>. From 1924 to 1929, the Tanami Desert
    experienced a severe drought, greatly reducing the availability of bush foods upon which nomadic Aboriginal people
    depended. In an effort to procure food from other sources, Warlpiri people began visiting white settlements in
    greater numbers <span class="source">Meggitt, 1962, p.
  24</span>. The government's desire to prevent Aboriginal people from crowding towns such as Alice Springs, coupled
    with the need for labour on cattle stations, led to the creation of Aboriginal settlements in the Tanami Desert. By
    1955, it is estimated that two thirds of the Warlpiri population lived on settlements under the direct supervision
    of the Native Affairs Branch <span class="source">Meggitt, 1962, p. 29</span>.</p>
  <p> From 1996-99, I conducted field research in a Warlpiri community that had been established in the 1950s. Located
    over 500 kilometres from an urban centre and having a population of approximately 750 individuals, the community is
    classified as 'very remote'. As in similar regions of the Northern Territory, Aboriginal residents of the community,
    who referred to themselves as yapa, possess little formal education, live in houses that are often overcrowded and
    in poor repair, are chronically unemployed or underemployed, often depend upon government payments as their primary
    form of income, and suffer from high rates of morbidity and mortality. Despite its remoteness a number of facilities
    were available to residents, including a shop, video store, takeaway, health centre, church, outstation resource
    centre, women's centre, community government council, school, bank agent, and videoconferencing services. These
    services employed a skilled non-Aboriginal workforce of approximately forty 'whitefellas' or kardiya. All of the
    teachers, nurses, accountants, and managers in the community were kardiya. While yapa and kardiya residents
    interacted at places of work, outside this environment, the community could be physically, socially, and culturally
    segregating. Kardiya typically lived in a separate area of the community, where few yapa had homes. After working
    hours, most kardiya chose to socialise with each other, rarely inviting Aboriginal people into their homes. I never
    attended an after-hours social gathering organised by non-Aboriginal people that included a single Aboriginal
    person. Similarly, yapa social events, such as public cards games, hunting trips, and ceremonies, were seldom
    attended by kardiya. In addition to these activities, yapa also possessed a cosmology, with which kardiya rarely
    engaged. Whereas yapa consulted Warlpiri healers to determine if sorcery was the cause of their illness or refrained
    from swimming in unfamiliar rock pools to avoid angering the rainbow serpent, non-Aboriginal people generally did
    not. On the two occasions that kardiya chose to consult Warlpiri healers, yapa residents remarked that this was
    unnecessary because non-Aboriginal people were immune to sorcery and ghosts. Most Warlpiri people regarded kardiya
    as completely unaffected by noumenal forces, while non-Aboriginal residents would often regard Warlpiri beliefs in
    these forces as superstition.</p>
  <p> Although Aboriginal residents relied on non-Aboriginal workers to provide expertise, Warlpiri people often
    expressed resentment towards kardiya in general. For Warlpiri residents of the community, there was not only a
    pervasive division between kardiya and yapa but also a perception that Aboriginal people had been taken off their
    land, made ill, and disenfranchised by non-Aboriginal people. For instance, many Aboriginal people blamed high
    levels of illness in the community, particularly lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, on settlement and the
    introduction of foreign foods that were high in saturated fat and sugar:</p>
  <p> Before the white man came, my people were healthy. We didn't have diabetes. We ate the sugar because it tasted
    good but we didn't know it would make us sick.Narratives such as this cast Aboriginal people as victims of
    non-Aboriginal domination. As noted elsewhere in Australia (Cowlishaw, 2004), complaints of victimhood were
    entrenched and habitual. Statements stressing the difference between indigenous and nonindigenous are a fundamental
    feature of the community and also underlie ideas regarding UFOs and alien abductions.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The Aliens</h2>
  <p>While the community could be considered to resemble many other remote Aboriginal settlements throughout the
    Northern Territory, it was also unique. Shortly after arriving to begin fieldwork, I was told that the region was a
    centre for UFOs as sightings of UFOs were said to have occurred on a fairly regular basis. Residents often remarked
    that in other Aboriginal communities or in urban centres such as Sydney or Darwin, UFOs were only rarely
    encountered, if at all. Consequently, 'the aliens', as they were often called, were discussed as a localised
    phenomenon. UFO sightings might have been primarily confined to the settlement and its surroundings, but narratives
    regarding the aliens were not. I witnessed conversations while in other remote communities and in cities such as
    Alice Springs and Darwin that specifically mentioned this community as a hub of UFO activity. While at a conference
    in Sydney, I encountered an anthropologist working several hundred kilometres away who had been told of the high
    number of UFO sightings that occurred in the community.</p>
  <p>Community residents, regardless of whether or not they had sighted a UFO, believed in them, or discounted the
    existence of extraterrestrials altogether,3 discussed the aliens on a fairly regular basis. Stories of UFOs were
    relayed in normal conversation while people were engaged in common activities such as attending a card game,
    visiting a waterhole or sacred site, hunting, collecting mail from the council office, or driving to or from the
    community. Unlike ghosts, Dreaming beings, or ancestral forces, UFOs were discussed by and between both Aboriginal
    and non-Aboriginal residents. I observed several conversations between yapa and kardiya where details of sightings
    were compared and theories regarding the aliens were imparted. When questioning Warlpiri people about the aliens, I
    was told on a number of occasions that kardiya also encounter UFOs. For instance, while James (34) was pointing to
    the location where months earlier he had sighted a large UFO, he remarked that non-Aboriginal people had also
    witnessed something similar in the same area. On another occasion, David (44) also stated, 'Kardiya do see them too.
    That new [service provider] said he saw one not from here'. Non-Aboriginal residents similarly talk about Warlpiri
    sightings and Warlpiri beliefs regarding the UFOs. At one after-hours social gathering, Fiona (26) recounted a
    recent sighting made by one of the Aboriginal women that she supervised. Those hearing the conversation contributed
    stories and warnings that they too had been told by Warlpiri people.</p>
  <p> While residing in the community, I never witnessed what either I or others considered to be a UFO sighting, but I
    was able to interview 18 individuals - fourteen yapa and four kardiya - ranging in age from twelve to 51, who
    claimed to have personally seen a UFO. I was given second-hand descriptions of several more. In every case the UFOs
    were described as almost identical to popularised ideas regarding flying saucers. For instance, all of the witnesses
    uniformly depicted UFOs as large, disc-shaped, brightly lit objects that flew through the sky. The UFOs were
    observed for a very brief period, often only a few seconds, before flying into the heavens. Although none of the
    individuals reported having any contact with the inhabitants of the ships, the UFO itself was always assumed to be a
    spaceship that was piloted by hyper-intelligent extraterrestrial beings. Steven (38), having never seen a UFO,
    said,</p>
  <p> They are smarter than we are though - smarter than any human. Kardiya think they are smart because they went to
    the moon but these aliens they travel all across the universe. While their descriptions of UFO sightings were
    similar, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people did possess divergent views regarding the intent of the aliens.
    Aboriginal people stated that the aliens' visits were for a purpose, whereas non-Aboriginal people, although aware
    of these explanations, tended to discount them. Warlpiri residents maintained that the alien's objective was to
    collect water. Six of the fourteen Aboriginal witnesses claimed that immediately after sighting the UFO, the water
    level in a neighbouring creek or rock hole was lowered. All six individuals stated that the aliens were responsible
    for the loss of water. None of these witnesses, however, claimed that they observed the aliens physically
    transferring the water onboard the spaceship. I was given a number of theories to explain the lack of visual
    evidence, such as 'beaming', using a giant tube, or absorbing water from the skin of the craft. In each case, the
    individuals believed that direct visual proof was neither necessary nor possible given the advanced technology that
    the aliens employed.</p>
  <p> The aliens were considered to frequent areas in which water sources were more prevalent. During the wet season
    when water sources increased, so too did the number of reported UFO sightings. Once the rains began each year,
    Warlpiri residents cautioned Aboriginal people from other regions as well as non-Aboriginal people not to drive at
    night, lest they encounter a UFO. A group of Aboriginal people from Darwin chose to spend the night along the road
    instead of driving to the community after the sun set. In the dry season, UFOs are also seen but often in areas with
    permanent water sources. South of the community lies a region known for its hills, which collect water in several
    rock pools. The number of encounters were higher here because, as Mark (33), a Warlpiri man, commented, 'the aliens
    want [water]. There is a lot of [water] in [the region]'. UFOs were usually portrayed as spaceships inhabited by
    beings in search of water, who were interested in little else. Plots to conquer the planet or to conduct medical
    experiments on humans were never discussed. The aliens were not thought to have a secret agreement with the
    government and conspiracy theories were also absent. Mark, like other Warlpiri people, did not express anger or
    resentment at the actions of the aliens. No one claimed that the aliens were taking a scarce resource to which they
    had no right and Aboriginal residents never indicated that they were in conflict with the aliens over the use of
    water. Although Aboriginal people reported feeling terror, fear, and panic at sighting large and brightly lit
    spaceships, and wished to avoid encountering them for this reason, I have never been told of a violent, injurious,
    or threatening encounter that any Aboriginal person had with a UFO. However, Warlpiri individuals asserted that the
    same was not true for non-Aboriginal people.</p>
  <p> After leaving the council office one afternoon, I was approached by Ronald (48), a yapa council employee, and
    asked if I had heard about Bill, a kardiya allied health provider that had visited the community a few days earlier.
    Allied health professionals such as Bill - dentists, ophthalmologists, and mental health specialists - visited the
    community on a sporadic basis and provided services that were not available locally. It was the wet season and Bill,
    anxious to leave before the rains damaged the road too severely, departed after only 36 hours. Ronald recounted that
    after his departure, no one in the community had received any communication from Bill. In an effort to confirm that
    Bill had returned safely, both his supervisor and the police had been contacted. Ronald reported that neither knew
    of Bill's whereabouts. This led Ronald, who had never sighted a UFO himself, to conclude that Bill had been
    abducted. He said, 'We told him not to go back at night but kardiya don't listen. Those aliens took him'. When I
    asked Ronald what the aliens would do with Bill, he replied that he did not know. What he was sure of, however, was
    that he would never see Bill again.</p>
  <p> The characteristics of Bill's disappearance were representative of many Warlpiri notions regarding alien
    abductions. Warlpiri people asserted that abductions occurred almost exclusively at night and were much more
    frequent during the wet season. Like popularised accounts, it was believed that abductees were seized against their
    will. 'Taken' was the word most used to describe alien abductions. However, yapa did not speculate on the fate of
    the victim. There were no tales of horrific medical procedures or examinations. Events on board the spaceship could
    not be determined because abductions were thought to be permanent. As in the case of Bill, abductees were not
    released or returned to earth. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of abductions was that the victims were always
    kardiya. James said,</p>
  <p> The aliens do nothing to us. But kardiya, maybe they are just travelling, maybe at night, and not thinking about
    anything then those aliens come and take them.</p>
  <p> Warlpiri people often warned non-Aboriginal residents and visitors that they were at risk of being abducted by the
    aliens. When I first arrived in the community during the middle of the wet season, I was told to avoid driving at
    night by at least ten different individuals. Short term visitors often ignored these warnings. After spending only
    two weeks in the community, a nurse reported that she did not believe that she was at risk and left the community in
    the evening. But some kardiya, who arrived in the community sceptical of Warlpiri claims, reassessed their views
    after several months of hearing tales of the aliens. Warren (37), said, 'I don't believe in UFOs. But after all
    these stories that I've been told, I do get a little nervous driving at night now'. A school teacher, Susan (31),
    stated that one evening while driving to town with several Warlpiri children, she was repeatedly asked if she was
    worried about being abducted. After returning safely to the community, Susan remarked that the constant inquiries
    had only served to make her nervous.</p>
  <p> Although Warlpiri people insisted that alien abductions were a reality, they also believed that it was possible
    for kardiya to obtain protection from the aliens. While driving at night during the wet season with a group of
    Aboriginal people, David assured me I was safe from abduction. He stated that the aliens would not take kardiya
    while they were travelling in a vehicle with yapa. Abductions only occurred when kardiya travelled<br> together or
    alone. David said, 'Don't worry. We will look after you'. When driving with another group of Aboriginal people at
    night, I was similarly told that yapa could 'protect' me from the aliens. Likewise, Ian (39), a medical researcher
    who resided in the community for three months, was also advised that by travelling with Aboriginal people he would
    be safe from abductions. There was no ritual involved in bestowing this protection; rather it was the presence of
    Aboriginal people that could guarantee the safety of non-Aboriginal individuals.</p>
  <p> Warlpiri people asserted that the aliens chose not to abduct yapa because Aboriginal people were recognised as
    belonging in the community and the land surrounding it. David said, 'They know us. This is our land'. Yapa who have
    had encounters with UFOs, such as Mark, expressed fear at seeing large brightly lit objects but did not state that
    they were concerned about being taken. Mark said that the aliens knew that this was 'his country' and therefore he
    would be safe. The aliens, he claimed, recognised that the Tanami Desert belonged to yapa. Alan (42) made a similar
    statement regarding the community. He stated that because the aliens had seen yapa 'sit down' in the community for
    so long, they were safe from abduction. Unlike popularised views, abductions were not motivated by the alien's need
    or desire to conduct experiments upon humans. Instead, non-Aboriginal people were viewed as recent arrivals, who the
    aliens did not 'know'. Kardiya were at risk because the aliens perceived them to be outsiders.</p>
  <h2> UFOs, Otherness, and Belonging</h2>
  <p> Many of the approaches taken by scholars examining popularised notions of UFOs - including the role of the media
    in disseminating beliefs, the similarities with local cosmological ideas,4 and the relevance of contemporary social
    relations - can also be applied to Aboriginal accounts. For instance, as in the United States, it is probable that
    media plays some role in shaping Warlpiri conceptions of UFOs. In Australia, most media portrayals of UFOs are
    produced in the United States and consequently reflect American concepts of extraterrestrials (Basterfield, 1997;
    Chalker, 1996). The almost ubiquitous presence of televisions, video, and DVD players ensures that popularised
    portrayals of UFOs and extraterrestrials permeate even geographically remote regions of the continent. At the time
    of research, television shows featuring storylines concerning UFOs, such as the X-Files and Stargate, were popular
    in the community. In addition to television, movies, such as Independence Day, could be obtained on either VHS or
    DVD and were often watched repeatedly, passed from family to family throughout the community.</p>
  <p> Geoffrey (46) noticed the similarity between media depictions of UFOs and Aboriginal narratives of sightings and
    abductions, commenting that the X-Files portrayed the everyday reality of many community residents. Nevertheless,
    some themes of popular narratives are not present in Warlpiri accounts, including government conspiracies, alien
    breeding projects, and the eventual but traumatised return of abductees. Examining Warlpiri responses to mass media
    has led Michaels (1990, p. 22) to note, people's readings of media are based as much on their lived experience,
    historical circumstances and cultural perspectives than any inherent instructions in the text itself on how
    something ought to be interpreted.</p>
  <p> Television programs and feature films might have exposed Aboriginal people to popularised notions of UFOs, but
    Warlpiri understandings regarding the aliens are not constrained by these depictions.</p>
  <p> Warlpiri descriptions of UFOs, while perhaps taking a cue from Hollywood, also echo themes present in local
    cosmology. For instance, warnayarra, giant multi-coloured snakes that are often referred to as rainbow serpents in
    anthropological literature, are also linked to water and water sources (Buchler &amp; Maddock, 1978; Merlan, 2000;
    Munn 1973; Poirier, 2005; Radcliffe-Brown, 1926; Rose, 1992). Warnayarra are thought to reside in rivers, water
    holes, underground soaks, rain clouds, and seasonal creeks, their presence tangibly signalled by water. One year,
    when the water level in the creek dropped suddenly, John (52) asserted that this was due to the warnayarra moving
    underground. Michael (29), a tradesman's assistant, disagreed, 'It was not the warnayarra, it was the aliens. Last
    night a big spaceship flew over'. Michael, like all of the other Aboriginal people with whom I spoke, did not claim
    that the warnayarra in the creek would have either injured, or been injured by, the aliens. Warnayarra and aliens
    were spoken of as two different beings, albeit similar in some ways, which could co-exist without conflict.
    Warnayarra, like UFOs, are also capable of recognising and harming individuals. Alan recounted an episode when he
    and his son, Ben, were visiting a water hole:</p>
  <p> That warnayarra is strong but it knows us - knows that this is our country. I brought Ben to that place and that
    warnayarra came up and wrapped around him. It recognized Ben and then went back into the water without hurting
    him.</p>
  <p> Had the warnayarra not recognised Ben, he would have been harmed. Similarly, Maisy (48) stated that the warnayarra
    in the creek was capable of killing children that it did not identify as living in the community. As Merlan (2000,
    p. 13) notes, a rainbow serpent is 'a native of place that responds angrily to foreign intrusion'. Safety from
    dangerous forces, such as warnayarra and ancestral spirits, is one way in which ownership of land is both asserted
    and demonstrated.5 As Alan noted, it was his 'country'. However, if an individual does not regularly visit or 'look
    after' land, warnayarra are capable of causing harm even to traditional owners (Poirier 2005, p. 132). Consequently,
    rights to land must be maintained or they are in danger of being contested or lost.</p>
  <p> Affiliation through country can act as an objectification of kin networks and a record of social ties (Myers,
    1986, p. 128). In this way, 'country' can be a source of identity, distinguishing differing claims to land but
    connecting individuals through these bonds. For instance, individuals recognised as traditional owners could
    guarantee the safety of their guests by placing a small amount of water on the head of a visitor and then speaking
    to the warnayarra. I was 'introduced' to warnayarra on a number of occasions in this manner. Myers (1986, p. 156)
    comments that this act of bestowing protection also acknowledges the dependency that a visitor has on his or her
    sponsor. Through beings such as warnayarra, rights to country are politically argued for and legitimised.</p>
  <p> Narratives of alien abductions appear to echo many of the themes found in tales regarding traditional owners and
    their safety from warnayarra and noumenal forces. For instance, Warlpiri people asserted that the aliens 'know'
    yapa. David, Mark, and Alan each stressed that the aliens recognised that both the community and the Tanami desert
    was the domain of Aboriginal people. While Mark declared that he would not be abducted by UFOs because it was 'his
    country', Alan asserted the warnayarra did not harm his son for the same reason. Abductees were individuals who were
    identified by the aliens as strangers to either the community or in the Tanami Desert. Like warnayarra, the aliens
    are capable of responding aggressively to foreigners but it was also possible to obtain protection from the aliens.
    Only those who were acknowledged by the aliens as belonging were able to ensure safety from abductions.
    Consequently, it would appear as if the aliens recognise traditional ownership.</p>
  <p> But unlike narratives regarding warnayarra and noumenal beings, which distinguish traditional owners by their
    family, site of conception, or their place of residence, abduction tales focus exclusively on race. The pervasive
    division in the community between kardiya and yapa that encompasses social networks, spaces, resources,
    technologies, education, traditions, and healing options was also a fundamental feature in UFO narratives. The only
    identity that the aliens seem to functionally acknowledge in humans was that of kardiya and yapa. Consequently,
    differences among Warlpiri people are disregarded, creating a single identity for all yapa. This category is then
    contrasted with that of kardiya. While yapa, as traditional owners, are safe from alien abduction, kardiya, as
    foreigners, are not. Social categories that existed in the community are reproduced by the actions of the aliens,
    stressing and encouraging ties of affiliation within these groups.</p>
  <p> Themes of belonging, protection, and traditional ownership can all be present in narratives regarding warnayarra
    and ancestral beings, but it is only through tales of the aliens that non-Aboriginal people are routinely
    incorporated into this cosmological system. Whereas non-Aboriginal people rarely endorse beliefs regarding
    warnayarra, this is not true of the aliens. Stories, including reports of sightings or that of Bill's abduction, are
    often conveyed to non-Aboriginal residents of the community, who generally engage in these discussions and share
    their own experiences. While often considered to be immune from the intervention of warnayarra or spirit beings,
    kardiya are nevertheless victims of abductions and cautioned by yapa to avoid driving at night in the wet season.
    UFOs provide a discourse through which social relations can be represented because ideas of UFOs are shared by both
    Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal residents. Television and movies exposed Aboriginal, non-Aboriginal, urban, and rural
    individuals alike to ideas of extraterrestrials. Consequently, the aliens are able to not only integrate
    non-Aboriginal people into Warlpiri models of belonging but do so publicly, by encouraging the participation of
    kardiya in discussions of sightings and abductions.</p>
  <p> By combining notions of extraterrestrials, racial categories, and traditional ownership, alien abductions tangibly
    and publicly address issues of indigenous identity. Because of their extraterrestrial origin and superior
    intelligence, the aliens do not appear to be bound by our historical or cultural perspectives, yet they recognise
    Aboriginal people as having a distinct identity and an enduring claim to land. The status of Aboriginal people is
    also reinforced through their ability to guarantee the safety of non-Aboriginal people from<br> alien abductions.
    The capacity of yapa to bestow protection upon kardiya, suggests that in some realms the latter is dependant upon
    the former. Abduction narratives not only emphasise racial affiliation, they also delineate the relationship between
    these two groups. The actions of the aliens provide a powerful and unique validation of Aboriginal identity. Through
    elements of popular UFO myth, local cosmological themes, and the division between yapa and kardiya, alien abduction
    narratives are able to present an Aboriginal identity that is differentiated from non-Aboriginal identity, linked to
    belonging and continued ownership of land, and validated by hyper-intelligent beings from outer space.</p>
  <p> While alien abductions are one way in which the value of Aboriginality is demonstrated through the interplay of
    popular ideas and Aboriginal worldviews, this also occurs throughout other realms of community narrative. For
    instance, Warlpiri residents often praised yapa foods that were hunted or gathered from the bush as healthier than
    kardiya foods. Kevin said, '[Kangaroo] fat is good, makes you strong, not like that fat from kardiya [meat]. Doctors
    know this too. It's a proven fact'. Similarly, wild yapa honey was said to cure diabetes, whereas kardiya sugar
    caused it. Consequently, many residents and health researchers (O'Dea 1983, 1985) have asserted that by following a
    traditional lifestyle of hunting and gathering, Aboriginal health could be significantly improved. Strength and
    health is directly attributed to a life spent living on traditional lands and eating bush foods. Like statements
    regarding UFOs, Aboriginal food narratives appear to naturalise the division between yapa and kardiya and portray
    the former as beneficial while using a concept - a medically nutritious diet - initially introduced by the latter
    (Saethre, 2005).</p>
  <p> Because UFO beliefs are only one example of how difference is presented and legitimated, an examination of
    Warlpiri understandings of extraterrestrials raises issues that are relevant to wider narratives within the
    community, particularly those that employ science or science-related concepts. Writing about the United States, Dean
    (1997, p. 56) states,</p>
  <p> To be comprehensible to governmental and scientific authorities, UFO talk relied on their languages and logics,
    even as it remained alien to, incomprehensible in terms of, these languages and logics.</p>
  <p> I believe that a similar process is at work in Central Australia, where the value of Aboriginality can be
    demonstrated through an appeal to science and medicine. Unlike statements that rely upon cosmology, Warlpiri
    assertions that appear to be based in science are widely accepted by non-Aboriginal people. Mimicking a scientific
    paradigm, these narratives nevertheless incorporate Aboriginal concerns and perspectives. Consequently, Warlpiri
    people are able to participate in global and national discourse, while asserting and maintaining an exclusive
    identity.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2> Conclusion</h2>
  <p> In Central Australia, the aliens can address concerns regarding identity but in a way that reflects the current
    environment of Aboriginal communities. In a contemporary urban context, extraterrestrials are considered to
    represent a threat to human culture and society. Through a traumatic interaction with otherness, fears of cultural
    dilution and invasion are expressed. But in Central Australia, Aboriginal people have a contrasting experience of
    aliens. Like nomadic Warlpiri people, the aliens seek water. Like warnayarra, the aliens can be blamed for the
    depletion of water and are able to recognise and harm outsiders. Consequently, Warlpiri narratives do not cast the
    aliens as fundamentally different from other beings that inhabit the desert. Furthermore, because Aboriginal people
    are protected from abductions, encounters with the aliens are not aggressive. For an Aboriginal person, sighting a
    UFO does not seem to represent a hostile encounter with otherness. Instead of epitomising insecurity, anxiety, or
    alienation, the aliens demonstrate Warlpiri security, assurance, and belonging. UFOs in America might be symbols of
    hidden conspiracies, painful alien examinations, and colonising extraterrestrials, but in Central Australia the
    aliens become capable of validating the claims and cosmology of indigenous people in the face of settlement.</p>
  <p> As in the community, many indigenous UFO narratives in the United States, Oceania, and Africa repeatedly link
    local cosmological entities to UFOs without being significantly altered. In many cases, traditional supernatural
    beings are considered to be extraterrestrials, thereby stressing an ancient and abiding connection with UFOs. It is
    claimed that the phenomenon is the same, it is only the language - Star People or UFOs - that is different. For
    instance, in South Africa, Credo Mutwa states that beings such as tokoloshe, baboon-like witch familiars, are
    actually a species of extraterrestrial (Mack, 1999; Martin, 1999). Mack (1999, p. 32) comments that indigenous
    people are 'usually pleased' to discuss UFOs because it is a way of 'affirming tribal myths, legends and
    experiences'. It seems as if extraterrestrials could be a way through which indigenous minorities are able to
    integrate local cosmologies into a global discourse, thereby transforming what non-indigenous people previously
    viewed as superstition into an encounter with superhuman beings that are acknowledged by UFO enthusiasts around the
    world. As a result, UFOs might be able to recast and re-imagine the role, status, and identity of indigenous peoples
    in a rapidly globalising world.</p></section>

  2. I have use pseudonyms throughout this article and also included the age, when possible, of each individual.<br> 3.
  I was aware of only five Aboriginal residents who claimed that UFOs did not exist. These individuals, ranging in age
  from 25 to 53, did not offer an alternative explanation for UFO sightings, such as a ghost, shooting star, or
  aircraft. John simply told me that the pervasive talk of aliens in the community was 'rubbish'.<br> 4. Examples
  include comparisons between UFOs and angels (Saler et al., 1997, p. 71; Saliba, 1995, p. 36; Thompson, 1991), between
  space and heaven (Saler et al., 1997, p.<br> 141), between Men in Black and the devil (Rojcewicz, 1987), abductions to
  initiation or rites of passage (Bullard, 1989, p. 162), aliens and demons (Partridge, 2004; Saliba, 1995, p. 36), and
  UFO phenomenon and fairies (Purkiss, 2000, p. 317-22; Silver, 1999; Thompson, 1991; Vall�e, 1969).<br> 5. For more
