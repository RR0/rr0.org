<p class="abstract">"Ockham's Razor" is a methodological principle, due to the medieval philosopher<a
    href="/people/o/OckhamGuillaume/index.html"> William of Ockham</a>, who mainly opposed an unjustified creation of
  new terms in philosophy. Since this principle and its later versions are frequently quoted in discussions about
  anomalies, it will be discussed here in some detail. After a short look at the historic roots, the principal modern
  formulations are summarized. It will be shown that a demand for "simplicity" cannot be generally sustained. Rather,
  striving for simplicity can conflict with other essentials of scientific method. Ockham's principle-no matter whether
  in its original or in a modified version--cannot help toward a rational decision between competing explanations of the
  same empirical facts. An incorrect use of Ockham's Razor only leads to a perpetuation and corroboration of existing
  prejudice, and this principle should not be used to easily get rid of unwelcome data or concepts.</p>

<h2> Misinterpretation of Empirical Facts-a Recurrent Pattern</h2>
<p> In discussions about the existence or non-existence of classes of controversial phenomena, about a correct
  interpretation of empirical data, but also about the adequacy of terms newly created for purposes of explanation, a
  principle is persistently quoted which is generally known as "Ockham's Razor". In the following, after a short glimpse
  at the historic roots, the scope and the limitations of this principle, particularly in its modern guise, will be
  explored.</p>
<p>Among the many dysfunctions of science, one specific pattern will be scrutinized in more detail. A significant
  proportion of the errors and misunderstandings in the history of science—until very recent times—can be understood as
  <strong><em>misinterpretations of empirical facts</em></strong>, in two possible ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The erroneous acceptance of phenomena (e.g., N-rays, polywater, Piltdown man).</li>
  <li> The unjustified rejection of phenomena (e.g., meteorites, ball lightning, continental drift, reverse
    transcriptase).</li>
</ul>
<h2> Ockham's Principle-Original and Revised Versions</h2>
<p> William of Ockham (about 1280-1349) is deemed one of the most important philosophers of the 14th century. <em>Ockham's
  Razor</em> is a "<q>methodological principle, particularly in the context of ontological issues, according to which
  philosophy and science should assume as few theoretical entities as possible for purposes of explanation, explication,
  definition, etc.</q>" <span class="source">Gethmann, C. F. (2004). Ockham's razor. In MittelstraO (Ed.), Enzyklopadie Philosophie und Wissenschaftstheorie (Vol. 2) (pp. 1063-1064). Metzler.</span>.
  It appears in two versions: "Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate" and "Frustra fit per plura, quod potest
  fieri per pauciora&quot;; the frequently cited form "Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem (sine
  necessitate)" (entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity) does not occur in Ockham <span class="source">Schwemmer, 0. (2004): "Ockham", in Mittelstral3 (Ed.), <em>Enzyklopadie Philosophie und Wissenschaftstheorie</em>  (vol. 2), pp. 1057-1063. Metzler.</span>
  <span class="source">Thorbum, W. M. (1918). The myth of Ockham's razor. Mind, 27, 345-353.</span>.</p>
<p> The original meaning of this principle can be understood only in the context of the philosophical and theological
  debates of that time, especially on the "problem of universals". Above all, Ockham opposes pseudo-explanatory or
  otherwise meaningless and superfluous terms. But a clear view of the authentic intention is blocked by later
  modifications and re-interpretations not consonant with the primary source. Essentially three basic patterns of the
  later versions can be identified, which of course partially overlap:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The <em>principle of parsimony</em> comes closest to the original version by demanding cautious discretion before
    creating new terms and concepts.</li>
  <li> The <em>principle of simplicity</em> (economy of thinking, according to Ernst Mach) aims at explanations,
    reasons, theories, etc., which should be as simple as possible.<br/>
  </li>
  <li>Closely related with the latter is the demand for an <em>exclusion of unnecessary additional hypotheses</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Simple or Suffkient Systems of Terms?</h2>
<p> Already in Ockham's lifetime, his fellow in the Franciscan order, Walter of Chatton, voiced contradiction: "If three
  things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things, a fourth must be added, and so on". Later,
  other authors in a similar manner advocated a "principle of plenitude" <span class="source">Maurer, A. (1984). Ockham's razor and Chatton's anti-razor. Mediaeval Studies, 46, 463475.</span>.
  The mathematician Karl Menger <span class="source">Menger, K. (1960). A counterpart of Ockham's razor in pure and applied mathematics. Synthese, 12, 415428.</span>
  formulates a "law against miserliness" and demonstrates that occasionally too many different concepts are united under
  one single term (e.g., "variable").</p>
<p> The demand for a functional, sufficiently differentiated system of terms is now generally accepted, as well as the
  warning against neologisms "beyond a necessary scale". Stupidities in terminology sometimes occur as a "show
  vocabulary" within new fields of science struggling for recognition, and as ingroup slang motivated by group dynamics
  and not scientific logic. Still unresolved, however, are concepts like "simpler theory" and "unnecessary additional
  hypothesis".</p>
<h2> The Myth of Simplicity</h2>
<h3> The Scientist and the "Unknown Unknown"</h3>
<p> Normally, an explanation becomes necessary when a surprising and unexpected phenomenon is observed, and an
  explanation has to do away with this element of surprise <span class="source">Kim, J. (1967). Explanation in science. In Edwards (Ed.), The Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Vol. 3) (pp. 159-163). Macmillan, p. 162</span>
  Bauer <span class="source">Bauer, H. H. (1992). Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method. University of Illinois Press., pp. 74-76</span>
  disputes the common view that scientists are open-minded and strive for new cognition and insight. By way of contrast,
  he states that open-mindedness for the new exists only so long as the new things are <em>not too new</em>. Bauer makes
  a distinction between the "known unknown" which can be derived from secured knowledge (and hence is suitable for
  research proposals), and the "unknown unknown" that cannot be expected on the basis of the state of knowledge. Based
  upon psychological experience, Krelle <span class="source">Krelle, W. (1968). Praferenz- und Entscheidungstheorie. Tiibingen: Mohr. pp. 344-347</span>
  characterizes a limitation to the human capacity of information processing under the term "<q>conservative
    distortion</q>". Particular and deviant features are perceived insufficiently, and "<q>valuations accepted
    before</q>" are maintained.</p>
<p> So it becomes understandable why the existence of meteorites and ball lightnings originally was rejected. The
  scepticism against reports supplied by laymen <span class="source">Westrum, R. (1978): "Science and social intelligence about anomalies: the case of meteorites",  <em>Social
  Studies of Science</em>, n° 8, pp. 461-493.</span> induced a persistent deterioration of the faculty of judgement,
  such that even substantiated evidence and experts' reports-actual specimens of meteorites and chemical analyses-were
  dismissed under the same prejudice. Being accustomed to categorize phenomena within the usual conceptual and
  explanatory schemes, scientists easily run the risk of a <em>reductionist trap</em>, finally being content with such a
  sloppy categorization, however wrong it may be.</p>
<p>As victims of this characteristic mechanism, scientists have acted dramatically against their own interests. We find
  the recurrent pattern of the "discovery before the discovery". At least three renowned chemists produced oxygen before
  Lavoisier, but erroneously classified it as some well-known gas. In at least 17 cases a new celestial object was
  reported before it was finally recognized as a new planet (Uranus), and similar errors happened before the "definitive
  discovery" of the planet Neptune and of X-rays <span class="source">Kuhn, T. S. (1962). Historical structure of scientific discovery. Science, 136, 760-764.</span>.
  In 1995, two American astronomers made observations suggestive of a planet outside our solar system, but did not
  further pursue their discovery. So other astronomers could be the first to publish their independent discovery and
  claim to have identified the first extrasolar planet <span class="source">Schneider, R. U. (1997): Planetenjager. Die aufregende Entdeckung fremder Welten. Basel: Birkhauser.</span>.
</p>
<h3> Nearness Distortion-a Characteristic Pattern of Misunderstanding</h3>
<p> When trying to interpret a phenomenon, humans are always at risk of "falling short", of adopting explanations close
  to their individual range of prior experience. This can be documented by a series of episodes from history.</p>
<p> Galilei categorically opposed the idea that the tides have something to do with the moon (gravitational theory of
  tides) and tried to develop his own, purely terrestrial, theory instead <span class="source">Harris, H. S (1967): "Italian philosophy", In Edwards (Ed.), <em>The Encyclopedia of Philosophy </em>(Vol. 4) (pp. 225-234). Macmillan, p. 228</span>.
  An explanation was highly desired also in the meteorite controversy. The true debate began in 1794 when the German
  physicist Chladni published a small book advocating the reality of meteorites, and in the same year a widely
  publicized observation took place in Siena, Italy. But Chladni and all other advocates of the reality of meteorites
  were under permanent attack. Even scholars who were up to the standards of their time tried to contrive explanations
  to circumvent the idea that material can fall from the sky, e.g., meteorites "<q>were caused by the ignition of long
    trains of gas in the atmosphere</q>" or by "<q>hurricanes and volcanic explosions</q>" (Westrum, 1978).</p>
<p> The "Nordlinger Ries" is a singular geological formation in Bavaria (Southern Germany). In our modern understanding
  it is an impact crater, nearly circular, with a diameter of about 24 kilometers. For a long time the problem of its
  origin had puzzled the experts. For this puzzle, too, a lot of possible terrestrial interpretations were thought up,
  e.g., a volcano that had meanwhile disappeared, an "explosion hypothesis", a "glacier-grinding theory", etc. Only
  after 1960 was the impact of a cosmic object ("meteorite theoryv)-the now generally accepted theory-seriously
  discussed <span class="source">Dehm, R. (1969): "Geschichte der Riesforschung", <em> Geologica Bavarica</em>, n° 61, pp. 25-35</span>.
</p>
<p> This recurrent type of misinterpretation can be dubbed nearness distortion. As a matter of symmetry, there is also a
  trend towards "far-fetched reasons", particularly in some groups that are inclined to quickly assume extraterrestrial
  or subterranean origins.</p>
<h3> In Search of a Simplicity Criterion</h3>
<p> The symmetrical terms "simplicity" and "complexity" are perspective notions: their meaning in a single case
  depends-beyond the well-known context dependence of any word meaning-on the context of application and the user's
  prior understanding <span class="source">Gernert, D. (2000): "Towards a closed description of observation processes", <em>BioSystems</em>, n° 54, pp. 165-180.</span>.
  For the present purpose, a comparative measure would suffice that marks one of two possible explanations of an
  empirical fact as the "simpler" one. But even such a comparative measure is feasible only in limited contexts within a
  formal science (e.g., comparing two formulas of a logic calculus); a measure of complexity will immediately provoke
  reservations as soon as relationships with empirical data come into play.</p>
<p> The degree of simplicity of a curve equation can be defined by the number of free parameters: a circle in the plane
  gets the measure 3, and an ellipse gets the number 5. On the basis of simplicity we would have to prefer the circular
  planetary orbits of Copernicus to Kepler's ellipses. Simplicity and precision are conflicting demands. Furthermore, a
  measure of simplicity depends upon a predefined scheme. In a task of curve fitting, given a set of measurement points,
  a reasonable curve is to be determined. If a fixed task requires, in a first step, to express such a curve by a
  polynomial, whereas in a second step also sin (x), log (x), etc., will be permitted, then the latter representation
  will be "simpler", but at the price of more complex means of expression. On the other hand, the simplest

  answer-maybe a straight or slightly curved line-is not always useful: for the quantum Hall effect, just the extrema of
  the curve are relevant. The theory of complexity is not helpful here. In the literature we find various definitions of
  "complexity", each of which is tailored to a specific application; each of them is related to its specific class of
  formally defined constructs, like algorithms or series of signs.</p>
<p> The problem of deciding between competing explanations for empirical facts cannot be solved by formal tools. Can a
  neutral procedure be imagined, to assess the issue of ball lightning, still controversial some decades ago: Is ball
  lightning real, or are the reports by laymen altogether based upon deception?</p>
<p> In an extensive monograph, Mario Bunge <span class="source">Bunge, M. (1963): <em>The Myth of Simplicity</em>, Prentice-Hall.</span>
  reveals the divers shortcomings and limitations of a principle of simplicity. In detail he demonstrates that a demand
  for simplicity (in any of its facets) will conflict with other essentials of science (as exemplified above by a
  conflict between simplicity and precision). Finally he speaks of a "cult" or "myth of simplicity". With respect to
  Ockham's Razor, Bunge recommends caution: "<q>In science, as in the barber shop, better alive and bearded than cleanly
    shaven but dead</q>" (p. 115).</p>
<h3> What Ockham's Principle Cannot Accomplish</h3>
<p> The principle of simplicity, no matter in which version, does not make a contribution to the selection of theories.
  Beyond trivial cases, the term"simplicity'' remains a subjective term. What is compatible with somebody's own
  pre-existing world-view, will be considered simple, clear, logical, and ~ evident, whereas what is contradicting that
  world-view will quickly be rejected as an unnecessarily complex explanation and a senseless additional hypothesis. In
  this way, the principle of simplicity becomes a <em>mirror of prejudice</em>, and, still worse, a distorting mirror,
  since this origin is camouflaged.</p>
<p> As an example, an advocate of the geocentric system could argue: some easiness in the calculation of planetary
  orbits is irrelevant, because we are not obliged to adapt our world system to the mathematicians' wishes for comfort,
  and the hypothesis of a moving Earth is an unnecessary—and adventurous—additional hypothesis, not at all supported by
  any sensual perception.</p>
<p> Walach and Schmidt <span class="source">Walach, H., &amp; Schmidt, S. (2005). Repairing Plato's life boat with Ockham's razor. Journal of Consciousness Studies, 12(2), 52-70.</span>
  propose to complement Ockham's Razor by "Plato's lifeboat". This principle, with its origin in the Platonic Academy,
  claims that a theory must be comprehensive enough "to save the phenomena&quot;; this was triggered by observed
  anomalies in planetary motion.</p>
<p> Our world is more multi-faceted than some people may imagine. The critical point is not only the frequently cited
  "more things in heaven and earth", but simply the adequate explanation of material at hand. Further misinterpretations
  are certain to come. But the principle of that honourable mediaeval philosopher should not be misused as a secret
  weapon destined to smuggle prejudice into the discussion and to easily dismiss unwelcome concepts. </p>
