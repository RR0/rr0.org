  "summary": "A new, revised edition of this classic book on suppressed technology: the early \"flying saucer\" technology of Nazi Germany and the genesis of man-made UFOs. While the government wants you to think that aliens are crashing their ships and buzzing military bases--this book presents the overwhelming evidence that most \"nuts and bolts\" UFOs are made on earth and piloted by earthlings. This important book takes us from the work of captured German scientists and escaped battalions of Germans who formed secret communities in South America and Antarctica, to today's state-of-the-art \"Dreamland\" flying machines. Heavily illustrated, this astonishing book blows the lid off the \"government UFO conspiracy\" and explains with detailed diagrams the technology involved. Examined in detail are secret underground airfields and factories; German secret weapons; \"suction\" aircraft; the origin of NASA; gyroscopic stabilizers and engines; the secret Marconi aircraft factory in South America; and more. Chapters include: June 24, 1947: A Day to Remember; A Bit of Science Fiction; The True Story of Project Blue Book; Mysterious Night Lights Over the Rhineland; Revolutionary German Anti-Aircraft Weaponry; The Advent of \"Suction Aircraft\"; A Time of Spectacular Possibilities; Nothing to Give in Exchange; How To Do the Impossible; Marconi's Secret Saucer Base; more. Hundreds of cool illustrations",
