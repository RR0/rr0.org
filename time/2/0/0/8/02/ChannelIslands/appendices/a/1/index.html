<p>The text of the MOR quoted below was enclosed with a reply dated May 10, 2007, from Sarah Doherty, Head of Safety
  Data Unit, CAA, responsive to an inquiry dated April 26, 2007. (Courtesy of Kim Efishoff, NARCAP) </p>
<p>A/C Type : BN2a Trislander <br> Flight Phase : Cruise <br> Classification : Occurrences <br> Occurrence Number :
  200703486 <br> Occurrence Date : 23 Apr 2007 <br> Location : Alderney <br> Location Info : 10NNE <br> Events :
  Miscellaneous Non-AD Occurrence </p>
<p>Pretitle : <br> BN2T crew observed a stationary bright light ahead, thought to be a reflection from the ground.
  However, crew viewed the light through binoculars and observed a shape, similar to a B737 fuselage. </p>
<p>Precis : <br> The crew contacted ATC, who originally stated that there wasn't anything showing on radar. However,
  they then observed a primary contact. The crew and some passengers observed the bright lights again later in the
  flight. The shape was said to be bright yellow with a dark area nearer to one end. </p>
<p>Number of Records : 1 </p>
<p>CAA refused direct requests for access to other pilot or ATC documents forming part of the MOR submission. These
  were pursued instead via the route of Freedom of Information Requests to the Ministry of Defence.</p>
