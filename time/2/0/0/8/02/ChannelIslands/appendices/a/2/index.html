<p>A number of requests are known to have been made to MoD under the provisions of the UK Freedom of Information Act by
  various individuals, including two of the present co-authors. No satisfactory direct reply was received to any
  request, up to and including this one lodged by us on 15 May 2007: </p>
<p>I would like to request copies of the pilot report document and any associated materials filed with CAA under the
  Mandatory Occurrence Report system, (Occurrence Number 200703486; Occurrence Date 23 Apr 2007; Location Alderney;
  pilot Capt. Bowyer, Aurigny), also any other report(s) or record(s) and associated materials from any other aircrew,
  Air Traffic Control facility or other radar installation connected with the incident. </p>
<p>However a few days later in view of wide interest in the case MoD decided to publish a redacted case file on the
  internet, thereby responding to all FOIA requests indirectly.</p>
