  <li><strong>Position of own a/c. <br> </strong>5NM north-west of Sark </li>
  <li><strong> Speed of own a/c. <br> </strong> Approx. 230 KTS indicated <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> Heading of own a/c. <br> </strong> ~ 170 degrees <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> Altitude of own a/c, and whether in level flight/ascending/descending. <br> </strong> Altitude 3,500'
    descending <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> Time of sighting. <br> </strong> 1415Z <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> Apparent relative altitude of sighted phenomenon. <br> </strong> Estimated 2,000' below <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> Duration and nature of observation (ie, was it a couple of snatched glances over his shoulder, or
    something more substantial?). <br> </strong> I looked several times, total duration about one minute <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> Any apparent motion of observed phenomenon. <br> </strong> No apparent motion <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Description of phenomenon - regular/irregular form, variations in shading, colour, single or multiple
    phenomenon/a, alignment if multiple, impression of depth. <br> </strong>Possibly oblong/oval, yellow/beige colour,
    little definition due to haze, little depth <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> Knowledge of other witnesses other than those in Bowyer's company. <br> </strong> FO aware of ATC request
    but unable to view due to position in cockpit <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> Recollection of weather conditions. <br> </strong> Hazy but smooth, no significant weather. <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> Was the horizon clearly discernable despite any haze/cloud? <br> </strong> No <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> If so, what was the elevation of the phenomenon in relation to the horizon (i.e. how far above or below,
    in angular measure and/or in terms of some distance at arm's length) <br> </strong> [n/a] <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> Was the island of Alderney clearly visible in the haze? <br> </strong> Just visible in outline <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> Where was the object in relation to Alderney (i.e., angular measure or distance at arm's length) <br>
  </strong> ~ 2NM west of Alderney by appearance <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> What was the apparent size of the object, i.e. length compared to Alderney and/or angular measure or
    width at arm's length? <br> </strong> ~1/2 NM max <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> Was the object a) sharply-defined in outline, b) like a well-defined cloud, c) like a fuzzy cloud, d)
    just a hazy patch? <br> </strong> Hazy patch <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> To what other familiar object or phenomenon would he most nearly compare it? <br> </strong> [no answer]
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> To what familiar object or surface would you compare the "yellow- beige" colouration? <br> </strong>
    About the same as a yellow Aurigny Trislander would look in the same position and distance although object seemed
    larger <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> During the sighting did the object maintain the same position, or change position, in relation to a) the
    horizon and b)Alderney? <br> </strong> No change in position relative to either but ultimately lost from view <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> Could you see the island of Burhou at the time? <br> </strong> Yes <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Do you have any suggestion as to why the object was not visible when he was passing Guernsey at about FL70
    - 65 when first asked to look, saying you could see "nothing in that position at all, I can't see anything" at
    1413:13, but was visible a couple of minutes later when down to about FL40? <br> </strong> No explanation <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> Would you describe the brightness and colouration of the object as due to reflected light or emitted
    light? <br> </strong> Reflected <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Can you compare the colour, brightness and shape of the object with that of any other familiar object or
    effect seen that day or during a typical flight? <br> </strong>Only a yellow Aurigny Trislander seen through haze
    although size would of course not match <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong> Do you have any opinion or ideas as to the most likely origin/source of the phenomenon you observed that
    day? <br> </strong> Atmospheric</li>
