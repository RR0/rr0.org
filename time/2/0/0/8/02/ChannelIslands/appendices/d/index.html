<p>The clean nature of the beam-0 images was noted, specifically the absence of sea return. Some weather radars (e.g.
  the NEXRAD WSR-88D) operate with reduced sensitivity in certain modes, but inquiries confirmed that there is no other
  scan mode available in this case, the sensitivity being comparable in practice to the NEXRAD clear-air mode. Clutter
  removal is understood to be limited to the synthetic beam-S images. The fact that much of the beam-0 echo clearly
  corresponds to echo from island and coastal features <span class="note">   On each of the scans the echo appears to be displaced by several kilometres in relation to the geographical map
  overlay.  The reason for this is unknown, but a similar displacement (though even larger) is noted by Rico-Ramirez,
  Cluckie &amp; Shepherd (next note) in studies using Jersey weather radar images. No attempt has been made to correct
this.</span>, the very features that would be on any permanent clutter map, seems to confirm this. So we think we are
  seeing all the data there are, without software manipulation, and that the images represent the actual clutter
  conditions of interest for our investigation <span class="note">    If we were seeing higher-elevation data that have been inserted to mitigate clutter in permanent clutter areas
  then we would expect to find a closely similar echo distribution on a higher elevation cut. But droplets or ice crystals
  in suspension aloft and yet closely matching the surface clutter distribution would be meteorologically un likely, and
in fact none of the higher cuts shows the same pattern or intensity of echo.</span>. </p>
<p> A minimal amount of sea return on the beam-0 cut might be consistent with the absence of severe radar
  super-refractivity. Variable weather factors determine wave slope and orientation and thereby the intensity of sea
  return. We learned from Tony Pallot that sea return is rarely very significant on the Jersey radar, perhaps indicating
  typically small wave heights and swell amplitudes due to the sheltering effect of the Brittany peninsula and a short
  southerly wind fetch. </p>
<p> To check conditions on the day, records of the local sea state were sought. The Channel Islands Shipping Forecast
  issued by Jersey Met Office at noon, 23 April 2007 (Appendix C) gives the sea state as "smooth or slight&rdquo; with
  no significant swell. This corresponds to World Meteorological Organisation code 2 or 3, defined as "smooth (wavelets)
  0.1 to 0.5 m&rdquo; or "slight 0.5 to 1.25 m&rdquo;
  (codes 0 &amp; 1 are "calm, glassy&rdquo; and "calm, rippled&rdquo;). </p>

<p>This forecast was confirmed by values from the Jersey Fisheries wave meter, a waverider buoy situated approximately 6
  miles off Corbiere, SW Jersey. As shown in Table 1, the maximum wave height at 1400Z was measured at 1.28m with a
  period of 6.7 sec. This corresponds to a very shallow wave slope in the order of only one or two degrees and very
  little radar backscatter. </p>
<p> So absence of sea return is not probative evidence. However the absence of any return from the island of Alderney
  offers a possible independent test. We know that many parts of nearby coasts and islands are detectable above the
  radar horizon on beam-0, so two avenues were explored to determine the significance of the absence of echoes returned
  by Alderney. Evidence was sought regarding the past frequency of detection of echoes from Alderney, and the local
  radar horizon in standard propagation conditions <span class="note">    Propagation of radar waves is determined by the vertical structure of the atmosphere. The typical pressure,
  temperature and humidity gradients of the "standard&rdquo; atmosphere result in a downward refraction. This has the effect
  of making the distance to the radar horizon greater than the normal optical horizon. When the vertical pressure,
  temperature and humidity gradients are non-standard, effects analogous to optical mirage can occur. Super-refraction
  (greater than normal downward bending) expands the radar horizon still further; sub-refraction (upward bending)
contracts the radar horizon.</span> was compared with the range and elevation AMSL of the island. </p>
<p> The typical frequency of detectability of Alderney was estimated from two sources: Anecdotal evidence from
  experienced users and a published study of accumulated rainfall measurements using the Jersey weather radar. </p>
<p> Tony Pallot was not surprised by the absence of echo from Alderney, suggesting that its low elevation was probably
  below the radar horizon. According to his recollection Alderney was almost never detected, even in strongly
  anticyclonic conditions when AP due to severe temperature inversion "occasionally&rdquo; shows Guernsey and the French
  mainland. However the beam-0 scans on the subject date (and to a lesser extent higher elevation scans as well) clearly
  do show echo from Guernsey, and from the French mainland as well, even though the meteorological conditions appear not
  to suggest severe AP conditions on April 23 (Section 5). Indeed Tony Pallot's own opinion was that negligible radar AP
  was likely. So this merited further investigation. </p>
<p> The height AMSL of the Jersey weather radar was determined to be 84.2m (276 ft) at the antenna boresight. The
  horizon distance d to which a sea-level reflector would be detectable by centimetric radar in normal propagation
  conditions, neglecting topographical masking, is given approximately by </p>
<p> d(nmi) =1.23&radic;h(ft)</p>
<p> or d = 20nmi. Alderney is ~30nmi from Jersey. However at that distance any reflector higher than about 20m (65 ft)
  would be above the radar horizon. Alderney is 88m (289 ft) elevation AMSL at the airport runway, and the horizon
  distance for a reflector at this height in the same conditions is ~41nmi, significantly greater than the 30nmi range
  of Alderney. So one would expect echoes from Alderney except in sub-refractive propagation conditions, unless at very
  low beam angles there is physical masking of the radar in the direction of Alderney due to local topography. </p>

    </tr></table><p>To clarify this matter, images of the accumulated echo from beam-0 scans of the same radar during a
    comparable seasonal period in 2004 were examined. In a four month study by Rico-Ramirez et al. of precipitation
    measurement accuracy using the Jersey weather radar, composite images were compiled of the aggregate echo detected
    in each of the four elevation scans during the months of February, March, April and May 2004 <span class="note">Miguel Angel Rico-Ramirez, Ian Cluckie &amp; Geoff Shepherd, &lsquo;Jersey Radar Experiment; Interim Report', Water
and Environmental Management Research Centre, Dept of Civil Engineering, University of Bristol, April 2005.</span>. </p>
    <p> On these accumulated monthly scans (see Fig.1) a NE masking sector in the sea return is very evident. But this
      sea return is in a part of the beam radiating at small negative elevations just beyond the half-power (3dB-down)
      points of the 1.0° beam <span class="note"> The range of the outer edge of this arc of return is quite close to the theoretical sea level horizon distance of
  about 20nmi [38km] expected in typical propagation conditions, and so corresponds roughly to rays launched at
  0° ## elevation. This coincides with the -3dB level for a boresight elevation of 0.5°. The inner edge is perhaps
0.9° #from the boresight</span>. The topographic masking in this part of the beam is not necessarily indicative of
      raypaths at the main beam boresight elevation of +0.5°. And in fact we do see echo from Alderney on the beam-0
      scans. </p>

        </tr></table><p>The possibility that ground clutter has been subtracted and that this echo is very intense local
        precipitation echo seems small. (The above authors allude to a possible clutter map used by Jersey Met, but this
        seems to refer to the map used to insert higher-elevation data in the synthetic S beam product referred to
        above.) Many echoes on the beam-0 scan are clearly clutter from coasts and islands and are identified as such by
        Rico-Ramirez et al., so there is no evidence that a permanent clutter map has been subtracted or substituted in
        these images. The strong echo accumulated at Alderney, especially in the April and May beam-0 scans, appears
        therefore to be ground echo <span class="note">  The Jersey ground clutter pattern is further discussed  by Rico-Ramirez, Cluckie, Shepherd &amp; Pallot, "A High Resolution Radar Experiment on the Island of Jersey&rdquo;, Journal of Meteorological Applications 14: 117-129 (2007).
DOI: 10.1002/met.13</span>.</p>
        <p> In support of this we can observe how the echo pattern changes. Generally, the intensity of the local arc of
          sea return progressively diminishes (relative to the general background) from February to May. This suggests
          decreasing average wave slope (linearly proportional to a decreasing average wind speed). At the same time
          distant land clutter and echo from surface vessels <span class="note">   Accumulated echo along Ferry routes from St Malo on the Brittany coast is evident, as also is a broader arc of
  strong echo running up the Channel roughly ESE-WNW to the north of Alderney, which is almost certainly a busy
merchant sea lane on which hundreds of  large container vessels pass every day.</span> intensifies. During April the
          Alderney echo first becomes clear; in May it is strong. The same trend of intensification is apparent in the
          echo from Guernsey, suggesting an increasing seasonal frequency of super-refractivity (or decreasing
          sub-refractivity) causing an expansion of the radar horizon. On the other hand no parallel trend appears in
          the Jersey mean rainfall figures which for Feb-May 2004 were 37.1, 35.8, 75.4 and 29.9mm <span class="note">   <a
              href="https://www.jerseymet.gov.je">Jersey Met Office</a> climate records</span>. </p>
        <p> Finally, the frequency of radar ducting events in the Channel Islands area during the same 2004 period was
          estimated in a separate study by Gunashekar et al <span class="note">   S.D.Gunashekar, E.M. Warrington, D.R. Siddle and P. Valtr , &lsquo;<a
              href="https://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2007/2006RS003617.shtml">Signal strength variations at 2 GHz for three sea
  paths in the British Channel Islands: detailed discussion and propagation modelling</a>', Radio Sci., 42, RS4020.</span>.
          A graph of refractive index gradients in N-units/km calculated from high-resolution radiosonde readings
          (Fig.14) shows a steeply increasing trend through the period March - June 2004, as inferred above, and this
          trend is paralleled by directly measured variations in 2GHz signal strength over the path between Jersey and
          Alderney, as well as by modified surface refractivity inversions between the heights of Guernsey and Alderney
          airports. </p>
        <p> In short, the aggregated 2004 observations provide convincing evidence that the strength of ground clutter
          echo from Alderney was positively correlated with an increasing parabolic curvature of the radar ray paths in
          conditions of increasing average super-refractivity. </p>
        <p> On 23 April 2007 we have evidence of two different inversion regimes, a severe one in the south near the
          Breton coast and another, much weaker, in the Channel Islands area. Considering the latter, we expect a small
          surface inversion of perhaps 2°- 3°C/kft in the area. This would by ruleof-thumb be expected to contribute a
          couple of N-units of refractive index <span class="note">   An N-unit is one part per million of refractive index, i.e., N = (n -1)106  = 350 where n = 1.00035. Around 350
N-units is a typical refractivity for centimetric radar at sea level, but it can vary from about 250 to 450 N-units. </span>.
          And the semipermanent evaporation duct produces as a matter of course a super-refractive (for radio waves
          only) humidity lapse through the lowest few tens of metres. We might therefore expect to see radar evidence of
          a small degree of super-refractivity on low elevation cuts, but certainly not much. </p>
        <p> So the fact that Alderney does not appear in the radar picture on 23 April can be interpreted as evidence
          that the latter does not indicate severe radar super-refractivity in the north Channel Islands area,
          consistent with expectation (from the horizon calculations), with the non-radar meteorological data (lack of
          evidence for significant temperature inversion in the North Channel Islands area) and with the professional
          opinions solicited. </p>
        <p> But radar evidence of propagation conditions in the south over the French terrain on 23 April 2007 is more
          ambiguous. There is some variation in the ground clutter intensity during the 30 minutes covered by Figs.
          15-17 in Section 5, and this can be interpreted in terms of varying refractivity. An observed diminution in
          the clutter pattern seems to indicate decreasing earthward bending of raypaths (i.e. a transition in the
          direction of less super-refractive or more subrefractive conditions). Comparing this clutter pattern with the
          2004 images in Fig.1 might suggest that it is somewhat more intense than would be expected in conditions that
          give rise to the observed Channel Islands echo pattern, since the latter are monthly accumulations of echo
          that presumably include (unlike the April 23 images) at least some low-level precipitation over the Breton
          hills. But the comparison is very subjective. </p>

            quantifiable test of the radio propagation conditions by comparing the observed echo pattern with that
            predicted by a computer simulation. Our hope also was that the result could be extrapolated to infer limits
            on possible refractivity at optical wavelengths. If so it might be possible to supplement meteorological
            evidence by means of indirect observational evidence, with a bearing on the possibility of optical mirage
            and related theories discussed in Section 6.d. </p>

                </tr></table><p>With this in mind we proceeded to design a computer ray-tracing simulation of the Jersey
                weather radar coverage pattern for various refractivity values <span class="note">The simulation implements the basic radar equation for average received power with an attenuation correction
  factor for plane (area) targets (i.e. the Earth's surface), the solution being computed for each 90m surface element of
  the DEM being impacted by a ray. A backscattering algorithm checks where the ray impacts the surface of the DEM
  and applies the relevant (calm sea/land texture) backscattering profile. For the visualization of the clutter maps we
  used geocontours included in the Jersey weather radar BUFR decoding package (thanks to Miguel Angel Rico-Ramirez, Bristol U.), rescaled, recentred and rotated by 2° anticlockwise to fit the DEM, with clutter maps
  downgraded from the 90m resolution to match the 2 km resolution of the Jersey radar. The results (Fig.3) show the
  interplay between the antenna gain diagram (vertical polar profile, boresight elevation 0.5°), distance attenuation,
and backscattering efficiency, for different refraction strengths.</span>. The simulation was initially run over a
                digital elevation model (DEM) of the coverage area at 90m resolution, later coarsened to match the 2km
                pixel resolution of the Jersey weather radar images. The refraction values chosen were -7&rdquo;/km, 0&rdquo;/km,
                +7&rdquo;/km, +15&rdquo;/km, +22&rdquo;/km, +33&rdquo;/km and +40&rdquo;/km (positive values indicating
                bending towards the earth). Initial results for a 0.5 degree ray tracing (Fig.3) suggest that the best
                fit is a refraction of +22&rdquo;/km, reproducing the 23 April images rather well within the limits of
                what is necessarily a very approximate simulation in terms both of terrain reflectivity and propagation.
                This amount of ray refraction, 11&rdquo;/km less than the earth curvature of 33&rdquo;/km, is not far
                from the refraction assumed in the &lsquo;4/3 earth' approximation used to model propagation in a
                standard atmosphere. </p>
                <p> Clearly we should not expect to be able to capture complex and dynamic propagation conditions very
                  effectively in such a crude simulation. But it is still reasonable to be a little surprised at the
                  result. Given evidence of a significant advection inversion close to the Breton shore during the
                  sighting period, with a marginally-ducting gradient of ~10°C/kft based on the Meteo-France numerical
                  simulation and other circumstantial evidence, ought not the low-beam clutter pattern on mainland
                  Brittany to show signs of stronger refractivity than a fairly bland 22&rdquo;/km? </p>
                <p> One possible explanation is that whereas optical refractivity is almost totally insensitive to
                  moisture (Fig. 4), the same is not true of radar. In fact variation in humidity contributes far more
                  to the radar refractive index than does variation of temperature. </p>
                <p> A semi-permanent feature of the marine radio environment in almost all conditions is the well
                  studied evaporation duct caused by a humidity lapse over the sea <span class="note">  Gunashekar et al., op. cit.</span>.
                  The effective duct height itself may only be a few tens of metres from the point of view of radio
                  propagation. The question is whether the humidity lapse continues through the marine surface boundary
                  layer (which we take to be in this case the region below the haze discontinuity at about 2000 ft
                  associated with the continental dry air intrusion; see Section 5), or whether there might be an
                  increase in moisture with height. Radar sub-refraction might occur if there a rising humidity
                  gradient, and thus the radio effects of a small or even moderate temperature inversion could in
                  principle be negated by a humidity "inversion&rdquo;. </p>
                <p> Evidence from the Brest radiosonde shows no such gradient, rather there is a somewhat dry boundary
                  layer overlain by the much drier layer already mentioned. The Trappes profile, far to the E and much
                  further from the sea, does show some increase in humidity with height. However our understanding
                  (Section 5) is that Brest, an essentially marine environment within the warm sector between fronts and
                  in the same SSW low level airflow, is more representative for our purposes. </p>
                <p> The noon Brest radiosonde ascent shows RH at 52% at the surface and &lt;40% through the first
                  3000ft, which is quite dry, falling to an unusually dry 10% at about 2000ft, perhaps indicating that
                  hygroscopic haze aerosols at this altitude - the same altitude as the reported Channel Islands haze
                  layer - are drying the air. Such a haze is basically composed of airborne particulates whose optical
                  cross-section is dependent on moisture but does not generally indicate RH at saturation or above. </p>
                <p> Hygroscopic salt particles in a salt sea haze begin to swell at about 70% RH, but dusts and
                  biological aerosols such as pollen will react to a lower RH than this. The latter is the type of
                  "continental bad air&rdquo; haze indicated ("not a salt haze&rdquo;) by observers, so a moderate
                  optical thickness in this case indicates removal of moisture from air that is probably well below
                  saturation in the first place. At the sighting time, Guernsey surface RH was recorded at 59% (17°T,
                  9°D), and Alderney surface RH at 77% (14°T, 10°D). The mean of these values is 68%, only a little
                  below the 22-year historical April average for Guernsey <span class="note">   https://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~brugge/ukclimate.html#HChannel%20Islands</span>
                  of 73%. The condensation level (cloud base) is close to the freezing level at 10,000ft. </p>
                <p> So, tentatively, we would say there is no sign of humidity increasing unusually with height and
                  therefore (though this is far from conclusive) no evidence of a subrefractive humidity gradient that
                  might mask the effects of an expected super-refractive temperature gradient. It is therefore a test of
                  our met model to see if it can explain the unexpected distribution of ground clutter in another
                  way. </p>
                <p> We think that this may be due to the shallowness of the coastal radio duct indicated by the
                  Meteo-France ALADIN simulation combined with the Breton topography. In this model the temperature
                  inversion gives way sharply to an overlying layer with a slightly excessive temperature lapse rate. So
                  the duct traps rays launched at near 0° elevation and at very small negative angles (including some
                  rays scattered at grazing incidence from the surface of the sea) and guides these over the geometrical
                  horizon towards the land. Rays launched at small positive angles just too steep to couple into the
                  duct either continue freely and do not refract earthward at all, or else intercept the top of the duct
                  at a grazing angle and may be scattered by partial reflection back into the sky. Thus the duct acts to
                  introduce a height cut-off in transmitter and receiver gain and tends to reject rays that impact the
                  terrain at altitudes above the top of the duct. </p>
                <p> The explanation of the observed clutter pattern could therefore be that the duct is enhancing echo
                  strength returned from the terrain, but by the same token is restricting the area from which ground
                  echo is receivable. The result is simultaneously to intensify and to contract the clutter pattern,
                  favouring lower terrain, which in N Brittany means that clutter would tend to concentrate towards the
                  coast and be minimised from higher ground inland. Thus a super-refractive surface duct which in theory
                  expands the radar horizon produces, because it is capped below the maximum topography, an effect which
                  resembles the contraction of the radar horizon due to subrefractive conditions. </p>
                <p> In the ALADIN model the top of the inversion would be at about 200m ASL. From examining the Breton
                  topography it is our impression that, if this explanation is correct, the effective top of the radio
                  duct may have been somewhat below the 200m contour. </p>
                <p> The above evidence and interpretation appears to confirm, or at least increases our confidence in,
                  the meteorological picture developed in Section 5. </p>
