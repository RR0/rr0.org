<p>At 1413:33, immediately after receiving the Jetstream's initial negative reply, Paul Kelly contacted the pilot of a
  FlyBe BAe146 northbound from Guernsey to Gatwick whose flight path had crossed behind the Jetstream and would take it
  NE towards R41 on a course reciprocal to that of Capt Bowyer's Trislander. Kelly advised that the object <q>...would
    be roughly on your course towards ORTAC, probably below, could you advise us if you see anything in the vicinity of
    Alderney?</q></p>
<p>At about 1414 Kelly was advising Capt Bowyer that he had a primary echo possibly corresponding to UAP #2 near the
  Casquets. Seconds later - at almost the exact moment that the Blue Islands Jetstream was reporting on the Approach
  frequency that he had a an object in sight near Alderney - Kelly called the 146 which was now flying west of the
  location and advised that <q>there is a primary [radar echo] just on your right hand side now, vicinity of the
    Casquets, about a mile to your right.</q> The pilot indicated that he would look. However at about 1417:30 after a
  second query from Kelly - <q>anything down your right hand side this time?</q> - the pilot responded that he had seen
  nothing, and thereafter was handed off to London Air Traffic Control for his cruise. </p>
<p>In radio discussion with Capt Bowyer during the latter's return flight to Southampton, Kelly remarked: <q>I think
  the FlyBe was too high</q>. Capt Bowyer recalled that the BAe146's altitude was between 6000 and 8000ft. </p>
