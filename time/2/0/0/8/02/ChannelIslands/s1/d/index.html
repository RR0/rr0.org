<p> An unidentified aircraft with the call sign GRR was heading southbound probably on R41 approximately 18nmi behind
  the Trislander (a few miles past ORTAC) when the pilot was contacted by Jersey Zone at about 1418. This was just as
  the sighting was ending. GRR was asked if he had overheard the transmissions from the Aurigny aircraft and replied in
  the affirmative. Controller Kelly asked him to keep an eye out as he approached and passed down the E side of the
  island of Alderney. GRR acknowledged. Queried at 1432 when off Alderney the pilot responded that - <q>to my
    disappointment</q>&rdquo - he had seen nothing. </p>
