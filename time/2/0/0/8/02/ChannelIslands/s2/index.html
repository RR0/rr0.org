<p>Jersey ATC kindly provided wav. files of all air/ground radio communications involving Channel Islands Control Zone
  and Jersey Approach Control during approximately two hours after the start of the sighting time. All exchanges on
  three ATC frequencies with reference to the UAP sighting have been extracted and transcribed below against time of
  transmission, beginning with Capt Bowyer's first call to Jersey Zone at 1409:32. Refer to radar map, Fig.6. </p>

      Aline who landed in Alderney about 20 minutes ago, er, he reported two cigar shaped objects, bright orange,
      approximately, well, between 5 or 40 and surface level just off the NW corner of Alderney, so if you could keep a
      look out for anything at all on your way down to Guernsey. </p>

    <p class="question">1437:10, JZ: Yes, maybe indeed, er, the pilot reported it and, er, all the passengers saw it as
      well. And, er, we had a separate, er, aircraft [unintelligible] just east of Sark who also confirmed it north of
