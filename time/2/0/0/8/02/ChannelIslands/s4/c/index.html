<p>The Jersey weather radar was of interest for two reasons. Unlike the ATC radar data, which is specially processed to
  remove non-aircraft targets, weather radars collect essentially unprocessed raw radar echo <span class="note">Some limited signal processing may be done and this was investigated by enquiries to Jersey Met Office and from
  internal evidence (see Appendix   ). But it is in any case limited to possible subtraction of permanent ground clutter 
  by means of a clutter map and/or insertion of data from higher-level cuts into these areas. This does not affect 
  coverage of targets in areas free from permanent ground clutter, i.e., over the open sea.</span>. This enhanced the
  possibility of finding echo correlating with any stationary radar-reflective phenomena. Additionally, the weather
  radar images could contain information on likely radar propagation conditions at the time (see Appendix D). We hoped
  that this information might help to calibrate conclusions reached about the temperature and humidity profiles of the
  atmosphere from indirect meteorological evidence. This in turn might help to improve our confidence in the likely
  optical refractive index values (see Section 5, Meteorological Conditions in Sighting Area). </p>

<p>Operated by Jersey Meteorological Office and located in the SW of the island near the airport, this is a C-band
  weather radar employing a 5 minute scan algorithm. An approximately 1° pencil beam rotates at approximately 1.1 rpm
  and changes elevation incrementally so that it sweeps out the total surveillance volume in a series of four separate
  slices or cuts (called beam 0, beam 1, beam 2 and beam 3) followed by a short period of idle time during which
  software constructs a synthetic image (known as beam-S) from the four real images before the cycle starts again. </p>

<p>Weather radar scans timed at 1400, 1415 and 1430Z, 23 April 2007 were obtained in BUFR file format thanks to the
  assistance of Tony Pallot, Principle Meteorological Officer, Jersey Airport Met Office <span class="note">The authors also acknowledge the assistance of  Dr. Miguel Rico-Ramirez of Bristol University in sharing
  software files necessary for visualising the radar data</span>. The basic product of each scan is a set of four images
  from the four elevation cuts having a horizontal resolution of 2km. The antenna boresight elevations are: </p>
<p> Beam 0 = 0.5°, <br> Beam 1 = 1.0°, <br> Beam 2 = 1.5°, <br> Beam 3 = 2.5°. </p>
<p> Beam-S produces a cleaned synthetic image by inserting higher elevation data into the beam-0 image according to a
  map of permanent clutter areas. </p>
<p> The three raw 0.5° (beam 0) images are shown in Figs. 15, 16 &amp; 17. The coloured bars on the right are scales
  showing different levels of reflectivity in dBZ <span class="note"> Z is reflectivity. The difference between any two colour bands is a constant logarithmic ratio of received power
measured in decibels</span>. It was established that the times given are in fact the start times of the beam-0 cut in
  each case (although this is not actually the first in the sequence) so that the beam-0 image from the 1415 scan in Fig
  16 shows us the 0.5° rotation from about 1415-1416Z. This 60-second scan is therefore the only available weather radar
  cover at the relevant altitude during the known visual sighting period. </p>
<p> The poor pixel resolution is obvious at a glance, as is an apparent displacement and/or scale mismatch between the
  echo video and the map overlay <span class="note">A similar mismatch was found to have been noted in published meteorological research work using this radar. See
  Appendix D</span>, making it difficult to judge echo location reliably from this image. The resolution cell has
  effectively the 2km x 2km range and azimuth dimensions of the display pixel (coarser than the true electromagnetic
  resolution), and assuming a depth of 1° the cell volume is about 4 km3 at a distance of 50km, including the ocean
  surface and the atmosphere up to about 3000ft altitude. </p>
<p> A few pixels south and north of Guernsey contain very weak reflectivity which could be approximately in the line of
  sight from the Trislander, and there is a weak signal intensity in one pixel whose correct location might arguably be
  a few nautical miles south of the Casquets in the area of the Casquet Banks, which is near the rough triangulated
  position of UAP #1. </p>
<p> The Jersey Met Office shipping forecast for the area limited on the west by the 3°W line of longitude (about 25nmi
  west of Guernsey), valid for the 24 hours starting at noon on April 23 (about 2 hours before the start of the
  sighting) mentioned the possibility of occasional rain spreading in from the west, but no weather reports indicate
  precipitation in the Guernsey- Alderney area at the sighting time. </p>
<p> As for low altitude aircraft: The Blue Islands Jetstream would have been passing through FL30 sometime during the
  1415 beam-0 cut, but it was nearly 20nmi away at that time; and the FlyBe BAe146 (Jersey 912G) would have been quite
  nearby (see Fig.6, Section 2) but reportedly above 6000ft and therefore too high to be detected. It is clear from
  Channel Islands Zone radio communications (Section 2) and the report of the Controller (Appendix A) that ATC was
  tracking no other candidate aircraft at this time. </p>
<p> However a Brittany Ferries vessel is expected in the area (though not very near the shallows of the banks of course
  <span class="note">Paul Kelly speculated that the "possible anaprop&rdquo; echo he observed in the area could have been "waves on the reef at the casquets&rdquo;. The Casquet banks area is to the south of the islet where Casquets Lighthouse is situated. Marine charts show the mean sea level depth over the banks reducing to as little as 3m. At the sighting time the tide was only about 2/3 of the way through its 6-hour ebb cycle. The next low tide (3.3m above chart datum, chart datum being the lowest possible astronomical tide) was at 1649Z, the previous high tide (7.4m above CD) having been at 1034Z. Thus the low tide would be about 2m below the mean tide. Assuming the mean tide on the day to be close to chart MSL then at low tide, 1649Z, the shallowest spot on the banks would still be a metre or so below the average wave height. More than 2&frac12; hours earlier at  ~1412Z, with slight sea conditions in a light breeze, there may be some doubt as to whether wave disturbance would have been significant</span>).
  It was probably detected by the Guernsey primary surveillance radar as Track B in Fig 12 and might also have been
  picked up by the Jersey weather radar in conditions of mild super-refractivity (see Section 5). </p>
<p> Also, it should be remembered that the weather radar reflectivity represents the aggregate echo received from the
  whole 4 km3 resolution cell. There are various other possible reflectors inside this volume - wave slopes, rocks,
  seabirds, small fishing boats etc - that could be sources of transient weak echo. </p>
<p> So the weather radar picture doesn't allow us to say there was no radar reflector near the triangulated UAP#1
  location, but it doesn't provide unambiguous evidence of an unexpected or unusual echo in the appropriate location.
  There also appears to be no trace of echo at the triangulated location of UAP#2. It may be reasonable to say that if
  there were UAPs with visual dimensions in the order of hundreds of metres (consistent with visual estimates of angular
  size) at these locations they probably had small radar cross-section at C-band. </p>
<p> In weighing this result we should bear in mind that the radar has the opportunity of only one very brief sampling.
  At 50km range a 2km resolution cell corresponds to ~2.5° = 1/(360/2.5 ) = 1/144 of the 60-second antenna rotation, or
  about 0.4sec, and the total dwell-time of a point target in the 1° beam width would be only ~1.7sec. </p>
