<p>In summary the radar evidence examined is not helpful in establishing the presence of extraordinary phenomena. An
  <abbr title="Air Traffic Control">ATC</abbr> radar echo reported below the approximate visually estimated position of
  one UAP may have been associated with an identifiable surface vessel. At the same time there are factors - use of MTI
  and poor sample rate - which limit the usefulness of this negative result, and pending the results of the <a
      href="/org/eu/fr/cnes/geipan/index.html">GEIPAN</a> study the ATC data files have not yet been examined to a level
  of detail that would completely rule out the presence of interesting primary echoes.</p>
