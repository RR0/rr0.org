<p> According to the Jersey Met Office climate graphs (Appendix 9) April 2007 was slightly warmer, sunnier and drier
  than the 1971-2000 period average, and the few days previous to April 23 had been very slightly warmer and sunnier
  than most of the month, although the pressure was falling somewhat below its high point earlier in the month. However
  this seems to reflect the fact that the area was in what is called a warm sector between a retreating warm front and
  an approaching cold front, and these cyclonic frontal movements associated with the low to the NW of the UK appear to
  dominate the weather in the area. Such conditions are far from the anticyclonic conditions of building high-pressure
  that are often associated with severe stratification. </p>
