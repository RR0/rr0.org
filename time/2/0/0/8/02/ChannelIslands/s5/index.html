<p>Capt. Bowyer reported that direct sunlight was obscured (the sun at 1410Z was elevation 44° 45'
  azimuth 225° 20') by a "stratus&rdquo; sheet a few thousand feet above his altitude extending 10 miles
  S of Guernsey. There was broken high cloud, some cloud to the E and a solid cloud mass to the 
  W but a clear horizon to the SW ahead of the plane despite a haze at about 2000 ft. Air 
temperature outside the BN2a Trislander at FL40 was ~10°C.  </p>

<p>As recorded in the report to CAA (Appendix A), forecast average winds for the Southampton-
  Alderney fuel calculation were SW 8 knots <span class="note">  UK Met Office forecasts and nearest UK and French balloon ascents all indicate around 20-25 knots at the cruise 
  altitude. Our flightpath reconstruction does not of course depend on a wind calculation because we are using the

  ft (88m) AMSL for 1350Z was: 200° 6 knots, visibility CAVOK, temperature 14°C, dewpoint
  11°C, QNH pressure 1021 mbar. </p>

<p>The general picture reported by Capt Bowyer seems consistent with meteorological observations
  and satellite images. The Guernsey and Alderney half-hourly met obs show 7/8 and 6/8 
  altocumulus at 12,000 and 10,000ft respectively for the previous few hours, in the process of  clearing at about the time of the observations, and 7/8 cirrus at 25,000 ft (Appendix C, Table 2) The UK Met Office pressure chart, 1200Z, 23 April 2007 (Appendix C, Fig.1) shows an upper 
  cold front moving in from the W ahead of a low-level cold front, and a weak warm front 
  retreating to the E. Images from the 1415Z NOAA 18 satellite pass (Fig.8) are of poor resolution 
  but show the general situation of a dense cloud mass associated with the frontal system to the W. 
  An earlier MODIS <span class="note">  The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers, carried on <a href="https://terra.nasa.gov">NASA's Terra</a> (EOS AM)
  and <a href="https://aqua.nasa.gov">Aqua</a> (EOS PM)  earth observation satellites, image the earth regularly in many bandwidths. <a href="https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about">Images in the red and infrared are produced at resolutions down to 250m</a>.</span> image taken at 1328Z with higher resolution to 250m (Fig. 19) shows a
  chaotic cloud system with divergent winds associated with the approaching cold front. Hooked 
  plumes of high-level cirrus uncinus to the W of Guernsey indicate wind shear at around 25,000 ft 
possibly associated with the frontal surface. A number of jet contrails are visible at high altitude. </p>
<p>  Unfortunately no regular radiosonde balloon ascents are made in or near the Channel Islands. 
  This means that almost no direct temperature, pressure, dewpoint or winds aloft measurements 
  exist for the column of atmosphere over the area of interest. However some conclusions are 
  possible from surface reports and other meteorological data and scheduled balloon ascents from 
  surrounding sites in France and the UK. </p>
<p>  The UK Met Office's noon synoptic pressure chart shows isobars to the N and W of the area
  lying roughly SW-NE, indicating the tendency of the geostrophic wind associated with the low 
  pressure centre to the NW of the British Isles. To the SE of the area most of the continent lies 
  under a rather flat pressure field with few isobars. High pressure is found to the S along the 
  Mediterranean. </p>
<p>  The nearest scheduled radiosonde upper air profiles were obtained <span class="note">  Courtesy of  the <a href="https://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html">Dept of Atmospheric Science, University of Wyoming College of Engineering</a></span> for Brest in Brittany,
  Trappes in inland France and Herstmonceux and Camborne in Southern England (the 1200Z 
  ascent readings for these stations along with station information and sounding indices are shown 
  in Appendix C, Tables 4-7), together with the surface wind and temperature chart for mainland 
  France (Appendix C, Fig. 2). </p>
<p>  The noon chart of surface winds in France (focusing particularly on north-western France) shows 
  the winds generally rotated to the S of W. The winds aloft were generally force 4 - 7 (a moderate 
  breeze to a moderate gale) while surface winds were generally force 2, a slight breeze. </p>
<p>  The Jersey Met Office 1300-1800Z aviation forecast for the Channel Islands area (Appendix C, 
  Fig.3) predicted winds from 230° at 10,000ft, 220° at 5000ft and 210° at 1000ft. The average
  surface winds actually measured at Guernsey and Alderney between 1150 and 1550Z were 195°
  and 189° respectively. The speeds of the winds aloft were forecast by Jersey Met as 15-30kts
  through 2000-18,000ft , and by the UK Met Office Form 214 forecast (for the north of the area, 
  Appendix C, Table 1) as 20-25kts at 1000ft and above. Measured surface wind speeds were only 
  about 6-7kts. </p>
<p>  The Brest noon temperature profile is thought to be the most directly relevant to Channel Islands
  conditions on the day. Brest soundings are reputed to be typically somewhat "bland&rdquo; <span class="note">Frank LeBlanq, Jersey Met Dept, email to Tim Lillington, Guernsey Airport Met Office, &amp; Martin Shough,
27.07.2007</span>, 
  nevertheless there is no inversion on the Brest (or Trappes) profile below about 40,000 ft. Small 
  low-level inversions at Camborne and Herstmonceux in the UK were determined to have causes 
  not directly connected with conditions in the Channel Islands area (see below). </p>
<p>  Sea surface temperature (SST) measurements were of interest. These were available for St 
  Helier, Jersey, St. Peter Port, Guernsey, and the Channel Light Vessel. Satellite infrared sea 
  surface temperature maps were also obtained courtesy of the French oceanographic agency 
  IFREMER <span class="note"><a href="https://www.ifremer.fr/francais/index.php">Institut français de recherche pour l'exploitation de la mer</a>. Special
  thanks to Francis Gohin, Département Dynamiques de l'Environnement Côtier, IFREMER BREST</span>  (Unfortunately valid data for April 23 2007 were limited due to cloud and haze.) </p>
<p>  An estimate of the vertical air temperature profile(s) in the line of sight was considered especially 
  important. Bearing in mind that the direct physical measurements available are incomplete, the 
  evidence for temperature inversions of various types in the sighting area was considered as 
  follows. </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="advection/index.html">Surface advection inversion</a></li>
  <li><a href="anticyclonic/index.html">Anticyclonic inversion</a></li>
  <li><a href="frontal/index.html">Frontal inversion</a></li>
  <li><a href="subsidence/index.html">  Elevated subsidence inversion</a></li>
  <li><a href="elevated/index.html">Elevated advection inversion</a></li>
</ul>
<p>  In summary, we conclude on the basis of meteorological evidence that there is a likelihood of a 
  significant inversion in the first ~200m over the cool sea to the S of the Channel Islands area, 
  strong near the Breton coast where it probably reached an optical ducting gradient, becoming 
  weaker further north. There seems to be neither evidence of, nor a plausible mechanism for, an 
  elevated temperature inversion - at least in the lower atmosphere below the freezing level <span class="note">The highest angular elevation of  the visual line of sight to the UAPs from ~4200ft AMSL was approximately 
  tangential to the 2000 ft haze-layer horizon. Most of the time the LOS actually intersected the sea. Therefore the 
  haze layer, well below the 10,000ft freezing level, represents the approximate maximum altitude of any relevant 
  optical duct. See Section 6(d), Surface reflections and mirages.</span>  (Detailed discussion of the optical effects of temperature, pressure and humidity gradients is in 
Section 6.) </p>
