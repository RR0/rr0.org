<p>Subsidence inversions can occur in a warm sector between a retreating warm front and an approaching cold front,
  almost always at higher levels and usually above the freezing level. However although the observed dissipation of the
  altocumulus layer at 10-12,000 ft may have been caused by adiabatic warming associated with subsidence at this level,
  Tony Pallot considers that this is unlikely to have a bearing on conditions near the ground. The fact that surface
  pressure was actually falling at the time ahead of an approaching cold front suggests ascending (cooling) air at low
  levels rather than descending (warming) air, so a subsidence inversion at low level does not seem likely <span

<p>Nevertheless we pursued this question further on the strength of an extremely dry level on the noon Brest profile at
  about 2500ft (see Fig. 21). Might not such a layer of dry air indicate the top of a subsidence inversion? This is
  often the case; but not, we were advised, in this instance. The overall dynamics of the atmosphere are inconsistent
  with a subsidence inversion at this low level. Rather this layer is believed to be what is known as a "dry air
  intrusion" caused by continental air being forced north parallel to the frontal zone, possibly from as far south as
  the Iberian peninsula <span class="note">  It is also possible that dry air is created ahead of a katabatic front, when the front is moving slower than the air
  ahead of it so that air tends to descend down the frontal surface. But this usually occurs from high altitudes down to
  about 3000m, and although the mechanism could be responsible for adiabatic evaporation of altocumulus cloud at
  this level the much lower Brest dry layer seems more likely to be associated with a deliquescent haze layer reported
  by observers at around 2000 ft and which Capt Bowyer described as "due to bad air from the continent". Tony Pallot
  would expect the Brest layer to be fairly localised but opines that the intrusion could have extended northward to the
Channel Islands area by that afternoon (email to Martin Shough, 16.08.07) </span>.</p>
