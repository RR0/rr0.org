<p>Related arguments apply to a possible subsun, which is also an ice halo phenomenon. A subsun is commonly seen in
  isolation, but is part of a complex display called a subparhelia, mirroring below the horizon the appearance of the
  normal parhelia above. The subsun is a virtual image of the sun and occupies the equivalent position in the inverted
  display, which is produced in this case by a layer of platelet ice crystals below the altitude of the observer. For
  this reason subsuns are commonly seen from aircraft. </p>
<p>A subsun appears as a single patch of light, varying from a near-specular solar image to a fuzzy ellipse (in rare
  cases surrounded by concentric ellipses called Bottlinger's Rings), with a vertically oriented major axis that further
  devolves into a vertical streak called a sun pillar. The single subsun appears directly below the sun, which in the
  present case would be at azimuths between ~224° and 227°, and therefore does not explain two horizontal ellipses
  disposed side by side, the westernmost of which is seen always to the E of the Casquets Light <span class="note">The reflection geometry of the ice halo is bilaterally symmetrical about a vertical axis passing through the azimuth
of the sun, whereas in this case both UAPs were seen (for some minutes) offset asymmetrically by several degrees to
the left (E) of the ~220°azimuth of the Casquets lighthouse (a definite and familiar visual reference), whilst the sun
was at an azimuth ~225° to right of Casquets and moving W (see Fig.23).</span>.</p>
<p>Rarely a very well developed subparhelia can produce a bright subsun attended either side by its own pair of
  sub-sundogs. But these will be at least 44° apart and therefore nowhere near close enough. The subsun itself would be
  much more prominent than the pair of sundogs. And most importantly, the depression angle below the horizon of this
  entire display will be equal to the elevation angle of the real sun above the horizon, i.e. about -43°, whereas the
  UAPs were seen within a degree or two of the horizon. </p>
<p>In the present case both the geometry and the meteorology are inconsistent with a subsun. Most obviously all
  witnesses were thousands of feet below the freezing level, which was at about 10,000ft (Fig.22; see also Fig.20,
  Section 5). There is no evidence that lines of sight could have intersected the top surface of a layer of ice
  crystals. </p>
