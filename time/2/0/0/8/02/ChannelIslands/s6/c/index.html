<p>Unlike the ice halos discussed above, rainbows are water droplet phenomena <span class="note"> A useful and authoritative source of information on a wide range of light effects involving droplets and crystals is
  the atmospheric optics <a href="https://www.atoptics.com">website of physicist Les Cowley</a>. A <a
      href="https://www.philiplaven.com/index1.html">wealth of data and applications</a>  is also available</span>. The
  common primary and secondary rainbows occur around the antisolar point, which is the vanishing point of a line drawn
  from the sun through the eye to the point on the celestial sphere opposite the sun. The primary rainbow appears as an
  arc of a circle 42° in radius. Clearly phenomena observed at the sun's azimuth cannot be primary or secondary (1st and
  2<sup>nd</sup> order) rainbows. </p>
<p>There are however rarer 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> order rainbows which do occur in the direction of the sun.
  The 3rd order rainbow is only about &frac14; as bright as the 1<sup>st</sup> and the 4<sup>th</sup> order about 1/6 as
  bright. They are almost never visible because of the glare of the sun, but in ideal conditions with the sun occulted
  it is thought that they may very rarely be detected. The 3rd order bow occurs at the same radius from the solar point
  as the 1<sup>st</sup> does from the antisolar, about 42°, and the 4<sup>th</sup> occurs immediately outside it
  separated by a small gap, with the order of colours reversed. </p>
<p>In this case we can perhaps suppose that direct sun at ~45° elevation is shielded by cloud and by the top of the
  cockpit windscreen, and a 42° radius would bring the bows close to the horizon. Perhaps only a small, isolated segment
  of bow is caused by an isolated patch of rain droplets. There is also a region where the inverted spectra of the two
  concentric bows abut, in the red, which might appear as a dark area between brighter yellow regions, suggesting the
  idea of the "dark band" reported on each of the two UAPs. </p>
<p>But these 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> order bows are even broader than the common 1<sup>st</sup> and
  2<sup>nd</sup> order ones and the pair would be perhaps 5° in thickness, an order of magnitude bigger than the 0.5°
  width of the UAPs when first observed, and the possible dark(red) area is much too wide to be a dark band in the order
  of 0.1° degree across or smaller. </p>
<p>Also to get the reported "brilliant" and "clearly defined" shapes from these very faint and elusive phenomena near
  the glare of the scattered light from the sun seems quite impossible. And even then the hypothetical "dark band" in
  the red must appear on a circumferential arc concentric with the sun; but because our UAPs are almost directly below
  the sun the band would lie horizontally, not cut through the UAPs vertically as observed. </p>
<p>Finally these bows can't occur in the absence of raindrops. Available meteorological reports and weather radar scans
  (Section 4) do not indicate rain in the sighting area <span class="note">82 Fogbows can  be caused by suspended droplet sizes smaller than raindrops, but they are far too diffuse and faint
for our purposes. However see Section 6d.</span>.</p>
