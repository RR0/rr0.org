<p>  Isolated sun patches caused by narrow shafts of sunlight piercing broken cloud, sometimes 
  known as "god rays&rdquo;, are one possible explanation of two lights that appear to move relative to
  one another on or "over&rdquo; the sea. To explain the brilliance we require specular sun-glitter
  reflection (some issues connected with this are discussed in Section 6.d.ii below). At the kind of 
  near-horizon distance required in this case the observed lateral translation equates to about 1 mile 
  per degree of arc, so UAP #2 could be modelled as a sun patch moving, relative to UAP#1, about 
  3 miles E-W in 6 minutes, or a rate of around 30 knots . If UAP #1 is a nearer sun patch moving 
very little then the rate and direction of #2 are roughly consistent with the winds aloft <span class="note"> Our hypothetical specular sun patches are not of course in the geographical locations indicated in Fig.7, Section 3, 
  which assumes parallax displacements of stationary UAPs at 2000ft above the sea.  The visual lines of sight do not 
intersect the sea surface at these local positions, but pass near the horizon.</span>.</p>
<p>  This hypothesis has several difficulties: The sighting geometry indicates an angular rotation of
  the #1 LOS itself through about 10Â°, equivalent to ~50 knots, in the direction opposite to the
  wind; notwithstanding this, the differential angular rates of motion of #1 and #2 would in any 
  case imply a horizontal wind shear in the order of tens of knots, which is in tension with the 
  requirements of stability and similarity of two sun patches under simultaneous binocular 
  observation for 6 minutes; the persistence of even one such patch of sunlight with a "very sharply
  defined&rdquo; and unchanging outline for 12 minutes seems unlikely, and the occurrence of two 
  geometrically similar such patches, a few miles apart on the sea surface, each with an 
  unexplained asymmetrical dark band in the same place, is more unlikely still; witnesses were 
  questioned about the light conditions but saw no sun shafts, despite the haze, and the weather 
  picture (Section 5) does not suggest the type of overcast that would produce extreme and unusual 
  contrasts of light and shade; at the start of the observation UAP#1 was seen not only against the 
  sea but also against the background of the island of Guernsey; at the end of the observation Capt 
  Bowyer estimated that the elevation angle of both UAPs was above the sea horizon, such that 
  they appeared to be near his own altitude, i.e., near the top of the 2000ft haze layer; and finally, 
  specular god-ray patches near the S sea horizon could not explain the phenomenon sighted (at the 
same apparent altitude) in the vicinity of Alderney by Capt Patterson looking N. </p>
