<p>Lenticular or lens-shaped clouds (lenticularis) are a type of lee wave cloud distinguished by an often striking
  symmetry and smoothness. These form due to standing gravity waves in the airflow when humid air is forced upward over
  an obstacle in conditions of static stability (i.e., minimal vertical circulation). The classic form is altocumulus
  standing lenticularis.
</p>
<p> Well-developed lenticulars are generally seen when strong winds are deflected by high hills or mountain ranges (for
  which reason they are also known as orographic, or mountain-formed clouds), and the amplitude of the waves in these
  cases can reach tens of thousands of feet. The clouds form at altitude in the ascending moist air at the peaks of the
  waves, often above the freezing level so that they are sometimes composed at least in part of ice particles. These
  mountain clouds are typically large, often miles across. Given sufficient wave amplitude they can appear as
  approximate lens or almond shapes, or like stacks of elliptical plates with smooth surfaces and well-defined edges
  (Fig. 33).
</p>
<p> A distinction is made between vertically trapped lee waves, and untrapped or vertically propagating lee waves.
  Gravity waves can only exist in statically stable air. The trapping occurs where a stable layer at the barrier crest
  is sandwiched between unstable airmasses which are unable to support gravity waves. It is these trapped waves whose
  signature, when wave amplitude is high, is the lenticular cloud proper (see Fig.33). They are also characterised by a
  small vertical directional wind shear (i.e. little change in wind direction with height) and require an abrupt
  escarpment on the lee side of the barrier, the windward profile being relatively unimportant <span class="note">  https://www.caem.wmo.int/_pdf/turbulence/OrographicTurbulence.pdf</span>.
  Untrapped waves, on the other hand, occur when the atmosphere is stable through a considerable depth and the waves are
  free to propagate upward. They generally occur in the presence of marked wind shear aloft and can be set off by
  broader mountain ridges. The signature cloud of these waves is usually a less compact higher-altitude cirrus form
  called orographic cirrus.

<p>Strong winds approaching Beaufort force 7 (moderate gale) in the stable layer are usually considered the minimum
  necessary for mature trapped lee wave clouds to form. A figure of at least 20 knots is widely cited. A UK Met Office
  source gives 20 knots and 300m (1000ft) vertical barrier height as the minimum conditions for trapped
  waves <span class="note">  ibid. A striking satellite photograph in ref.113 shows a stratus sheet rippled by orographic turbulence extending 
  hundreds of km in the lee of all but one of the South Sandwich Islands, a chain of mountainous volcanic islands in 
  the S Atlantic. The responsible mountain heights here are between 1800 and 3600 ft. No effect is detectable from the 
lower island of  Leskov (625ft, 190m).</span>. A study in New Zealand indicated that winds in excess of 20-25 knots were
  required blowing at <30deg to the line of the orographic barrier, and found wavelengths of 4 - 20km with an average of
  15km <span class="note">Alistair Reid, Mountain Waves & Clouds: Investigating the occurrence of cloud-producing mountain waves.

<p> The Lifted Condensation level, H, is the height at which an air parcel of a given constant moisture and heat content
  will become saturated due to adiabatic expansion-cooling when mechanically lifted. The formula <span class="note"> Petterssen, S., Introduction to Meteorology, McGraw-Hill, 1958 p.83.</span>

  about 3000ft at the sighting time, about twice the altitude visually estimated independently by two pilots, but an
  order-of-magnitude match is probably good enough given that this is a rule of thumb and the true sea-level humidity is
  uncertain.

<p>Unusual lenticularis was an early candidate for our UAPs. In the present case there is no high mountain barrier -
  barely even 1/3 of the minimum 300m cited - or strong wind. However the island of Guernsey does constitute a modest
  barrier (about 100m, 330ft at the highest southern point) to a SSW sea level breeze, and the triangulated UAP
  positions (see Fig.7) do fall in the lee of the island. Jersey meteorologist Frank LeBlancq pointed out
  <span class="note"> Email to Tim Lillington and Martin Shough from Frank LeBlancq 27.07.2007</span> that the presence
  of a temperature inversion (see Section 5) indicates a layer of statically stable air - one known precondition - and
  speculated that lenticular cloud might form in stratocumulus even at low level. On the other hand we also sought the
  opinion of Robin Hogan, a cloud physicist at Reading University. Based on information supplied including the Brest
  balloon ascent readings (Fig.34), satellite images and local weather observations it was Dr Hogan's opinion that
  lenticular development was "very unlikely"
  <span class="note"> Emails to Martin Shough from Robin Hogan, 28.08.07</span>.
</p>
<p> The surface breeze measured on Guernsey from 1350-1420 was only 6-7 knots, or about &frac14; of the typical minima
  measured in mountain wave studies. The barrier height is not great, and the barrier profile - an abrupt windward side
  sloping very gradually to sea level on the leeward side - is the exact opposite of the optimum shape. There is
  reasonable doubt that a wave having an amplitude in the order of 10 times the barrier height (to reach the
  condensation level) could be kicked off in these conditions.

<p>But it seemed somewhat plausible to us that the distributions of the causal variables must have a tail end, and that
  in the right conditions of atmospheric stability and humidity even a modest cliff and a slight breeze might sometimes
  generate a short-duration, possibly poorly-developed fragment of lenticularis. After all, might this not explain why
  the clouds were so small (angular size >1deg at 12nmi, or 22km, indicating diameter in the region of ~400m) compared
  with the diameters of typical lenticularis, and with the bulk of the parcel of air potentially lifted by a generally
  flattish island the size of Guernsey (63 km<sup>2</sup>, 24.3mi<sup>2</sup>)? Unfortunately the theory falls foul of
  problems with wavelength, amplitude and lenticular definition.
</p>
<p> Firstly we found that the particular importance of wind speed is as the main factor in determining the wavelength of
  the orographic wave. The values are directly proportional <span class="note">  https://www.caem.wmo.int/_pdf/turbulence/OrographicTurbulence.pdf</span>.
  For a given atmospheric stability, the higher the wind speed the longer the wavelength. It is the wave amplitude that
  is governed principally by the topography. The triangulated UAP positions in Fig.7 are approximately 18 and 36km from
  the south coast of Guernsey. It is striking that these distances could be consistent with lenticularis in the first
  two peaks of a mountain wave having a wavelength of approximately 18 km. But satellite measurements have shown that a
  15km wavelength equates to a 30m/sec wind <span class="note">Reid, Alistair, op. cit.</span>, or approximately 60
  knots, which is violent storm force (Beaufort #11). One would reasonably expect that light winds, and a low orographic
  barrier of only a few hundred feet, would produce not only small amplitude waves but, in particular, wavelengths at
  the low end of the ranges recorded, i.e., perhaps a few kilometres. The wind speed measured by an anemometer at the
  hypothetical uplift location (Guernsey Airport, not far from the cliffs at the south of the island) was a slight
  breeze (Beaufort #2), only about 1/10 of the speed that typically produces 15km wavelengths in the cited studies.
  Therefore an 18km wavelength in this case seems implausible.
</p>
<p> Secondly, the very compact shape and "sharply defined edge" of the UAPs is a problem. The lenticular definition, we
  learned, is proportional to the wave amplitude. Generally, for a given wind speed, the wave amplitude is proportional
  to the size of the barrier, so at first sight it seems that in this case, with a very modest barrier, a large
  amplitude and well-defined lens clouds would not be expected.
</p>
<p> A possible escape from this conclusion offers itself when we find that the degree of stability of the air layer is
  also a factor: A shallow layer of exceptional stability can produce higher amplitude waves than can a deep layer of
  only moderate stability. (This, in general, is why trapped lee waves produce well-defined lenticularis and untrapped
  lee waves do not.) So can we posit an extremely stable trapped layer?
</p>
<p> Direct meteorological evidence is inconclusive <span class="note"> The noon radiosonde ascent at Brest on the SW of Brittany (Fig.35 and Appendix C ) shows an unstable layer 
  below about 500m indicated by a decreasing Theta (potential temperature). Here, the atmosphere could not support 
  gravity waves below about 500m, and it was far too dry for cloud condensation below about 1500m (email to Martin 
  Shough from Dr. Robin Hogan, 28.08.07). No capping inversion is indicated, although there is a near-isothermal 
  layer from ~500-1200m. But the profile is stable everywhere above 500m (indicated by a high positive Lifted Index 
  of 12.67), suggesting that lee waves at the top of the unstable layer would not be vertically trapped and signature 
  lenticularis would be unlikely. The meteorological model in Section 5 shows a strong inversion near the N Breton 
  coast, with these highly stable conditions probably decaying over the sea south of the Channel Islands with a much 
  weaker inversion here indicating decreasing stability. To the north, the noon ascents at both Camborne and 
  Herstmonceux showed an unstable surface layer only about 200m deep, but a lower positive Lifted Index indicating 
overlying air still on the stable side although somewhat less stable than at Brest. </span>. However it happens that the
  stability of the wave layer is in turn inversely proportional to the wavelength <span class="note"> https://www.caem.wmo.int/_pdf/turbulence/OrographicTurbulence.pdf </span>,
  so exceptional stability would dictate short wavelength, and this is in tension with evidence for what appears to be a
  problematically long wavelength. The wave cloud theory therefore appears not to be internally consistent.
</p>
<p> Another factor is that orographic waves can propagate many tens of kilometres and are in general associated with
  downstream turbulence and pressure fluctuations of concern to pilots. Up- and down-draft rates of hundreds of feet per
  minute occur in well-developed mountain waves, and rotor or roll clouds <span class="note">Rotors are vortex clouds that generally form nearer the ground underneath the lenticular clouds, often at the base 
  of a stack (see Fig.31 and below)</span> in the vicinity of lenticularis are associated with especially dangerous
  turbulence with up to ten times these rates. In our earliest interview we asked Capt Bowyer to describe the conditions
  of the flight, which brought the Trislander in downwind of Guernsey in a near-direct line with the hypothetical
  direction of orographic wave propagation. In fact it happens that when passing through the apparent ~2000ft altitude
  of the UAPs the aircraft was (hypothetically) itself almost exactly one 18km wavelength downwind from the triangulated
  position of UAP#1. But flying conditions were "standard", Capt Bowyer reported; it was a "normal day". Did he
  experience any turbulence during the approach, or in the descent to Alderney? "None at all." (See Appendix B)
</p>
<p> The only instrument evidence we could find relating to local pressure variations was the regular surface
  observations made by Guernsey and <span class="place">Alderney</span> Airport Met Offices. Guernsey's high ground is
  at the S end of the island, and it is here that SSW winds generating wave clouds would be obstructed by coastal
  cliffs. The expected result would be to build high pressure at the southern edge of the island where Guernsey Airport
  is located. The orographic wave would then induce alternating high and low pressure in the lee of the island,
  extending towards Alderney. Raised pressure would tend to accompany adiabatic compression in the troughs, and lowered
  pressure might be found below the peaks owing to adiabatic expansion-lifting of the overlying air. The 18km wavelength
  indicated by the triangulated UAP locations would lead to a wave peak close to the range of Alderney, where a low
  pressure reading might be expected.
</p>
<p> The pressure figures read at Guernsey at 1350Z, 23 April 2007, were obtained thanks to the airport Senior
  Meteorological Officer, Tim Lillington <span class="note"> Email to Martin Shough from Tim Lillington, 07.08.07 
  </span>At the altitude of the airport (336ft MSL) the reading was 1009.1 mbar. Sea level adjusted (QFF) pressure was
  1021.4mbs. With appropriate adjustment this could be compared with the 1350Z Alderney QNH surface pressure reading
  recorded in the CAA report (Appendix A).
</p>
<p> Sea level pressure QFF at Guernsey, 1021.4 mbar, is a shade higher (+0.4 mbar) than the QNH sea level pressure at
  Alderney. QNH pressure at Alderney was 1021 mbar, which is adjusted from the ground level reading by assuming the
  International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) pressure lapse rate of 27 ft/mbar, whereas QFF pressure at Guernsey (1021.4)
  is adjusted by using measured temperature. So if the actual pressure lapse rate exceeds ISA then QNH will
  underestimate sea level pressure relative to QFF; conversely, if the lapse rate is less than ISA it will overestimate
  it. In this case 336/(1021.4 - 1009.1 mbar) = 27.3 ft/mbar. So the true lapse rate here is very slightly greater than
  ISA and QNH will very slightly underestimate the pressure, probably accounting for the very small 0.4 mbar
  differential between QNH and QFF in a flat pressure field containing Guernsey and Alderney. We can interpret this to
  mean that there is no evidence of the pressure gradient between high pressure at the S end of Guernsey and low
  pressure at Alderney that would be expected to be associated with an orographic wave of the wavelength indicated.
</p>
<p> Capt Bowyer remarked to us that he has seen lenticularis many times when flying many routes and insists that he
  would not have been deceived by a lenticular cloud. With the benefit of 12 minutes observation both with naked eye and
  10x binoculars he described both objects as appearing to be "very sharply defined", and so bright as to appear
  self-luminous. A second witness described "very bright" white-yellow light as bright as a specular reflection of
  sunlight - "like the sun reflecting off glass". Another witness judged that the light was "brilliant . . . A lot
  brighter than a reflection of the sun would create." These estimates of brightness are not at all suggestive of
  daylight scattered by any ordinary cloud.
</p>
<p> We might be able to rescue the theory by assuming some unusual coronal effect. Coronas and iridescence have been
  seen in mountain clouds, an effect (sometimes called <em>irisation</em>) which could be relevant to perceived colour
  and brightness. Such coronas are explained as diffraction by water droplets (or small ice particles, but not in this
  instance) and so imply illumination from behind the cloud at a small angle to the line of sight.
</p>
<p> A bright corona would need illumination approaching zero degrees. In the present case a cloud would be directly
  illuminated at 45° to the line of sight. True, the limiting angle of diffraction is inversely proportional to droplet
  size, so a fine mist can diffract incident light through a larger angle than can large droplets; but unfortunately the
  brightness efficiency has an exactly opposite dependency, i.e., the intensity of the diffracted light is
  proportionately weaker, and the forward scattered intensity at such a large angle would be negligible. Coronal
  diffraction in cloud is normally only seen at all at scattering angles <40° And it does not seem that this could
  explain the reported yellow colouration anyway, since the dominant colours of wave cloud coronae are red and blue.
  Some observers have reported red and green, but not yellow <span class="note"> J. A. Shaw and P. J. Neiman, Coronas and iridescence in mountain wave clouds," Appl. Opt. 42, 476-485 (2003) 
https://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=ao-42-3-476</span>.
</p>
<p> Generally the iridescence seen in these coronae occurs in the region of low droplet density at the cloud edge rather
  than across the denser opaque body of the cloud. Our UAPs appeared uniformly bright (apart from the vertical "graphite
  grey" bands on each). One could try to speculate that in the present case a less well-developed lenticular cloud has a
  lower density overall, and is more like a translucent mist. But this seems in tension with the excellent lenticular
  definition required to explain the observed "sharply defined" edges <span class="note">  Given such a mist it is conceivable that a specular glint reflection from a distant sun-glitter pattern on the sea (for 
  example) might work as a secondary source of diffraction close to the line of sight. Such a scenario is discussed in 
Section 6d.</span>.
</p>
<p> With regard to shape and definition we should note that rotor or roll clouds are, as mentioned, turbulent vortex
  clouds occurring in parts of the mountain wave below the level of lenticular clouds. They are sometimes described as
  columnar "cumulus bar" clouds (or in higher/colder conditions than obtain in the present case they may occur as
  semi-transparent cylinders of thin cirrus sheets). They can have fairly well-defined edges, like their lenticularis
  cousins, and form with the horizontal roll axis lying perpendicular to the airflow <span class="note"> Ozawa, H., K. Goto-Azuma, K. Iwanami, and R.M. Koerner, 1998: Cirriform Rotor Cloud Observed on a
Canadian Arctic Ice Cap. Mon. Wea. Rev., 126, 1741-1745. https://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=getdocument&issn=1520-0493&volume=126&issue=06&page=1741#i1520-0493-126-6-1741-corby1</span>.
  Some similarity can be argued between the typically cylindrical form of roll clouds and the UAPs in this case. But
  similar problems arise.
</p>
<p> Would a series of unusually well-developed ("sharply defined") rotor clouds occur in isolation from their usual
  lenticular partners? These are the most energetic of mountain wave features, and seem rather less likely to occur
  given light winds and a very modest orographic barrier. Moreover the same red-blue-green coloration is likely to be
  observed in rotor cloud coronae <span class="note"> Ibid.</span>, although it is true that because they are usually
  associated with a turbulent layer extending to the ground in the lee of the barrier, they can often pick up dust
  particles and other debris, which might affect the diffraction properties of the cloud edges (but would tend to
  increase the optical thickness, further reducing any translucency in the body of the cloud).
</p>
<p> Howsoever no turbulent, low-level winds were recorded by met observers on Guernsey, or on Alderney although the
  latter lies close to where turbulence (or even a reversed surface wind direction) might indicate the rotor circulation
  under the second lee-wave peak (UAP#1). Neither were rotor clouds (or indeed any low clouds at all) recorded at either
  station. Guernsey's Senior Meteorological Officer Tim Lillington confirmed to us that only "normal" altocumulus at
  12,000ft was being observed <span class="note">"Alderney airport observers would not have made the distinction [between standard and lenticular altocumulus] as 
  they are not obliged to be that specific." (Email to Martin Shough from Tim Lillington ) Nevertheless they, like 
  Guernsey, reported no low level cloud at all.</span>. And of course the 18km wavelength consistent with the
  triangulated UAP positions remains anomalous in terms of the wind speed.
</p>
<p> We have searched satellite images in the visible and IR without seeing any persistent large phenomena in the area
  indicated. Although the best resolution (250m) is not available nearer than about 40 minutes before the start of the
  sighting, and there is then a broken veil of intervening high cirrus, no prominent compact clouds are discernable in
  the area. We found a rather bright cloud spot a few miles east of Guernsey on a Meteosat 8 visible light image timed
  at 1415Z and took note of an opinion given to us by Meteo-France (Centre de Météorologie Spatiale) that this could be
  "an orographic cloud development" <span class="note">Email from Pierre Blouch, Meteo-France, Brest, to Jean-Francois Baure, 12.07.2007</span>.
  However we were able to discount this possibility.
</p>
<p>Viewing successive images in a slideshow discloses that the cloud feature is actually developing before it reaches
  Guernsey (see Fig. 36), and moreover infra red cloud top data indicate that this is at about 15,000 ft, which appears
  to be confirmed by the fact that instead of following low level winds of a few knots it is moving rapidly from W to
  the E of Guernsey at about 35 knots (consistent with the UK Met Office Form 214 upper air forecast for 50°N 02°30'W,
  and the Jersey Airport local area aviation forecast, both of which show winds swinging 230-260° through this
  altitude).

<p>Whatever its origin this cloud was also far too high above the observers' near-horizontal or even depressed lines of
  sight to the UAPs. It was also moving in the wrong direction (W to E at ~0.75°/min) across the line of sight from the
  Trislander, which LOS rotates in the opposite sense (E to W) at about the same rate during the observation.
</p>
<p> In conclusion, the lenticular cloud theory seemed initially promising, but we are disappointed by it. It is true
  that certain factors would be easier to explain if we could place some such phenomenon at the location. For example,
  colouration, absolute brightness, and other factors aside, the relative brightnesses of the of objects as seen looking
  towards the sun from the NNE and away from the sun from the south ("brilliant yellow" and merely "yellow/beige"
  respectively) might be qualitatively consistent with the forward-scattering and back-scattering respectively off the
  top of a sunlit surface like a bright cloud. But there are a number of meteorological and other problems. Also let's
  recall that there were two of these "clouds" each with identical dark stripes 2/3 of the way along their length. We
  have considered the possibility of jet contrail or cloud shadow(s) lying across them. But it would be asking a great
  deal for the same contrail shadow to do the same trick on two small clouds 18 km (about 10nmi) apart.
