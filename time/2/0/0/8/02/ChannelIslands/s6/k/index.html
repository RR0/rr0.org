<p><a href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses/EQL/index.html">Earthquake lights</a> fall into the general category
  of "earthquake precursors", phenomena believed by geophysicists to be symptomatic of the building and discharging
  stresses that sometimes lead to earthquakes. These phenomena include electrical, visual, infrared and other possible
  signals, but the field is in general poorly understood and certain reported phenomena are controversial. Reports of
  unidentified lights have been associated anecdotally with earthquakes for centuries and today many geophysicists
  (although not all) accept that the association is real. But even now the exact causes and mechanisms remain obscure.
</p>
<p> Most observations of EQL are "white to bluish flashes or glows lasting several seconds associated with moderate to
  large earthquakes"
  <span class="note">Derr, J., '<a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learning/faq.php?categoryID=8&faqID=103">What are
    Earthquake Lights? Are they real?</a>', US Geological Survey FAQ.</span>. The largest study of modern EQL sightings
  dealt with more than 40 reported examples during the 1988-89 quakes in Saguenay, Quebec <span class="note">St-Laurent, France, 'The Saguenay, Quebec, Earthquake Lights of November 1988 - January 1989.'
    Seismological Research Letters, 71, no. 2, p. 160-174, 2000</span>. According to Derr they fell into 6 types of
  luminous phenomenon: "<q>(1) seismic lightning, (2) atmospheric luminous bands, (3) globular incandescent masses, (4)
    fire tongues, (5) seismic flames, and a newly-recognized category, (6) coronal or point discharges</q>." The 1995
  Kobe, Japan earthquake (Mag 6.9) produced 23 sightings within 50km of the epicenter <span class="note">Tsukuda, Tameshinge, 'Sizes and some features of luminous sources associated with the 1995 Hyogo-ken Nanbu 
    earthquake', Journal of Physics of the Earth, 45, no.2, p. 73-82, 1997.</span>. They were "<q>a white, blue, or
    orange light all with an upper height of 200 meters and a linear dimension of 1 to 8 km. The types of phosphorescent
    phenomena were classified as: lightning with zig-zag lines, swelling shield-shaped sources, upward-extending
    fan-shaped sources, or a belt of lights (including arcshaped sources)</q>"
  <span class="note">Derr, J., op.cit.</span>.
</p>
<p> On the night of July 27-28, 1976, many people in the area of Tangshan, northeast China, reported strange
  multicoloured lights and loud sounds. Some people reported flashes of light, others saw fireballs flying across the
  sky. These were followed by loud roaring sounds. Workers at Tangshan airport said the noises were louder than aircraft
  engines. Pets and farm animals were behaving very abnormally. At 3:42 am on the morning of Jul 28, a magnitude 7.8
  quake struck Tangshan and devastated the city, killing over 240,000 people. It was the deadliest earthquake of the
  century <span class="note">Chen Yong, et al., The Great Tangshan Earthquake of 1976: An Anatomy of Disaster (New York: Pergamon 
    Press, 1988) 53.</span>.
</p>
<p> Mechanisms proposed for EQL include piezoelectricity, heat of friction, sonoluminescence, phosphine gas emissions
  and more. Problems with the favoured electrical charge migration theories (such as the piezoelectric theory) have
  centred around getting a sufficient negative electron density to the surface through the rocks. A recent promising
  theory developed by Friedemann Freund of NASA suggests that EQLs are instead caused by positive hole charge carriers
  that turn rocks momentarily into p-type semiconductors <span class="note">143 Freund, Friedemann T., 'Rocks that Crackle and Sparkle and Glow: Strange Pre-Earthquake Phenomena'

    of Scientific Exploration, 17, no. 1, p. 37-71,2003.

      Charge Carriers in Rocks'. International Workshop on Seismo Electromagnetics (IWSE), 2005. 
      https://elfrad.com/FranceStLaurent_IWSE_2005.pdf</span>. Coronal or point discharges, such as were observed at
  Saguenay, are believed to be strong support for this positive hole theory. We consulted Prof. Freund during our
  investigation of the Channel Islands phenomena.
</p>
<p> The Channel area is not especially geologically active. After a notable quake below the Kent coast in 2007 (the
  strongest in the northeast Channel area since 1950 and the strongest inside the UK for 100 years) the British
  Geological Survey <span class="note"> https://www.earthquakes.bgs.ac.uk/earthquakes/reports/folkestone/folkestone_28_april_2007.htm</span>
  listed only a dozen quakes (of all magnitudes) within 50km of the new epicentre since 1328AD. It is therefore the more
  interesting that this 2007 earthquake occurred on April 27, only four days after the UAP sighting over the Channel
  Islands.
</p>
<p> Bearing in mind that the processes that eventuate in earthquakes develop with lead times of perhaps weeks or months,
  and that the deep geology of the English Channel might connect Alderney and the Kent coast, we considered that a
  related EQL four days earlier might be possible. With this in mind we looked at the geology and seismicity of the
  Channel Islands area.

<p>We found from Jersey Meteorological Dept/BGS records for the years 1996-2006 <span class="note"> https://www.jerseymet.gov.je/earthquake/earthquake_index.html</span>
  that the area is subject to a few earthquakes every year, mostly minor tremors of around Mag 1.0 or less, and mostly
  with epicentres near Jersey. The geological feature of most interest, however, was a fault or complex of faults known
  as the Alderney-Ushant fault system, passing down the Channel a few miles N of Alderney and extending in a NE-SW
  direction to the island of Ushant. And inside the boundaries of Alderney-Ushant system just NW of Alderney lies the
  deepest seafloor structure in the Channel, the Hurd Deep (Fig.38).
</p>
<p> We found ambiguous views about the geological origin of the Deep, recent opinion <span class="note"> G. Lericolais, P. Guennoc, J.-P. Auffret, J.-F. Bourillet and S. Berne, 'Detailed survey of the western end of the 
  Hurd Deep (English Channel): new facts for a tectonic origin', Geological Society, London, Special Publications 
  1996; v. 117; p. 203-215</span> seeming to favour a tectonic origin (i.e., a faulting origin) over earlier theories
  involving ancient tidal scouring. But a 1985 theory by Smith <span class="note"> Smith, A. J. 1985. 'A catastrophic origin for the paleovalley system of the eastern English Channel', Marine 
    Geology, 64, 65-75.</span> proposing a catastrophic origin in a massive North Sea breakthrough event that created
  the Channel by flood scouring seems newly relevant in the light of recent sonar studies that have identified
  characteristic scars of a "megaflood" on the sea floor <span class="note"> S. Gupta et al., Nature 448 (2007), pp 342-345</span>.
</p>
<p> The geology of the underlying faulted Channel bedrock is that of an ancient rift valley whose contours it appears
  determined the profile of the overlying chalk landbridge. Consequently there was relatively low ground here, and when
  the Rhine outflow caused the level of the ice-choked North Sea to rise a river system probably developed through the
  lower-lying parts of the chalk, beginning an erosion which accelerated until eventually (perhaps aided by an
  earthquake trigger) the sea broke catastrophically through the land bridge to scour the Channel. It appears that the
  Hurd Deep is also a pre-existing fault trough that may have been deepened by scouring and then choked by up to 140m of
  sedimentary infill to its present depth of 75m.
</p>
<p> The Kent quake at 0718Z, April 28, 2007, registered Richter Magnitude 4.2, and had an epicentre near Folkestone. It
  was followed by a series of nine Mag ~1.0 aftershocks until June 5. It occurred at a shallow depth (<5km) below the
  coast. The BGS moment tensor solution indicated nodal planes of the fault movement oriented either SSW-NNE or SE-NW.
  No tremors appear to have been reported in or near the Channel Islands, either then or around April 23, but it seemed
  possible to us that the Channel Islands area might be connected to the Kent coast area by this system of Channel
  faults and that associated tectonic stress might have built up in the underlying rocks near the Hurd Deep prior to the
  Folkestone earthquake.
</p>
<p> We also found varying opinions about this. We asked the opinion of Dr Roger Musson, British Geological Survey, who
  replied that he was not aware of EQLs occurring at such a great distance (330km) from a quake hypcentre and doubted
  the connection because of the small fractured volume in this case (order of 1km<sup>3</sup>) <span class="note"> Email from Roger Musson to Jean-Francois Baure, 25.06.07</span>.
  However Freund told us that stress can accumulate at 300km from the fracture and that it is very hard to place
  boundaries on the distribution of underground stress <span class="note"> Email from Friedemann Freund to Jean-Francois Baure, 22.05.07</span>.
  A study of the Saguenay EQL reports indicates 4 observations at ranges>160km, 2 at >200km <span class="note"> St-Laurent, France, 'The Saguenay, Quebec, Earthquake Lights of November 1988 - January 1989.'
    Seismological Research Letters, 71, no. 2, p. 160-174, 2000</span>. Freund regarded a tectonic origin as plausible
  in terms of his p-hole process, but "whether or not this situation is applicable to the reported sightings . . . of
  course I don't know" <span class="note"> Email from Friedemann Freund to Martin Shough, 25.05.07</span>. John Derr
  discussed the sighting report with Freund and with Canadian EQL experts St-Laurent and Theriault, and was more
  optimistic: "I think we agree that the sighting is highly likely to be precursory EQL," he told us, "and may lead to
  new insights into the mechanism of generation of these lights" <span class="note"> Email from John Derr to Jean-Francois Baure, 08.06.07</span>.
</p>
<p> We also looked for historical anecdotal evidence that local tectonic conditions might be favourable for EQLs. We
  could only find one EQ-related story <span class="note"> Although other reports of strange lights exist of course. For example, a 3-minute 1975 pilot sighting of "orange 
    lights" moving at ~500ft off the coast of Guernesey was reported in an MoD signal sent to the Defence Intelligence 
    office DI55 on 09 Oct 1975: <br>

The signal  was discovered recently by David Clarke during research at the National Archives, Kew (TNA ref DEFE 
  31/171, file ref D/DI55/1/15/1 Pt 9). We were unable to find a record of any seismic event in the Channel area near 
this date.</span>, recorded in 1843.
</p>
<p> At 7:30 pm on Dec 20, 1843, a "very remarkable meteor" was seen in the sky of Guernsey, a luminous body "like a
  clouded moon" moving slowly for 10-15 minutes. Two days later at 3:00 in the afternoon the hitherto bright sky filled
  with clouds that were strangely coloured with tints of green, red and purple. At 3:50 an earthquake struck, shaking
  buildings, ringing church bells and causing minor damage, whilst a loud undulating rumble was heard all over the
  island <span class="note"> Falla, G., <a href="https://www.bufora.org.uk/Default.aspx?tabid=72">The Remarkable Guernsey
    'Meteor' and Earthquake of 1843</a>, BUFORA, Aug 2007.</span>.
</p>
<p> One issue of possible relevance to the EQL theory is that our UAPs would apparently have been located over the
  ocean. In terms of some EQL theories this might be problematic. For example, friction heating or piezoelectric corona
  discharge would seem to require a rock-air interface to generate luminous bodies in the atmosphere. In any electron
  charge migration theory there is already a difficulty with the transport of sufficient charge to the surface of
  exposed rocks. Conceivably sparking stress fractures in rocks under the sea bed could emit radio waves, but these
  would be blocked or drastically attenuated <span class="note"> The extremely low (order of 10Hz) electromagnetic frequencies that are not quite effectively blocked by water 
    carry very little energy and to get enough of it through the conductive water blanket seems difficult to say the least. 
    Electrical breakdown causing corona discharge glows needs hundreds of thousands of V/cm at rock edges and 
    corners. Such gradients seem unlikely to arise from million-metre ELF waves weakly reaching the atmosphere over a 
    huge surface area of ocean.</span> by the overlying volume of water.
</p>
<p> The recent p-hole theory of Freund has attracted attention largely because it offers a promising alternative
  mechanism of charge migration in rock <span class="note"> The "holes" are defects in the negative electron structure of the crystal which can be treated as positive charges.</span>.
  This mechanism is, as he explained to us,"relatively trivial" <span class="note">  Email to Martin Shough from Friedemann Freund, 25.05.2007 "If positive hole charge carriers are activated in 
    an otherwise insulating dielectric medium, they throng to the surface. They build up a surface potential from which 
    we can calculate the electric field. If the concentration of positive holes is sufficiently high, the field can easily 
    exceed 500,000 V/cm, even on a flat surface, a value that invites speculations that air molecules should become 
    ionized (field-ionization, loosing an electron to the surface and become airborne as positive ions). About ten years 
    later [c.1994] I was able to experimentally show that this effect takes place and leads to luminous effects emerging 
    from edges and corners of rocks due to corona discharges in the air."</span> and probably could not circumvent the
  problems of more conventional corona discharge theories in the case of an EQL over water. However there is a second
  and more intriguing possibility "based on observations which suggest that the wavefunction associated with positive
  hole charge carriers is not localized on any one oxygen anion but spreads out over many oxygen anion positions, maybe
  as many as several hundred. If the number density of pholes reaches a threshold . . . the wavefunctions will begin to
  overlap and the system will undergo a transition from a weakly doped semiconductor state to a highly doped
  (quasi-metallic) plasma state. I have 'seen' this transition in a number of experiments . . . ." <span class="note"> Ibid.</span>
</p>
<p> The relevance of this mechanism to the Channel Islands UAPs is the possibility that a rapid build-up of tectonic
  stress in a small source-volume of the Earth's crust may lead to such a plasma state which becomes unstable and
  "bursts" outward through the surface. Freund speculates that some EQLs are such p-hole plasmas, and in answer to our
  questions he opined that "a shallow body of water would not be an impediment (I think) to the outburst of the plasma
  bubble". However he cautions that it is only "a plausible physical process (untested yet) that could explain part of
  the story" and there is as yet neither a theoretical nor an experimental basis for saying that large, stable, luminous
  shapes at altitude can be caused by such plasma outbursts - if indeed they occur <span class="note">Ibid.</span>.
</p>
<p> This theory raised some further questions in our minds. An unstable plasma propagating rapidly outward through the
  rock from the source volume would, one imagines, prefer to travel as an expanding wavefront of p-type plasmons
  radiating from this "hypcenter" to the "epicenter" (of the wave, not the quake), leading to a diminishing surface
  potential spreading outward from the epicenter. In this case the energy density at any region of the surface must be a
  tiny fraction of that at the source, in a short pulse, with a tendency to dissipate further in the air. We wondered
  how the stability and somewhat high energy density implied by the idea of a "plasma bubble" EQL might arise from the
  unstable dissipative process of a p-hole wave generated deep underground. What secondary mechanism(s) might be at
  work? Is it possible that the process recyles sufficiently fast to keep the EQL pumped, and if so is it possible to
  guess at the frequency? And/or is some sort of focusing mechanism possible owing to the underground configuration of
  charge carrying rocks?
</p>
<p> Prof. Freund replied that the answers to such questions are largely in the realm of speculation at the moment, but
  offered this very interesting suggestion <span class="note">Crediting the original idea to Robert Theriaux in discussion with himself, France St-Laurent and John Derr.</span>:
</p>
<p> I know from my lab experiments that pholes can (i) be activated in every igneous and high-grade metamorphic rock
  that I have had a chance to study in at least some detail, and (ii) propagate through such rocks. I also know that
  pholes cannot be activated in regular technical glass (window glass), but they can propagate through glass. However,
  pholes can neither be activated in marble nor propagate through marble. The reason (for which I have rather convincing
  crystallographic arguments) is that the structure of Ca-carbonate, the mineral calcite in marble, does not support the
  formation of the parent defects out of which pholes can be activated. What is true for Ca-carbonate must be true for
  other carbonates as well, in particular for Mg-carbonate magnesite, which is often (I have been told) associated with
  magmatic lamprophyres. Therefore the idea came up that the presence of lamprophyric dykes in the deep underground
  could constrain or 'focus' the flow of pholes in such a way as to more easily achieve the critical density necessary
  for entering into a plasma state. It would certainly be a worthwhile task to inspect geological maps of those places
  where EQLs have been observed whether there are any magmatic or sedimentary carbonates in the neighborhood
  <span class="note"> Email to Martin Shough from Friedemann Freund, 26.05.2007 </span>.
</p>
<p> We found out that lamprophyres are indeed present throughout the geologically-connected area (northern edge of the
  Massif Armoricain) containing north Brittany, Contentin, and the Channel Islands. All of the islands (with the
  exception of little Sark) contain
  lamprophyres <span class="note">C. J. D. Adams, '<a href="https://jgs.lyellcollection.org/cgi/reprint/132/3/233?ijkey=03c9785c0a1bc38bc62d68b32898e198222c8d36">Geochronology
    of the Channel Islands and adjacent French mainland</a>', Journal of the 
    Geological Society 1976; v. 132; p. 233-250; esp. Table 1, P.235</span>. These are relatively young rocks dating to
  the period of "Variscan plutonism" about 280-345MY ago and presumably overly many of the older igneous and ancient
  basement rocks, but we have not found a precise map of the distributions.
</p>
<p> It is possible that at least one of the triangulated UAP locations could have been close to the Casquets Rock, a
  small islet west of Alderney bearing the Casquets Lighthouse. What, we wondered, might be the effect of a p-hole wave
  reaching a rock/ocean boundary which is penetrated by an isolated rock/air discharge point in the form of an island -
  or nearly penetrated by a submarine seamount? How does the wave of positive holes behave when reaching the water, i.e.
  what possible ion transfer effects are there involving dissolved salts at the interface, and what happens a) in the
  deep region and b) at the rising seafloor around the island? Is it possible that the discharge-to-air route is a
  preferred minimum energy path and that the seabed potential is shunted towards the island, so that the island acts to
  "collect" and concentrate the current from a wide area?
</p>
<p> We were unable to find clear answers to such questions, although it seems likely that "the dielectric properties of
  the medium will play an enormous, if not controlling role in the 'bursting' of the bubble" <span class="note"> Email to Martin Shough from Friedemann Freund, 26.05.07: "Depending upon the dielectric constants of the 
    rocks in the deep underground, a propagating wavefront can be expected to be diffracted and/or focused in a way 
    that I don't even begin to understand. The fact that liquid water has a high dielectric constant of 81 (versus epsilon of 
    rocks being more in the 6-10 range), will certainly also have to enter into consideration."</span>. The p-hole
  theory is not yet well enough developed to predict where and in what form EQLs might be observed, even if the local
  geomorphology and seismic conditions were known in detail. But it is an intriguing possibility, and the proximity to
  the Alderney-Ushant fault, the probable presence of lamprophyre dykes in the vicinity, and the significant Kent
  earthquake just a few days later, are all at least circumstantial evidence. It also seems possible that an aerial
  plasma of this type would have a small radar cross-section at the centimetre wavelengths of ATC and weather radars
  (see Section 4).
</p>
<p> It is worth listing some of the negative indications: The persistence of UAP#1 for at least 12min; stability of form
  for 12min; "very sharply defined" binocular outline; extreme brightness in strong daylight (typical EQLs are not
  perceived as brilliant even at night, but as aurora-like glows); anisotropic luminous output (pale "yellow/beige" from
  the south; "very brilliant" from the north <span class="note">Note that Capt Patterson was initially unable to see anything, even when some 6nmi closer to the triangulated 
    location of UAP#1. At this time the depression angle from the Jetstream to UAP#1 would have been ~5.0°, reducing 
    at the sighting time to about 1.1° (UAP #2 would initially have been almost directly below the aircraft, latterly falling 
    almost directly behind.). It is not known whether the visibility of some type of EQL emission might be sensitive to 
    the elevation angle (and/or bearing angle) of viewing. Capt Bowyer's viewing angle remained much less than 5.0°
    (visually estimated max. -2.0° depression; calculated max. [Sect.3, Fig.8], 1.1° below geometrical horizon, reducing 
    through 0° to about +0.5°).</span>); yellowish or yellow-orange colour (blue or purplish colours - the
  colours of corona discharge - seem statistically favoured); apparent immobility for the whole observation period; all
  of the above duplicated in an identical (apart from angular size) UAP#2 for at least 6min; the "graphite grey" bands
  at the same position on each object; distance from dry land (in at least one case) by several nmi and 1500-2000ft of
  altitude.
</p>
<p> We are aware of no well-authenticated observation of EQL that reproduces even a few of these features. But given
  that the nature and mechanism of EQL is at best obscure it does not seem possible to do more than define the class of
  EQL phenomenologically, rather than physically. This being the case one does not know a priori whether a given
  observation should be excluded from the class or included to redefine the class. It is certain that reports of many
  types of aerial phenomena exist that find no comfortable home in any classification today but may do so in future.
</p>
<p> On this basis, and with a view to the striking coincidence of the Kent earthquake as well as the local geology, we
  cannot rule out novel EQL-related effects in this case.
