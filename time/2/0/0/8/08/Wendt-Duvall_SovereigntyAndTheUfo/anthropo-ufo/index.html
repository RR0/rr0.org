<p>Authoritative insistence on knowing the UFO only through ignorance is necessitated by the threat it poses to the
  anthropocentric metaphysics of modern rule. Within modern rule we focus specifically on sovereignty, but in our
  conceptualization sovereignty cannot be understood without reference to governmentality, which sets the normative
  context of sovereign decision. Thus, in what follows we both begin and end with governmentality, while keeping our
  remarks to a minimum in order to focus on the metaphysics of sovereignty per se. In doing so we recognize that the
  relationship between governmentality and sovereignty is contested among political theorists. Focused on the specific
  problem of the UFO taboo, we do not take sides in this debate except to accept the view that the two aspects of
  modern rule are intertwined.</p>
<section>
  <h3>Governmentality, Sovereignty, and the Exception</h3>
  <p>In thinking about the problem of rule, political scientists have traditionally focused on either individual
    agents or institutional structures, in both cases treating government as a given object. In contrast, Foucault’s
    concept of governmentality is focused on the “art of governing,” understood as the biopolitical “conduct of
    conduct” for a population of subjects <span class="source">Foucault, “Governmentality,” 11.</span> . Thus,
    governmentality concerns the specific regime of practices through which the population is constituted and
    (self-)regularized. “Modern” governmentality marks a shift in discourses of rule away from the state’s sovereign
    power— its ability to take life and/or render it bare—and toward its fostering and regularizing of life in
    biopolitics. The object of government is no longer simply obedience to the king, but regulating the conditions of
    life for subjects. To this end biopolitics requires that the conditions of life of the population be made visible
    and assayed, and practical knowledge be made available to improve them. As a result, with modern governmentality
    we see the emergence of both panoptic surveillance and numerous specialized discourses—of education, political
    economy, demography, health, morality, and others—the effect of which is to make populations knowable and subject
    to the regularization that will make for the “happy life.”</p>
  <p>A constitutive feature of modern governmentality is that its discourses are scientific, which means that science
    and the state are today deeply intermeshed. Through science the state makes its subjects and objects known,
    lending them a facticity that facilitates their regularization, and through the state science acquires
    institutional support and prestige. Despite this symbiosis, however, there is also an important epistemological
    difference between the two. Science seeks, but knows it can never fully achieve, “the” truth, defined as an
    apolitical, objective representation of the world. To this end it relies on norms and practices that produce an
    evolving, always potentially contested body of knowledge. The state, in contrast, seeks a regime of truth to which
    its population will reliably adhere. Standards for knowledge in that context privilege stability and normalization
    over the uncertain path of scientific truth. Although science and the state are allied in the modern UFO regime,
    we suggest in conclusion that this difference opens space for critical theory and resistance.</p>
  <p>Modern governmentality directs attention away from sovereign power and toward the socially diffuse practices by
    which it is sustained. Yet as Agamben reminds us <span class="source">See also Foucault, Society Must Be
        Defended.</span>, sovereignty remains important, because every regime of governmentality has outsides, even
    while exceeding the capacity for regularization. This outside is both external, in the form of actors not subject
    to normalization, and internal, in the form of people’s capacity to do otherwise (hence their need to be
    “governed”). Ordinarily these limits do not severely threaten modern rule, but some exceed the capacity for
    regularization.</p>
  <p>Schmitt calls such situations “states of exception”: “any severe economic or political disturbance requiring the
    application of extraordinary measures,” including abrogation of law by those who govern in its name <span
        class="source">Translator’s note in Schmitt, Political Theology, 5, footnote 1.</span>. Extending and
    modifying Schmitt’s analysis, Agamben emphasizes a “zone of indistinction” between the juridical order and the
    state of exception, which is neither fully in nor outside the law. Thus, while sometimes con- stitutionally
    recognized, the state of exception is “not a special kind of law,” but necessarily transcends the law <span
        class="source">Agamben, State of Exception, 4.</span> . In Sergei Prozorov’s terms, the state of exception is
    a “constitutive outside” or “excess” to law that is the latter’s condition of possibility <span
        class="source">Sergei Prozorov, “X/Xs: Toward a General Theory of the Exception,” Alternatives 30
        (2005): 81-112.</span>. As such, for Agamben (if not for Schmitt) a state of exception is always potentially
    there, even when not actually in force, permanently contaminating the law. On the other hand, the state of
    exception also belongs to the law, since it is by the latter’s limits and/or failure that it is known. States of
    exception cannot be declared willy-nilly, but must make sense within the regime of truth they would uphold. Thus,
    law and the exception are co-constitutive rather than mutually exclusive.</p>
  <p><q>Sovereign is he who decides the exception</q> <span class="source">Schmitt, Political Theology, 5.</span>.
    Like the state of exception it decides, sovereignty is both outside and inside law. On the one hand, it is the
    ability to found and suspend a juridical order. To that extent sovereignty transcends the law, its decisions
    seeming to come out of nowhere, like a <q>miracle</q> <span class="source">Ibid.</span>. In saying this Schmitt
    emphasizes sovereignty’s omnipotence, if not to realize its intentions then at least to decide them. However, even
    Schmitt recognizes that sovereign decision is not literally a miracle, but has conditions of possibility. Among
    Agamben’s contributions is in showing that those conditions include the very corpus of law that is to be suspended
    in the decision of the exception. In this way sovereignty is also inside and limited by law.</p>

<section>
  <h3>Anthropocentrism and the Undecidability of the UFO</h3>
  <p>If the limits of the governmental regime are exposed, the sovereign generally can be counted on to survey and to
    securitize the threat; that is after all what its sovereignty is for. In this light the UFO is the proverbial dog
    that didn’t bark, a potential threat not only un-securitized but never even properly surveyed. About the UFO, in
    short, there has been no decision as to its status as exception, only an ignoring. The reason, we argue, lies in
    the triple threat that the UFO poses to modern rule, at once physical, ontological, and metaphysical.</p>
  <p>Exceptions presuppose an exterior. Because modern rule is grounded in a scientific worldview that does not
    recognize the existence of supernatural phenomena, this exterior is normally understood today in purely spatio-
    temporal terms <span class="source">Agamben, State of Exception.</span>. Threats can then take two forms, physical
    threats to life and ontological threats to identity or social being <span class="source">On ontological
        security, see Jennifer Mitzen,“Ontological Security in World Politics,” European Journal of International
        Relations 12 (2006): 341-70.</span>. Given sovereignty’s need to transform the contingency of decision into
    taken-for-granted authority, it is only by reference to the intrusion of such threats into its field of visibility
    that the state of exception can be justified. Importantly, the sovereign cannot decide the terms of its encounters
    with these intrusions, only their status as exception.</p>
  <p>On one level the UFO is a traditional spatio-temporal threat, because one of the possibilities that we must
    countenance if we accept that the UFO is truly unidentified is that its occupants are ETs—and that threatens both
    the physical and ontological security of modern rule. The physical threat, of course, is that ET presence in “our”
    solar system would indicate a vastly superior technology to human beings’, raising the possibility of conquest and
    even extermination. (In this respect it matters greatly that They might be Here, rather than far away as in the
    SETI scenario.) The ontological threat is that even if the ETs were benign, their confirmed presence would create
    tremendous pressure for a unified human response, or world government. The sovereign identity of the modern state
    is partly constituted in and through its difference from other such states, which gives modern sovereignty its
    plural character. Any exteriority that required subsuming this difference into a global sovereignty would threaten
    what the modern state is, quite apart from the risk of physical destruction.</p>
  <p>It might be argued that these spatio-temporal threats alone can explain the UFO taboo. On this view, by virtue of
    the possibility that UFOs are ETs, the UFO calls into question the state’s claim to protect its citizens, which it
    would be unwilling to admit. Because the threat is so grave, the only rational response is to ignore the UFO.
    States are enabled in this policy by the fact that UFOs do not (yet) interfere with the conditions of life of
    human populations, and as such have not compelled recognition.</p>
  <p>However, at least two considerations militate against reducing the UFO threat to spatio-temporal terms. First,
    states show little reluctance to ignore other existential threats; if immigrants, pandemics, and terrorists are
    readily securitized, despite states’ inability to secure their populations from them, then why are not UFOs?
    Second, given that UFOs do not interfere with modern governance, and with no indication that states actually
    believe the ETH, the UFO would seem cynically to be an ideal securitization issue. Because it leaves physical
    traces it can be represented as if it were real, justifying the growth of state power, even as states know the
    threat is imaginary. To be sure states may have other worries—but then all the more reason to stage a UFO threat
    to bolster their capacities. Thus, Hollywood notwithstanding, in our view the threat of the UFO is not primarily
    alien invasion or the black helicopters of world government. Challenges to the “physics” of modern sovereignty are
    necessary conditions for the UFO taboo, but they are not sufficient.</p>
  <p>The UFO threat is different in the challenge it poses to the metaphysics of modern sovereignty, which are
    fundamentally anthropocentric <span class="note">In ufology, this is known as the “ontological shock” argument; we prefer “metaphys-
ical” to highlight the ways in which the UFO is presented within modern discourse as an almost supernatural
        phenomenon.</span>. Because the contemporary capacity to command political loyalty and resources depends upon
    it, the assumption of anthropocentrism must be unquestioned if modern rule is to be sustained as a political
    project. As a condition of their own sovereignty, therefore, before modern states can deal with threats to their
    physical and ontological security, they must first secure this metaphysic.</p>
  <p>How is this done? Sovereign decision is no help, since modern sovereignty can only instantiate an anthropocentric
    metaphysic, not step outside to decide the exception to it. So here modern sovereignty must give way to
    governmentality, or authoritative procedures to make anthropocentrism “known” as fact. In contrast to past
    processes of normalization in which the visions of shamans or seers were taken to be authoritative, the standards
    of knowledge in modern governmentality are primarily scientific. Thus, since there is no scientific evidence for
    miracles, it is known that God does not intervene in the material world. Similarly, since there is no evidence
    Nature has subjectivity, it is known not to. Anthropocentrism will be secure until scientific evidence to the
    contrary comes along.</p>
  <p>An unknown that incorporates the possibility of ETs confounds this metaphysical certainty, creating a situation
    in which its status as exception cannot be decided. We develop this suggestion using Derrida’s concept of <q>undecidability</q>
    <span class="source">Jacques Derrida, “Plato’s Pharmacy,” in Dissemination, trans. B.
        Johnson (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), 63-171.</span>, while arguing that the particular form
    undecidability takes in the UFO case disrupts its usual operation.</p>
  <p>Something is undecidable when it <q>does not conform to either polarity of a dichotomy, (for example,
    present/absent, cure/poison, and inside/outside)</q>, but is both at once <span
      class="source">Jack Reynolds,“Habituality and Undecidability: A Comparison of Merleau-Pontyand Derrida on the
        Decision,” International Journal of Philosophical Studies 10 (2002): 449-66, at 450.</span>. Perhaps
    confusingly, undecidability does not mean a decision cannot be made, but that a decision on which side of the
    binary an undecidable belongs is compelled. Undecidability is a <q>condition from which no course of action
      necessarily follows</q> <span class="source">Aletta Norval, “Hegemony after Deconstruction: The Consequences of Undecidability,” Journal of Political Ideologies 9 (2004): 139-57, at 143, quoting Ernesto Laclau.</span>
    , yet which requires a decision to resolve oscillation between dichotomous poles. The UFO is undecidable in this
    sense, and thus compels decision.</p>
  <p>However, to “decide” an exception it would seem necessary for the sovereign first to acknowledge the existence of
    a disturbance in its field of visibility and try to determine what the disturbance is. “Decision,” in other words,
    suggests an effort to know potential threats rather than merely reenact the norm, if only to make better
    decisions—yet states have made no meaningful effort to know the UFO. Disturbances may be acknowledged, but then
    states have mostly abjured a scientific standpoint in favor of public relations on behalf of the established
    regime of truth, re-affirming that We already know what these (unidentified) objects are (not). The effect is to
    constitute the UFO as un-exceptional, but not by <q>deciding</q> <span class="source">Here there is a direct
        contrast with conspiracy theories, which assume that a decision has been made. If so, then this part of our
        argument is wrong, although one might then fairly ask why the decision was kept secret.</span>.</p>
  <p>This suggests that we need to look more closely at the moment of transition from undecidability to the decision,
    or what Derrida calls the <q>logic of the palisade</q> <span class="source"> Ibid., 147.</span>, which in this
    case does not seem to be automatic. More specifically, we propose that the UFO compels a decision that, by the
    modern sovereign at least, cannot be made. The reason is the particular character of the UFO’s undecidability, at
    once potentially objective and subjective, each pole of which poses a metaphysical challenge to anthropocentric
    rule.</p>
  <p>On the one hand, UFOs appear indeed to be objects, not necessarily in the narrow sense of something hard and
    tangible, but in the broader sense of natural processes that produce physical effects. The effects are subtle and
    elusive, which means that UFOs are not unambiguously objects, but radar anomalies and other physical traces
    suggest something objective is going on.</p>
  <p>As unidentified object the UFO poses a threat of unknowability to science, upon which modern sovereignty depends.
    Of course, there are many things science does not know, like the cure for cancer, but its authority rests on the
    assumption that nothing in Nature is in principle unknowable. UFOs challenge modern science in two ways: (1) they
    appear random and unsystematic, making them difficult to grasp objectively; and (2) some appear to violate the
    laws of physics (like the 40g turns in the Belgian F-16 case). This does not mean that UFOs are in fact humanly
    unknowable, but they might be, and in that respect they haunt modern sovereignty with the possibility of epistemic
    failure. To see how this might be uniquely threatening it is useful to compare the UFO to three other cases of
    what might be seen as unknowability.</p>
  <p>One is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in quantum theory, which acknowledges inherent limits on the ability
    to know sub-atomic reality. Since the Uncertainty Principle has not stopped physicists from doing physics, this
    might seem to undermine our claim that potential unknowability precludes a decision on the UFO as object. Yet,
    there are known unknowns and unknown unknowns, and here the two cases differ. Quantum mechanics emerged in a
    highly structured context of extant theory and established experimental results, and is a systematic body of
    knowledge that enables physicists to manipulate reality with extraordinary precision. With quantum theory we know
    exactly what we cannot know, enabling it to be safely incorporated into modern science. The UFO, in contrast,
    emerges in a context free of extant theory and empirical research, and raises fundamental questions about the
    place of human beings in the universe. That we might never know what we cannot know about UFOs makes their
    potential objectivity more problematic for the modern project.</p>
  <p>A different problem is presented by God, whose existence science also declaims ability to know. Once fiercely
    contested, the notion that God can be known only through faith not reason is today accepted by religious and
    secular authorities alike. Since God is not potentially a scientific object, science does not consider the
    question to be within its purview. Miracles are recognized by the Church, but the criteria by which they are made
    authoritative are not primarily scientific. UFOs, in contrast, leave unexplained physical traces and as such fall
    directly within the purview of modern science <span class="source">cf. Edward Berryman, “Taking Pictures of
        Jesus: Producing the Material Presence of a Divine Other,” Human Studies 28 (2006): 431-52.</span>. It is one of
    the ironies of modern rule that it is far more acceptable today to affirm publicly one’s belief in God, for whose
    existence there is no scientific evidence, than UFOs, the existence of which—whatever they might be—is physically
    documented.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the best analogue to the epistemic threat posed by UFO objectivity is extra-sensory perception or “psi.”
    Here we have a subtle and elusive phenomenon that might be objective, and which raises similar worries about
    unknowability for the modern episteme <span class="source">See Robert Jahn and Brenda Dunne, “The PEAR Proposition,” Journal of Scientific Exploration 19 (2005): 195-245.</span>.
    And here too we see tremendous resistance from the scientific community to taking it seriously. Nevertheless, and
    interestingly, psi research has been undertaken by states <span
        class="source">For purposes of espionage, by the United States and Soviet Union during the cold war; Russell
        Targ and Harold Puthoff, Mind-Reach (Charlottesville, VA: Hampton Roads, 2005).</span>, suggesting that
    potential unknowability by itself does not preclude sovereign decision, if, were the phenomenon to become known,
    it could serve human purposes.</p>
  <p>Indeed, were the UFO merely an object, it is hard to see that its potential unknowability would preclude a
    decision on its status as exception. Qua object, and only object, the UFO threatens neither the physical nor the
    ontological security of modern rule, which we have argued are necessary conditions for the metaphysical threat
    from UFOs to be realized (in this respect the UFO contrasts interestingly with the possibility of catastrophic
    asteroid impacts, which in fact has been recently constituted as a physical threat) <span
        class="source">Felicity Mellor, “Colliding Worlds: Asteroid Research and the Legitimization of War in
        Space,” Social Studies of Science 37 (2007): 499-531.</span>. As with other anomalies there might be
    sociological resistance to seeing UFOs, but if science does its job properly, the resistance should break down and
    a serious effort to identify UFOs eventually undertaken.</p>
  <p>Unlike some objects, however, the UFO might also have subjectivity (ETs). In itself non-human subjectivity need
    not be a problem for anthropocentric sovereignty. Although modernity is constituted by a general de-animation of
    Nature, debates about animal consciousness raise anew the possibility that subjectivity is not limited to humans
    <span class="source">Bernard Baars, “Subjective Experience is Probably Not Limited to Humans: The Evidence from Neurobiology and Behavior,” Consciousness and Cognition 14 (2005): 7-21.</span>.
    However, while it may generate anxiety <span class="source">Raymond Corbey, The Metaphysics of Apes (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2005).</span>
    , animal subjectivity does not threaten modern rule either physically or ontologically. Superior intelligence
    enabled humans long ago to domesticate animals, ensuring that any subjectivity they might have will lie safely
    “beneath” human rule. By virtue of being in the solar system, in contrast, ETs might have vastly superior
    intelligence, literally “above” human rule, and thus be sovereign deciders in their own right. To our knowledge no
    ETs have shown themselves, which means the UFO is not unambiguously subjective (either), but the failure of
    science to justify ruling out the ETH leaves open the possibility, and that clearly does threaten
    anthropocentrism. As potential subject, then, the UFO radically relativizes modern sovereignty, disturbing its
    homologous character with the threat of unimagined heterogeneity, the sovereignty of the fully alien (non-human)
    Other.</p>
  <p>In short, the UFO poses threats to modern rule on both poles of the object–subject dichotomy that constitutes its
    undecidability, making a decision in favor of one or the other intrinsically problematic. These threats are
    metaphysical in the sense of raising epistemological and ontological doubts about the whole anthropocentric idea
    of modern rule, not just its realizations in actually existing states—and it is the absolute taken-for-
    grantedness of that idea upon which the ability to mobilize modern power depends. From the standpoint of modern
    rule, therefore, the threat of the UFO is not unlike that of the Christian’s Second Coming, a potential mate-
    rialization of the metaphysical.</p>
  <p>It is the triple threat of the UFO that explains states’ very different response to it compared to other
    disruptions of modern norms. By calling into question the very basis of the modern sovereign’s capacity to decide
    its status as exception, the UFO cannot be acknowledged as truly unidentified— which is to say potentially
    ET—without calling into question modern sovereignty itself. Thus, far from being a deus ex machina that, through
    the decision, intervenes miraculously to safeguard the norm, modern sovereignty is shown by the UFO to be itself a
    norm, of anthropocentrism—and behind this norm no further agency stands. In this way the UFO exhibits not the
    standard undecidability that compels a decision, but what might be called a “meta”-undecidability which precludes
    it. The UFO is both exceptional and not decidable as exception, and as a result with respect to it the modern
    sovereign is performatively insecure. The insecurity is not conscious, but operates at the deeper level of a
    taboo, in which certain possibilities are unthinkable because of their inherent danger. In this respect UFO
    skepticism is akin to denial in psychoanalysis: the sovereign represses the UFO out of fear of what it would
    reveal about itself <span class="source">Carl Jung, Flying Saucers (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press,
        1978). This invites a Lacanian reading of the UFO as <q>the Real</q>.</span>. There is therefore nothing for the
    sovereign to do but turn away its gaze from—to ignore, and hence be ignorant of—the UFO, making no decision at
    all. Just when needed most, on the palisades, the sovereign is nowhere to be found.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Governmentality and the UFO Taboo</h3>
  <p>To this point we have concentrated on the question of “why?” the UFO taboo, in response to which we have offered
    a structural answer about the logic of anthropocentric sovereignty. However, there is a separate question of
    “how?” the taboo is produced and reproduced, since structural necessity alone does not make it happen. It takes
    work—not the conscious work of a vast conspiracy seeking to suppress the truth about UFOs, but the work of
    countless undirected practices that in the modern world make the UFO “known” as not-ET. Bringing our argument full
    circle, this is the work of modern governmentality, upon which the normalization of the UFO is thrown back by the
    absent sovereign. Yet this work too is problematic, because modern governmentality usually proceeds by making
    objects visible so they can be known and regularized, which in the UFO case would be self-subverting. Thus, what
    are needed are techniques for making UFOs known without actually trying to find out what they are.</p>
  <p>One might distinguish at least four such techniques: (1) authoritative representations, like the U.S. Air Force’s
    claim that UFOs are <q>not a national security threat</q> <span class="source">Dolan, UFOs and the National
        Security State, 193-203.</span>, the portrayal of ufology as pseudo-science, and the science fictionalization of
    UFOs in the media; (2) official inquiries, like the 1969 Condon Report, which have the appearance of being
    scientific but are essentially “show trials” systematically deformed by a priori rejection of the ETH <span
        class="source">The only nominally scientific study of UFOs in the United States was the politicized
and methodologically flawed 1969 Condon Report; Edward Condon and Daniel Gillmor, eds., Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1969). For critiques of the Report see David Saunders and Roger Harkins, UFOs? Yes! Where the Condon Committee Went Wrong (New York: World Publishing, 1968); J. Allen Hynek, The UFO Experience
 (New York: Marlowe, 1972); James MacDonald, “Science in Default: Twenty-two Years of Inadequate UFO Investigations,” in UFOs—A Scientific Debate, ed. Carl Sagan and Thornton Page (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1972), 52-122; and Peter Sturrock, “An Analysis of the Condon Report on the Colorado UFO Project,” Journal of Scientific Exploration 1 (1987): 75-100.</span>
    ; (3) official secrecy, which <q>removes knowledge</q> from the system <span class="source">Peter Galison, “Removing Knowledge,” Critical Inquiry 31 (2004): 229-43. On UFO
secrecy, see especially Dolan, UFOs and the National Security State; and, for the official view, Gerald Haines, “CIA’s Role in the Study of UFOs, 1947-1990,” Intelligence and National Security 14 (1999): 26-49; and Charles Ziegler, “UFOs and the US Intelligence Community,” National Security 14 (1999): 1-25.</span>
    ; and finally (4) discipline in the Foucauldian sense, ranging from formal attacks on the “paranoid style” of UFO
    believers as a threat to modern rationality <span class="source">For introductions to this literature, see
        Dean, Aliens in America; and Jack Bratich, “Making Politics Reasonable: Conspiracism, Subjectification, and
        Governing Through Styles of Thought,” in Foucault, Cultural Studies, and Governmentality, ed. J. Bratich, J. Packer, and C. McCarthy (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2003), 67-100.</span>,
    to everyday dismissal of those who express public interest in UFOs, which generates a “spiral of silence” in which
    individuals engage in self-censorship instead <span class="source"> Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, The Spiral of
        Silence, 2nd ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993).</span>.</p>
  <p>Much could be said from a governmentality perspective about these techniques, which are amply documented in the
    ufological literature, but we lack the space to do so here. Instead, we have focused on explaining why all this
    anti-UFO work is necessary in the first place, which goes to the fundamental puzzle with which we began our
    argument: given the many reasons to study UFOs, why aren’t they taken seriously? To answer this question the
    specific techniques by which the UFO is normalized can be a distraction, since ignorance is multiply realizable at
    the micro-level. Notwithstanding the importance of governmentality to a critical theory of anthropocentric rule,
    it is to the performative insecurity of modern sovereignty that one must look first.</p>
