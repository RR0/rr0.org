<p>Our argument is that UFO ignorance is political rather than scientific. To motivate this argument, however, we
  first need to critique UFO “skepticism” as science <span class="source">The widely used phrase is misleading, however, because “skepticism” should imply doubt but openness, whereas in UFO discourse it has been deformed into positive denial.</span>.
  Science derives its authority from its claim to discover, before politics, objective facts about the world. Since
  today these putative facts include that UFOs are not ETs, we have to show that this fact is not actually scientific.
</p>
<p>We consider very briefly the strongest arguments for UFO skepticism and show that none justifies rejection of the
  ET hypothesis (ETH). Indeed, they do not come close <span class="source">See especially Jacques Vallee and Janine Vallee, Challenge to Science: The UFO Enigma (Chicago: Henry Regnery, 1966); McDonald, “Science in Default”; Hynek, The UFO Experience; and Michael Swords, “Science and the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis in Ufology,” Journal of UFO Studies 1 (1989): 67-102.</span>.
  It is not known, scientifically, that UFOs are not ETs, and to reject the ETH is therefore to risk a Type II error
  in statistics, or rejecting a true explanation. Of course, this does not mean that UFOs are ETs, either (inviting a
  Type I error), but it shifts the burden of proof onto skeptics to show that a Type II error has not been made <span
      class="source">cf. John Lemons, Kristin Shrader-Frechette, and Carl Cranor, “The Precautionary Principle: Scientific Uncertainty and Type I and Type II Errors,” Foundations of Science 2 (1997): 207-36.</span>.
  The UFO taboo is then puzzling, and open to political critique.</p>
<section>
  <h3>“There is No Evidence”</h3>
  <p>Echoing Hume’s discussion of miracles, Carl Sagan once said about UFOs that <q>extraordinary claims require
    extraordinary evidence</q>, and the empirical evidence for the <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses/intelligence/HET">ETH</a> is certainly not that. If there is any ET
    signal in the noise of UFO reports it is very weak. However, some evidence warrants reasonable doubt.</p>
  <section>
    <h4>Physical evidence</h4>
    <p>Usually the first objection to the ETH is the lack of direct physical evidence of alien presence. Some ET
      believers contest this, claiming that the U.S. government is hiding wreckage from a <a
          href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell">1947 crash at Roswell</a>, New Mexico, but such claims
      are based on conspiracy theories that we shall set aside here. Not because they are necessarily wrong (although
      they cannot be falsified in the present context of UFO secrecy), but because like UFO skepticism they are
      anthropocentric, only now We know that UFOs are ETs but “They” (the government) aren’t telling. Such an
      assumption leads critique toward issues of official secrecy and away from the absence of systematic study, which
      is the real puzzle. In our view secrecy is a symptom of the UFO taboo, not its heart.</p>
    <p>While there is no direct physical evidence for the ETH, however, there is considerable indirect physical
      evidence for it, in the form of UFO anomalies that lack apparent conventional explanations—and for which ETs are
      therefore one possibility <span class="source">IllobrandvonLudwiger,BestUFOCases—Europe(LasVegas,NV:NationalInstitute for Discovery Science, 1998); and Peter Sturrock, The UFO Enigma (New York: Warner Books, 1999).</span>.
      These anomalies take four forms: ground traces, electro-magnetic interference with aircraft and motor vehicles,
      photographs and videos, and radar sightings like the Belgian F-16 case. Such anomalies cannot be dismissed
      simply because they are only indirect evidence for ETs, since science relies heavily on such evidence, as in the
      recent discovery of over 300 extra-solar planets (and counting) <span class="source">Peter Kosso, “Detecting Extrasolar Planets,” Studies in History and Philosophy of Science 37 (2006): 224-36.</span>.
      For if UFO anomalies are not potentially ETs, what else are they?</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h4>Testimonial evidence</h4>
    <p>Most UFO reports consist primarily of eyewitness testimony. Although all observation is in a sense testimonial,
      by itself testimony cannot ground a scientific claim unless it can be replicated independently, which UFO
      testimony cannot. Such testimony is problematic in other respects as well. It reports seemingly impossible
      things, much is of poor quality, witnesses may have incentives to lie, honest observers may lack knowledge, and
      even experts can make mistakes. In view of these problems skeptics dismiss UFO testimony as meaningless.</p>
    <p>Problems notwithstanding, this conclusion is unwarranted. First, testimony should not be dismissed lightly,
      since none of us can verify for ourselves even a fraction of the knowledge we take for granted <span
          class="source">Peter Lipton, “The Epistemology of Testimony,” Studies in History and Philosophy of Science 29 (1998): 1-31.</span>.
      In both law and social science, testimony has considerable epistemic weight in determining the facts. While
      sometimes wrong, given its importance in society, testimony is rejected only if there are strong reasons to do
      so. Second, there is a very large volume of UFO testimony, with some events witnessed by literally thousands of
      people. Third, some of these people were “expert witnesses”—civilian and military pilots, air traffic
      controllers, astronauts, astronomers, and other scientists. Finally, some of this testimony is corroborated by
      physical evidence, as in “radar/visual” cases.</p>
    <p>In short, the empirical evidence alone does not warrant rejecting the ETH. It does not warrant acceptance
      either, but this sets the bar too high. The question today is not “Are UFOs ETs?” but “Is there enough evidence
      they might be to warrant systematic study?” By demanding proof of ETs first, skeptics foreclose the question
      altogether.</p>
  </section>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>“It Can’t Be True”</h3>
  <p>
    Given the inconclusiveness of the empirical record, UFO skepticism ultimately rests on an a priori theoretical
    conviction that ET visitation is impossible: “It can’t be true, therefore it isn’t.” Skeptics offer four main
    arguments to this effect.</p>
  <section>
    <h4>“We are alone.”</h4>
    <p>Philosophers have long debated whether life exists beyond Earth <span class="source">Michael Crowe, The
        Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750-1900 (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1988).</span>, but the
      debate has lately intensified in response to empirical discoveries like extra-solar planets, water on Mars, and
      “extremophile” organisms back home. A thriving discipline of astrobiology has emerged, and the view that life
      exists elsewhere seems poised to become scientific orthodoxy. However, this does not mean that (what humans
      consider) intelligent life exists. The only evidence of that, human beings, proves merely that intelligence like
      ours is possible, not probable. The Darwinian “Rare Earth hypothesis” holds that because evolution is a
      contingent process, human intelligence is a random accident, and the chances of finding it elsewhere are
      therefore essentially zero <span class="source">Peter Ward and David Brownlee, Rare Earth (New York:
          Copernicus Books, 2000).</span>.</p>
    <p>This is a serious argument, but there is a serious argument on the other side too, going on within evolutionary
      theory itself, where the neo-Darwinian orthodoxy is today being challenged by complexity theorists <span
          class="source">Stuart Kauffman: <em>At Home in the Universe</em> (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1995)
          .</span>. Rather than contingency and randomness, complexity theory highlights processes of selforganization
      in Nature which tend toward more complex organisms. If the “law of increasing complexity” is correct then
      intelligent life might actually be common in the universe. Either way, today it is simply not known.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h4>“They can’t get here.”</h4>
    <p>Even if intelligent life is common, skeptics argue it is too far away to get here. Relativity theory says
      nothing can travel faster than the speed of light (186,000 miles per second). Lower speeds impose a temporal
      constraint on ET visitation: at .001 percent of light speed, or 66,960 miles per hour—already far beyond current
      human capabilities—it would take 4,500 Earth years for ETs to arrive from the nearest star. Higher speeds, in
      turn, impose a cost and energy constraint: to approximate light speed a spaceship would need to use more energy
      than is presently consumed in an entire year on Earth.</p>
    <p>Physical constraints on inter-stellar travel are often seen as the ultimate reason to reject the ETH, but are
      they decisive? Computer simulations suggest that even at speeds well below light the colonization wave-fronts of
      any expanding ET civilizations should have reached Earth long ago <span class="source">Martyn Fogg, “Temporal Aspects of the Interaction Among the First Galactic
Civilizations,” Icarus 69 (1987): 370-84.</span>. How long ago depends on what assumptions are made, but even
      pessimistic ones yield ET encounters with Earth within 100 million years, barely a blip in cosmic terms. In
      short, ETs should be here, which prompts the famous “Fermi Paradox,” “Where are They?” <span
          class="source">Stephen Webb, Where is Everybody? (New York: Copernicus Books, 2002).</span>
    </p>
    <p>Additionally, there are growing, if still highly speculative, doubts that the speed of light is truly an
      absolute barrier <span class="source">J.Deardorff,B.Haisch,B.Maccabee,andH.E.Puthoff,“Inflation-TheoryImplications
          for Extraterrestrial Visitation,” Journal of the British Interplanetary Society 58 (2005): 43-50.</span>.
      Wormholes—themselves predicted by relativity theory—are tunnels through space-time that would immensely shorten
      the distances between stars. And then there is the possibility of “warp drive,” or engineering the vacuum around
      a spaceship, enabling it to skip over space without time dilation <span class="source">H. E. Puthoff, S. R. Little, and M. Ibison, “Engineering the Zero-Point Field and Polarizable Vacuum for Interstellar Flight,” Journal of the British Interplanetary Society 55
          (2002): 137-44.</span>. Speculative as these ideas are, their scientific basis is sufficiently sound that
      research is currently being funded through the “Breakthrough Propulsion Program” at NASA. They may prove to be
      wrong or beyond human capacity. But if humans are imagining them just 300 years from our scientific revolution,
      what might ETs 3,000 years, much less 3,000,000, from theirs be imagining?</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h4>“They would land on the White House lawn.”</h4>
    <p>If ETs came all this way to see us, why don’t they land on the White House lawn and introduce themselves? After
      all, if humans encounter intelligent life in our own space exploration, that’s what we would do. On this view,
      the fact that ETs have not is evidence they are not here.</p>
    <p>But is it? Again there is debate. The “embargo” or “zoo hypothesis” suggests that ETs might have quarantined
      Earth as a wildlife preserve <span class="source">John
          Ball: “The Zoo Hypothesis,”Icarus 19(1973): 347-49; J.Deardorff, “Examination of the Embargo Hypothesis as
          an Explanation for the Great Silence,” Journal of the British Interplanetary Society 40 (1987): 373-79.</span>.
      Or, ETs might be interested in contact, but want humans to discover their presence ourselves to avert a violent
      shock to our civilization. Finally, even humans might not land on the White House lawn. In the popular science
      fiction show Star Trek, the Federation maintains a policy of “non-interference” toward lower life forms; might
      not real space-faring humans adopt a similar policy? Whatever the answer, debates about ET intentions have no
      scientific basis.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h4>“We would know.”</h4>
    <p>The last skeptical argument is an appeal to human authority: with its panoptic surveillance of the skies the
      modern state would know by now if ETs were here. Of course, conspiracy theorists think the state does know, but
      there is no need to embrace this debatable proposition to call the skeptical argument into question. First,
      skepticism assumes an ability to know the UFO that may be unwarranted. If ETs have the capability to visit
      Earth, then they may be able to limit knowledge of their presence. Second, no authority has ever actually looked
      for UFOs, the effect of which on what is seen should not be under-estimated. Finally, in view of pervasive UFO
      secrecy more is probably known about them than is publicly acknowledged. This does not mean what is known is ET,
      but it could provide further reason to think so.</p>
    <p>Given the stakes, ignoring UFOs only makes sense if human beings can be certain they are not ETs. We have shown
      there is more than reasonable doubt: the ETH cannot be rejected without significant risk of Type II error. What
      is actually known about UFOs is that we have no idea what they are, including whether they are alien; far from
      proving UFO skepticism, science proves its ignorance. With so little science on either side, therefore, the UFO
      controversy has been essentially theological, pitting ET believers against unbelievers. In this fight, the
      unbelievers have secured the authority of science, giving them decisive advantage. Their views are taken as
      fact, while those of believers and agnostics are dismissed as irrational belief. Since science does not actually
      justify rejecting the ETH, why would unbelief be so hegemonic? The UFO taboo is puzzling, we submit, and demands
      a deeper look at how its “knowledge” is produced.
