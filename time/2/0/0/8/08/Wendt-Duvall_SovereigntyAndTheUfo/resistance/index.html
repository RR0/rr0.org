<p>We have called ours a “critical” theory, in that it rests on a normative assumption that the limits of modern rule
  should be exposed. In the present context this means that human beings should try to know the UFO. Although we
  believe the case for this presumption is over-determined and overwhelming, it is not a case we can make here.
  Nevertheless, it seems incumbent upon us to follow through on the practical logic of our theory, so taking its
  desirability as given, in conclusion we address the question of resistance to the UFO taboo.</p>
<p>We have called ours a “critical” theory, in that it rests on a normative assumption that the limits of modern rule

  believe the case for this presumption is over-determined and overwhelming, it is not a case we can make here.
  Nevertheless, it seems incumbent upon us to follow through on the practical logic of our theory, so taking its
  desirability as given, in conclusion we address the question of resistance to the UFO taboo.</p>
<p>The structuralism of our argument might suggest that resistance is futile. However, the structure of the UFO taboo
  also has aporias and fissures that make it—and the anthropocentric structure of rule that it sustains—potentially
  unstable.</p>
<p>One is the UFO itself, which in its persistent recurrence generates an ongoing need for its normalization. Modern
  rule might not recognize the UFO, but in the face of continuing anomalies maintaining such nonrecognition requires
  work. In that respect the UFO is part of the constitutive, unnormalized outside of modern sovereignty, which can be
  included in authoritative discourse only through its exclusion.</p>
<p>Within the structure of modern rule there are also at least two fissures that complicate maintaining UFO ignorance.
  One is the different knowledge interests of science and the state. While the two are aligned in authoritative UFO
  discourse, the state is ultimately interested in maintaining a certain regime of truth (particularly in the face of
  metaphysical insecurity), whereas science recognizes that its truths can only be tentative. Theory may be stub-
  born, but the presumption in science is that reality has the last word, which creates the possibility of scientific
  knowledge countering the state’s dogma.</p>
<p>The other fissure is within liberalism, the constitutive core of modern governmentality. Even as it produces
  normalized subjects who know that “belief” in UFOs is absurd, liberal governmentality justifies itself as a dis-
  course that produces free-thinking subjects who might doubt it <span class="source">Bratich, “Making Politics Reasonable.”</span>.
  It is in this context that we would place the recent disclosure by the French government (and at press time the
  British too) of its long-secret UFO files ({{1600|number}} reports), including its investigations of selected cases,
  of which the French acknowledge 25 percent as unexplained <span class="source">See www.cnes-geipan.fr. The 25 percent figure is comparable to the 30 percent unex- plained cases acknowledged by the Condon Report.</span>
  . Given that secrecy is only a contingent feature of the UFO taboo, and that even the French are still far from
  seeking systematic knowledge of UFOs, this disclosure is not in itself a serious challenge to our argument. However,
  the French action does illustrate a potential within liberalism to break with authoritative common sense <span
      class="note">In terms of the taxonomy of ignorance developed by Tuana in “The Speculum of Ignorance,” the French
      and British actions might move them into the category of “knowing that we do not know, but not caring to know.” That is progress insofar as it enables subsequent knowing, but whether it will remains to be seen.</span>,
  even at the risk of exposing the foundations of modern sovereignty to insecurity.</p>
<p>The kind of resistance that can best exploit these fissures might be called militant agnosticism. Resistance must
  be agnostic because by the realist standards of modernity, regarding the UFO/ET question neither atheism nor belief
  is epistemically justified; we simply do not know. Concretely, agnosticism means “seeing” rather than ignoring the
  UFO, taking it seriously as a truly unidentified object. Since it is precisely such seeing that the UFO taboo
  forbids, in this context seeing is resistance. However, resistance must also be militant, by which we mean public
  and strategic, or else it will indeed be futile. The reproduction of UFO ignorance depends crucially on those in
  positions of epistemic authority observing the UFO taboo. Thus, private agnosticism—of the kind moderns might have
  about God, for example—is itself part of the problem. Only breaking the taboo in public constitutes genuine
  resistance.</p>
<p>Even that is not enough, however, as attested by the long history of unsuccessful resistance to the UFO taboo to
  date <span class="source">See, for example, Ann Druffel, Firestorm: Dr. James E. McDonald’s Fight for UFO Science
      (Columbus, NC: Wild Flower Press, 2003); and, inter alia, Dolan, UFOs and the National Security State.</span>. The
  problem is that agnosticism alone does not produce knowledge, and thus reduce the ignorance upon which modern
  sovereignty depends. For a critical theory of anthropocentric rule, therefore, a science of UFOs ironically is
  required, and not just a science of individual cases after the fact, which can tell us only that some UFOs lack
  apparent conventional explanations. Rather, in this domain what is needed is paradoxically a systematic science, in
  which observations are actively sought in order to analyze patterns from which an intelligent presence might be
  inferred <span class="source">For example, Scot Stride, “An Instrument-Based Method to Search for Extraterrestrial
      Interstellar Robotic Probes,” Journal of the British Interplanetary Society 54 (2001): 2-14.</span> . That would
  require money, infrastructure, and a long-term commitment of the kind that to date has been possible only for
  epistemic authorities, or precisely those actors most resistant to taking UFOs seriously. Still, given the potential
  disjunction of interest between science and the state, it is possible here for science to play a key role for
  critical theory. Whether such a science would actually overcome UFO ignorance is unknowable today, but it is only
  through it that We might move beyond the essentially theological discourse of belief and denial to a truly critical
  posture. Modern rule and its metaphysics are extraordinarily resilient, so the difficulties of such resistance
  cannot be overstated. Those who attempt it will have difficulty funding and publishing their work, and their
  reputations will suffer. UFO resistance might not be futile but it is certainly dangerous, because it is resistance
  to modern sovereignty itself. In this respect militant UFO agnosticism is akin to other forms of resistance to
  governmentality; however, whereas sovereignty has found ways of dealing with them, the UFO may reveal an Achilles
  heel. Like Achilles, the modern sovereign is a warrior whose function is to protect—in this case, from threats to
  the norm. Unlike conventional threats, however, the UFO threatens humans’ capacity to decide those threats, and so
  cannot be acknowledged without calling modern sovereignty itself into question. To what extent that would be
  desirable is a large normative question which we have bracketed here <span class="note">The ethical opening we
      take to be profound, pointing on one hand toward the UFO as faceless Levinasian Other that demands a radical
      acknowledgement of human limits in prac- ticing an ethics of responsibility and on the other toward dialogical possibilities with non- human Nature that the Levinasian perspective does not suggest.</span>.
  But taking UFOs seriously would certainly embody the spirit of self-criticism that infuses liberal governmentality
  and academia in particular, and it would, thereby, foster critical theory. And indeed, if academics’ first
  responsibility is to tell the truth, then the truth is that after sixty years of modern UFOs, human beings still
  have no idea what they are, and are not even trying to find out. That should surprise and disturb us all, and cast
  doubt on the structure of rule that requires and sustains it.
