<p>Oddly enough, in opposition to that fundamental disenchantment, a non-negligible part of the worldwide population
  today believes that the search for extraterrestrial life should not only focus on planetary bodies of our solar system
  or to the listening of electronic signals (SETI) from thousands of light-years away, but also to our immediate
  environment: the Earth itself. Survey polls <span class="source">Gallup poll (1987) CNN/Time magazine (1997) Life magazine (2000) Quark monthly science magazine (2002) SCI FI Channel/ Roper poll.</span>
  regularly indicate not only a widespread belief in the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life in the universe,
  but also and more intriguing that some of it is already visiting us, in the form of what is popularly called UFOs
  (Unidentified Flying Objects). Indeed an important number of people believe that the SETI searches have already been
  successful. The SETI institute’s senior astronomer Shostak underlined this close relationship in 2005: <q>The good
    news is that polls continue to show that between one and two-thirds of the public thinks that extra-terrestrial life
    exists. The weird news is that a similar fraction thinks that some of it is visiting Earth</q> <span class="source">S. Shostak, <a

    </tr></table><p>Undeniably in parallel with the space exploration and particularly since the beginning of the 1950s,
    the last century has seen the emergence of a phenomenon that has generated intense interest and invaded the modern
    consciousness on a worldwide scale. In Europe many thousands of people, from all walks of life and including
    numerous civilian, governmental and military credible witnesses, have reported UFO sightings. Although embedded in
    everyone’s psychology and having gained the status of a modern myth, it is still necessary to give a definition of
    what the term, generally speaking, refers to: <q>A UFO is the reported sighting of an object or light seen in the
      sky or on land, whose appearance, trajectory, actions, motions, lights, and colours do not have a logical,
      conventional, or natural explanation, and which cannot be explained, not only by the original witness, but by
      scientists or technical experts who try to make a common sense identification after examining the evidence</q>
    <span class="source"> H. J. Allen, The UFO experience, Marlowe, 1972.</span>. </p>
    <p>The majority of sightings can be explained in conventional terms, e.g. meteors, planets, rockets, space debris,
      satellites or weather balloons and there remains a continuing lack of any scientifically acceptable evidence.
      However despite this, the continuance of UFO reports for half a century, the apparent existence of a small residue
      of cases remaining unexplained after analysis, and the direct association with extraterrestrial probes generate
      intense interest and give the subject a strong aura of mystery, fascination, controversy and popularity. At each
      opportunity the debate over and fascination for the extraterrestrial hypothesis for explaining such UFO reports
      regularly resurfaces. Undoubtedly this situation is here to remain. </p>
    <p>This persistent belief probably reflects our desire to find the answers to our age-old question of whether or not
      we are alone in the universe, projected right here on our planet. Regardless of the scientific results of space
      exploration, the human consciousness will seek new excitement and fascination for alternate perceptions of its
      natural frontier, the outer space, at much closer range: its immediate vicinity, be it the atmosphere or the
      earth’s orbit. Moreover, the detection of numerous extra-solar planets initiated since the mid-1990s has increased
      the public’s assumption that, with the existence in the universe of billions of stars and galaxies, other
      earth-sized twins of our planet should exist and even be commonplace. Compared to the beginning of the Space Age,
      it then became increasingly imaginable firstly that other extra-terrestrial intelligence existed, potentially
      million of years older than humankind, and secondly that these would also be involved in space exploration,
      through faster space travel technology means then humankind has today. </p>
    <p>The belief that UFOs could represent such an event has by now invaded our mentality and stretched our
      imagination. This does not appear as impossible as it did decades ago. Perhaps this consideration should not be
      systematically rejected, based on bias or ridicule attached to the UFO subject, or on the wrong assumption that
      there is no data at all worth examining. </p>
    <p>On the contrary, there is a vast amount of information to examine, the release of which was publicized recently
      in two widely circulated media announcements. Both announcements represented world wide news headlines and
      attracted the attention of millions of European citizens. Firstly, in March 2007 France became the first country
      to officially open its UFOs files to the public when its <a href="/org/eu/fr/cnes/index.html">Centre National
        d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES)</a> unveiled a specific website <span class="source"><a
          href="https://www.cnes-geipan.fr">CNES/GEIPAN website</a>.</span> documenting 100 000 pages of testimonies,
      photographs and <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/statistique/index.html">statistics</a> <span class="source">P. Ailleris, Unidentified Aerospace Phenomena in France: Seeking a renewed fascination for space exploration: paper associated to a Poster presentation for the conference ‘‘Imagining outer space’’, 6–9 February 2008, Bielefeld, Germany.</span>.
    </p>
    <p> Unexpectedly, within 2 h of allowing access to the site, the CNES web server crashed, overwhelmed by the flood
      of viewers around the world attempting to access the information. The objective of this release was to provide
      total transparency on the current status on the topic, after 30 years of information collection (Figs. 3 and 4).
      More importantly and in view of an overall 23% ratio of cases remaining unexplained, this unprecedented
      governmental action was an attempt to stimulate the interest of the scientific community. </p>

        </tr></table><p>Secondly, starting from May 2008 the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) initiated the
        declassification and release of thousands of documents related to
        allegedUFOsightings,throughtheNationalArchives’web site (total project estimated to more then 50,000 pages).
        Although this decision was guaranteed to generate intense international interest, no one had foreseen the actual
        record internet traffic. In the first four days there were 1.3 million downloads of information from the site.
        The chart of the number of reported events <a

            class="source">, 2000.</span> logged in the MoD database reflects an impressive number of yearly sightings
        in the United Kingdom (Fig. 5). Unexplained radar images from air traffic control, accounts of strange lights
        and objects in the sky being spotted by the public, police officers, airplane pilots and armed forces prove
        intriguing and sometimes alarming (e.g., a near miss by a civil airplane, a US air force fighter pilot

            </tr></table><p>Finally a psycholinguistic comment: both the CNES and the MoD have decided to use a
            different acronym than UFO (respectively, PAN: "Phé́nomènes Aé́rospatiaux Non Identifiés": Unidentified
            Aerospace Phenomena and UAP: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena). These agencies have realised that the old term
            was critically hindering a serious approach of the topic and had been long since discredited due to its
            strong connotation with extra-terrestrial vehicles and science fiction. For 60 years the term UFO has been
            embedded with the unfortunate connotation that if a phenomenon was unidentified it must be somehow
            extra-terrestrial. Moreover the utilisation of the word "object" within the term was misleading due to the
            fact that in the vast majority of the sightings there was no certainty about the presence of a material
            object, as almost exclusively luminous phenomenon are described. The term UAP will therefore be consistently
            used in the rest of this document. </p>
