<p>Seeing is one of the most powerful of the human senses. But when confronted by a situation where the visual
  information is extremely ambiguous, how does the brain decide how to represent and categorize the movement, shape,
  colour, contrast, size? How do we make sense of what we see? Despite its remarkable complexity, one of the main
  shortcomings of the human eye is that it can only see electromagnetic radiation in the visible wavelengths. This is
  the reason why during the last century the astronomy field has developed specific instruments and techniques to offset
  these shortcomings, for enabling the continuous exploration of the cosmos. </p>
<p>Concerning the UAP sightings, it became quickly obvious that the majority of the thousands of reports are a poor
  source of information. These often contain little data, are generally the results of misidentification of natural
  phenomenon or man-made objects, and also contain some hoaxes. As generally the case and illustrated by the CNES/GEIPAN
  database (Figs. 3 and 4), only a small percentage of the reports provide sufficient information from which any
  analysis can be done. </p>
<p>Unfortunately the situation has globally not much changed since the last official scientific study, requested by the
  USA Air Force Office of Scientific Research and undertaken by the University of Colorado during the period 1966–1968.
  Research physicist Frederick Ayer II already wrote in 1969 in the final study's report (so called "Condon report") a
  specific chapter <span class="source"> U. Condon Edward, Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects, Dutton, NY, 1969 (Chapter 9).</span>
  on the instrumentation for UFO searches, explaining the necessity and justifications for information recorded by
  suitable instruments: "The need for instrumented observation of UFO phenomena arises from the fact that an observer’s
  unaided senses are not reliable recorders of scientific data. Further, the ability of an observer to supply useful
  information is affected by his training, his state of mind at the time of the observation, and his suggestibility,
  both during and after the event. Accuracy requires instruments to measure precisely data such as angles, apparent or
  real velocities, distance, colour and luminance. Even an observer with optimal training, objective state of mind, and
  minimal suggestibility is hard pressed when unassisted by instruments, to provide useful scientific information. This
  is especially true in the case of UFO phenomena, which are typically of short duration, occurring in an unfamiliar
  environment, and lack points of reference from which reasonable inferences as to distance, size, and velocity can be
  drawn". </p>
<p>Confronted with the emergence of the UAP phenomenon and many sightings, a few field experiments initiatives were
  undertaken in order to supplement visual observations with scientific measurements. The advantages of using such an
  approach were obvious: a wider geographical coverage; enabling real time observation/ measurements and not anymore a
  posterior analysis; utilisation of technical parameters to complement human sightings; and finally a more systematic
  detection as no human observer is required during a UAP event. </p>
<h2>1950 USA: Project twinkle</h2>
<p>Starting end <a href="../../../../../../../../1/9/4/8/index.html">1948</a>, sightings of unexplained light phenomenon
  were reported in the south-western United States in the vicinity of sensitive government research and military
  installations, such as Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratory. Due to fact that this phenomenon suddenly appeared
  and were seen many times per month by credible observers (airline and military pilots, security inspectors, special
  agents of the office of special investigation) near installations that were the backbone of the atomic bomb programme,
  the situation caused considerable concern among security agencies. Not only was the possibility of foreign powers
  making "sensing shots" with some super-stratosphere devices, but also speculations of extraterrestrial probes
  projected into the atmosphere from a spaceship hovering several hundred miles above the Earth. </p>
<p>As the information available was not sufficiently quantitative, it was considered essential to obtain instrumental
  observations, photographic, triangulation and spectroscopic. The Air Force delegated the study of the phenomenon to
  the Geophysical Research Directorate, a group that studied the upper atmosphere and other atmospheric phenomena.
  During <a href="../../../../../../../../1/9/5/0/02/index.html">February 1950</a> the frequent reports of unexplained
  aerial phenomena close to Holloman and Vaughn Air force bases prompted the initiation of a programme to gather factual
  data. </p>

      <li>optical spectra-photography using standard cameras with suitable diffraction gratings; and </li>
      <li>electronic frequency measurements using Signal Corps Engineering Laboratory equipment. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Air force established a number of observation posts in the vicinity of Vaughn, New Mexico, for the purpose of
      photographing and determining the speed, height and nature of the unusual phenomena referred to as "green balls
      and discs". A round the clock watch was maintained. </p>
    <p>The Project Twinkle final report concluded on the overall negative results obtained from the year of vigilance
      and inquiry, and that no conclusive opinion on the aerial phenomena of interest had been reached. The overall
      results were not satisfactory, especially due to a reduction of activity of the phenomenon at the equipment’s
      locations. However the final report indicates that on two occasions some objects were photographed with the
      Askania theodolites during some Bell aircraft missile and V-2 launchings. In addition, the projects records and

    <h2>1953 USA: Air force videon cameras</h2>
    <p>As from the beginning of <a href="../../../../../../../../1/9/5/2/index.html">1952</a> the US Air Force was
      confronted with a massive increase of UAP reports across America (Fig. 7). In order to determine whether or not
      reported UAP were actually some new type of aircraft or merely misidentification of know objects, the use of
      spectrum analysis was suggested as an identification aid. A group within the US Air Force, the <a
          href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/index.html">Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC)</a>, developed a camera
      equipped with a diffraction grating. These special cameras, the commercial model of which was called Videon,
      combined the stereo-camera and the spectrographic principle. It would break down the light received from any
      object into its various components. This would permit the determination of the element or combination of elements
      of which an object would be composed.</p>
    <p> By <a href="../../../../../../../../1/9/5/3/06/index.html">June 1953</a>, approximately 75 cameras had been
      distributed to Air Force control towers and selected radar stations operators, in 33 states around the country
      <span class="source">"AF Cameras to eye streaking objects", The Washington Post 02/12/1953.</span>. Unfortunately
      it was found out that the light gathering power of the lenses was too low and that the diffraction gratings were
      deteriorating quite quickly. According to the records only a few worthless pictures were obtained through this
      approach. During 1958 the possibilities of more extensive instrumentation were also discussed by the Air Force.
    </p>
    <p>Other suggestions for more complete cameras, special aircraft instrumentation (e.g. USAF fighters-interceptors
      aircrafts also equipped with diffraction gratings over the lenses of 16 mm gun cameras) and other detection
      devices were put forward and analysed. However no further study contract for such instrumentation was either
      started, in light of the belief that the cost of such a programme would outweigh the results.</p>

          href="/people/s/SmithWilbertBrooker/index.html">Smith</a>, a senior radio engineer from the Department of
        Transport, requested his superiors to make use of a laboratory and the department’s field facilities for a study
        of UAP and the physical principles associated to them. Project Magnet was authorized in December 1950 by
        Commander Edwards, then Deputy Minister of Transport for the Air Services, and was justified by the belief that
        it might be possible to use the Earth’s magnetic field as a propulsion method. </p>
        <p>The purpose was to study magnetic phenomena, particularly the ones resulting from unusual boundary conditions
          in the basic electromagnetic theory. Smith thought that there was reason to believe that such phenomenon
          existed and that their discovery would open up a new and valuable technology. The initial programme included
          in particular the investigation into the possibility of producing an effect of a "sink" in a magnetic field,
          and some experiments for qualitatively examining various theories regarding the feasibility of converting
          geomagnetic energy into electrical energy <span class="source">Library and Archives Canada, <a

        </p>
        <p>Smith, intrigued by the large number of sightings of UAP, generally called "Flying saucers", raised the
          question as to whether such objects could be emissaries of some other civilization having a technology
          somewhat different then ours, and possibly more advanced in magnetism. After having completed some theoretical
          work and analysed many Canadian UAP cases, Smith believed that the phenomena could logically be accompanied by
          some measurable physical characteristics. To him, whether a sighting was an alien vehicle or had natural
          electromagnetic causes, there would probably be magnetic or radio noise disturbances, perhaps some gamma
          radiations, and even gravity waves associated with it.</p>

            </tr></table><p>With these goals in mind, in November 1953 Smith set up a group of instruments in a hut at
            Shirley Bay (20 miles outside Ottawa) with the objective to attempting to get measurements related to UAP
            sightings and to seek scientific proof of their existence (Fig. 8). </p>
            <p>The intention was to man the station 24h a day. As reported in the Canadian press <span class="source"> H. Greer: "<a
                href="../../../../../../../../1/9/5/3/11/11/FlyingSaucersOrNot_TorontoStar/index_fr.html">Flying Saucers or Not? Canada Sighting Station to Seek Scientific Proof</a>", <em>Toronto Star</em>, 11/11/1953.</span>,
              which nicknamed the hut the "Canadian flying saucer observatory", some complex and expensive equipment had
              been installed in the saucer observatory": An ionospheric reactor to determine the height, pattern and
              conduct of the ionized layer of gases several hundred miles in the atmosphere, a counter to detect atomic
              rays from the outer atmosphere, various types of radar, a gravimeter imported from Sweden to measure the
              Earth’s gravity, a magnetometer to measure the variations in the magnetic field, and a radio set running
              full volume at 530 kilocycles for picking up any radio noise. </p>
            <p>Probably in relation to excessive mainstream press attention towards the Shirley Bay’s facility, Project
              Magnet was officially discontinued mid-1954 by the Department of Transport, without the time or fortune
              for obtaining any relevant data. </p>
            <h2>1963 FRANCE: Magnetic detectors</h2>
            <p>In Europe the governments decided not to be involved in the controversy, and contrary to the USA and
              Canada did not implement any specific instrumentation project for studying the phenomena, in the late
              1950s and early 1960s, despite also being confronted by a significant number of UAP sightings. Any such
              study was left to various civilian associations. Some UAP researchers had noticed that the UAP literature
              included many alleged cases of magnetic disturbances associated to the sightings, such as compass
              disruptions or car breakdowns. This led to the idea of building up local magnetic devices aimed at early
              UAP warning systems. </p>
            <p>In relation to this approach, it is worthwhile to mention the French association "Lumieres Dans La Nuit"
              (LDLN) which at the beginning of the 1960s not only designed and built up some magnetic detectors but also
              set up a nation-wide network as early as 1963. The LDLN’s policy was to distribute to the public as many
              of these detectors as possible (called GEOS), in order to demonstrate the correlation between the UAP
              sightings and magnetic disturbances. </p>
            <p>The apparatus was composed of a compass directly connected to an electric circuit, which range in the
              event of a deviation. Around 1968/1969, the LDLN network included approximately 450 detectors spread
              throughout France. Despite some detector calls (58) and some alleged cases of correlation between a
              detector’s ring and a UAP sighting (only 8), the interest in the approach gradually vanished at the
              beginning of the 1970s. </p>
            <p>The main reasons appeared to have been related to technical deficiencies of the detectors (too sensitive)
              and a loss of interest from the public who had been equipped with them. </p>
            <h2>1972 USA: The Topenish field study</h2>
            <p>The first civilian UAP field study took place in August 1972 on the Yakama Indian reservation
              (7250Km<sup>2</sup>) in Toppenish, Washington. Due to a noticeable increase of UAP sightings from law
              enforcement personnel around the reservation area and in nearby towns, Akers, a private investigator,
              decided to set up an intensive eleven day long field study aimed at capturing instrument recordings of
              some reported anomalous luminous phenomena (ALP). </p>
            <p>Authorisation was granted from the Yakima Tribal council, the Bureau of Indian affairs and the Agency
              Forestry Division to undertake the project. As underlined in the project’s report <span class="source">W. Akers David, Report on the investigation of nocturnal light phenomena at Toppenish, Washington, 02/11/1972.</span>
              a primary objective was to determine the feasibility of "staking-out" a scientific observer in an area of
              high sighting probability, with the purpose in mind of obtaining hard data concerning the UAP. </p>
            <p>A "hit and run" strategy, of moving the instruments to a location where activity would be observed, was
              to be followed. The priority was to obtain photographs, including spectrographs and position data, and
              also to eventually acquire data relating to any magnetic effects which might arise from UAP activity. The
              field investigation involved setting-up portable observation equipment at selected locations for several
              days a time. Observation lookouts were established at six different locations in the Yakama Indian
              reservation. </p>
            <p>The instruments used by Akers, all battery operated, were covering three different ranges: firstly the
              sound recording (WWV time receiver, crystal controlled reference oscillator, cassette tape recorder);
              secondly the optical range (two single lens reflex cameras, one equipped with a 55 mm lens and replica
              grating to permit recording of spectral data, a 16mm motion picture camera, a 35mm range finder camera)
              and thirdly the magnetic and radiation measurements (a compass spin detector, an automatic recording
              magnetometer, a G-M counter Gamma and beta). </p>
            <p>The results of the field study were satisfactory. Various observations of suspected anomalous lights were
              made by the investigator, and several of them recorded on film. Unfortunately all the sightings and
              pictures related exclusively to round lights situated at far distances (the closest activity had been at
              eight miles). However and most importantly, Akers had demonstrated for the first time the validity of a
              placing an observer into an area of frequent UAP sightings and the feasibility of obtaining scientific
              measurements of the phenomena. In his conclusions, Akers acknowledged the practical experience gained from
              the eleven day long field study and also that nothing in his nocturnal observations had point towards an
              extraterrestrial source of activity. Still he was persuaded that something unusual was taking place,
              something which warranted a continuous and objective examination.</p>
            <h2> 1973 USA: Project identification</h2>
            <p>In response to a flurry of UAP sightings near Piedmont, Missouri, Rutledge, then Chairman of the Physics
              Department at Southeast Missouri State University, decided in March 1973 to lead a field investigation.
              Assisted by a team of colleague professors, qualified students, scientists and amateur enthusiasts and
              having managed to secure some funding from one of the three largest metropolitan newspapers in Missouri
              (the St Louis Globe-Democrat); Rutledge ran a seven year long study. </p>
            <p>This field investigation of the UAP phenomena, called "Project Identification", had two objectives:
              firstly to measure the physical properties of the lights and/or objects in the sky and secondly to
              identify their origin. Rutledge's innovative approach was to study the unknown phenomena while it was in
              progress, and no longer after the fact. Having read the final US Air force report on UAP (Scientific Study
              of Unidentified Flying Objects), Rutledge explained the failure of earlier government efforts could be
              attributed to the fact that the programme administrators did not recognize the need for observation
              stations in the field, and that instead the official teams responded to reports of sightings in progress,
              thereby arriving too late on the scene. </p>

                as radar, electromagnetic frequency analyser, high-frequency low-intensity sound detector, spectroscopic
                camera, Questar astronomical telescopes with cameras attached and photographic equipment. From
                1973–1980, Rutledge set up a total of 158 viewing stations (Fig. 9) in three major geographical areas,
                during which the sky was watched for 427h, by more than 600 observers at various times. Having precisely
                catalogued different characteristics of the various sightings, Rutledge attempted to calculate the
                actual velocity, course, position, distance, shape, colour, size and behaviours of the UAP. </p>
                <p>In the final report of Project Identification <span class="source">H.D. Rutledge, <em>Project Identification</em>, Prentice-Hall, 1981, p. 211</span>,
                  Rutledge quotes a total of 157 sightings of 178 UAP, of which there were 34 class A sightings (light
                  or/and objects displaying bizarre behavioural and/or physical properties that defied a conventional
                  explanation) of 45 UAP. </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, out of a tantalizing number of 700 project photographs, not one exposure of a Class A
                  sighting had been obtained. Still, he was convinced without a doubt that his research had established
                  the existence of a real UAP phenomenon, but a very subtle one as illustrated in his conclusions "<q>...In
                    that research, more was involved than the measurement of physical properties of UFOs by
                    dispassionate observers. A relationship, a cognizance, between us and the UFO intelligence evolved.
                    A game was played. In my opinion, this additional consideration is more important than the
                    measurements or establishing that the phenomenon exists...</q>"</p>
                <p>In his final remarks, Rutledge stressed the need for further scientific study of the phenomenon and
                  for additional sophisticated equipment, including devices to record the intensity and spectrum of
                  electromagnetic frequencies including the optical ranges such as infrared, visible and ultraviolet,
                  and automatic tracking devices so that the detectors could be locked on the direction to a moving

                    href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/projet/psi/index.html">Project Starlight International
                  (PSI)</a> and its founder <a href="/people/s/StanfordRaymondD/index.html">Ray Stanford</a> pushed the
                  challenge of applying scientific methods and gathering evidence a step further. Financed by the
                  Association for the Understanding of Man, <a
                      href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/projet/psi/index.html">PSI</a> supported an active UAP
                  research (instrumented hard-data monitoring and signalling) as a viable alternative to the mere
                  collection and correlation of UAP reports <span class="source">S. Harrigan: "Planet X! We are waiting for you!", <em>Texas Monthly</em>, 1976.</span>.
                </p>
                <p> One of the working hypotheses was that at least some of the UAP were technological devices, the
                  effects of which were subject to detection, monitoring and recording. In addition was the
                  consideration that these devices had some form of sophisticated intelligence associated with them.
                  Therefore besides the primary goal of obtaining quantitative data, <a
                      href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/projet/psi/index.html">PSI</a> expended its efforts towards
                  developing strategies and equipments for attempting communication with UAP intelligences. </p>
                <p>Inside a four-foot high white brick building serving as an observation area, was the main PSI’s
                  equipment: the UFO/VECTOR (UFO/Video Experiment Console for Transitional-Overt Response). This suite
                  of sophisticated equipment incorporated a TV-aimed, remote-control console of various instruments and
                  in particular a video-modulated Liconix 605M helium–neon laser, a Criterin Dynamax 8
                  Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope, a photomultiplier and video amplifier and a Sony video camera. An
                  extreme PSI assumption was that video transmission via a modulated laser beam from the UFO/VECTOR unit
                  might be readable by instruments aboard UAP. </p>
                <p>PSI had also installed on the ground another experiment attempting communication. It was a circle of
                  spotlights composed of ninety 150W lamps, forming a ring of 100 feet in diameter. These lamps could
                  switch on and off according to various sequences and therefore could serve as communication device
                  (reminiscent of Spielberg’s 1977 movie, "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", where contact was
                  established following a particular musical tone and light activity). Lack of UAP activity and
                  discontinuity of financing eventually forced <a
                      href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/projet/psi/index.html">PSI</a> members to stop their
                  research programme. </p>
                <h2>1984 NORWAY: Project Hessdalen</h2>
                <p>Hessdalen is the name of a small valley in the central part of Norway, roughly 15 km long and 5 Km
                  wide, with only 140 inhabitants. At the end of 1981 strange unknown light phenomena started to appear
                  frequently at numerous locations throughout the valley. Until the end of 1984 these lights appeared up
                  to 20 times a week. Then the frequency suddenly decreased to only once or twice a month. </p>
                <p>Most of the observations fell into one of the following three categories: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A big yellow light that moved slowly around in the valley, or would be stationary for some minutes
                    or more than an hour. The anomalous light could show up in all weather conditions and was seen at
                    different altitudes, either high in the sky, or just over the roof of the houses or even down on the
                    ground. </li>
                  <li> White or blue flashing lights which would last only from a fraction to a couple of seconds and
                    which could show up everywhere in the sky. </li>
                  <li>Several lights together, with a fixed distance from each other. It seemed like the lights
                    eliminated from a black object. Mostly it was two yellow or white lights and a red one in
                    front. </li>
                </ul>

                <p>No one could provide explanations for these lights and quickly the Norwegian valley became known as a
                  "UAP hotspot", and internationally known as the "UAP laboratory". As no official institute with
                  government support had shown interest in the unknown lights, five individuals decided to set up their
                  own research project. <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/projet/Hessdalen/index.html">Project
                    Hessdalen</a> was born in June 1983 and was primarily aimed at identifying the nature of the
                  phenomena through gathering scientific data, and secondly at raising the interest of the mainstream
                  scientists. </p>
                <p>A field expedition was carried out from 21 January to 26 February 1984, during which a total of 40
                  volunteers participated. Various instruments were installed at the headquarters, which was a trailer
                  located on a hill (Fig. 10). Two other groups of participants, equipped with cameras, were located on
                  two of the nearby mountains. The following instruments were made available in the field: </p>

                    A total of 53 unknown phenomena were observed and corroborated with the scientific instruments. Not
                    only were some pictures with the lights’ wavelength distribution obtained, but also some radar
                    measurements, changes in the magnetic field, recordings on the spectrum analyser and even more
                    strangely, reactions to laser. The laser had been pointed towards a flashing light, in two different
                    cases, for a total of nine times. In eight of these times, a reaction occurred, through a change in
                    the flashing sequence. Despite the fact that no conclusive explanation for the luminous phenomena
                    could be found, the 1984 scientific campaign had demonstrated its reality and that it could be
                    scientifically measured and studied. </p>

                      camps are run, new strategies and equipments are being developed, international alliances sought
                      and established, and efforts for attracting the interest of the scientific community are pursued

                    <p>From late 1989 into mid-1990 a spectacular wave of anomalous sightings occurred in Belgium, and
                      UAP observations were made almost on a daily basis (Fig. 12). Hundreds of witnesses reported
                      seeing a large triangular object, which flew slowly and silently at very low altitude, generally
                      exhibited three powerful headlights at its corners and remained in sight for several minutes.
                      Witnesses include not only civilians but also military staff, police officers, scientists and air
                      traffic controllers. In June 1990, the Belgian Air Force released a report of a 75 min chase by
                      two F–16 fighter planes in the night of the 30–31 March of a UAP which had been sighted from the
                      ground by State Police forces and civilians.</p>
