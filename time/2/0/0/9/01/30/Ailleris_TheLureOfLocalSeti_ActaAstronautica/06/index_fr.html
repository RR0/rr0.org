<p>In this paper we have described several instrumented field studies that have been deployed by scientists and
  organizations during the period 1950–1990 in USA, Canada and Europe. Certainly this brief historical review does not
  represent a complete picture of the investigations undertaken. As more countries follow the example of France and the
  United Kingdom by declassifying their UAP archives, we can expect new information concerning similar research
  activities will surface in the future (e.g. Brazil <span class="source">As a result of the campaign ‘‘UFOs: freedom of information now!, the Brazilian government have started releasing in 2009 <a
      href="../http/www.ufo.com.br/amazonia">documentation on Operation Saucer</a>, a secret UAP investigation carried out by the Army in the Amazonian region in 1977.</span>).
</p>
<p>What does become clear is that most of the field investigations were the result of individual’s or civilian
  associations’ initiatives (Project Magnet, Magnetic detectors, project identification, Starlight International,
  Hessdalen). These participants acted proactively, realizing that the governments would not initiate nor support such
  research due to fear of ridicule, waste of tax money, the belief that nothing of scientific significance would be
  discovered, or because of national security considerations. Only the American government, which had been confronted in
  the 1950s and 1960s (Fig. 7) with an important number of UAP sightings, was forced to respond to public demand and be
  therefore officially involved. </p>
<p>It appears obvious that the resources engaged in these field experiments (staff, equipment, duration) were
  insufficient to reach any firm conclusion or bring forward any acceptable scientific measurement. However, it can be
  argued that some projects have managed to acquire some preliminary data (Projects Twinkle, Identification, Hessdalen),
  albeit inconclusive. This in itself supports running optical and instrumental observations campaigns on the field
  while the phenomenon is active, rather than retroactive filling in questionnaires and maintaining a log of past
  observations. Moreover, these field experiments demonstrated that it was possible to study the controversial AP topic
  on a rigourous and empirical basis. This in itself was likely the most valuable outcome of these research
  projects. </p>
<p>This paper also highlights the fact that the vast majority of the field studies were initiated in answer to a sudden
  burst of UAP activity around a well-defined geographic area. Certainly it was only under this condition that any
  civilian activity could be undertaken, as any field experiment required sufficient resources and a well-defined
  logistic. This could be deployed by individuals and associations at a specific location, but would have been
  impossible to be set up on a larger scale. This explains why the last field project described in this paper is almost
  twenty years old. Since the 1990s spectacular wave of anomalous sightings in Belgium, no significant UAP flap over
  another particular geographical zone has occurred and therefore there has been no opportunity to set up field
  experiments. In addition, due to the random nature of these UAP phenomena both in time and location, and of their
  short duration, the chances of obtaining scientific data outside a UFO flap are nearly null. </p>
<p>For this reason it could be said to be essential not only to keep Norway’s Project Hessdalen (ref. 5.8) active, but
  also to devote supplementary resources to it, thereby launching a specific extended research and observational watch
  of a sufficient duration. In <a href="../../../../index.html">2009</a>, this project constitutes a unique worldwide
  UAP research opportunity. Its existence is justified by the continuous presence of anomalous luminous phenomena in the
  Norwegian valley and its perceived scientific value. Here remains the possibility for Science to discover new
  phenomena, extra-terrestrial or otherwise. </p>
