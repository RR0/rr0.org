<p class="abstract">How authentic is UFO documentation? A lot of factors demonstrate – doing a simple analysis – that
  most of UFO photographic material, in particular the one that circulates on the web, is totally unreliable. It is not
  only a matter of lack of scientific method; it is mostly a simple matter of lack of common sense. The common sense of
  people is constantly made a fun of and the reasons of this are many, the most important of which is the emotional
  effect caused by the imaginary collective. UFO iconography is a drug at all effects, and can be used to switch minds
  in many ways, also to collect proselytes to make up new fanatic religions, but more generally to give people a sort of
  psychological medicine with which people can escape from the hard reality of everyday, where the continuous
  competitions of present society often obscure the human and spiritual dimension: people need to retrieve the very
  nucleus of their soul. This intimate need is clearly legitimate, but it is also risky: in fact persons who are not
  well rationally grounded are very easily subject to manipulation: it seems that most persons in the world are just in
  this condition, especially at our epoch. When critical thinking starts to lack, who leads this society has at his
  disposal a huge mass of sheep, ready to follow alleged miracles, saviour aliens and related gurus. The less people
  think in a grounded way the least this people are conscious of what is happening at their shoulders. This is the
  effect of UFO iconography.

  <h2>The roots of delusional sickness and the role of science</h2>

  <p> Let’s try now to see how people are diverted by reality by means of “UFO documentation” that is growing more and
    more every day. Apparently the UFO phenomenon is escalating…. Is it a real escalation of sightings? The answer is
    no, because here we have an escalation of fakes and/or ephemeral information, the propagation of which nowadays is
    vectored and amplified by the media, in particular by the web.
  </p>
  <p> Let’s now show some examples describing how the phenomenon develops. Of course the phenomenon of interest here is
    the social one, because many evidences show that the "UFO phenomenon" is still not-well defined in the intrinsic
    sense. The reason of this is that rarely such a phenomenon can be observed by an objective and/or inter-subjective
    point of view: more often most UFO events are in reality the result of the “modulation” of subjective factors – a
    sort of magnifying and/or aberrating lens – so that any potentially considerable objectivity remains very
    questionable. In such a way the coordinates with which a possible UFO event should be fixed are not defined at all.
    What we really know of this is more similar to the “cloud of probability” with which the position of a quantum
    particle can be statistically evaluated, but without any Newtonian determinism. This is because what we have at our
    disposal as data is constituted only by photos/videos and witnesses: in some cases we have both and in some others
    we have only one of the two. In particular, the witness of a given UFO event, when this event is not statistically
    significant or coherent within the same statistics, doesn’t furnish a real map of what happened due to the many
    contradictions, subjective manipulations and constructions of the witness: here some visual testimony is
    continuously mixed with unconscious or subconscious factors: objectivity is always melted with subjectivity. This
    constant uncertainty renders the scientific treatment of the UFO phenomenon very difficult, unless such phenomenon
    can be effectively monitored and measured in areas of recurrence using the appropriate instrumentation, which due to
    its intrinsic nature cannot be misled by any form of subjective thinking. This is the only science that can be done
    on UFOs but it is very difficult to achieve this task because, in spite of the recurrence of the phenomenon in
    certain areas of Earth, such a phenomenon is not a star that we can constantly find on the celestial sphere but a
    globally random object, whose space and time coordinates are very difficult to predict.
  </p>
  <p> Truly unexplainable anomalies do exist (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Allen_Hynek) and it is towards them that a
    scientific investigation is addressed.
  </p>
  <p> Really scientists are so “sold to the system” when they arbitrarily deny the UFO phenomenon? Scientists are used
    to investigate reality by doing measurements and calculations on *data*. They have been trained to distinguish what
    is worth investigating and what is not, in the sense that they are trained to discern the noise from the signal:
    this is due to their profession and forma mentis; it is not a question of “ignorance of the problem” as most people
    like to think, and science is not a collection of erudite dogmas but a pure methodology, where critical thinking
    makes of science an “intellectual dynamics” in which old ideas can be often supplanted by new ones until, through
    subsequent approximations, a better vision of reality is built up in the most accurate way. This vision of reality
    might be only the map of reality and not reality itself in its entirety, but so far there is no other way to
    approximate reality than the scientific one: this is not an elite-style way of knowing the world for a few but it is
    due to a pure human shared necessity to live and survive, and this started since the first time in which primitive
    men decided to use animal bones to defend themselves against enemies. Of course science and its method can surely
    improve and an “open mind” is the best approach to explore the Universe that surrounds us. But if an open mind is
    not accompanied by feet well planted into the ground (namely: rigour) that mind is only a “brain” that is easily
    destined to fall from the skull to the ground. The mind is generated by the brain, which stays up, while the ground
    is for feet and not for brain. If we locate feet and brain at their appropriate position then we can hope to build
    up a science. Differently from what is now claimed by “new agers” concerning “emotional intelligence”, science can
    be done only by non-emotional intelligence. It is true that some aspects of quantum mechanics show that the observer
    interacts with the observed but we have no scientific confirmation yet that consciousness is really able to generate
    reality (https://www.whatthebleep.com/). This might occur at a certain level, or sublevel of reality, but we do not
    have yet a quantitative description of the phenomenon. Until a mathematical treatment of this possibility (on which
    some physicists currently speculate and/or make reasoning based on solid work hypotheses) will be finally done, we
    cannot use subjectivity (otherwise called “qualia”) as a parameter of science. Therefore so far we are still
    anchored to standard scientific methodology. This is what we have now and, in spite of several difficulties and
    drastic limitations, it is the only methodology that we can use to examine the facts of ufology too
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Maccabee), but only when we are sure that these facts are objective data and not
    arbitrary constructions. Otherwise the “scientific house” is not built on a solid ground but on moving sands. That’s
    the reason why analysis of facts must be carried out only when these anomalies are validated to be true ones. This
    analysis can be done in two ways: 1) statistical evaluation of reliable witnesses and construction of physical
    scenarios; 2) direct instrumented measurements on the field.

  <h2>Wrong perceptions and the power of illusions</h2>

  <p> Let’s now go back to the "UFO phenomenon" and try to look in more detail at the alleged "evidence" of it, the most
    important of which should be photos and videos. In fact this is the only way through which an almost totally random
    and unpredictable phenomenon can be reported by ordinary people. But is this documentation really reporting UFOs?
    Many are the evidences that such photos and videos may be more or less easily identifiable as prosaic objects. In
    many cases these objects are the result of misinterpretation of known natural and/or manmade objects, in many other
    cases the portrayed objects are deliberate hoaxes and fakes. Only in a few cases the anomalous phenomenon that is
    reported is real, even if an accurate comparative study shows that identifying it as such – namely a truly peculiar
    fact – is like to be able to hear the meow of a cat inside a square where 1000 persons are shouting all together.
    But, again, in spite of the well-demonstrated existence of fakes (see Appendix), such a phenomenon – when it is not
    a-critically and dogmatically denied by the short intellectual horizons of some – is invariably and arbitrarily
    interpreted as "extraterrestrial spacecrafts" and "alien visitation" by most people. The collective imaginary is
    really powerful socially. And it is just this uncritical way to present and to wave UFO events in general that
    averts and deters true scholars from attempting to study the even tiniest possibility that Earth might be visited by
    exogenous intelligence, in addition to discouraging scientists from exploring in depth still unknown natural
    phenomena whose physics (including a possibly "exotic" one, in case) might be providential to the solution of a lot
    of energy problems. In principle scientists might also demonstrate that Earth is visited by other intelligences
    indeed (https://openseti.org/Docs/NewSETI_MT_LAKI.pdf), if only they wouldn’t be continuously deceived (and, not
    rarely, exploited by artful "ufologists") by that which is presently a colossal "cloud of confusion" in which it is
    very hard to find data that are really worth examining. In such a situation also open-minded scientists may start to
    have prejudices and doubts about the entire UFO stuff (psychological effects can be effective on scientists too, who
    are just humans like all the others), which can make them more away from the genuine facts. So what is the result of
    all of this havoc created by badly-vectored information? The result is that science doesn’t feel like investigating
    what might be a hugely important frontier of science, which, on the other side, remains in the hands of uncritical
    believers, hoaxers, fakers, “magicians”, story-tellers at UFO congresses, fanatic sects, and even “PSYOP-ers”.
    Therefore scientists do not like to get involved into UFO matter only because they consider it risky for their
    career or because they are afraid of the gossip of colleagues, but mostly because it is their own independent
    choice, possibly dictated by some (justified anyway) prejudices, but it is their choice to do so and not a "true
    imposition from the system" (this one, a mythological tale spread out by UFO fanatics). But then the problem is that
    if science doesn’t explore and examine the phenomenon properly the chaos goes on reigning, with the result of a
    *total deception* all over this world and a devastating effect on the psyche of singles and of society in general:
    this is a "subliminal weapon" that is manipulating at all the effects the world in its entirety. *Who* exactly has
    some interests in maintaining such a deceptive way of divulging the phenomenon? It is not so difficult to imagine
    it, and it will be speculated later on this issue.
  </p>
  <p> But how does all this develop? Let’s start from some examples of misinterpreted light and/or aerial phenomena.</p>
  <p> Here a typical case. Suddenly a photographer finds two strange lighted objects in one of his nightly photos; he
    makes Photoshop enhancements and discovers two UFOs in the night sky: one is clearly a flying saucer surrounded by a
    fascinating aura, while the other is similar to a triangle. Of course the photographer doesn’t think that he
    inadvertently pressed the shutter of the camera towards the sky and maybe (it often happens) he becomes more and
    more convinced that he was “telepathically induced to do that”: at the same time the power of self-suggestion
    amplifies itself and at the end – thanks to the effect of the imaginary collective– he definitely believes he
    photographed two alien spacecrafts. He doesn't even consider the possibility to make a check using a simple sky
    mapping software, because if he did it he would discover quite easily that those two "UFOs" are not alien
    spacecrafts but the stars α Aquilae and η Ophiuchi, which acquired that strange shape due to an aberration of the
    lens or to an error of the auto-focus mechanism of the camera for objects that are just on the border of the frame
    (away from the optical axis).
  </p>
  <p> Figure 1. Misinterpreted astronomic objects. Above. Photograph of the sky with contrast enhancement in order to
    make the stars come out in the field. Below. Sky map of the same region of sky. Circles identify the stars (plotted
    in altazimuthal mode) permitting a comparison between the photo and the sky map: stars are easily identified and the
    two strange objects (inside red circles) are confirmed to be two stars whose light is subject to some kind of
    aberration. (Test carried out by the author, using an HP Photosmart 945 digital camera)
  </p>
  <p>Another emblematic example here. After reading a book on “orbs” and related “spiritual and/or disembodied” beings
    (an example here: https://www.spiritofthenile1.co.uk/page_1254583.html) a person sees suddenly an orb with his own
    eyes, without even the necessity to use the flash of the digital camera (in fact this is the only way in which
    “orbs” are classically photographed). And it appears in daylight, just inside the kitchen, on the ceiling,
    precisely. The orb is really fascinating and it is changing shape all the time by showing also clear 3-D effects: a
    spiritual being is just there, trying to get in touch with the targeted witness. The phenomenon is persistent for
    several minutes, so the witness decides to take a photograph of it: a “visual orb” is now immortalized! Well… what
    happens in the mind of that person during those holy moments? That person is severely drunken by suggestion and
    loses almost totally his relation with reality: namely the brain falls from the skull-box to the ground while the
    feet furiously flounder in the air, just metaphorically speaking. In fact that “orb” – in the proper reality – was
    caused by his cat that was moving with his little paw the water inside his beloved water-pot. What happened? At that
    moment, the water was reflecting sunlight just over the ceiling and the movement of the “orb” was induced by the
    cat. Water worked just like a mirror but as that one is a “liquid mirror” that is moving all the time, it happens
    that the angle of reflected light-rays changes all the time at all the points of the water, so that it creates
    apparently three-dimensional and dynamical effects. This is not a scientific analysis, it is just common sense. Why
    does a person suddenly lose his/her own relation with reality at certain moments? Is this a sign of endemic
    stupidity? Not necessarily. Inside all of us there is a need of the “absolute” and this is legitimate, of course.
    But this can often cause a lot of unpleasant jokes to us: losing a contact with reality can be truly dangerous, and
    can become also contagious if this is propagated on … Youtube, for instance.
  </p>
  <p> Figure 2. Misinterpreted ordinary object. Left. Orb-like light reflection on the ceiling of a kitchen. Center. The
    water-pot of the cat. Left. The cat looking satisfied and curious at the light-prodigy he himself created. (Test
    carried out by the author and his cat, using a Fujii Finepix S-2 Pro digital reflex camera)
  </p>
  <p> And of course all of this deceiving perceptual effects regards “orbs” themselves too when they are obtained by
    taking photos using a digital camera and (https://www.theorbzone.com/evidence.htm). Unless the object is moving very
    fast and/or presents particularly elaborated shapes (these might be true anomalies), the answer is invariably this:
    dust particles, spry particles, snow flakes, pollen, smoke, insects, and even occasional hair’s dandruff, all
    reflecting flash light. It happens because all of these tiny objects are occasionally very close to the lens and
    therefore they are photographed out of focus with a consequent enlargement (from a tiny particle to a sort of
    “bubble”), while the light of the flash is reflected by these objects, which otherwise would be invisible. By the
    way, let me show the result coming out from my tests on taking photographs of insects (midges, for precision) using
    the flash, during a slightly rainy night.
  </p>
  <p>Figure 3. Misinterpreted ordinary insects. The asymmetric luminous images above on the left and below is the result
    of the reflection of flash light on flying midges. The “orbs” that are spread all over the field of view are due to
    ground dust lifted by a slight wind in a very dusty area. (Test carried out by the author, using a Nikon Coolpix
    S-550 digital camera)
  </p>
  <p> The amorphous lighted thing that can be seen in the photo is not an "etheric spacecraft" low in the sky, while
    sending down rounded "plasma beings", but it is just a midge – plus other three more far away – that passed a few
    inches in front of the lens (they were present in great number that night, and their presence could be witnessed by
    the disturb they were causing to the skin in general, without any need to photograph them), while the "orbs" are
    just due to dust particles floating in the air and reflecting flash light. Nevertheless, on some of the "UFO
    magazines" it will be possible to read that<br> these ones are often "explained" as spacecrafts and alien beings,
    while "spiritual magazines" will explain all the kinds of "orbs" (the main torment of New Age, nowadays) as
    disembodied beings or "ghosts" targeting us for some reasons. How many articles of this taste are published on such
    magazines, especially on Internet? Many… Of course this doesn’t mean that all "orbs" can be explained with prosaic
    causes; there are some anomalies also in this field, but these are well-known<br> only by serious scholars of such
    phenomena who attempt to distinguish a possible signal from a hugely spread pure noise. These scholars do not assume
    arbitrarily that "orbs" are ghosts or aliens, but – in a very small selection of cases – they consider the possible
    existence of low-energy plasmas whose existence might be rendered visible by the photon-injection effect induced by
    the flash of a digital camera. But people who are more wishful than scientifically thinking make immediately an
    association combining "disembodied beings" with "plasma phenomena". The result is: "plasma beings". And so the new
    dogma in which to believe is imposed to most of other ingenuous people, who drink all this a-critically by replacing
    the word "/science" with the word "faith". If it wouldn’t be for the fact that all this is innocent in itself, the
    damage that is anyway done by propagation (namely: the alleged existence of “plasma beings”) is devastating, in
    addition to causing a consistent sociological damage to citizens, while serious UFO and/or paranormal research is
    totally discredited. And there is also who makes money on it. But let’s put this very clear: this doesn’t exclude at
    all that even “plasma beings” can exist. On the contrary, it might be possible
    (https://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1367-2630/9/8/263/njp7_8_263.html), but not in the way in which “believers” approach
    the problem. Believers systematically avoid any use of methodology and reasoning: they hang themselves to their
    "faith" thinking that the only reachable Truth can be emotional and analogical. And if some scientist discovers (or
    promotes physically consistent work-hypotheses in the field of fringe science) something that might be similar to
    what these persons perceive by faith, that scientist is systematically exploited by them without he/she even
    realizes it. This is a good reason for scientists and serious scholars to make their own research on anomalies
    “stealthy” and to publish possible results only cryptically on technical peer-reviewed journals: that’s the concrete
    reason why research on anomalies must be necessarily an "elite one", away from the<br> misinterpretation of the
    general public.
  </p>
  <p> Now let’s imagine a story that sounds more or less like this.</p>
  <p><q> "Ooops…wh… what the *bleep* is that!!! I was just writing a paper on abductions and suddenly something is out
    of the window here, right now! A synchronicity, evidently. Heart is running like a machine gun, and I even hear
    voices in my head, as if something is very close to or just "inside" me… Well … I just had the camera with me. I
    need to document all of this<br> immediately. It looks like a silent invasion outside. What is that???</q></p>
  <p> Figure 4. Misinterpreted ordinary light reflection. The light of a big chandelier reflected on the window of the
    hall of a restaurant. (Test carried out by my ex-associate of “XPOSE UFO TRUTH” using a digital camera)
  </p>
  <p><q>“ Well… here the hall of this restaurant is so comfortable to write my UFO article using my faithful laptop.
    Suddenly behind me a hand is touching my shoulder and the hissing voice in the back of my head is getting stronger
    and stronger. I am afraid they are already inside and preparing to abduct me, when … I suddenly jump from the chair
    like a kangaroo. I turn back and unexpectedly I see the terrible reality: a fat waitress, after looking at the
    screen of my desktop just after I downloaded the photo from my camera, is telling me: “It is the chandelier’s
    reflection on the window, Sir”. ”</q></p>
  <p> This is an example of what happens very often, and I also believe that in some cases even the “objective prompt”
    by the waitress is useless: the fellow often goes on believing that outside are UFOs landing close to that lonely
    country hotel. And so just *this* is the phenomenon to be studied, at least also this. What happens in the mind of
    persons, sometimes? It happens also to well-cultured persons, not only to crackpots or to uneducated people. And
    this is extremely alarming.
  </p>
  <p>And more…. Suddenly a light appears and then it stands still in the air, a truly dazzling light. An UFO! And of
    course the self-suggestion induced by the particular circumstance immediately triggers the illusion of a telepathic
    contact (in reality this is caused by the inappropriate reaction time of mind when faced to some facts that cannot
    be easily or immediately catalogued within its experiential schemes). Suddenly the wretched person starts to behave
    strangely, and in some cases that person – almost totally “abducted” by his/her own suggestion that meanwhile is
    self-amplifying more and more – might even create a new religious sect based on extraterrestrials, our saviours, of
    course. Well…in the example that I report here, it was the landing light of an airplane, by the way, stopping in the
    air because the airplane was moving exactly along the sight line of the observer. But the “need to believe” is
    stronger than critical thinking and so a person assumes that it is an UFO: this happens to all of course; the
    problem is that only a few decide then to rationalize and to observe the fact – whatever it is – out of their
    subjective impressions or expectations.
  </p>
  <p>Nevertheless, the propagation of misinterpreted facts (namely, an emotional state, in which people likes to
    navigate) makes the rest: it works practically like the geometric progression of water lilies multiplication, not in
    a little pond but in a lake of consistent extension. A first true disaster. Of course the reaction of “skepticals”
    (if “unhealthily skeptical” they are another form of dogmatism, of opposite valence than the one above) is
    immediate: since then all that which behaves in that way is just airplane landing lights and nothing else. Case
    closed. And this is a second true disaster: a ruin against true knowledge and against a truly scientific way to
    treat facts, because this means simply “throwing away dirty water with the baby inside”. And the effects of both
    disasters mutually feed each other. In fact it is so that possibly authentic UFO events continue to appear
    undisturbed in our skies and no scientific efforts are done to discover what they are. As is it possible to see, all
    this is a socially “self-replicating machine”, the “lie-machine” that maintains us in the total ignorance, in
    addition to rendering who leads us stronger in the power of manipulation of the masses. In practice this psycho-
    sociological mechanism is similar to what occurs with some very dogmatic religions.
  </p>
  <p> Oh yes, just speaking of religions… I have had the occasion more than once to be approached by some persons who
    belonged to a very famous pseudo-religious sect. That person told me that he could report “light spaceships” and
    that such miracle was appearing on his photos, but he also told that he was brave to discover them because – he said
    –<q> “I zoom on this bright spot and I can see the light spaceships in all their magnificence. They just appear
      because they read in my thought.”</q> So, let’s tell what his discovery was. In fact I also did tests with my
    reflex digital camera. In some photos strange light spots were effectively coming out and if I resized the area of
    interest I was finding a sort of pink flying saucer. The one below is one example.
  </p>
  <p>Figure 5. Photoshop resizing of a light spot that occasionally forms in digital cameras. (Test carried out by the
    author, using a Fujii Finepix S-2 Pro digital reflex camera)
  </p>
  <p> Well… not spacecrafts. This is simply the effect of an anomaly that is often present in the CCD sensor of digital
    cameras. It simply means that all over the pixel matrix occasionally some pixels respond too much to light or they
    activate incorrectly due to some malfunction of the photo-electronic process in the CCD, and the effect that they
    produce when zoomed is just like the one above: not a “light spacecraft” but a defect of the CCD sensor, which I
    have often encountered in the types of digital cameras I have been using. Of course also the opposite can happen:
    dark spots that appear on photos taken at daylight. The interpretation by many is immediate: far flying saucers,
    balls, cylinders and mother-ships, which are monitoring us obviously. No: they are simply caused by stain dust that
    occasionally deposits on the CCD sensor; the dust can enter very often inside when the lens is changed often with
    another one. It is sufficient to clean the sensor using the appropriate stain remover together with a cloth, and
    mother-ships suddenly disappear from the photo (not via teleportation to another space-time). But many persons are
    going on posting this trash on Internet by passing them for UFO, and also some well-selling UFO magazines do the
    same when they do not know how to fill a monthly issue: everything makes a soup. I might also include in the list of
    misinterpretations: owls photographed when illuminated by the beams of car headlights, birds or insects passing in
    front of the video camera at daylight, migrating bird flocks high in the sky in geometric formation, lights of
    little towns on the top of hills in a foggy weather, cars headlights affected by mirage-like refraction in desert
    areas, double reflections of the sun or the moon, planet Venus seen through quickly moving clouds, two or
    three-planets conjunctions: the owls suddenly become flying saucers or triangles in the starry night, birds and
    insects become dark spacecrafts in the clear sky, bird flocks become "flotillas" of spacecrafts monitoring the sky
    from up, bell towers in the fog are landing UFOs, cars become suddenly landed spacecrafts, double reflections become
    suddenly UFOs that want to be seen while we look at the moon, Venus becomes an UFO chasing us, planets very close
    together become a group of UFOs standing still in the sky, and there is much more! The UFO phenomena that are
    reported and so irresponsibly waved on the web are just this for 90% or 95% of the cases and people believe
    a-critically to an escalating UFO phenomenon, while some "ufologists" have artfully smelled the business, and some
    TV programs are doing even more. So the study of true UFO cases is totally impaired. Is this only due to credulity
    and lack of critical sense of people? No, not only due to that. The second damage will be done immediately lately by
    the so called "skepticals" who will so standardize their explanations without even trying to carry out true
    investigations case by case (… the so called "armchair ufology"…). Therefore the disaster is double here, and the
    true UFO phenomenon goes on occurring, unperturbed and – above all – not scientifically studied, except for a
    handful of cases.

  <h2>True lies</h2>

  <p> Let’s speak now of true lies concerning UFOs. Of course we do not consider here the intrinsic contradictions with
    which certain UFO “news” are propagated or even the confusion of facts and witnesses of the present with the ones of
    the past (an example here is shown in the Appendix at the end). Let’s focus now on faked images that are presented
    like “spacecrafts” from outer space. By the way I just did three just now and it took 30 minutes in total, by doing
    a few Photoshop manipulations. I simply used three kinds of chandeliers, which were taken from here:
  </p>
  <p> https://www.flickr.com/photos/ogimogi/2204568888/<br> https://www.macandmacinteriors.co.uk/images/slide_ufo_425a.jpg<br>
    https://imgs.inkfrog.com/pix/pcashop/0003a.jpg
  </p>
  <p> And then I turned them into three different types of UFOs in the night sky. The result is presented on the right
    of each of the three photos, together with the artefact from which they were originated (on the left of each photo).
    Are we sure that someone will check at least the homogeneity of photo’s granularity and the way in which the light
    works in comparison with the environment in which the alleged UFO was photo-reported? In fact I did these fakes
    deliberately rough just in case to test people minimum analytical and critical sense (if only I had been so reckless
    to post them on the web). A few months ago a friend of mine, using very sophisticated software, did much better and
    posted the test-fake on Internet
    (https://www.automiribelli.org/docu/automiribelli-guerre_spaziali_savio_ravenna.pdf): the laughter was punctually
    assured, but the truth was soon revealed before the small snow-ball became an avalanche. I didn’t use any
    sophisticated software but simply the most updated version of Photoshop software that is omnipresent in our
    computers. In fact most people still now do not well realize that at their disposal they have a potential
    “subliminal weapon” in order to transform persons into remotely controlled zombies. And not only that: that’s a
    powerful method to discredit the entire true UFO research too. Thirty minutes of working on the fakes using the
    Photoshop-howitzer, five minutes of downloading these (in this specific case, only virtually) on blogs, websites,
    Youtube and newsletters, and click: after the shot the play is done. Internet itself makes the multiplicative effect
    and after a few days sensational news will start to circulate: at that point everyone will have even forgot the
    source of the “data”, while the cake will go on leavening, and even the dreams and psychic life of people who
    occasionally look at this crap will be affected. A powerful social weapon, no doubt! How many controls on the
    shameful diffusion of this deliberate misinformation / media terrorism? Zero! We are a democracy, of course and
    everyone is allowed to tell all the *bleep* he/she prefers: or is this the manifestation of a *faked democracy*
    presented as a true thing? Meanwhile the machine of money-making and the fever of ego-shows go onto exponentially.
    While somewhere obscure … hem… “Directors” …reunite the administration council in order to study carefully how
    citizens can be piloted/manipulated and how to take profit from all of this for several goals, namely: “how and
    where the shepherd will conduct sheep, this time”.
  </p>
  <p> Consequently to this, it is not so difficult to understand why and how science is important in all of this stuff.
    Isn’t it? Science and rationality, applied also to the study of anomalies, have the true and concrete power to make
    citizens *leaders of themselves*, and, at the same time, a healthy and lucid distinction of grain from weed can open
    for us the door of new frontiers of knowledge and maybe also of new propulsion systems. But ordinary people prefer
    to dream them than doing them really. And it is on this that the “social status quo” is maintained. Therefore, where
    is exactly the so much praised "power of Faith" in moving our actions? Maybe here someone has confused the
    possibility to "believe in ourselves" (power of intention) to DO something with the blind faith on something
    external that works for us lazy individuals. From that: the faith in hoaxes too.
  </p>
  <p> So now, let’s see my experiment as a faker at the beginner level.</p>
  <p>Figure 6. Three UFO fakes built up by this author using Photoshop, the image retouch software. Left. Sources of the
    fake (three types of chandeliers). Right. Suddenly the UFO appears in the sky.
  </p>
  <p>Let’s now plunge into the hardcore now … the abduction of a cow. In order to do this I used image posted at:</p>
  <p> https://k41.pbase.com/u13/dajavu/upload/3402906.1262676_web_parklotlamp2.JPG<br> (Photo of a parking lamp of modern
    type by David J. van Unen)
  </p>
  <p> Look now at the result after 10 more minutes of faking:</p>
  <p> Figure 7. Another UFO fake built up by this author using Photoshop software. Left. Source of the fake (a modern
    design of street lamp). Right. Suddenly the UFO appears in the sky and makes its action using a beam (often called
    “solid light” by ufologists).
  </p>
  <p> Of course this is surely an UFO that is sucking up a cow or a fat human using a “drawing beam”. In order to better
    comment all of this please consult this page:
  </p>
  <p> https://www.tradebit.com/filedetail.php/835430-big-laughter-collection-sound-effect</p>
  <p> And now the strong dish: the pilot of the UFO who is carefully managing the lifting of the cow from a remote
    junction box, as it was photographed by an abducted person through a strange porthole, just inside, while our friend
    was looking at the control panel:
  </p>
  <p> Figure 8. The ultimate Photoshop fake by this author: an alien being aboard the UFO.</p>
  <p> Well… for respect of privacy (apart from chandeliers and lamps, persons cannot be used in such a way) I couldn’t
    use the face of others to make the fake of the alien now. I just faked a photo portraying myself when I was a child.
    Here a challenge to experts: please, try to retrieve the original image. It is not an alien: it is me, after I
    “photoshopped” me.
  </p>
  <p>Now let’s imagine what happens if I decide to perpetrate all this on Internet. Experts and photo-technicians will
    be easily able to unmask immediately these so naive fakes, including probably also people who have only an
    elementary common sense. But most people will not, especially those who “want to believe”, whatever their education.
    Therefore, if I had decided to post all this publicly, I would have added one more (multiple) Lie to the huge
    collection of the human ones. Not only that, but I would have been also responsible of a manipulation of the psyche
    of the unprepared public. If I had really done this action I would have felt myself in fault, honestly. But
    evidently there are many who go on with this without scruples; after all it is so amusing to make a fun of the
    others, practically like when we make our cat play with the red spot of a Laser pointer: as everyone knows the cat
    becomes crazy and starts to follow the spot in an untiring manner. In such a way we just “remotely control” the cat
    using his urge to chase the spot in order to make his life fuller of attractive plays. We are doing exactly the same
    when we administer faked UFO photos to the public, and in doing so we are committing a moral crime not only abusing
    people credulity and creating the roots of a potential social disorder and alarm but also discrediting the serious
    efforts of some ufologists and scientists (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._McDonald) who spend much of their
    free time and money to investigate rationally (plus the necessary open mind) a problem that is indeed serious, but
    which unfortunately totally disappears from objective existence due to the ocean of fakes and hoaxes of which the
    “UFO community” feeds itself, especially after the wide diffusion of Internet (Youtube, in particular). In few words
    faking and hoaxing destroys any attempt to carry out research on some true anomalies, of which we need urgently a
    scientific explanation. In fact, carrying out serious research on UFOs (and even on the so called “paranormal”) is
    not only a pioneering exploration of the frontiers of science with an intellectually enlightened (and not romantic)
    goal in mind, but also a duty towards society. A society that doesn’t deserve to be made a fun of, but which must
    work as a synergy of really awake citizens, one of the scopes of whom is also self-determination and intellectual
    freedom.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>A recent case in Torrington</h2>

  <p> And what happens then when the faker is so lazy that he doesn’t even feel like making up an UFO by
    photo-manipulating known objects? Of course he takes another UFO (of which – by the way – in its turn there is no
    proof of authenticity), rotates it of 180 degrees horizontally, enhances colours and light, and the play is done. It
    seems to me that something similar has happened very recently (March 2009), for instance concerning the Torrington
    UFO case too (https://www.ufodigest.com/news/0309/torrington-print.php). The alleged “UFO” portrayed there is simply
    a manipulation of a quite old case, which was allegedly reported in Atlixco, Mexico, 1991 (see Appendix). The way in
    which such an alleged old case has been “re-proposed” is truly childish, but yet: how many thousands of “believers”
    will fall into this trap? Probably many, too many…
  </p>
  <p> Of course the faker thinks he is artful, because so he wants to show the "morphological constants" of the UFO
    events, a worldwide phenomenon, of course. Well, in doing that, he suddenly destroys the fact that effectively the
    true UFO phenomenon shows constants everywhere in the world, and the Torrington example given above might be really
    related to one or more truly happened events. But their possible authenticity has been devastated by a simple faked
    photograph for doing which it took only 3 minutes. In few words, the association of an entirely faked photo with
    possibly true sightings in<br> that area can trigger in the short run some unpleasant effects, such as discrediting
    the efforts of serious scholars in true UFO research, and/or discrediting and offending the good faith and
    engagement of honest witnesses of possibly true facts. The association of faked material (sent and widely spread by
    persons of doubtful preparation) with true events, is not only immoral in itself but also a devastating damage to
    the credibility of serious UFO research to the eyes of the public that is uninitiated in this delicate matter.
  </p>
  <p>Anyway, I might feel like furnishing here additional suggestions on how to propagate even more the hoax starting
    from the original case from which everything started. It took 17 minutes to me to produce all this.
  </p>
  <p> Figure 9. Various possibilities on how to fake an UFO case even more. Above. The “original” object photographed in
    Atlixco, 1991 (left). Three possible variants of new hoaxes that might be produced using the same photo (from left
    to right). Below. The same object was photographed in Europe too, in 1963 !!! This demonstrates the existence of a
    morphological constant all over the world (oh My…. Just the same object!)
  </p>
  <p><em> Now just a brief note here. Are we totally sure that people will read carefully the desacralizing content of
    this paper of mine and that someone will not focus his attention only on images? We’ll see all this very soon on
    Internet, and it will be an even more useful Test, just to verify if people reads and cogitates the content of a
    document or only focus their attention on images.</em></p>
  <p> Going back now to the subject that is discussed in this paragraph, in the specific Torrington case if the person
    who did that artefact wanted to make a simulation of what allegedly happened in the area using a previous UFO photo,
    he should have declared this explicitly and immediately close to the photo that he spread in a so unscrupulous and
    cynical way: only in that way he would have behaved correctly, such as in this case for instance:
  </p>
  <p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jgxbp3uutk&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=322AE4B2A8B54DE8&amp;playnext=1&amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;index=9</p>
  <p> So it easy to notice that a simple fake prepared in 3 minutes posted on Internet (and, in case, published also on
    magazines and newspapers) is sufficient alone to destroy or at least seriously spoil a sequence of investigations
    that in that specific area are worth doing since at least decades (https://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc685.htm).
    But this is the best way to block totally research on these anomalies, by just discrediting them by means of the
    perpetration of plain hoaxes, which in this case work exactly as a smoke curtain. So now the two fateful questions:
    Why? Who?
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2> Why ? Who ?</h2>

  <p> Concerning the first question – Why? – there are several possibilities. The most mundane possibility is that human
    stupidity and dishonesty is the main constant of the problem. A less mundane possibility is that someone who is
    really artful and who studied very deeply social sciences, using specific soldiers (“contractors”?) might have
    *ordered* a campaign of discredit concerning the UFO phenomenon for two possible (alternative) reasons: let’s now
    visualize these two possible scenarios with the words of their hypothetical wicked creators :
  </p>
  <p> A) <q>“….The social and economic situation is quite serious now and people sooner or later will start to react
    maybe in a disruptive way. Therefore let’s give them a social anaesthetic</q> (“intellectual bromide”?) <q>so that
    they calm down and we have not to face too many problems with containing the unsatisfied masses ”</q> ;
  </p>
  <p> B) <q>“….The UFO phenomenon is so widely diffused that we need to avoid the panic in the public and/or to shy away
    from showing our impotence in facing this problem, so that we have to discredit it totally and the best way to do
    this is to make so that true facts are mixed up with lies, so that the second destroy the first… We hire
    contractors, yes…” </q>.
  </p>
  <p> In both scenarios we have a constant: to maintain social control by appealing to people’s credulity and intimate
    need of spiritual values that is typical of our materialistic and competitive society.
  </p>
  <p> Concerning the second question – <em>Who?</em> – Well, it is much more difficult to depict possible scenarios. But
    certainly the *who* who decided to prepare this scenery is someone from up in our society, but not necessarily from
    the government (which might be totally unaware of what is going on). How much “up”? Maybe here we have three
    speculative scenarios (one of which very extreme); let’s put it again in the hypothetic words of the personages who
    might be at the source of all of this staging:
  </p>
  <p> A) <q>“ We have a problem in conducting and controlling this society, so we now need to make a mass-test to see if
    and how much society is manipulable … And… why not… we also need to trigger the creation of new pseudo-religious
    sects</q> (in addition to the other 3 famous ones – by the way – strangely untouched by the main skeptical
    societies) <q>just to maintain faithful and obedient the sheep who are under our conduct. Critical thinking is not
      desirable as it might be socially explosive so that we couldn’t easily move in our stealthy action in directing a
      society that must remain catatonically stable. We need a mass of stupid individuals: in few words a form of social
      lobotomy. So, let’s create a reality that doesn’t exist and that makes them dream so that they are diverted from
      concrete problems, and let’s put UFOs into their subliminal menu. ”</q></p>
  <p> B) <q>“ They are now more conscious of our existence, we cannot fly any more so easily in the skies of this
    dangerous planet. We need to hide better our presence. So let’s use our own techniques of mind control and let’s
    induce some people to spread hoaxes concerning us. The process will exponentially self-replicate and at that point
    none will believe in our existence, not even if we land on the lawn of the White House. Moreover, we are very afraid
    of scientists who might unmask us and that perspective might be a threat to us. After all we found a so pretty
    hen-house here (the one that we also genetically care since hundreds of years), and we cannot make it escape from
    our possession. Ah… And let’s not forget to send sometimes ELF pulses in order to affect the brain of these idiots:
    inducing hallucinations might be also helpful to discredit our existence.</q></p>
  <p><q>And let’s be fast… there is one guy at Laurentian University</q>
    (https://www.geocities.com/satanicus_2/GodHelmet.html) <q>somewhere there who discovered in a lab how some waves
      affect the brain. Let’s not permit him to build up a potential shield against any source of EM waves affecting
      human bioelectric activity. Meanwhile let’s go on inducing the diffusion of the fake telling that human HAARP is
      responsible for all of this. ”</q></p>
  <p><q> C) “ Since eons I am The King of this world (and the way in which I have been portrayed by Church is simply
    ridiculous). The parallel dimension in which I live is very comfortably safe and – me, the monkey of God – I play
    with these monkeys like with the marbles of billiards and it is a pleasure for me to use my stick to put the one
    against the other, according to my needs, as Earth is mine such as many other planets. As a Prince of the Air, my
    force is in the power of inducing illusions in the psyche of people and also in the ability to create things and
    artificial life forms from the nothing – including the “soldiers” I need – by moulding them according to the
    mankind’s beliefs of the moment. Oh… I know quite well the “hidden iceberg” of quantum mechanics of which these
    monkeys know only the tip, I am the King of *scalar waves*, the Technologist of mind-matter interaction and the
    Emperor of Illusion. ”</q></p>
  <p> Clearly scenarios B) and C) are very exotic indeed: yet the way in which the worldly society goes often brings
    some of us to this kind of speculation. After all none can demonstrate yet the non-existence of aliens visiting
    Earth or of the atavistic Mr. X. And maybe there might be also intermediate combined scenario such as: C)
    interacting with A), B) interacting with A), B) and C) being the same thing, or even B) and C) totally nonexistent,
    for instance. Of course these are only mere thought experiments, but looking at the mechanism with which hoaxes
    occur I might feel myself tempted – as it occurred above – to make some reflections.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2> UFOs that are realities and hoaxes at the same time</h2>

  <p> Any scientific evidence of one of the three scenarios ventured above? Maybe yes. And this evidence might be simply
    given by the fact that hoaxes are not only happening after Photoshop manipulations of known images but the nature of
    the UFO phenomenon itself might be a deliberate hoax (or at least a large part of it) on a large scale, of very
    sophisticated nature evidently. Let’s look for instance at this brief technical report, posted here:
  </p>
  <p> https://www.surfin.com.au/AvalonBeach_Report.pdf</p>
  <p> The person who took these UFO images has been careful and also technically precise, methodical and constant in
    monitoring the phenomenon occurring in his area, while the analysis of those images has been carried out canonically
    and precisely and left no space to doubts regarding what came out. But monitoring what, exactly? A careful
    spectroscopic analysis shows an entire physical nonsense concerning alleged propulsion of such “UFOs”. Really an
    engine that works with Mercury in some way would produce simple and unperturbed spectral lines exactly similar to
    the (old-style) ones of our streetlights? After all airplanes do not use Mercury lights, but their illumination
    system mostly produces a continuum spectrum (without lines). And airplanes do not perform such acrobatics and/or
    split in more parts and/or melt into plasma cloud. On the other side a flying vehicle able to produce a Mercury
    plasma as a by-product of propulsion, should show clear alterations of spectral lines in form of enhanced line
    broadening (https://www.libreriauniversitaria.it/excitation-atoms-and-broadening-spectral/book/9783540586869), such
    as strong Doppler and pressure broadening of the plasma therein, Zeeman or Stark splitting effect due to the
    respective presence of a strong magnetic or electric field, rotational and/or turbulence line broadening, and maybe
    also a line-broadening effect of gravitational nature. But in this specific case spectral lines are totally
    unperturbed as if these "UFOs" use common Mercury light for illumination and for signalling their presence. Apart
    from the belief of some ufologists in the legendary "Vimana engine" (working with Mercury, as they claim :<br>
    https://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc110.htm), are really aliens so stupid and totally lacking in tactical and
    strategic sense? But maybe here the strategy might be another one: creating an illusion in the sky in order to
    induce and then test reactions from people, maybe also with the purpose to manipulate them. One thing is clear:
    those lights, in spite of their spectacular nature, are not at all what we would expect from alien visitors, unless
    they decided to use some form of (pathetic) mimicry to try to imitate an airplane of ours, both in the manifested
    lights and in the produced sounds (https://www.sunstar-solutions.com/AOP/Boomerang/Boomerang.htm#Sound%20Analysis).
    If so, in spite of their use of an old system of illumination, they would anyway render their behaviour stealthy to
    our science measurements, meaning that they would hide their propulsion system in some way by camouflaging with some
    ridiculous light. At least it so appeared according to the report concerning “mercury aircrafts”.
  </p>
  <p> Alternatively, they might not be alien visitors at all, but simply an application of alternative scenarios (A)
    and/or C). For sure the military have at their disposal several "illumination artefacts" (a few years ago I received
    a private communication concerning such an issue by a researcher working just on this) and they, together with
    sounds and other devices, use them as a form of "psychological warfare". If this possibility (including also the C)
    scenario, whatever its exoticity may be, if we do not want to blame the military) is true then we have a
    scientifically unmasked example of "Authentic UFO phenomenon that is a Fake itself, to be administered to the
    masses", created in order to cheat and deceive mankind, as a *control system*. Probably Dr. Jacques Vallee knows
    already much of this (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Vallee). Once more, the evidence from the brief report
    cited above is: physical nonsense concerning propulsion. But it would be interesting to see what happens elsewhere
    in the world, even if taking a well-done spectrum is not at all a so easy operation: and, in order to build up a
    good statistics, spectral gratings should be distributed to many citizens who then should attach them to their
    cameras.
  </p>
  <p> Of course a true scientific investigation of UFO phenomena demands the use of complete instrumentation to be
    deployed simultaneously. For instance: taking optical spectra, videos and photos needs to be accompanied also by the
    measurement of the electromagnetic field and of the magnetic field and by the monitoring of the infrared spectrum,
    all of which supported by radar and/or Laser telemetry and range finding (https://www.itacomm.net/ph/phdata_e.pdf).
    Deploying all of this, in addition to being economically very expensive, is quite difficult, especially because true
    UFO phenomena occur mostly unexpectedly and randomly. But there are indeed areas of recurrence in the world (one
    famous example here: https://www.hessdalen.org/). This regards mostly anomalous light phenomena of probable
    geophysical and/or atmospheric origin, and several continuing scientific monitors have been attempted in the recent
    past by several research teams (here an example:
    https://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_18_2_teodorani.pdf).
  </p>
  <p> Clearly the same methodology described above can be put in practice also in the case of UFOs that are suspected to
    be of technological nature. An analytic approach can very quickly rule out fakes, hoaxes, true natural phenomena, or
    misinterpreted facts. But what then if someone discovers that the hoax does not only implies classical fakes but
    also a possible "MOAH" (acronym for "Mother of All Hoaxes"), deployed on a worldly scale, that is truly flying over
    our heads? Science can unmask this too (as it was already tested in the specific case that has been just discussed),
    and maybe someone or something should start to tremble, because sooner or later the analytic monitoring using
    appropriate optronic units might be systematically extended to all Earth.
  </p>
  <p> The scenario that has been discussed right now doesn't mean that all true UFOs are the product of some artful
    illusionist. Something technological might really exist but it might be deeply hidden and obscured inside an ocean
    of more or less deliberate human (and maybe non-human too?) fakes. A careful and recent collection of informative
    facts concerning new projects by the military – such as new advanced models and/or projects of UAV, UCAV, OAV and
    drones in general – seems to show quite clearly that these vehicles might simulate the shape of an UFO indeed (for
    instance, we might mention the present X-45, X-47, Taranis and Neuron experimental projects) but not at all its
    typical flight and illumination characteristics. On the other side, the myth of the “Aurora” (or “TR-3”) aircraft –
    allegedly propelled by a sort of anti-gravitational engine – seems to be more a metropolitan legend running through
    the corridors of UFO conferences, than a true fact. If, for instance, the US government had really at its disposal
    such a futuristic aircraft, there would not have been any need to spend a lot of money to deploy the F-22 and the
    F-35 multi-role fighters as it happens now. And probably recent wars would have been won in a much shorter time.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2> Conclusive remarks</h2>

  <p> Searching for a science of UFO phenomena and doing rational witness investigations are the main tasks of our team.
    Of course neither this scenario escapes our consideration: someone might fake the phenomena themselves in order to
    “cover” a true exogenous presence in our skies. Or maybe all UFO phenomena are the result of a sophisticated fake
    planned and created by a form of “dark intelligence” whose scope is to deceive and control us, perhaps with the
    collaboration of some obscure leading personages living and acting on this planet. Only science and its methodology
    will establish what the final answer is, and in both cases the arrival of a clear answer is expected to be a big
    step forward in the walk for knowledge and full consciousness of mankind of its potentiality and freedom in its own
    planet, a beautiful planet as well as its inhabitants. A scientific approach can only render all of us leaders at
    our home whatever will be the answer to the big question. And if true UFO phenomena resulted to be really of alien
    origin we would have the possibility to learn from them what one day we’ll also be able to do ourselves. If all the
    stars, according to their mass, evolve in a similar way all over the Universe, this might be the same for the
    inhabitants of their planets and their technology. All this said, without excluding another possibility: that,
    dimensionally speaking, the Universe is not only a “flat” composed of many apartments but a “skyscraper” composed in
    its turn of many flats that are one over the other. After all the mathematical framework of superstring theory
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) already shows that the Universe is multi-dimensional, and in other
    dimensions of the Universe as a whole maybe laws of physics that are different from ours might exist, including the
    process in which life forms are born and develop. After all only in our Universe itself it seems that alternative
    life forms may exist in addition to the one based on Carbon and/or Silicon biochemistry, as for instance: life forms
    based on plasma: https://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1367-2630/9/8/263/njp7_8_263.html . But here we are speaking only of
    what happens inside our “flat”, not of what might happen inside the other flats of the “skyscraper”. Probably more
    things exist in the “sky” than whatever a human mind can imagine and maybe there, among the labyrinths of superior
    dimensions, immeasurably evolved beings might nest unnoticed, together with their *technology* of Matter, of Energy,
    of Life and of Mind.
