<p> The tactical goal that induced me to make this quantitative screening was to verify if some significant trends can
  be identified both in space and in time. In order to achieve this task some parameters have been opportunely chosen.
  The most natural choice from a scientific point of view was to try to see if any trend (of any kind, not necessarily
  only linear or exponential, but also periodical) was detected in a sample of data containing a sufficiently
  statistically populated number of cases. This test started with the Connecticut cases, and in fact both the time and
  the duration of reported UAP sightings have been plotted against Julian Date, being confident that the Julian date
  system, normally used in astronomy for precision studies of variable celestial phenomena [Refs. 24, 105], might reveal
  something after a subsequent analysis was done. The final result was that time-series analysis [Ref. 93] showed no
  possible periodicity, no significant trend of any kind, except for the fact that the number of recorded sightings is
  clearly increasing with years both in terms of the number of cases at a given time and date and in terms of a widened
  hourly-range (see Fig. 1). </p>

    </tr></table><p>What is the meaning of all this? This will be discussed in a further section, when such an increase
    in number of UAP cases with time will show itself in a more marked and clear way. As it will be discussed later,
    this is not due to a real increase of UAP cases with time. The intention was just to start immediately with temporal
    analyses that are more refined than normal histograms, using the same approach that astronomers normally use when
    they want to carry out variability studies on some particular classes of stars. In this case the Julian Date system
    is commonly used as a time precision tool. If then a periodicity can be identified then a “time phase” can be used
    as an independent variable, with a highly predictive valence. But the experiment done showed that this unfortunately
    doesn’t happen when the same procedure is applied to UAP databases. As it will be seen later, UAP sightings reported
    in Connecticut follow a very similar time trend as the New York and Ontario ones: so there was no convincing reason
    to waste new time in order to apply this kind of temporal analysis to the other two areas.</p>
    <p> Therefore, the globally disappointing results obtained with this first study, where the sample is quite well
      statistically represented, invited me not to repeat the same test for the Ontario and New York cases. After this
      choice was done, the analysis was from then on focussed on the choice of more general and classical parameters
      such as the number of UAP cases as a function of time range, month and year. If we consider the first one of these
      three statistical checks that were carried out, where the number is counted during the last 60 years, what we
      obtain is shown in Fig. 2, which shows that cases reported in Ontario, New York and Connecticut are quite well
      correlated together.</p>
    <p>Figure 2. Up. Number of UAP Sightings plotted vs. Time Range for three compared areas: 1) Connecticut state
      (USA): 543 data points; 2) New York state (USA): 2057 data points; 3) Ontario province (Canada): 969 data points.
      Down. Correlation between the three cases.</p>
    <p> This similarity in the time behaviour of the three cases is not surprising at all and probably tells almost
      nothing on the intrinsic nature of the investigated phenomenon. The reported behaviour most probably shows a very
      marked “selection effect” due to the fact that witnesses of UAP sightings are much more numerous in a time range
      in which they are freer (mostly from work time) to look at the sky and when they are still awake. The higher
      frequency of cases reported at certain hours at night is probably due to the perceptive effect [Ref. 102] of the
      witness in general: it is here expected that “nocturnal lights” (of the structured and unstructured kind) in
      general tend to attract the attention of people much more than daylight anomalous aerial phenomena. But maybe, as
      it is strongly suspected, the most important component affecting this statistics is due to the fact that witnesses
      very often tend to misinterpret well known astronomic, atmospheric and aerial phenomena, such as stars or planets
      that give the impression to “run in the sky” when really the clouds are moving, luminous planets (such as Jupiter,
      Venus, Saturn and Mars) taken alone or in occasional conjunction, meteors and fireballs, occasional ball lightning
      or natural phenomena of different kind [Refs. 5, 13, 19, 21, 48, 106], airplanes and/or helicopters seen through
      particular perspectives compared to the observer, very luminous orbital satellites and space stations, bird flocks
      illuminated by city lights, single birds (such as owls) occasionally illuminated by street lights, fireworks,
      military flares, mirages [Ref. 57], moving laser beams hitting the clouds, experimental military aircrafts,
      Chinese lanterns, cars moving on the top of hills during foggy days, simple cottage lights, and probably several
      other causes that might create the illusion of seeing an UAP.</p>
    <p> A *real frequency* of the UAP phenomenon, intended as a really anomalous phenomenon, seems to be completely
      buried inside these perceptual and highly deceptive factors. Therefore the extraction of the signal from the noise
      is extremely difficult because any possible study to evaluate the noise involves many concomitant effects, which
      might also be different from state to state.</p>
    <p> What is a bit surprising is that if we make the same hourly plots just monthly and not extended to all the
      sightings that were reported during 60 years, the picture changes quite consistently. In fact the previously
      recorded correlation almost vanishes, and the three areas show a quite different hourly behaviour, despite the
      fact that here we can anyway see just a “general common increase” during dark hours. This can be seen quite
      precisely in Figs. 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D, where the Ontario, New York and Connecticut cases are considered together.
      How to explain this behaviour? Certainly one probable cause should be apparently given by the difference of
      daylight hours for areas that taken all together range from the parallel 41° (NY) to the parallel 54° (ON): this
      clearly shifts the time at which sightings are reported, with opposite conditions during extreme seasons such as
      winter and summer. Nevertheless this effect doesn’t seem to be decisive due to the fact that the most northern
      areas (northern Ontario) are much less populated than the southern ones: for instance, it is sufficient to compare
      Long Island, NY area with the most northern border of the Ontario province in Canada. As it will be seen later
      this drastic difference in population number has a very marked effect on the number of reports of UAP sightings.
      Conclusively, the difference of daylight is a reasonable factor that must be taken into account per se, but in the
      case of this specific confining group of states it must be accurately weighed state by state. However as a general
      impression in this specific case this factor seems not to be important in determining the often marked difference
      that is seen when the statistics on time range is done month by month.</p>
    <p> All this said, it cannot be therefore excluded that the bulk of a possibly real UAP anomaly is hidden inside
      these last four charts, namely in the residual that comes out from the pondered difference of the number of UAP
      sightings at a given time slot and at specific months. This is the real reason of the importance of comparing
      together UAP sightings reported in more than only one state, without limiting the statistics to only one. There is
      no doubt that the difference of the trend that is shown by the three cases contains in itself something that
      should be better evaluated. As it was discussed previously, fishing the signal from the noise here is a quite
      difficult operation. The scope of this study, as it can be seen now, is not to solve this problem once and for
      all, but to highlight this possible perspective for further studies when it will be inevitably necessary to embark
      into a multi-faceted analysis of the many accurately weighed factors that contribute in creating the “noise”
      inside these charts. This further study might maybe shed some light into the evidence of a real UAP phenomenon
      directly from UAP databases that are opportunely screened and where the individual cases are more carefully and
      accurately selected and chosen.</p>

    <p>What about now "UAP statistics" on a monthly and yearly base? Concerning the statistics by month (see Fig. 4) we
      clearly see that summer months are quite markedly favoured in all of the three states. This is logically expected
      due to the fact that summer months – in particular July and August – are the ones in which people pass their time
      more often outside due both to the good climate and to a less constraining link with work duties (and a consequent
      lesser necessity to go to bed earlier in these months). Nevertheless it is possible to notice some quite basic
      difference among the three considered areas.</p>
    <p> Figure 4. Up. Number of UAP Sightings plotted vs. Month for three compared areas: 1) Connecticut state (USA):
      543 data points; 2) New York state (USA): 2057 data points; 3) Ontario province (Canada): 969 data points. Down.
      Correlation between the three cases.</p>
    <p> The general trend shows only a quite vague, but not very strict, correlation. For instance if we look at the
      high peak reached in October by the New York state area and we compare it with the same month in the Connecticut
      and Ontario areas, we notice a pretty huge difference. The differences with which the curve grows or decreases in
      the three cases can be noticed also in some other months of the year. These differences, in particular the October
      behaviour for the New York case, might show the existence of a real “UAP flap” (or in case more than one, at
      different times) that is just “hidden” inside these curves. In few words some events that have nothing to do with
      prosaic perceptual factors might have occurred. It must be clarified that such a flap must not necessarily
      ascribed to extraterrestrial [Ref. 17] and/or interdimensional visitation. It can be caused by “everything”, most
      probably by occasional flybys of experimental aircrafts [Ref. 27] or to other specific factors that are peculiar
      of the locations where these events have been occurring. The trend by year (see Fig. 5) shows in all of the three
      areas a quite strict correlation. This is a very important result and, as it will be noticed soon, it is most
      probably not due to a real increase of UAP events.</p>
    <p>Figure 5. Up. Number of UAP Sightings plotted vs. Year for three compared areas: 1) Connecticut state (USA): 543
      data points; 2) New York state (USA): 2057 data points; 3) Ontario province (Canada): 969 data points. Down.
      Correlation between the three cases.</p>
    <p>Which other factor might account for this almost exponentially increasing trend with years? The answer is quite
      clear: the reason of this is mostly due to the exponential increase with time of the technology of communications.
      A similar conclusion seems to be suggested by previous extensive studies, including aviation-related UAP reports,
      dating back to 1930 [Refs. 114, 115, 116].</p>
    <p>Figure 6. Up. Number of UAP Sightings plotted vs. Year for the three compared areas. Down. Evolution of diffusion
      of cell phones in North America. (2008 and 2009 data were not yet available for cell phones at the time of the
      writing of the present paper.)</p>
    <p>Statistics on the technological evolution and diffusion of Internet and cell phones is shown everywhere on
      internet. In the case of the signalling of a UAP incident, cell phones, whose worldwide diffusion [Ref. 7] follows
      approximately the same trend as the one of Internet, should be considered more important because a witness can
      advise (sometimes in real time) an UAP centre from everywhere, including the car from which a given sighting has
      been just reported. Fig. 6 shows that a quite interesting correlation exists between the diffusion of cell phones
      in the world and the increase of UAP sightings with years. But this correlation is very sharp only for two thirds
      of the entire yearly curves. In fact the residuals might hold something relevant to UAPs.</p>
    <p>What occurs in the last years seems to show that something that is probably inherent to the “phenomenon” itself
      is suddenly overlapped and this happens almost exactly in the same way for the New York, Connecticut and Ontario
      areas. Let’s comment more in detail what happens here.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> From 1994 to 2004 the number of UAP sightings grows more or less proportionally to the increase of cell
        phones diffusion. So, considering only this factor the intrinsic UAP number per year should be more or less
        intrinsically constant. It is not unreasonable to guess that, as in previous statistics, this is due to a purely
        perceptual effect and to many factors, including misinterpretation of known and prosaic objects in the sky, such
        as airplanes seen at different sight perspectives, for instance. Moreover, the increase of the number of
        airplanes, of the level of their technology and complexity of their illumination system at night, might be
        another determinant factor that contributes to the increase of UAP reports with years, by overlapping
        consequently with the main factor represented by cell phone diffusion. But peculiarities do exist, indeed: the
        gradual exponential growth of UAP sightings is occasionally broken in some years in the same way for all the
        three areas (even if with different amplitude). For instance, years 1983, 1985 and 1995, and secondarily 1954,
        1957, 1965, 1970, 1975 and 1978 (see Fig. 5) show some more or less slight excess compared to the general time
        trend. Possibly a real incidence of true UAP incidents can be foreseen just in these years, maybe in form of
        true “temporal flaps”. These details might be quite important in trying to understand the behaviour of the true
        signal that we are searching for. It seems in fact that, apart from the constancy of the general trend (if we
        calibrate or normalize the diagrams by subtracting the cell phone trend) something real, even if quite tiny
        compared to the great numbers considered here, is occasionally occurring.</li>
      <li>From 2004 to 2006 UAP sightings decrease showing an occasional anti-correlation with cell phone increase.
        Namely: the UAP number drops intrinsically. This is quite interesting because suddenly the general trend is
        broken for two years and this happens for all the three considered areas. If UAP reports were referred to more
        prosaic causes this might show that in all the three areas people looked less at the sky during that period of
        time. This might be due to particularly unfavourable common weather conditions for the inhabitants of the three
        considered states or to some specific social phenomenon that must be still identified. If UAP reports are really
        referred to truly flying aerial anomalies (military experimental aircrafts and/or real signs of alien
        visitation) then this behaviour might be maybe interpreted in this way: since sixty years UAPs fly in the skies
        of Earth pretty constantly but, after some transient flaps, this constancy is suddenly slightly decreased due to
        some reason that is not possible to know at the present time: here any speculation is licit, of course.</li>
      <li>From 2006 to 2007 UAP sightings increase again and this time faster than the increase of the diffusion of cell
        phones. This means that the UAP number is not any more constant or transiently and occasionally decreasing as in
        the previous period of time but is subject to a slight intrinsic increase in the last years compared to a
        presumably constant behaviour. A quick extrapolation shows that this involves also 2008 and 2009 years [Ref.
        50], where the increase of UAP number is particularly accentuated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In conclusion it is highly reasonable to suspect that mostly the UAP number is correlated with the increasing
      diffusion of cell phones, but also that: A) in some specific years temporal flaps occurred transiently; B) in the
      last 6 years a sharp change of the constant trend occurred, characterized first by a decrease and then by a sharp
      increase. These ones might be intrinsic effects due to the UAP phenomenon: in fact this trend correlates NY, ON,
      and CT areas together quite well.</p>
    <p>Another important feature should be noticed if we look at Figs. 5 and 6. Apart from the same trend that the three
      cases show quite sharply, we notice that the amplitude of the three curves is markedly different. Do UAP pilots
      prefer a state than another in order to build their “underground bases”? Maybe, but not as expected. The amplitude
      of the shown curves depends mostly on the number of inhabitants of the New York (19.000.000) and Connecticut
      (3.500.000) states and of the Ontario (13.000.000) province. In fact, as it will be seen more clearly in a
      subsequent section concerning spatial analyses, the number of UAP sightings is quite strictly dependent on the
      number of inhabitants of a given area. And it is also logical that it happens this way. But is all this totally
      explanatory and exclusive? To give the answer we should compare together the ratio given by the number of
      inhabitants and the number of reported UAP sightings. Results give the following values:</p>
    <table cellspacing="0">
      <tr>
        <td><em>New York</em> state</td>
        <td>Ratio: 19.000.000 / 2.057</td>
        <td>=</td>
        <td><strong>9.237</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><em>Connecticut</em> state</td>
        <td>Ratio: 3.500.000 / 543</td>
        <td>=</td>
        <td><strong>6.446</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><em>Ontario</em> province</td>
        <td>Ratio: 13.000.000 / 969</td>
        <td>=</td>
        <td><strong>13.416</strong></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Clearly here a smaller ratio is an indication of a bigger impact of UAP sightings (intended as reports and not
      necessarily an alien visitation). In fact these ratios show that the state that is more affected by the phenomenon
      is not New York (biggest amplitude of the curve) but Connecticut (smallest amplitude), while the Ontario state
      (intermediate amplitude) is the one where UAPs have less impact (in spite of the additional reports compared to
      the other two areas). This clearly shows that, apart from their trend in time and the peculiarities therein (which
      are what really counts in this study), the numerical amplitude of the histograms and the curves represented in the
      charts of Figs. 2 up to 6 are just illusory, namely: they are not numerically intrinsic to the signal that we are
      searching for.</p>
