<p> One of the first diagnoses that a researcher should do when many UAP sightings are reported from a given widen area
  such as the New York and Connecticut US states and the Ontario Canadian province is to verify if these areas are
  characterized by some anomalies from a geophysical point of view. Two geophysical variables that should be checked are
  anomalies of magnetic and gravitational fields, in addition to the incidence of fault lines, seismic and/or volcanic
  areas and Radon indoor losses. An opportunely prepared <em>World Wind</em> map [Ref. 49] shows an overall
  representation of the distribution of magnetic and gravimetric anomalies that characterize the North American
  continent (see Fig. 7): these maps show how fluctuations of these two parameters are distributed spatially. The three
  states can be seen within this general map. A careful comparison of the spatial distribution of UAP reported sightings
  (see, more forewords, Fig. 11) with the <em>World Wind</em> magnetic and gravimetric map shows that no real
  correlation exists between these geophysical fluctuations and UAP sightings. On the contrary, as it will be explained
  in a subsequent section, the spatial distribution of UAP sightings is correlated with a much more prosaic factor,
  namely the population number.</p>
<p> Figure 7. Geophysical anomalies in North America (which is deliberately shown entirely in order to permit a wider
  comparison of intensities). The area of interest (NY, CT and ON states) is represented by a white box. Up. Magnetic
  anomalies (dark blue colour: -200 nT, clear blue: -100 nT, yellow: +30 nT, red: +100 nT, violet: +200 nT). Down.
  Gravimetric anomalies (dark blue colour: -60 mGal, clear blue: -20 mGal, green: 0 mGal, yellow: +20 mGal, red: +60
  mGal). These maps have been obtained using the WDMAM option of the World Wind 1.4 software.</p>
<p> Unlike the case of "earthlights" [Ref. 30], which are more likely anomalous geophysical phenomena and may be often
  correlated with the presence of fault lines and/or seismic areas [Ref. 19], UAP sightings seem not to have any precise
  and well-marked link with the geophysical characteristics of the territory, even if some of them may occasionally do.
  In fact we cannot ignore the probable fact that within the category of “UAP sightings” some more properly defined
  "earthlight phenomena" too may be mixed inside very likely, in particular inside many of the so called unstructured
  "nocturnal lights".</p>
<p>Figure 8. Yearly UAP Number vs. Local Magnetic Field Intensity (incident component) for the cases of Connecticut, New
  York and Ontario (from up). Data distribution has been fitted using a 6-th order polynomial function. The same trend
  is obtained for the X, Y, Z and H components of magnetic field intensity.</p>
<p>As it can be seen from the maps of Fig. 7, once compared with the chart of Fig. 11, the three considered geographic
  areas present a moderate level of gravimetric spatial fluctuation (ranging from -20 to +20 mGal), and magnetic
  fluctuations at various intensities that are more or less randomly scattered and that have no spatial coincidence with
  the distribution of UAP sightings all over the entire area. In conclusion, geophysical factors that are statically and
  spatially characterized (without considering time variability) have no impact in the spatial occurrence of UAP
  sightings.</p>
<p> Figure 9. Up. Decrease of Solar Activity with Years. The trend line interpolates points showing a secular decrease
  of solar activity. Down. Correlation between Solar Activity and Earth’s Magnetic Field Intensity.</p>
<p>Where the “magnetic factor” reveals to be decisive as a correlative element for UAP sightings is not in its spatial
  distribution but in its temporal variation, namely the “secular variation” to which the local Earth’s magnetic field
  is subject in time. This aspect, as it will be seen in brief, has a strict relation with the variation of the number
  of UAP sightings through the years. Therefore we now reconnect with the discussion that was started and developed from
  the statistical interpretation of Figs. 5 and 6.</p>
<p> After inserting the data concerning latitude, longitude, elevation and date inside software Geomagix [Ref. 29] of
  the National Geomagnetic Information Center (NGIC) of the US Geological Survey (USGS), it is easy to verify that the
  local geomagnetic field intensity decreases linearly of about 40 nT every year. If we then plot this parameter vs. the
  yearly number of UAP sightings we discover a quite strict exponential anti-correlation that is substantially the same
  for the New York, Connecticut and Ontario cases (see Fig. 8). Moreover, after checking the values of the secular
  variation of solar activity (deduced by the number of sunspots) during the years [Refs. 3, 66] it is easy to verify
  that solar activity is linearly correlated with Earth’s magnetic field intensity (see Fig. 9). Therefore it is
  transitively deduced that the increase of the yearly UAP number is anti-correlated with the long-term time variation
  of both the terrestrial magnetic field intensity and solar activity.</p>
<p> In few words it can be deduced that the yearly UAP number increases when solar activity and Earth’s magnetic field
  intensity decrease. Is there any interpretation in all of this? Maybe we might be in a condition to venture several
  speculations if the yearly UAP number were not correlated with anything else. But, as we have already seen (Fig. 6),
  the yearly UAP number is very well (linearly) correlated with the yearly diffusion of cell phones. Therefore we might
  have discovered a sort of “serendipitous effect” that tells us that here the really meaningful correlation is just
  between Earth’s magnetic field / solar activity and the evolution of human technology (and not the yearly UAP number).
  What does all of this mean? It seems to tell us that the products of the left hemisphere of human brain – namely
  rationality, science and technology as its most logical consequence – grow exponentially when Earth’s magnetic field
  intensity decreases linearly. This is exactly what can be inferred from these charts. This result seems to show that
  the rational ability of the human brain is sensibly affected by magnetic fields, meaning that strong magnetic fields –
  plus correlated solar activity – tend to weaken our logical-mathematical skills. From accurately prepared and
  repeatable laboratory experiments where people's temporal lobes are stimulated artificially with a weak magnetic field
  and/or ELF-VLF electromagnetic fields, it has been ascertained since at least two decades that these fields are able
  to induce hallucinations and/or “religious states” [Refs. 20, 55, 56]. It is therefore logical and elementary to
  deduce that a hallucinated mind is not able to work properly in the rational sense. But what is exactly an
  "hallucinated mind"?</p>
<p> If we then go back to human history and extrapolate the value of the Earth’s geomagnetic field, for instance, one
  millennium ago, we deduce that when our civilization was devoid of any form of technology the local magnetic field
  intensity was much higher than now. Its value was more than twice higher according to a quick calculation, namely as
  an order of magnitude, a value of 100.000 nT against one of. 50.000 nT of our times. At those times (middle age) art,
  religion, intuition, philosophy, metaphysics, alchemy, esoterism and witchcraft where characterizing the cultural
  values and often the habits of this period of the past, just the opposite than now. To quote just a few examples,
  strange beliefs in devils, angels, and "elementals" were much more diffused in the past than now (in spite of the "New
  Age phenomenon" of the present times). Was this due to a higher induced hallucinatory state of the human brain? This
  hypothesis should be investigated thoroughly by carrying out interdisciplinary studies, whose main goal should be the
  one of investigating and testing which is the appropriate intensity level of the local magnetic field (including the
  one produced by artificial means) to create a well-balanced state of our mind and psyche.</p>
<p> None really knows, apparently, if building a society only on science and technology is the correct approach to the
  life and mental sanity of an entire civilization. Does the “rational approach”, based on science and logic alone,
  create a worthwhile life or is there a worldwide problem with this? Are rational people really sure to have a
  perception of reality that is truly objective and in harmony with some “creative project”? Or does it maybe happen
  that when some aspects of life are lacking then a “psychic factor”– and not mental or hallucinatory in the biophysical
  sense – suddenly emerges, maybe as an effect of some “energy conservation”, by causing itself a distorted perception
  of the external world, such as misinterpretation of know phenomena mistaken for UAPs? This second possibility might
  overlap in its turn with the “technology factor” in increasing the number of UAP sightings with time, and maybe
  psycho-social scientists should make some investigation. Questions here are potentially many and sound, and
  speculations alone never solve the problem but they maybe might stimulate someone to do it concretely.</p>
<p> Let’s try to resume now. Using UAP sightings as a "probe" we are in a condition to deduce from the analysis of
  numbers that our technological civilization is favoured by a low intensity level of the geomagnetic field, which,
  running parallel to the secular variability component of solar activity, is subject to a gradual and constant decrease
  with time and through the centuries. But "thinking clear" may not be the same thing as "living life in a full way".
  The number of reported UAP sightings – apart from the described peculiarities – is evidently affected by the evolution
  of communication technology and, hypothetically (as it is suggested now as an additional factor), also by an
  unconscious need of humanity to re-balance its brain skills when a naturally "hallucinatory" biophysical effect is
  lacking. In few words it would really seem that mankind has not many possibilities to choose its own life style,
  unless someone will be able to "switch the Sun" and consequently to change the probably related geomagnetic activity
  in the same way in order to tune to an optimum level able to guarantee a balanced way (left and right brain
  hemispheres together) of using our brain and our psyche.</p>
<p> Maybe a really important issue has been raised here (thanks to the "UAP messengers"), because it seems it has a lot
  to do with the (maybe short-term) future of the entire mankind. All this, only partly speculative, reasoning is not
  intended to exclude at all that a real exogenous intrusion of some kind may occur in our world. After all some of the
  peculiar aspects that have been pointed out and discussed in the previous sections do overlap with some other "general
  trend". A final question now might be if is there any connection between this so potentially explainable general trend
  and the so called "peculiar aspects" overlapping it. How does something become suddenly real amidst so many illusions,
  delusions, self-induced fantasies and unconscious misinterpretation of reality? How is our mind and psyche connected
  to the cosmos in the creation [Refs. 33, 83, 84, 85, 87] of that which is called with the name of "material reality"?
  Maybe here is the true mystery.</p>
