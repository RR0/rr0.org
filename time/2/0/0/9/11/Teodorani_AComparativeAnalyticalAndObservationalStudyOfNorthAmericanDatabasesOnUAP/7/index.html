<p>A test was done in order to verify if and how UAP databases can be of some utility in order to furnish some kind of
  scientific information on the so called “UAP phenomenon”. The immediate answer is twofold: a) no information can be
  obtained on the nature of the UAP phenomenon itself; b) on the contrary, several important pieces of information can
  be obtained from the way in which UAP sightings have been described by witness in the last 60 years. This demonstrates
  that UAP databases can be very important in permitting to describe the way in which witnesses perceive the phenomenon,
  which is not the same thing as telling what the phenomenon really is. But databases of this kind, despite the frequent
  lack of important information, when they are statistically rich, can allow the construction of charts from which it is
  possible to see how UAP sightings behave both in space and in time, how they are related to the present status of our
  communication technology and to some important geophysical and astronomical parameters such as the secularly
  decreasing geomagnetic field, Moon phase and height and astronomical conjunctions. This (shy attempt of) statistical
  study on the data seems able both to construct a quite coherent picture describing the typology of the sighted events
  and to derive with a sufficient level of accuracy the real geographic frequency of UAP sightings. A cross-comparison
  of databases concerning more than one geographic area (such as the cases of New York, Connecticut and Ontario) can
  permit to verify if UAP sightings occur randomly or if they follow some precisely coherent trend. By identifying and
  analyzing the “residuals” that can be deduced from some general prosaically explained trends, it is possible to
  localize both in space and in time the effect of a presumably real anomaly, whatever it is.</p>
<p>Let’s now resume precisely the really important results that have been obtained from this quite time- wasting (but
  not useless) investigation on UAP databases:</p>
<ol>
  <li>UAP sightings show no time periodicity but they increase with years due to the evolution of our communication
    technology and, partly, due to some possible “time flaps” that seem to be intrinsic to the phenomenon itself.<br>
  </li>
  <li>UAP sightings are reported more or less at the same hour range of the day if we consider the overall behaviour
    during the years, but some not-negligible peculiarities emerge when the three geographic areas (NY, CT and ON) are
    compared together at the different months of the year, so that the difference that is sometimes seen in the hourly
    behaviour might be due to really occurring anomalies that overlap on a more general perceptive trend. Similar
    peculiarities emerge when the monthly frequency of UAP sightings is considered.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The numerical frequency of UAP sightings in the very long term (60 years, in this study) follows an apparently
    very coherent time trend for the three geographical areas. The trend shows an almost exponential increase. This
    general trend results to be due to the time evolution of cell phones diffusion, showing that it is not the UAP
    phenomenon that really increases but the capability of witnesses to report it. But, as in the cases of hourly and
    monthly behaviour the general yearly trend is overlapped with time flaps of short duration, which coherently are the
    same for all of the three geographic areas. Considering this all together it seems reasonable to assume that the
    “perception of UAP sightings” has been more or less constant during 60 years, except for flaps and a true
    short-lasting decrease in the last years. Time flaps in particular seem to show something really correlated with an
    anomaly in the sky.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Except for phenomena such as “earthlights” that might be mixed up inside the category of “unstructured nocturnal
    lights”, UAP sightings show no relation with geophysical anomalies.<br>
  </li>
  <li>UAP sightings tend slightly to appear when moonlight is weak and often when astronomical conjunctions are seen in
    the sky.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The geographical distribution of UAP sightings is not a real distribution of the reported phenomena but it is
    totally dependent on the population number of the inhabited centres from where UAP sightings are reported. A real
    geographical localization of UAP sightings can be derived only if a pondered weight on population number is
    evaluated. In such a way it is objectively possible to focus on the real spatial frequency of the sightings. Within
    the three investigated areas the Hudson Valley (NY) results to be the most important “UAP location of
    recurrence”.<br>
  </li>
  <li>People tend to perceive the shapes of UAP phenomena in the same way. Typology is not randomly distributed and
    people really see what is seen, independently from the real nature of the phenomenon.<br>
  </li>
  <li>As a serendipitous discovery within this study, it results that the intensity of Earth’s magnetic field seems to
    affect negatively human rational thinking. The evolution of technology is indeed correlated with a decrease of the
    geomagnetic field.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>We have now in hands one important datum on which to concentrate our investigative focus: if we really decided to
  carry out an expedition to this part of North America in order to attempt to obtain some scientific data using
  measurement instrumentation we now know with a certain surety that Pine Bush and surroundings in the Hudson Valley
  would be surely the preferred locations. Clearly this is a choice that would be limited only to the considered NY, CT
  and ON areas. Apart from well known areas of recurrence concerning earthlights, we have not yet a clear quantitative
  picture telling which other locations of recurrence in the world are crucial to the UAP phenomenon.</p>
<p>Organizing a field-mission is always a quite time wasting and expensive task, and it requires some trusted contacts
  in the area. There was no contact in the Hudson Valley area at the present time, but one very trustable contact
  existed in the Ontario area in Canada [Refs. 31, 32]. Therefore it was decided to carry out a mission there.</p>
