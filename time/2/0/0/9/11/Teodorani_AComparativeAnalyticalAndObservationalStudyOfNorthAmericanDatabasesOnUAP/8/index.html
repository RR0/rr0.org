<p> As it has been described in previous pages, the Ontario area, among the three considered in this study, is the one
  where the accuracy with which data on UAP sightings have been collected and carefully screened, has been of the
  highest level. Due to the reasons explained in previous sections, it has not been possible to localize intrinsically
  real areas of recurrence that can come out from the published database, but it has been possible to rely on the
  long-term experience of a “skywatcher” and investigative ufologist [Refs. 31, 32]. According to this reliable contact
  since 12 years it has been possible to know of an area (so far not accurately or sufficiently catalogued inside the
  present UAP databases [Ref. 90]) where apparent “UAP events” have been filmed many times over Lake Ontario. Moreover,
  the expertise of this scholar and investigator has been very useful and extremely instructive when trying to study in
  more detail prominent UAP sightings (independently from their recurrence in a given location or not) that occurred in
  the area North of or around lake Ontario. This scholar, who is skilled in examining very carefully the story told by
  witnesses, since a long time has been preparing very detailed maps indicating where sightings of importance have
  occurred in the last decades. It was then chosen to visit some of these areas (see Figs. 23, 24, 25), clearly
  depending on the available time for the mission (17 days) and on the clemency of the weather. The goal was threefold:
  1) to verify if some of these areas show time repeaters and how often; 2) to use off-the-shelf portable
  instrumentation for measurements; 3) to test the organizational and efficiency level that can be reached both with
  transfers to the chosen areas and with the use of the instrumentation. Before describing the results of this
  explorative survey of these areas, it is necessary to list the instruments (see Fig. 26) that have been effectively
  used (avoiding listing the ones that have not been). The list is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li> VLF-ELF receiver connected to a dipole wire antenna, attached (in a spectrometric configuration) to an Asus Eee
    PC mini-laptop computer. This spectrometer was used in order to detect and record radio waves in the very low
    (0-1000 Hz) and extra low (1000-25000 Hz) frequency range [Refs. 59, 67, 91].<br>
  </li>
  <li>Trifield Natural EM Meter and long-range antenna. This analogic instrument was used to detect possible
    disturbances of the magnetic, electric and microwave fields, but it was mostly used as an atmospheric magnetometer
    and also as an alarming detector.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Portable Russian alpha-particle detector (Geiger counter).<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fuji Finepix S-2 Pro professional digital reflex camera attached to a Rainbow Optics Spectroscope (ROS)
    spectrographic grating and to a Wratten IR filter. This camera was used mostly for low- medium dispersion optical
    spectroscopy, for high-resolution photography and for near-IR photography.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Several simple additional instruments, such as a Nikon Coolpix 5000 pocket digital camera, a compass, a visual
    X-ray detector, a 5 mW green Laser, two high-power Xenon and Halogen flashlights and a head-flashlight.</li>
</ol>
<p>The area of Lake Ontario was well known to me due to the tireless work that was done quite constantly for several
  years through the monitoring and videoing operations carried out by Project Orbwatch [Ref. 31]. The many videos that
  have been acquired from several directions (mostly from Oakville shore and from Niagara-on-the-Lake) by sky watchers
  of Project Orbwatch show the clear evidence of unstructured light phenomena (more often double and sometimes also
  triple) apparently entering inside the lake after doing a quite long-duration descent. Several observers pointed out
  that these are airplanes landing at an airport in distance, but this interpretation seems quite questionable due to
  the fact that the back of normal airplanes do not use a so powerful light: when an airplane is landing the landing
  light is obviously pointed to the opposite direction and not towards the observer. The possibility of military VTOL
  fighters of the Harrier kind landing to a possible carrier quite far on the lake has been ventured by me, not with the
  intent to quickly get rid of the phenomenon there but to try to survey all prosaic hypothetic possibilities in order
  to be more able to concentrate on the real phenomenon. After all this phenomenon has been witnessed in the past too,
  much before Orbwatch operations started [Ref. 10].</p>

  July 24 to August 9, 2009. The shores of Lake Ontario and Lake Simcoe and some places of the up-country were the main
  visited places. (The Niagara-on-the-Lake area, on the southern shore of Lake Ontario, was visited too, but no
  instrumental monitoring operations were possible due to bad weather).</p>

<p>With this philosophy in mind I have also ventured the possibility that some of the "bigger light phenomena" that a
  decade ago were videoed being “parked” just on the water surface might be caused either by sun reflection on some
  reflecting surface or by some possible flammable gas (such as <a
      href="/science/discipline/hard/nat/mat/chim/mol/methane">methane</a> for instance) coming out occasionally from
  the depth of the lake. Of course these ones are only hypotheses, certainly not the solution of the entire problem.
  Trying to distinguish the signal from the noise from this anyway spectacular phenomenon is not an easy thing so far,
  also because at the time of this mission to Ontario these phenomena were not seen, except for possibly (in a very weak
  and short-lasting mode) once when a monitor was done from Ajax (there was not sufficient time to aim the camera and
  the light was anyway too weak for getting good optical spectra using a reasonable exposure time). During the
  skywatching operations carried out at two locations (Oakland and Ajax) at Lake Ontario no (hypothetically permanent or
  occasional) anomaly was recorded either in the near infrared or in the VLF-ELF radio wavelength range.</p>
<p>These areas – not only the shore of Lake Ontario but also the up-country – are very often subject to the flyby of
  many airplanes (one after the other), some of which (quite clearly identifiable by the noise that is produced) showed
  occasionally a triangular or diamond-like light formation. This was clearly only one visual testimony, but the
  impression that it gave to me was just a suspicion that possibly some or many of the reported "structured lights" that
  have been passed for "UAP" by witnesses may be in reality airplanes having a particular light configuration. Moreover,
  the fact that often airplanes seem to stand still for quite a long time in the sky due to the zero apparent speed when
  they move in the direction of the observer and their very powerful landing light are surely an additional cause of
  (innocent) suggestion for the occasional observer. Concerning aircrafts having a specific geometric light
  configuration I am certainly not in a condition to exclude arbitrarily a "mimicry effect" [Ref. 14] due to their
  apparently conventional sound. I accept the possibility of mimicry by a hypothetical exogenous visitation [Refs. 81,
  100] but I cannot demonstrate it yet: unfortunately I couldn’t make an appropriate sound analysis at the time of
  sighting (being travelling in a highway as a passenger).</p>
<p>The optical spectrum was often recorded (see Fig. 27) when a nightly light was not identified yet as an airplane
  (thanks also to a radio-scanner promptly used by the Orbwatch person who gently accompanied me always to these
  locations), and it resulted to be always of continuum kind (no lines present therein): this is typical of halogen
  lights used by airplane illumination systems. This spectroscopic procedure was not only important to identify lights
  in the sky but it was also a very useful exercise of “speedy promptness” in the event that something really anomalous
  was caught. It is in fact expected that an anomalous aerial phenomenon (be it of technological, geophysical or
  atmospheric nature) present an anomalous spectrum as well [Ref. 77]. A spectral anomaly might be represented, for
  instance, by some broadening of spectral lines [Refs. 22, 24], such as that caused by the Zeeman and Stark effects
  (due respectively to a magnetic and an electric field), pressure-collision effect, rotational and/or turbulence
  effects, gravitational effect, or by red or blue shifts of the spectral lines themselves (if effectively present).
  Optical spectroscopy can also be very useful to unmask, in case, a prosaic illumination system caused by “light
  artefacts” (such as military flares, Chinese lanterns, or other causes that are not due to a real (more or less
  exotic) propulsion system) [Refs. 78, 79, 80]. Taking a spectrum of an object that is moving in the sky, using a
  dispersion grating (of high quality in the case of ROS), is not an easy operation. The spectrum can be well exposed
  only if the object is sufficiently luminous and not moving too fast. But it can result to be of basic importance when
  it is necessary to identify any illuminated object at night both as a diagnostic tool able to unmask fakes in the sky
  or to promptly identify normal airplanes or to measure important physical properties at the atomic level [Ref. 22]
  from which it is possible to construct some physics of really anomalous objects. Apart from the promptness and
  efficiency at any time with all instruments, unfortunately no spectrum of interest was recorded among the ones that
  were taken, during the mission to Ontario.</p>
<p>But a visual sighting of something presumably anomalous did occur from the area of Cheltenham Badlands (a very
  interesting geologic formation in the off-country, Fig. 24). A sketch of the anomaly seen in the sky at that time is
  presented in Fig. 28. The sighting dealt with two yellow lights that were moving very close together, first vertically
  and then horizontally. The object was seen from the car for about two minutes (see Tab. 2) on the return from a
  monitoring mission on the Oakland shore of Lake Ontario. The impression was that this apparently anomalous object was
  moving with no acceleration and following a slightly “wavy” motion. No noise was heard. Of course at this time no
  instrument was in function (they were all packed inside the car after using them for some hours during a monitoring
  session at Oakland shore that ended two hours before). So it has been only possible to describe this sighting (two
  witnesses) but not to take any measurement of it. According to a witness reported in the NUFORC database [Ref. 50], a
  similar sighting was reported 4 days later.</p>

<p>Figure 28. Visual sighting of suspect UAP nature reported in Badlands on July 27, 2009.</p>
<p>After sighting this probable anomaly in the sky it was decided to concentrate the next monitoring session in the area
  of Badlands. Two days later instruments were then mounted directly on the rock formation and the monitoring was
  carried out for some hours in the night. No magnetic alarm was recorded, radioactivity was at normal levels, and
  nothing anomalous was seen in the sky at that time. The same object was not seen anymore (even during a further
  monitoring session at Badlands, a week later). But that night the VLF-ELF spectrometer recorded occasionally transient
  signals of variable amplitude, which is not so easy to interpret (see Tabs. 2, 3 and Fig. 29). Of course the suspicion
  remains that this signal was caused by an interference caused by the used laptop computer (to which the VLF-ELF
  receiver was always connected), in fact this can happen many times [Refs. 59, 60]. The problem is that such a
  (sometimes extremely strong) signal manifested itself only during a few minutes in total and only during one single
  night out of over 20 hours of VLF-ELF registration sessions in more than two weeks and at 9 different locations, where
  the system configuration has been always the same. Moreover the same kind of signal has been never recorded in the
  course of previous registration sessions carried out in Italy using the same spectrometer configuration. Possible
  interference caused by other devices has always been carefully tested and examined in advance. Therefore this case, by
  my opinion, remains open. Unfortunately the very limited funds available for this mission didn’t allow the use of an
  infrared device too [Ref. 113]. If something was not visible at that time in the sky it is not certainly possible to
  exclude that it was effectively present indeed very close to us (as the strength of the recorded VLF signal
  suggested): an IR thermo camera (properly equipped with a zoom lens) would have caught and identified it almost
  immediately. This instrument is extremely important when such monitoring operations are done.</p>
<p>Clearly the philosophy of this kind of “instrumented skywatching” is very simple. The main goal is to be able to
  acquire simultaneously an optical recording (video, photo or spectrum) and a VLF-ELF recording (in case assisted by
  the Natural EM Meter). This is the only way to validate the possible anomalous nature of a VLF-ELF signal, especially
  if this can be time-correlated with something anomalous in the sky. Experience shows that being able to obtain such
  simultaneity of measurements is an extremely difficult task. Probability to see something in the sky becomes very low
  especially if few occasional hours are dedicated to the monitoring, despite of the fact that this is done at areas
  where previous sightings have been reported. Clearly an automatic monitoring system, for instance similar to the
  Automatic Measurement Station used by Project Hessdalen in Norway [Ref. 69], might be an ideal system to increase the
  probability to catch something, but due to several reasons all this would be limited to video and/or VLF-ELF recording
  but not to optical spectroscopy (unless a particularly sophisticated automatic system is used). In few words
  instrumented skywatching operations carried out directly by personnel on site has the disadvantage of offering a low
  probability to record something but has the double advantage of permitting more complete and accurate scientific
  measurements and of mobility (a monitoring station is always fixed at a spot).</p>
<p>Therefore all these considerations show that this mission on site has been a further test both of efficiency and
  promptness (not so different, conceptually, than working at an anti-aircraft post) and of testing on the field what is
  the value of ratio * results / work done * when one attempts to monitor highly elusive phenomena such as “UAP”
  apparitions. Experience clearly shows that this ratio may be much higher (namely: favourable) if, instead of UAPs,
  areas of recurrence of Hessdalen-like phenomena (presumably natural) are monitored [Refs. 69, 77]. There are good
  reasons to suggest that UAP cases too can be monitored with the same effectiveness only when an “UAP flap” occurring
  around a given location can be promptly caught [Refs. 14, 61, 68]. But this has not been the case of this mission,
  where no UAP flap was really reported at that time. In spite of this such a mission has been a very useful (new) test
  and exercise of promptness and efficiency: this know-how and expertise can be turned to one’s advantage in the
  perspective of new more favourable occasions.</p>

<p>But the recording of VLF-ELF anomalies didn’t lack in the course of this mission. In addition to the strong
  suspicious signal described above other still unexplained anomalies (more or less suspected as such) were recorded
  indeed (see Tabs. 2, 3, and Figs. 30, 31, 32), also considering that a quite rich database of known signals (of
  ionospheric and/or manmade nature) in this wavelength range is available since some years as an important tool to
  compare the “noise” with the “signal” that is effectively searched for [Refs. 59, 60]. Maybe some of the anomalies
  recorded in the course of this mission might enter into this data bank in the future if they will be clearly
  identified. Or maybe not.</p>

</p>
<p>Is there some utility in recording electromagnetic anomalies when nothing is seen in the sky at the same time?
  Probably yes. The VLF-ELF tool alone might be an efficient method to alert next observers when/if new UAP sightings
  will be reported in the area from where such signals have been recorded, or it might be a suitable method to “map
  electromagnetically” a given area, in order to permit to know in advance important information such as the level of EM
  manmade disturbance (which tends to create a very bad or poor signal quality) recorded when measurements are done at
  certain specific locations and, of course, to evaluate the possibly persistence at such locations of unexplained EM
  anomalies, which might be both of geophysical and/or atmospheric nature or of an artificial nature that cannot be
  easily explained as a manmade one.</p>
<p>The other recorded anomalies are quite interesting, and in 5 years of quite constant VLF-ELF monitoring operations
  [Refs. 77, 78] in other countries (in particular, Norway and Northern and Central Italy), such signals have never been
  encountered before. The VLF anomaly recorded at Sibbald Point location (see Fig. 30) is particularly interesting and
  some of the best experts in VLF- ELF monitoring (deliberately consulted among the most skeptical ones) do not have an
  explanation yet [Ref. 60]. Another anomaly, in this case in the ELF range, was recorded at Spectrum Airways (see Fig.
  31) air field location (where some quite important UAP sightings were reported several years ago). It was first
  suspected that the strong vertical outburst of emission might be caused by wind or by touching occasionally the
  antenna wires, but after doing several tests it was soon realized that this wasn’t the explanation. What is
  interesting here is that such very strong vertical clustered spike-like signals were preceded by a sort of “worm-like”
  signal precursors. This kind of signal occurred several times at the end of the monitoring session. Experts suggest
  that this kind of signal might be caused by some “movement of air masses” [Ref. 60]. Clearly that one was an area that
  was very frequently flied over by Cessna-like first-level trainer airplanes (taking off, touching and going, and
  landing one after the other all the time), and that night this occurred up to 11:00 PM. This might be in itself a
  possible explanation of this kind of signal, but at the moment of airplane passages (also at very low height) no
  anomaly was recorded by the VLF-ELF spectrometer (whose antenna was set up to record the electric component of the
  field). Most prominent anomalies of this specific kind were recorded predominantly after 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>As an anecdote I should remember that after 00:30 PM (at the airfield) when I was about to pack all my instruments in
  the car towards which I had started to move, I suddenly saw a quite huge and almost blinding “spherical light ball” of
  white-blue-violet colour on the ground, which was located presumably some kilometres away from the observation point.
  This phenomenon lasted a few seconds and reminded (as a perceptive effect) an “atomic explosion” seen at its beginning
  and in distance. What was it? This is impossible to tell, and, once more it must be reminded that this was another
  totally unpredictable transient light event that, by the way, couldn’t even be photographed in useful time even if the
  camera had been still in position (unless it had been taking a long exposure catching the specific time lapse of the
  light apparition). But certainly if the VLF-ELF device had been in function (I was typically recording sequential
  files that were each 20 minutes long) at the time of this big light flash, something might have been surely recorded.
  This sighting was seen only by the undersigned, as the other person accompanying me was occasionally looking at a
  different direction, while this very luminous lighting effect lasted very shortly. Once more, we see how elusive these
  kinds of phenomena are, especially when we intend to obtain scientific measurements of them. And this one was another
  very useful test, which might be very instructive for future monitoring sessions. Trying to measure UAP or UAP-like
  phenomena is not exactly like aiming a telescope at a star... And it must be once more reminded that trying to acquire
  measurements of alleged UAP phenomena is much more difficult than doing the same of very spatially recurrent
  “earthlights” [Ref. 86], unless an aimed monitor of UAPs is promptly carried out as soon as a “time flap” occurs in a
  given area of the world. The success of an operation of this kind depends mostly on the availability of the necessary
  money funding for this research, which certainly requires necessarily more than two persons working on it and several
  additional (expensive) off-the-shelf and portable instruments. Nevertheless it must be also pointed out at a quite
  good level of confidence that being able to acquire simultaneously VLF- ELF recordings, optical spectra and videos of
  a possible anomalous aerial phenomenon that is in sight would be more than sufficient to obtain scientific data of a
  certain relevance. That’s the reason why it was decided to carry out this mission even if some important sophisticated
  measurement facilities are presently lacking. Whatever is the success of this kind of instrumented missions,
  experience says that trying to do them is without no doubt an important exercise (maybe a bit similar to a military
  one) of efficiency and promptness, especially if these operations are carried out in the full darkness and at often
  impervious locations where all the instruments have to be deployed.</p>
<p>This session should be concluded just making a short list of the additional portable instrumentation and support
  personnel that the experience on the field necessary required (due to the present lack of it). The following elements
  are necessary in order to be able to carry out a full scientific analysis:</p>
<ol>
  <li>An Infrared Thermo Camera attached to a 30-300 mm zoom lens, in order to permit the uncovering of apparently
    invisible objects in the sky and to record them for subsequent analysis.<br>
  </li>
  <li>A small Radar of maritime kind (with fully computer recordable tracking data), in order to be able to track these
    objects.<br>
  </li>
  <li>A Laser Range Finder, in order to be able to measure their distance (while apparent luminosity is measured by
    conventional high resolution photography at the same time) and to determine exactly their NESW direction.<br>
  </li>
  <li>A digital and computer interfaceable Magnetometer, in order to permit computer recording of this kind of data (the
    readings of an analogic magnetometer, whatever its sensitivity and precision, can be done only by eye).<br>
  </li>
  <li>A green High Power Laser (200-300 mW), in order to attempt several tests on anomalous targets, once their
    conventional nature (such as airplanes) has been promptly excluded using other means such as a radio scanner [Refs.
    72, 73].<br>

  <li>A Microwave Spectrometer in order to possibly detect high-energy radio waves (in the range 1-10 GHz) that might be
    correlated with an anomalous aerial object in the sky.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Two Ph.D. students (in physics, astronomy, engineering) or young scientists of equivalent culture and preparation,
    in order to assist technically one or two principal investigators [Ref. 82].<br>

<p>Experience teaches that the full success of this kind of scientific campaigns doesn’t depend only on the availability
  of sophisticated instrumentation and on the presence of highly technically competent personnel but also on the
  organizational and logistics capabilities. In addition to the use of the available instrumentation, the last mentioned
  capabilities have been tested and wholly achieved during the mission carried out to Ontario, due to a quite well
  harmonized work between a physicist and an investigative ufologist of prominent general culture, specific preparation
  in the field of ufology (whatever the personal thoughts and beliefs on the UAP phenomenon may be) and excellent
  cartographic and explorative skills.</p>
