    title="Would Contact with Extraterrestrials Benefit or Harm Humanity? A Scenario Analysis">

<p>Humanity has not yet encountered or even detected any form of extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI), but our efforts to
  search for ETI (SETI) and to send messages to ETI (METI) remain in early stages. At this time we cannot rule out the
  possibility that one or more ETI exist in the Milky Way, nor can we dismiss the possibility that we may detect,
  communicate, or in other ways have contact with them in the future <span class="note">Throughout this paper we define the term “contact” broadly to include any way in which ETI has some impact on humanity.  This includes human-ETI interactions that only involve remote detection or communication without any physical contact.</span>.
  Contact with ETI would be one of the most important events in the history of humanity, so the possibility of contact
  merits our ongoing attention, even if we believe the probability of contact to be low. </p>
<p>A central concern regarding possible contact with ETI is whether the contact would be beneficial, neutral, or harmful
  to humanity. This concern will help us decide, among other things, whether or not we should intentionally message ETI
  and what we should say if we do. The short answer is that we do not know how contact would proceed because we have no
  knowledge of ETI in the galaxy. Indeed, we cannot know for sure until after contact with ETI actually occurs.
  Nevertheless, we do have some information that can help us at least make educated guesses about the nature of contact
  with ETI. Developing and analyzing this information may help prepare us for contact and increase the probability of an
  outcome that we consider favorable. </p>
<p>There have been many previous analyses of and commentaries on how contact with ETI would proceed. Unfortunately, this
  previous work tends to be quite narrow in the sense of only considering one or a small number of possible contact
  outcomes. There appears to be a tendency to jump to conclusions on a matter which remains highly uncertain and for
  which a broad range of outcomes are within the realm of possibility. Such narrow and hasty thought ill prepares us for
  actual contact. Instead, given the extremely broad range of possible contact outcomes, we would be much better
  prepared by identifying and thinking through a broad range of possible contact outcomes. </p>
<p>This paper presents a broad synthesis of available information regarding the possible outcomes of contact with ETI.
  Our work is in the form of a scenario analysis: we analyze many possible ETI contact scenarios in terms of whether and
  how they would harm or benefit humanity. In the process, we draw upon numerous prior discussions of contact with ETI
  that cover a broad range of possible outcomes, but tend to do so narrowly. Although contact with ETI has been
  discussed in the scientific literature for over fifty years <span class="source">Cocconi, G. &amp; Morrison, P.: "<a
      href="/time/1/9/5/9/09/19/Morrison-Cocconi_SearchingForInterstellarCommunications/index.html">Searching for
    interstellar communications</a>", <em>Nature</em>, 184 (1959) pp. 844-846.</span> and in science fiction at least
  since The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells in 1898, there has been relatively little effort to cumulatively analyze
  the possible outcomes compared to the synthesis presented here. To the best of our knowledge, the only previous broad
  synthesis is in the excellent work of Michaud <span class="source">Michaud, M.A.G.: <em>Contact with Alien Civilizations: Our Hopes and Fears about Encountering Extraterrestrials</em>, Copernicus Books, New York, 2007.</span>.
  The present paper has some similarities to Michaud’s work but also includes several new scenarios, a different
  organizational structure that explicitly organizes scenarios in terms of harms and benefits to humanity, and new
  discussion of scenario analysis as a contribution to our understandings of and recommendations for possible ETI
  encounters. </p>
<p>Scenario analysis of ETI contact serves several purposes. First, contact scenario analysis is of strong intellectual
  interest to the SETI and METI community and others, given the nuances and challenges involved in imagining an ETI we
  have never observed. But this scenario analysis is of practical value as well. An individual scenario is a narrative
  of a possible outcome of, in this case, contact between humanity and ETI. Such scenarios can help us train our minds
  to recognize patterns in actual outcomes. By “training our minds” we mean simply that our minds grow accustomed to
  thinking about, identifying, and analyzing specific scenarios and variations of them. The training process is thus
  simply reading and reflecting on the scenarios and the encounter patterns found in them. The patterns of an actual
  encounter may resemble the 2analyzed scenarios even if the specifics differ from the scenario details. By training our
  minds in this way, we build our capacity to analyze and respond to actual contact with ETI. The scenario analysis
  presented here thus holds practical value in addition to the noteworthy intellectual insights that come from
  considering how contact with ETI might proceed. Additionally, by considering a broad range of possible contact
  scenarios, including some that might seem unlikely, we improve both the range of patterns our minds are trained for
  and the breadth of intellectual insight obtained. This sort of broad scenario analysis can thus be an especially
  fruitful process. </p>
<p>We organize ETI contact scenarios into three basic categories based on whether the consequences would be beneficial,
  neutral, or harmful to us. Although the possibilities surely fall along a spectrum along these lines, we believe these
  three bins represent a useful categorization scheme. As defined here, beneficial contact would be desirable for
  humanity; neutral contact would cause indifference for humanity; and harmful contact would be undesirable for
  humanity. A relatively large number of the scenarios we consider fall within the harmful-tohumanity category. We thus
  further divide these scenarios into two sections in which ETI are either intentionally or unintentionally harmful.
  Note that the large number of harmful-to-humanity scenarios does not imply that contact with ETI is likely to harm
  humanity. Quantitative estimates of the probabilities of specific scenarios or categories of scenarios are beyond the
  scope of this paper. Here we focus instead on the breadth and form of the possible modes of contact with ETI. Before
  developing these scenarios, we present some background information of relevance to the discussion that follows.</p>
