<p> Even if ETI exist in the nearby galactic vicinity, this does not necessarily imply that communication with them will
  be possible or straightforward. One major challenge is selecting the frequency at which to broadcast and listen <span
      class="source">F.D. Drake, C. Sagan: "Interstellar radio communication and the frequency selection problem", <em>Nature </em>245 (1973) 257-258. 29</span>.
  The electromagnetic spectrum consists of a continuum of wavelengths for communication that includes radio, microwave,
  infrared, visible, ultraviolet, and x-ray bands. Searching this entire range is a monumental and nearly impossible
  task, so we choose particular wavelengths that seem more probable for interstellar communication. For example, the 21
  cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen was the first suggestion for a communication wavelength [1]. The water
  hole at a wavelength of 18 cm is another popular choice for SETI <span class="source">F.D. Drake, C. Sagan: "Interstellar radio communication and the frequency selection problem", <em>Nature </em>245 (1973) 257-258. 29</span>,
  and recent analysis has suggested that we shift our focus toward higher frequencies <span class="source">G. Benford, J. Benford, D. Benford: "Searching for cost-optimized interstellar beacons", <em>Astrobiology</em> 10 (2010) 491-498.</span>.
  However, because there is an infinite number of wavelengths for interstellar communication, we must acknowledge the
  possibility that ETI may be transmitting or listening at wavelength ranges that we have not yet considered. The
  possibility also remains that ETI do not use electromagnetic radiation for communication but instead have discovered
  some other method (possibly something more efficient or effective) for exchanging information across astronomical
  distances. </p>
<p>Communication via electromagnetic radiation is limited by the time required for a signal to reach its destination,
  i.e., the speed of light. On Earth, electromagnetic communication is nearly instantaneous because of the short
  distances involved. However, galactic communication occurs over astronomical distances so that even a message
  traveling at light speed will take a long time to reach its destination. For example, communication with ETI on a
  planet just 50 light years away–which is relatively close by galactic standards–will still take place on a timescale
  of 100 years. As Sagan <span class="source">C. Sagan: <em>Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CETI)</em>, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1973.</span>
  notes, this makes communication with ETI an intergenerational project: effective communication across astronomical
  distances will require unprecedented cooperation that spans several human lifetimes. This difficulty in communicating
  across such vast distances also might limit the ability for ETI to engage in interstellar warfare for the simple
  reason that the communications problem renders such warfare too logistically difficult to coordinate <span
      class="source">M. M. Ćirković: "Observation selection effects and global catastrophic risks", in: N. Bostrom, M.M. Ćirković (Eds.), <em>Global Catastrophic Risks</em>, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2008, pp. 120-145.</span>;
  peaceful endeavors such as the formation of a Galactic Club may face similar logistical challenges. Such physical
  limits on interstellar communication by ETI are in turn limits as to how ETI could more generally come into contact
  with and affect humanity.</p>
<p> Another implication of these long communication times across the galaxy is that ETI might become alerted to our
  presence without us realizing it. Communication with electromagnetic waves on Earth has been used for nearly one
  hundred years, during which time our radio shows, television programs, and mobile phone conversations have
  isotropically leaked into space. If ETI search for us just as we search for them, i.e. by scanning the sky at radio
  and optical wavelengths for any type of interstellar communication <span class="source">J. Tarter, "The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI)", <em>Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics</em> 39 (2001) 511-548. 28</span>,
  then they might detect our leakage signals. Advanced ETI within 100 light years could receive our earliest radio
  transmissions; those less than 50 light years away could watch our television shows <span class="source">L. Scheffer: "Aliens can watch 'I Love Lucy'", <em>Contact in Context</em> 2 (2004) v2i1/lucy.pdf.</span>;
  and those less than 10 light years away could receive our earliest intentional METI attempts <span class="source">A.L. Zaitsev: "Sending and searching for interstellar messages", <em>Acta Astronautica</em> 63 (2008) 614-617.</span>.
  Thus, the radiation that has been unintentionally leaking and intentionally transmitted from Earth may have already
  alerted any nearby ETI to our presence and may eventually alert more distant ETI. Once ETI become alerted to our
  presence, it will take at least as many years for us to realize that they know we are here. During the intervening
  time, ETI can respond to our presence or prepare for contact in ways that we would have no knowledge of or influence
  on. </p>
<p>Even if humanity can successfully exchange signals with ETI, there is no guarantee that the information will be
  successfully communicated. In order for information to be exchanged, it is also necessary that humans and ETI
  understand the contents of each others’ messages. It will likely be difficult at first to communicate anything
  subjective about human experience, emotions, and expressions, so mathematical conversation may comprise our first few
  exchanges with ETI <span class="source">C.L. Devito, R.T. Oehrle: "A language based on the fundamental facts of science", <em>Journal of the British Interplanetary Society</em> 43 (1990) 561-568.</span>.
  It may eventually be prudent to develop a framework for METI so as to increase the probability of successful
  communication anytime a transmission is sent from Earth <span class="source">D. Atri, J. DeMarines, J. Haqq-Misra: "A protocol for messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence", <em>Space Policy</em>, in review.</span>.
  Perhaps such schemes will succeed in effectively communicating with ETI. However, our extreme ignorance about the
  nature of any ETI means that we cannot rule out the possibility that we will fail or at least severely struggle to
  exchange information with them.</p>
