<p>If contact between humans and ETI is possible, then it is important to consider the capability of ETI to cause us
  benefit or harm. This information is important across nearly the full breadth of contact scenarios. Although we cannot
  know the level of technological sophistication achieved by ETI, we do have a compelling reason to believe that ETI
  would be significantly stronger than us and therefore highly capable of causing our total destruction. This point has
  been raised repeatedly throughout the literature [1,4,14-16,31-33]. </p>
<p>The reason to believe that ETI would be more advanced is because humans and human technology are relatively recent
  phenomena in the history of Earth. We have only had radio communication for about a century, or just a few
  generations, which suggests that advanced technology can develop quickly compared to evolutionary timescales.
  Following this reasoning, it is likely that any extant ETI has been around much longer than us and would have
  developed far greater technological abilities than we could imagine for ourselves. Even if an ETI is younger than us,
  the very ability to contact us would likely imply progress beyond that which our society has obtained. We have not yet
  figured out how to achieve interstellar communication or travel; a society that has these capabilities is almost
  certainly more technologically advanced than we are. If their communications are directed toward a general audience
  and not only intended for humans or Earth, then they may also be more advanced in their ability to communicate across
  cultural barriers. This is reminiscent of Arthur C. Clarke’s insight that “<q>any sufficiently advanced technology is
    indistinguishable from magic</q>”. If ETI are indeed more advanced, then any form of contact will likely proceed
  according to the ETI’s desires, whatever those might be <span class="source">S.D. Baum: "Universalist ethics in extraterrestrial encounter", <em> Acta Astronautica</em> 66 (2010) 617-623.</span>.
  For example, we are almost guaranteed to lose in a fight between us and them, and there is a strong likelihood that
  such a loss would be so severe that we would cease to survive as a civilization. On the other hand, if ETI decide to
  use their superior abilities to help us, then they may be able to help solve many of our problems.</p>
