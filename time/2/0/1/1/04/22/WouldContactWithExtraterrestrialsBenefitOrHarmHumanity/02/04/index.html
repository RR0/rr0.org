<p>As noted above, if ETI are significantly more advanced than humanity, then the outcome of contact may depend
  primarily on ETI desires. However, this leaves open speculation as to the specific desires of ETI and raises the
  question of what ethical framework they follow. Much can be said about ETI ethics. Here we focus on one key aspect:
  selfishness vs. universalism. In rough terms, a selfish ETI is one that desires to maximize its own self-interest,
  whereas a universalist ETI is one that desires to maximize the interests of everyone, regardless of which civilization
  they are part of. But this is a crude explanation of selfishness and universalism; more precision is needed for our
  purposes in this paper. </p>
<p>As a starting point, it is helpful to think of ETI as trying to maximize some sort of value function <span
    class="source">The discussion here is derived from the more detailed discussion found in the work of Baum.</span>
  <span class="source">S.D. Baum: "Universalist ethics in extraterrestrial encounter", <em> Acta Astronautica</em> 66 (2010) 617-623.</span>.
  Specifically, they are trying to maximize intrinsic value, which is something that is valuable for its own sake.
  Intrinsic value contrasts with extrinsic value, in particular instrumental value, which is valuable because it causes
  additional value. One can place intrinsic value on many different things, such as life, ecosystems, happiness,
  knowledge, or beauty. Human ethics is often anthropocentric in the sense that it places intrinsic value only on human
  phenomena, such as human life, human happiness, or other human factors. Such anthropocentrism is selfish on a
  civilizational scale because it involves humans only placing intrinsic value on the interests of their own
  civilization. In contrast, a universalist ethical framework would place equal intrinsic value on certain phenomena
  regardless of which civilizations possessed these phenomena. For example, a universalist civilization that places
  intrinsic value on life will place equal intrinsic value on all life, regardless of which civilization (or
  non-civilization) the life is part of. In this case, the civilization will try to maximize the total amount of life,
  regardless of whose life it is maximizing. If instead it places intrinsic value on some phenomenon other than life,
  then it will try to maximize that phenomenon wherever it occurs.</p>
<p>Conflicts between humans are often, though not necessarily always, rooted in selfishness. These conflicts include
  struggles for power, land, resources, prestige, and many other instruments of self-interest. Even when human conflicts
  have overtones of being for some higher purpose, such as for liberty or against oppression, the basic desire for the
  survival and flourishing of the self often remains a core motivation. Likewise other conflicts we see throughout the
  sentient animal kingdom appear to be motivated by the desire for instruments of self-interest such as survival, food,
  or territory <span class="source">R.W. Wrangham, D. Peterson, <em>Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence</em>, Mariner Books/Houghton Mifflin, New York, 1997.</span>.
  While non-sentient species (animal or otherwise) may also appear to act in their own self-interest, it is
  inappropriate to attribute intent to them because intent is presumably a property of sentience.</p>
<p> It is worth noting that the analysis in this paper is in a sense selfish in that it focuses on benefits and harms to
  humanity. Throughout the paper, we do not consider how contact with humanity could benefit or harm either the ETI or
  any other entities affected, including other entities on Earth and elsewhere in the galaxy. By focusing on benefits
  and harms to humanity, we do not intend to advocate for a selfish ethics. Instead, this focus is simply an expository
  tactic aimed at keeping this article reasonably concise. In our view, consideration of impacts of contact to nonhumans
  is important and would be well worth considering in future work.</p>
