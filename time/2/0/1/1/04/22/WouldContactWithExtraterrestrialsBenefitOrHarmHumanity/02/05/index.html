<p>The scenario analysis presented throughout this paper assumes that any given encounter will follow one general
  trajectory. The encounter might benefit, be neutral to, or harm humanity for a certain reason, but the encounter would
  only have one of these outcomes and follow one general trajectory to reach this outcome. This follows from the idea of
  a homogenous ETI, i.e. an ETI with one defining attribute or combination of attributes that dominates the encounter.
  The attribute could be the ETI’s strength, ethics, politics, or something else. If it is the case that the ETI has one
  defining attribute or combination of attributes, then it is reasonable to expect one general trajectory for the
  encounter. However, this requires a homogenous ETI population. </p>
<p>It is possible that an ETI would have a heterogeneous population instead of a homogenous one. Evidence for this can
  be found in the human population, which features a highly diverse mix of technological abilities, ethical views,
  national identities, and other attributes. For example, in the event of an ETI encounter, humanity may be fiercely
  divided on whether to respond peacefully or with protective aggression. ETI may be similarly divided. At a minimum,
  humanity’s diversity provides proof of the principle that intelligent civilizations can be heterogeneous. </p>
<p>The possibility of ETI heterogeneity suggests that an encounter might not follow one general trajectory but instead
  could have multiple trajectories in series or perhaps even in parallel. For example, an encounter could rapidly change
  form if a shift in power occurred within the ETI leadership. Or, we might receive mixed signals from the ETI if it
  lacks a single unified 8leadership structure; perhaps several ETI factions or nations that originate from the same
  home world will make contact with us, each in pursuit of different objectives. The possibilities of ETI heterogeneity
  and multiple trajectories are worth keeping in mind when considering the specific encounter scenarios that could
  occur.</p>
<p>Having considered these points of background information, we can now proceed to specific scenarios of contact
  between humanity and ETI. An overview of these scenarios is provided in Fig. 1. </p>
