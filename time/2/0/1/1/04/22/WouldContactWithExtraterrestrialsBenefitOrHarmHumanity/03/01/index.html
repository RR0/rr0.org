    title="Would Contact with Extraterrestrials Benefit or Harm Humanity? A Scenario Analysis">

<p>Mere detection of ETI refers to scenarios in which the entirety of contact is limited to the discovery that ETI
  exist. In other words, we detect the presence of ETI and thus can confirm their existence but have no further contact.
  This means no communication, direct contact, or any other possible contact mode. Here we argue that mere detection
  would provide a nontrivial benefit to humanity.</p>
<p> If ETI do exist within the galaxy, then confirmation of their presence would have profound implications for human
  science, philosophy, religion, and society. This point has been noted repeatedly throughout the literature
  [15,33,39-<span class="source">[41] J.D. Haqq-Misra, Planetary Messenger, Createspace, Scotts Valley, CA, 2009.</span>.
  Indeed, ongoing SETI activities are based to a large degree on the premise that humanity wants to learn about ETI. One
  reason for this is that the discovery of ETI would answer the deep and longstanding philosophical question of whether
  we are alone in the universe. This in turn relates to the question of our role in the universe as intelligent beings.
  Humanity has a strong interest in obtaining answers to these major questions and thus would benefit tremendously from
  the mere detection of ETI.</p>
<p> Some people might consider mere detection to be harmful to humanity. These people include those with religious
  perspectives and other worldviews that depend on the idea of humanity (and Earth-life more generally) playing a unique
  and privileged role in the universe (e.g., <span class="source">[42] G. Gonzalez, J.W. Richards, The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery, Regnery Publishing, Washington, DC, 2004. 30</span>
  <span class="source">T. Peters: "Exo-theology: speculations on extraterrestrial life", in: J. R. Lewis (Ed.) <em>The gods have landed: new religions from other worlds</em>, SUNY Press, Albany, NY, 1995, pp. 187-206.</span>).
  The detection of ETI could challenge these worldviews and therefore be perceived as harmful by those who hold such
  beliefs. However, this perception of harm depends on a philosophical mistake. The existence of ETI in the universe is
  independent of whether or not they have been detected by humanity. It is the existence of ETI that challenges such
  worldviews and not the act of detection. If ETI do in fact exist, then the harm has already been done in the sense
  that such worldviews are already invalid. Detection simply alerts us to this invalidity. This alert itself might be
  classified as a benefit or harm, because of its affects on the wellbeing of those whose worldviews are challenged with
  the discovery of ETI, but this is seemingly a lesser matter than the broader benefits of mere detection. </p>
<p>More troubling is the possibility that detection could initiate or exacerbate conflicts in our society. The conflict
  could be over how to interpret or reply to such a discovery. There are already disagreements over how to message to
  ETI, whether or not we should, and who should 10speak for humanity; such disagreements would become much fiercer if
  ETI were detected. Meanwhile, the groups whose worldviews would be challenged could respond in harmful ways if they
  feel threatened, nullified, or otherwise worsened by the discovery or the intent to reply. While we hope that
  detection would unify humanity towards positive outcomes, the opposite result remains entirely possible. </p>
<p>While mere detection of ETI would be beneficial for the insight it offers, these benefits could be limited. That is,
  mere detection would leave much of humanity’s situation intact. Perhaps mere detection would be on par with the
  Copernican revolution in that it would change human thought but not radically alter our geopolitics <span
      class="source">J.F. Galloway: "An international relations perspective on the consequences of SETI", <em>Space Policy</em> 12 (1996) pp. 135-137.</span>.
  So while mere detection may offer net benefits, these benefits are likely not very large, especially relative to the
  benefits and harms found in many other contact scenarios. </p>
<p>Regardless of their magnitude, the impacts of mere detection serve as a baseline set of impacts for almost all other
  contact scenarios. This is because nearly all other contact scenarios involve detection along with other forms of
  contact. The exceptions here are contact scenarios that do not involve detection, which include scenarios in which ETI
  manipulate our world (in good ways or bad) while hiding and scenarios in which ETI destroy us without our having the
  opportunity to notice the ETI. These scenarios are discussed further below. </p>
<p>Even if we receive no more than a simple greeting or passive artifact from a distant ETI civilization, it will at
  least tell us that life has developed more than once in the galaxy and that human-like technology to broadcast across
  space has been invented elsewhere. Advanced ETI may have little to no interest in a society as primitive as Earth, but
  if they do acknowledge our presence and initiate communication, then even this knowledge will benefit humanity.</p>
