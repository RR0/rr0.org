    title="Would Contact with Extraterrestrials Benefit or Harm Humanity? A Scenario Analysis">

<p>If contact with ETI involves more than mere detection, then it is possible for humanity to receive additional
  benefits by cooperating with the ETI. The nature of these benefits depends on the degree of ETI cooperation – that is,
  it is unlikely that uncooperative ETI would benefit humanity. This is because ETI are likely to be much more advanced
  than humanity and would therefore be capable of dictating the terms of contact. Thus cooperative ETI would have the
  ability to bring benefits to humanity, just as uncooperative ETI would likely harm humanity. </p>
<p>An initial scenario of cooperative ETI involves friendly and informative communication between our respective
  civilizations. Assuming ETI are sufficiently interested in humanity (which is not guaranteed, given that they would
  likely be much more advanced), they may choose to maintain communication at length to discuss mathematics, physics,
  and chemistry <span
      class="source">C.L. Devito, R.T. Oehrle: "A language based on the fundamental facts of science", <em>Journal of the British Interplanetary Society</em> 43 (1990) 561-568.</span>
  and to learn more about Earth life. It is reasonable to assume that the general principles of physics and chemistry
  11apply everywhere in the galaxy, even if mathematical descriptions of these physical phenomenon differ among
  intelligent civilizations. This type of dialog with ETI may require that we first develop a common mathematical
  language using physical observables that are known by both civilizations (such as properties of neutral hydrogen). In
  a more remarkable and unlikely case, we may learn that ETI occupy some region of space where different or unknown
  physical principles apply, which would certainly be a unique discovery for humanity. Thus through such a conversation
  we may come to acquire a deeper understanding of mathematics or science, and we may also discover specifics about the
  ETI home world or ETI biology. As with mere detection, such contact would have considerable intellectual benefits,
  though here the benefits would be larger – potentially much larger.</p>
<p> Depending on the nature of information shared through communication with ETI, there could also be more in the way of
  practical, non-intellectual benefits. An advanced ETI may be capable of solving a great many of humanity’s problems,
  such as world hunger, poverty, or disease. Benevolent ETI may even design their first message to contain information
  on how to avoid technological catastrophe in order to help less developed civilizations succeed <span class="source">C. Sagan, <em>Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science</em>, Ballantine Books, New York, 1979.</span>.
  From humanity’s perspective, this is the best-case scenario for ETI contact. However, while we suspect that the basic
  principles of physics and chemistry apply across the universe, it is somewhat less likely that ETI knowledge would be
  useful in addressing social issues on Earth. The usefulness of ETI knowledge, combined with the willingness of ETI to
  employ it on our behalf, plays an important role in the benefits that a cooperative ETI would bring to humanity.</p>
<p> We do not know if ETI would be cooperative, but we have several reasons to suspect that they would be.
  Noncooperation can be a risky and harmful strategy, and noncooperative civilizations may tend to have shorter
  lifetimes as their noncooperation eventually leads to their demise. For this reason, a long-lived civilization that
  explores the galaxy may have transcended any aggressive patterns out of the need to maintain long-term survival <span

  <span class="source">C. Sagan, W.I. Newman, The solipsist approach to extraterrestrial intelligence, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society 24 (1983) 113-121.</span>.
  It is also possible that intelligent civilizations may inevitably develop cooperative tendencies as part of their
  evolutionary process [44,<span class="source">L. Arnhart, The new Darwinian naturalism in political theory, American Political Science Review 89 (1995): 389-400.</span>.
  However, there are also reasons to suspect that evolution would proceed along different, less desirable trajectories
  <span class="source">N. Bostrom, The future of human evolution, in: C. Tandy (Ed.), Death and Anti-Death: Two Hundred Years After Kant, Fifty Years After Turing, Ria University Press, Palo Alto, 2004, pp. 339-371.</span>.
</p>
<p>Another reason to suspect that ETI would be cooperative follows from the Sustainability Solution to the Fermi
  paradox. A corollary of the Sustainability Solution is that extant ETI civilizations in the galaxy may be less prone
  to violence and destruction in the event of contact. This corollary follows from the tendencies of sustainable human
  populations. </p>
<p>On Earth, sustainable human populations tend to be more protective of their ecosystems. This protectiveness can be
  for either of two reasons. First, humans can protect ecosystems for their own benefit. This protection is known as
  conservationism and involves humans placing intrinsic value on themselves. Second, humans can protect ecosystems for
  the ecosystems’ benefit. This 12protection is known as preservationism and involves humans placing intrinsic value on
  the ecosystems. (See <span class="source">R. Randolph, M. S. Race, C. McKay: "Reconsidering the ethical and theological implications of extraterrestrial life", <em>Center for Theology and Natural Sciences Bulletin</em> 17 (1997) 1-8. </span>
  for a similar approach to environmental ethics in the context of terraforming Mars.) In either case, human populations
  that follow a sustainable mode of development are less likely to expand for lack of resources, although they may
  choose to explore out of sheer curiosity. ETI populations may be similar in this regard <span class="source"> B.R. Finney, E.M. Jones, <em>Interstellar Migration and the Human Experience</em>, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1985.</span>.
  Thus, if exponential growth is in fact unsustainable on the galactic scale as Haqq-Misra and Baum <span
      class="source">J.D. Haqq-Misra, S.D. Baum, The sustainability solution to the Fermi paradox, Journal of the British Interplanetary Society 62 (2009) 47-51.</span>
  suggest, then we are much more likely to encounter a long-lived ETI civilization that follows a sustainable
  development pattern. Such a civilization may have no need to consume Earth systems (or humans) because they will have
  already found a way to effectively manage their resources over long timescales. Therefore, the possible
  unsustainability of long-term rapid expansion decreases the probability that ETI will destroy us. However, there is a
  scenario in which sustainable ETI would destroy us – specifically if the ETI is expanding at the maximum rate possible
  given its sustainability constraints. This “maximally expansive” scenario is one of the “harmful to humanity”
  scenarios discussed below.</p>
