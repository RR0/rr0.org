<p>Given that ETI are likely much more advanced than human civilization, contact with uncooperative ETI seems likely be
  harmful to humanity. Harm from uncooperative ETI is discussed in detail in Section 5. However, there are certain
  scenarios in which contact with uncooperative ETI would benefit humanity. These are scenarios in which ETI attempts to
  harm us but fails. Perhaps the ETI, no matter how strong or powerful, just happen to be vulnerable to something
  humanity has. This is illustrated in the conclusion to The War of the Worlds, where the invading Martians are rendered
  helpless by infection by Earth microbes. Or perhaps humanity somehow goes against the odds and defeats the ETI. This
  latter scenario is widespread throughout science fiction, including in major Hollywood films such as Independence Day
  (1996). In these scenarios, humanity benefits not only from the major moral victory of having defeated a daunting
  rival but also from the opportunity to reverse engineer ETI technology. A final scenario involves a second ETI
  learning of our situation and coming to our rescue, again leaving us better off than we were to begin with. Scenarios
  such as these might make for quality entertainment, but they also appear rather unlikely. Still, such contact
  scenarios are possible and thus worth including in this analysis.</p>
