<p>There are several scenarios in which ETI could be invisible to us in the sense that we do not detect the presence of
  any ETI. All of these scenarios assume that ETI do in fact exist, but we do not detect their presence, perhaps because
  we are physically unable to do so. As far as humanity is concerned, invisible extraterrestrials could be no different
  than non-existent extraterrestrials if they both have no impact on us. This scenario would be completely neutral to
  us. However, it is not necessarily the case that an invisible ETI would have no impact on us. </p>
<p>One invisibility scenario involves ETI that intentionally hide from us. This corresponds to the Zoo Hypothesis of the
  Fermi paradox. ETI could have the capability of hiding from us given the likelihood of their superior technology, and
  there are many ways that ETI could remain undetected by us if it chooses to do so. The simplest approach would be to
  hide among the asteroids and observe us at a distance <span class="source">M.D. Papagiannis: "<a

  In this case, such ETI will cease to be invisible to us when we have searched enough of the asteroid belt to detect
  signs of their presence, such as mining on asteroids <span class="source"> B. O’Leary: "Mining the Apollo and Amor asteroids", <em>Science</em> 197 (1977) 363.</span>

  or intelligent conversational space probes <span class="source">A. Tough: "Small smart interstellar probes", <em>Journal of the British Interplanetary Society</em> 51 (1998) 167-174.</span>.
  A more sophisticated approach would eliminate all outgoing electromagnetic signals by to hide any signatures of its
  presence, and ETI with even greater technological prowess could engineer a virtual planetarium surrounding Earth so
  that we are forced to observe an empty universe <span class="source">S. Baxter: "The planetarium hypothesis: A resolution of the Fermi paradox", <em>Journal of the British Interplanetary Society</em> 54 (2001) 210-216.</span>.
</p>
<p>Depending on the form of the intentional hiding, the scenario need not be strictly neutral. Deardorff <span
    class="source">J.W. Deardorff, "Examination of the embargo hypothesis as an explanation for the great silence", <em>Journal of the British Interplanetary Society</em> 40 (1987) 373-379.</span>
  argues that hidden ETI may actually be beneficial because they know we are here and presumably check up on us from
  time to time. Perhaps they do have our best interests in mind and will initiate friendly contact when we begin a
  long-term METI program <span class="source">J.W. Deardorff, "Examination of the embargo hypothesis as an explanation for the great silence", <em>Journal of the British Interplanetary Society</em> 40 (1987) 373-379.</span>
  or when 14we start conversing with an intelligent space probe <span class="source">A. Tough: "Small smart interstellar probes", <em>Journal of the British Interplanetary Society</em> 51 (1998) 167-174.</span>.
  This scenario may even have some implications for human behavior that are somewhat parallel to scenarios in which
  humanity is actually the manifestation of a computer simulation [61]. A sustainable ETI may be hiding from us to see
  if we can turn into a sustainable society on our own before we gain the ability to travel between stars. Such a
  society would be temporarily neutral to us, but potentially harmful or beneficial to us in the long term. </p>
<p>Another possibility is that ETI would unintentionally escape our notice <span class="source">J.R. Rice: "ET: Come and gone unnoticed?", <em>Contact in Context</em> 1 (2002) v1i1/etcomeandgone.pdf.</span>.
  Even if they took no extraordinary measures to remain concealed, ETI that pass by Earth may draw as much attention
  from humans as a passing-by scuba diver would alert a sea anemone by taking a photograph. This could be because ETI
  take a different physical form than Earth life – a form that we are unable to recognize – or because their technology
  is unobtrusive enough that we fail to take notice. Although it is common to assume that extraterrestrial life will
  most likely be carbon-based and require liquid water, there are a number of suggestions for more exotic configurations
  of life. These include alternative biochemistries based on alcohol solvents or silicon <span class="source">S.A. Benner, C.Y. Switzer, Chance and necessity in biomolecular chemistry.

  In the same way, we may fail to notice ETI messages that are transmitted at a different wavelength range than we
  typically listen to. In such a scenario, ETI are actively attempting to communicate with us, but we miss the message
  because our search efforts are less than comprehensive. ETI may be interested in observing the Earth system for
  scientific purposes or may simply be galactic tourists passing through the Solar System. But as long as they refrain
  from significantly interfering with humans or our environment, these ETI provide no threat or benefit to our
  existence. </p>
<p>It is also plausible that nearby ETI simply have no desire to communicate with us. Nonexpansive ETI that pursue a
  sustainable development pattern may also find all the contentment and meaning they need on their own planet so that
  they have no desire for interstellar communication <span class="source">J.D. Haqq-Misra, <em>Planetary Messenger</em>, Createspace, Scotts Valley, CA, 2009.</span>.
  They may have taken up transcendental spiritual practices that focus their efforts inward rather than outward <span
      class="source">D.H. Grinspoon, Lonely Planets: <em>The Natural Philosophy of Alien Life</em>, ECCO, New York, 2003.</span>,
  or they might limit their space exploration to passive interstellar probes <span class="source">R.N. Bracewell: "Communications from superior galactic communities", <em>Nature</em> 186 (1960) 670-671.</span>
  <span class="source">R.A. Freitas, The case for interstellar probes. Journal of the British Interplanetary Society 36 (1983) 490-495. </span>

  <span class="source">C. Cotta, A. Morales: "A computational analysis of galactic exploration with space probes: Implications for the Fermi paradox", <em>Journal of the British Interplanetary Society</em> 62 (2009) 82-88.</span>.
  Perhaps ETI actually do inhabit nearby star systems and detect our radio leakage but have no plans to send a response
  until we send them a more intentional message [23,<span class="source">D.H. Grinspoon, Lonely Planets: <em>The Natural Philosophy of Alien Life</em>, ECCO, New York, 2003.</span>.
  They may be unimpressed with the quality of our broadcasts, or they may choose to conserve their resources and decide
  that interstellar communication is too expensive. For our purposes here, these non-communicative ETI are invisible all
  the same. </p>
<p>Finally, we must acknowledge the possibility of scenarios in which ETI are too far away for communication. It may be
  that ETI have no desire to maintain long-term communication with us, but they also may be too physically distant from
  Earth to consider communication [15-17]. An ETI broadcast from another galaxy, for example, may not have yet reached
  Earth and would 15probably be too faint to detect with modern technology. Likewise, ETI that live beyond 100 light
  years from Earth would not have detected our radio leakage and may not yet know of our presence. Even if intelligent
  life is common in the universe, it may still only arise once or twice within a galaxy <span class="source">P.D. Ward, D. Brownlee, Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe, Springer-Verlag, New York, 2000.</span>
  so that the likelihood of interstellar communication is diminished. Then again, the galaxy may be full of
  non-expansive ETI that may still embark upon interstellar radio communication but are too far away for us to have yet
  received their messages. Human expansion in space may lead to eventual contact with non-expansive ETI, but aside from
  this possibility, non-expansive ETI will remain invisible to us and have little influence on humanity.</p>
