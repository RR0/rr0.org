<p>It is possible that humanity could succeed in identifying ETI in the galaxy, only to find that we are indifferent to
  the cumulative experience. This may seem unlikely, given that the discovery that extraterrestrials exist elsewhere in
  the galaxy would have wide-reaching implications. Nevertheless, there are several scenarios in which our evaluation of
  the encounter could be one of indifference.</p>
<p>As an initial scenario, suppose that planet-finding missions successfully identify an extrasolar terrestrial planet
  orbiting a Sun-like star with an atmospheric composition similar to Earth <span class="source">D.J. Des Marais, M.O. Harwit, K.W. Jucks, J.F. Kasting, D.N.C. Lin, J.I. Lunine, J. Schneider, S. Seager, W.A. Traub, N. J. Woolf, "Remote sensing of planetary properties and biosignatures on extrasolar terrestrial planets", <em>Astrobiology</em> 2 (2002) 153-181.</span>.
  Follow-up observations with radio telescopes reveal unintentional electromagnetic leakage coming from the planet,
  which suggests the presence of intelligent life. However, suppose further that we decode this leakage to find no more
  than the ETI equivalent of old television shows and obscure military transmissions. These broadcasts may contain next
  to nothing in terms of information usable by humans, and the public may quickly lose interest in nonresponsive ETI
  with uninteresting messages <span class="source">J.L. Heilhron, J. Conway, D.K. Cullers, S. Dick, B. Finey, K.S. Guthke, K. Keniston, SETI and history, in: J. Billingham, R. Heyns, D. Milne, S. Doyle, M. Klein, J. Heilbron, M. Ashkenazi, M. Michaud, J. Lutz, S. Shostak (Eds.), <em>Social Implications of the Detection of an Extraterrestrial Civilization: A Report of the Workshops on the Cultural Aspects of SETI</em>.  SETI Press, Mountain View, CA, 1994, pp. 33-60.</span>.
  Even active ETI broadcasts that are targeted toward Earth may contain information that we find useless or esoteric.
  Remote observation of an ETI planet may also reveal strikingly different chemical compositions between their world and
  ours. ETI that originate from a gas giant planet, for example, may have followed a completely different evolutionary
  trajectory that leaves little room for biological similarity between us and them. Communication with such ETI may
  provide little useful information for humans. After all, an ETI society that eats only hydrogen might not have any
  practical information relating to development issues on Earth, and the vast difference in biology might render them
  unable to communicate with us at all. If the search for life finds that the galaxy is in fact teeming with ETI, then
  uninteresting ETI planets such as these will likely fall to low priorities for making contact. </p>
<p>Another scenario involves us finding that contact with ETI creates a mild nuisance or requires more effort than we
  would like to spend. The film District 9 (2009) highlights a contact scenario where we discover a helpless ETI crew
  that requires human assistance in order to survive <span class="source">S.D. Baum, Film review: "District 9", <em>Journal of Evolution and Technology</em> 20 (2009) 86-89.</span>.
  Placed in a temporary refugee camp, the ETI in District 9 display a wide range of temperaments, 16but their overall
  presence annoys the humans because the ETI refugee camp seems to be a permanent fixture. Similarly, we may discover
  through remote messaging that ETI need our help but provide little in return, so that contact with ETI eventually
  begins to drain human resources. Under different circumstances, perhaps ETI make contact with Earth to welcome us into
  the Galactic Club but only after we complete a set of required bureaucratic tasks. ETI that make contact with Earth
  will certainly be more technologically advanced than humans today, so it is entirely plausible that the requirements
  to enter a Galactic Club will be beyond our abilities. In these scenarios, contact with ETI benefits humanity by
  confirming the presence of life elsewhere, but the consequences of contact are sufficiently disruptive, annoying, or
  complicated that human civilization remains indifferent. </p>
<p>A final scenario involves disagreement within human civilization regarding whether or not contact has occurred. The
  simplest conditions for this to occur would be if we received a message from ETI that cannot be unambiguously decoded.
  No SETI signal has yet been identified as extraterrestrial in origin, and if we do ever stumble upon an actual ETI
  broadcast then there could be a long and tedious process to demonstrate its authenticity. Less probable modes for this
  form of contact have been explored in films such as Contact (1997) and K-PAX (2001) in which the nature of the ETI is
  only realized by a handful of humans and dismissed by the rest. If our detection of ETI lacks an obvious and
  unambiguous signal, then different humans – even including different ETI researchers – could reach different
  conclusions on the question of detection. Any benefits of mere detection could be offset by the turmoil of the
  disagreement. A scenario involving more than mere detection could also still create conflict and disorder, but this
  outcome seems less likely.</p>
