<p>Another set of scenarios involves contact with ETI that are neutral toward us (Figure 1, center column). Neutral here
  means that humanity is indifferent to contact with ETI: we are just as well-off with it as we are without it. There
  are two fundamental ways in which ETI could be neutral. The most straightforward way is that ETI have no impact on us
  at all. Here it is important to recognize that ETI would have a profound impact on humanity if we simply become aware
  of its presence â€“ that is, through mere detection, as discussed above. Indeed, the discovery of ETI could well be the
  most profound and important discovery that humanity has ever made. Thus, for ETI to have zero impact on us, they must
  go undetected. In other words, ETI will have no impact on us only if they remain invisible to us. </p>
<p>The other way in which ETI could be neutral is if they have an impact on humanity, but the cumulative effect of that
  impact is neutral. In this case, humanity becomes aware of the presence of ETI. As discussed above, detecting ETI is
  generally considered beneficial for humanity. Therefore, if we detect ETI and are neutral toward them, then there will
  have to be some harm in order to offset the benefit of contact. It is unlikely that this harm would precisely offset
  the benefit of detecting ETI (and any other benefits that might come with contact), so here we consider scenarios in
  which the offset is of approximately the same magnitude, which results in a net impact that is roughly neutral. </p>
