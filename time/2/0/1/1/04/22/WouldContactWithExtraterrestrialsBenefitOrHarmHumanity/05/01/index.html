<p>A selfish ETI is one that places intrinsic value only on properties of itself: its lives, its welfare, etc. The idea
  of a selfish ETI is quite prominent in discussions of ETI. For example, geographer Jared Diamond <span class="source">J. Diamond: "To whom it may concern", <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, 5 December 1999, pp. 68-71.</span>,
  drawing from his expertise in encounters between different intelligent populations on Earth, argues that astronomers
  are often overly optimistic about ETI encounters:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><q> The astronomers and others hope that the extraterrestrials, delighted to discover fellow intelligent beings,
    will sit down for a friendly chat. Perhaps the astronomers are right; that's the best-case scenario. A less pleasant
    prospect is that the extraterrestrials might behave the way we intelligent beings have behaved whenever we have
    discovered other previously unknown intelligent beings on earth, like unfamiliar humans or chimpanzees and gorillas.
    Just as we did to those beings, the extraterrestrials might proceed to kill, infect, dissect, conquer, displace or
    enslave us, stuff us as specimens for their museums or pickle our skulls and use us for medical research. My own
    view is that those astronomers now preparing again to beam radio signals out to hoped-for extraterrestrials are
    naïve, even dangerous. </q></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Diamond is correct in noting that many astronomers neglect the potential perils of an ETI encounter, it would
  be a mistake to assume that astronomers are uniformly naïve in this regard. For example, Nobel Laureate astronomer Sir
  Martin Ryle opposes active efforts to communicate with ETI due to concern that humans would be attacked <span

  Similar concerns have been raised by several others [26,43,<span class="source">[76] R. A. Carrigan Jr, "Do potential SETI signals need to be decontaminated?" <em>Acta Astronautica</em> 58 (2006) 112-117. </span>-<span
      class="source">[77] T. Ferris, The Mind's Sky: <em>Human Intelligence in a Cosmic Context</em>, Bantam Books, New York, 1993. </span>.
  Even Carl Sagan, who is usually quite optimistic about ETI encounters, has expressed concern regarding ETI risks <span
      class="source">I.S. Shklovskii, C. Sagan, <em>Intelligent Life in the Universe</em>, Holden-Day, San Francisco, 1966.</span>.
  A common theme underlying the pessimism of these various commentators is the likelihood that ETI would be more
  advanced than humanity. </p>
<p>A core concern is that ETI will learn of our presence and quickly travel to Earth to eat or enslave us. Predation is
  common among life forms on Earth because it can be more efficient to prey upon other biota than it is to independently
  utilize autotrophy for energy, carbon fixation, and other nutrients for cellular material <span class="source">C.S. Cockell, M. Lee: "Interstellar predation", <em>Journal of the British Interplanetary Society</em> 55 (2002) 8-20.</span>.
  This may be less of a concern if the chirality of organics on Earth is poorly suited as a universal food source <span
      class="source">C.S. Cockell, M. Lee: "Interstellar predation", <em>Journal of the British Interplanetary Society</em> 55 (2002) 8-20.</span>.
  Additionally, an advanced society capable of interstellar travel may be less likely to turn to humans as a source of
  food or labor because they should have already solved these problems through some combination of machine labor,
  artificial synthesis, and conservation <span class="source">I.S. Shklovskii, C. Sagan, <em>Intelligent Life in the Universe</em>, Holden-Day, San Francisco, 1966.</span>.
  Nevertheless, other selfish motives may cause ETI to harm us, such as their drive to spread their beliefs through
  evangelism (akin to the spread of Christianity or Islam) or their desire to use humans for entertainment purposes. As
  Shklovskii and Sagan <span class="source">I.S. Shklovskii, C. Sagan, <em>Intelligent Life in the Universe</em>, Holden-Day, San Francisco, 1966.</span>
  discuss: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Or perhaps human beings have some relatively uncommon talent, of which they are themselves entirely unaware. J. B.
    S. Haldane once pointed out to me that sea lions and seals have a remarkable ability to balance a rubber ball on
    their noses, which is part of the reason we maintain them in captivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus in one ETI contact scenario, the ETI use humanity for entertainment purposes just as we use sea lions and seals
  for this. Shklovskii and Sagan <span
      class="source">I.S. Shklovskii, C. Sagan, <em>Intelligent Life in the Universe</em>, Holden-Day, San Francisco, 1966.</span>
  continue to point out that ETI may desire to be the sole galactic power and will eliminate other life forms when they
  start to get in the way. Similarly, an ETI may simply be interested in using us as a means for growth of their
  economy. On an individual level they may not be interested in killing us, but may be interested in incorporating us
  into their civilization so they can sell us their products, keep us as pets, or have us mine raw materials for them.
  Such a scenario could be harmful or beneficial to us, depending on the methods they use to bring us into their
  society.</p>
<p>Under what conditions might ETI be self-interested? Here it is again useful to consider possible resolutions to the
  Fermi paradox, in particular the Sustainability Solution. It is unlikely that humanity will encounter an exponentially
  expansive civilization [18-<span class="source">J.D. Haqq-Misra, S.D. Baum, The sustainability solution to the Fermi paradox, Journal of the British Interplanetary Society 62 (2009) 47-51.</span>
  because we likely would have already detected ETI if exponential expansion could be maintained on galactic scales.
  Thus exponentially expanding ETI probably do not exist or otherwise do not have the capacity to expand throughout the
  galaxy. This is fortunate for humanity, since exponentially expansive ETI would likely be quite harmful, just as
  exponentially expansive populations on Earth (including at least some portions of humanity) can be harmful for other
  members of their ecosystems. An exception to this is a civilization that has exponentially grown and collapsed in the
  past but did not succumb to complete ecological collapse. Such a society may recover and choose once again to embark
  upon a development pattern of exponential expansion. If such an ETI civilization exists today, then they could be
  extremely harmful, even if they are only moderately more advanced than we are, because if they continue upon their
  developmental trajectory to rapidly colonize the galaxy, then they will likely consume our resources before their
  collapse occurs.</p>
<p>As discussed above, we have reason to believe that a sustainable ETI is less likely to be harmful than an
  unsustainable, exponentially expansive ETI. However, it remains entirely possible for an ETI to be both sustainable
  and harmful. Such an ETI could be expanding as fast as happens to be sustainably possible, along a colonization
  wavefront as in the simulations by Newman and Sagan <span class="source">W.I. Newman, C. Sagan, Galactic civilizations: Population dynamics and interstellar diffusion, Icarus 46 (1981) 293-327.</span>.
  Unlike the sustainable civilization described above, this maximally expansive civilization would be sustainable but
  still eager to consume whatever resources it could. This type of ETI civilization would likely consume all the
  resources of Earth and destroy humanity if we got in its way. In the analysis of ETI expansion, a key question is thus
  whether or not the expansion is occurring at or near the maximal possible rate.</p>
