<p> It might seem unlikely that a universalist ETI would intentionally harm us. This is because universalist ETI place
  inherent value on whatever traits that it values (lives, ecosystems, etc.) regardless of whether it relates to our
  civilization or theirs. In other words, a universalist ETI civilization would be in no way biased against us. Within
  humanity, universalism is commonly associated with peace and cooperation, not with harm and destruction. But this is
  because human populations are all generally similar. If, for example, we seek to maximize total happiness, then we
  will succeed by avoiding conflict within humanity, because conflict generally reduces happiness for nearly all
  humans. </p>
<p>Such may not be the case for ETI. Just because an ETI civilization holds universalist ethics does not mean that it
  would never seek our harm. This is because ETI may be quite different from us and could conclude that harming us would
  help maximize whatever they value intrinsically <span class="source">S.D. Baum: "Universalist ethics in extraterrestrial encounter", <em> Acta Astronautica</em> 66 (2010) 617-623.</span>.
  For example, if ETI place intrinsic value on lives, then perhaps they could bring about more lives by destroying us
  and using our resources more efficiently for other lives. Other forms of intrinsic value may cause universalist ETI to
  seek our harm or destruction as long as more value is produced without us than with us. Novelist Douglas Adams
  captures this scenario vividly in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, where ETI place intrinsic value on civic
  infrastructure (or, more likely, on some consequence of its use) and destroy Earth to make way for a hyperspace
  bypass. At the heart of these scenarios is the possibility that intrinsic value may be more efficiently produced in
  our absence.</p>
<p> An interesting and important case of universalist ethics in this context is when civilization itself holds intrinsic
  value. ETI that support this ethical framework would seek to maximize the total number of civilizations, the diversity
  of civilizations, or some other property of civilizations. All else equal, such ETI would specifically wish for our
  civilization to remain intact. But all else may not be equal. It is plausible that such ETI might try to harm or even
  destroy us in order to maximize the number/diversity/etc. of civilizations. This could occur if our resources could be
  used to more efficiently to generate or retain other civilizations, though this possibility seems highly remote given
  how efficiently tuned humanity is to its environment. Alternatively, such ETI could seek our harm if they believe that
  we are a threat to other civilizations.</p>
<p> The thought of humanity being a threat to other civilizations may seem implausible given the likelihood of our
  technological inferiority relative to other civilizations. However, this inferiority may be a temporary phenomenon.
  Perhaps ETI observe our rapid and destructive expansion on Earth and become concerned of our civilizational
  trajectory. In light of the Sustainability Solution to the Fermi paradox, perhaps ETI believe that rapid expansion is
  20threatening on a galactic scale. Rapidly (maximally) expansive civilizations may have a tendency to destroy other
  civilizations in the process, just as humanity has already destroyed many species on Earth. ETI that place intrinsic
  value on civilizations may ideally wish that our civilization changes its ways, so we can survive along with all the
  other civilizations. But if ETI doubt that our course can be changed, then they may seek to preemptively destroy our
  civilization in order to protect other civilizations from us. A preemptive strike would be particularly likely in the
  early phases of our expansion because a civilization may become increasingly difficult to destroy as it continues to
  expand. Humanity may just now be entering the period in which its rapid civilizational expansion could be detected by
  an ETI because our expansion is changing the composition of Earth’s atmosphere (e.g. via greenhouse gas emissions),
  which therefore changes the spectral signature of Earth. While it is difficult to estimate the likelihood of this
  scenario, it should at a minimum give us pause as we evaluate our expansive tendencies.</p>
<p> It is worth noting that there is some precedent for harmful universalism within humanity. This precedent is most
  apparent within universalist ethics that place intrinsic value on ecosystems. Human civilization affects ecosystems so
  strongly that some ecologists now often refer to this epoch of Earth’s history as the anthropocene <span
      class="source">P.J. Crutzen, E.F. Stoermer, The "Anthropocene", IGBP Newsletter 41 (2000) 17-18.</span>. If one’s
  goal is to maximize ecosystem flourishing, then perhaps it would be better if humanity did not exist, or at least if
  it existed in significantly reduced form. Indeed, there are some humans who have advanced precisely this argument

  <span class="source"><em>Voluntary <a href="https://www.vhemt.org">Human Extinction Movement</a></em>, 2010</span>. If
  it is possible for at least some humans to advocate harm to their own civilization by drawing upon universalist
  ethical principles, then it is at a minimum plausible that ETI could advocate harm to humanity following similar
  principles. </p>
<p>The possibility of harmful contact with ETI suggests that we may use some caution for METI. Given that we have
  already altered our environment in ways that may viewed as unethical by universalist ETI, it may be prudent to avoid
  sending any message that shows evidence of our negative environmental impact. The chemical composition of Earth’s
  atmosphere over recent time may be a poor choice for a message because it would show a rapid accumulation of carbon
  dioxide from human activity. Likewise, any message that indicates of widespread loss of biodiversity or rapid rates of
  expansion may be dangerous if received by such universalist ETI. On the other hand, advanced ETI may already know
  about our rapid environmental impact by listening to leaked electromagnetic signals or observing changes in Earth’s
  spectral signature. In this case, it might be prudent for any message we send to avoid denying our environmental
  impact so as to avoid the ETI catching us in a lie.</p>
