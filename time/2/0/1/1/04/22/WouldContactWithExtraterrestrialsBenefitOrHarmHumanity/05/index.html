<p>The last scenarios we consider are those in which contact with ETI is harmful to humanity (Figure 1, right column).
  This is a particularly important set of scenarios because of the strong caution they impose on our SETI and METI
  endeavors. These scenarios have also received extensive consideration in both fictional and non-fictional realms. Here
  we explore one main type of scenario in which an ETI could be harmful: intentional harm. The possibility of ETI
  causing unintentional harm is discussed in the following section. In the intentional harm scenarios, ETI decide that
  they wish to cause us harm and then follow through on this wish. In the unintentional harm scenarios, ETI do not wish
  us any harm but inadvertently harm us anyways.</p>
<p> We see two types of scenarios in which ETI might intentionally harm us. The first scenario involves hostile, selfish
  ETI that attack us so as to maximize their own success. This scenario suggests a standard fight-to-win conflict: a war
  of the worlds. The second scenario involves ETI that are in no way selfish but instead follow some sort of
  universalist ethical framework. ETI might attack us not out of selfishness but instead out of a universalist desire to
  make the galaxy a better place.</p>
