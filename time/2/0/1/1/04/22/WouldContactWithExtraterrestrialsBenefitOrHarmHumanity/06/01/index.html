<p>If humanity comes into direct physical contact with either ETI themselves or some ETI artifact, then it may be
  possible for humanity to be unintentionally harmed. One of the most prominent scenarios of this kind is the
  transmission of disease to humanity. This scenario is inspired by the many instances in which humans and other species
  on Earth have suffered severely from diseases introduced from other regions of the planet. Such diseases are spread
  via the global travels of humans and our cargo and also through certain other disease vectors. Introduced diseases
  have been extremely potent because the population receiving the disease has no prior exposure to it and thus no
  build-up of immunity. Indeed, disease introductions are blamed for loss of human life so widespread as to have altered
  the broadest contours of human history <span class="source">J. Diamond: <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies</em>, Norton, New York, 1997.</span>.
</p>
<p>If ETI could introduce disease to humanity, then the impacts could be – but wouldn’t necessarily be – devastating.
  The disease could quite easily be significantly different from anything our immune systems have ever encountered
  before. The disease could also be entirely unfamiliar to our medical knowledge, and it could potentially be highly
  contagious and highly lethal. This combination of contagiousness (i.e. high R0 <span class="source">J. M. Heffernan, R. J. Smith, L. M. Wahl: "Perspectives on the basic reproductive ratio", <em>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</em> 2 (2005) 281-293.</span>)
  and lethality (i.e. high mortality rate) is unlikely in existing pathogens because such pathogens would quickly kill
  their host population and then die out themselves. Furthermore, if we had already encountered such a disease on Earth,
  then we likely wouldn’t be here anymore. However, a disease from ETI would be new to us. It presumably would not be
  highly contagious and lethal to the ETI themselves or to the other organisms in their biosphere, but it could be
  devastating to humans and the Earth system. Then again, ETI biology may be so vastly different from Earth biology that
  no significant interactions between organisms occur. ETI may have their own contagious diseases that are unable to
  infect humans or Earth-life because we are not useful hosts for ETI pathogens. After all, the ETI diseases would have
  evolved separately from Earth biota and thus be incompatible. So while there are reasons to believe that an ETI
  disease which affected humanity would be devastating, there are also reasons to believe that an ETI disease would not
  affect humanity.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that a disease brought by an ETI could harm us without infecting us. This would occur if the
  disease infects other organisms of interest to us. For example, ETI could infect organisms important to our food
  supply, such as crop plants or livestock animals. A non- 22human infection would be less likely to destroy humanity
  and more likely to only harm us by wiping out some potentially significant portion of our food supply. In a more
  extreme case, ETI disease could cause widespread extinction of multiple species on Earth, even if humans remain
  uninfected. </p>
<p>It may be possible to protect humanity from diseases brought by ETI. The most straightforward option is simply to
  prevent contact between the ETI biosphere and Earth’s biosphere. Several calls for such prevention have already been
  advanced, often under the rubric of planetary protection <span class="source">J.D. Rummel, L. Billings "Issues in planetary protection: policy, protocol and implementation", <em>Space Policy</em> 20 (2004) 49–54. </span>.
  If we never come into contact with an ETI biosphere, then we probably cannot become infected by its diseases. This
  fact has implications both for how humanity handles communications with ETI – for example, whether our communications
  encourage contact–and for human space exploration policy – for example, whether we send probes in search of ETI life,
  and whether we send these probes back to Earth if life is found. </p>
<p>If prevention fails and ETI disease is contacted, then treatment may be aided by information about the biology of ETI
  and other organisms in their biosphere. Perhaps such information could be used to develop vaccines or other
  countermeasures. However, our experience with novel diseases on Earth, such as novel influenza strains, suggests that
  it takes much less time for a disease to spread than for us to find a cure. The spread of ETI diseases may be even
  more rapid and the cure even more difficult to develop. Therefore, any head start we can get for our cure development
  could be highly valuable. This in turn makes remotely received information about ET biology (i.e. biology of the ETI
  and others in their biosphere) valuable. If we can receive information about ET biology before we make physical
  contact–for example, if we can receive it via electromagnetic transmission–then perhaps we can develop adequate
  countermeasures to ET diseases before we encounter them. The possibility that physical contact with ETI may infect
  humanity with a deadly disease also suggests that we may want to refrain from broadcasting any specifics of our
  biology. Malicious ETI that learn about our biology will know how to best exploit our immune systems and may even
  design a human-tailored biological weapon before coming to destroy us. Thus, one possible METI strategy may be to
  actively seek information about ET biology while carefully guarding the details of human and Earth biology. </p>
<p>Diseases are not the only physical hazard we may unintentionally face from ETI. A similar biological hazard is the
  invasive species. Whereas a disease infects and harms an organism by overwhelming its immune system, an invasive
  species affects and harms an ecosystem by overwhelming its ecological functions. The distinction between diseases and
  invasive species is at most a blurry one. A disease can at least sometimes be classified as an invasive species. Some
  diseases, such as viral diseases, are not well-classified as species, while some diseases are not invasive because
  they have a permanent and entrenched status within their host population. Likewise, some invasive species are not
  diseases per se but instead are harmful in other ways. For example, an introduced predator is a disease only in a
  metaphorical sense. </p>
<p>In the context of an encounter with ETI, the dynamics of invasive species are similar to the dynamics of introduced
  diseases. In both cases, humanity is particularly vulnerable due to the extreme novelty of the introduced agent,
  because our natural defenses and our skilled response efforts are unaccustomed to the agent. Also, in both cases,
  humanity could benefit from preventing contact with the ET biosphere and from remotely received information about the
  ET biology. Although an invasive extraterrestrial species seems like it should displace at least some portion of
  Earth’s ecosystem, it is also possible that such invasive species occupy a completely different ecological niche than
  any extant life on Earth. Thus, we may find that an extraterrestrial invasive species takes up residence on our planet
  without causing any destruction at all (analogous to a shadow biosphere <span class="source">P. Davies: <em>The Eerie Silence</em>, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, New York, 2010.</span>
  <span class="source">P.C.W. Davies, S.A. Benner, C.E. Cleland, C.H. Lineweaver, C.P. McKay, F. WolfeSimon, Signatures of a shadow biosphere, Astrobiology 9 (2009) 241-249.</span>).
</p>
<p>One non-biological physical hazard that we could face from direct contact with ETI is unintentional mechanical harm.
  For example, ETI might accidentally crush us while attempting an unrelated maneuver. This scenario parallels instances
  on Earth in which humans inadvertently destroy the ecosystems of species that then go extinct. All else equal,
  humanity would generally prefer not causing the extinction of species, but we often prioritize other matters. Indeed,
  in many cases we may not have even realized that an endangered species was present until after extinction has
  occurred. Perhaps ETI could inadvertently destroy humanity under analogous circumstances. In a similar class of
  scenarios, ETI could inadvertently unleash some harmful force into the galaxy through some act of incompetence, quite
  possibly harming itself in the process. For example, an otherwise benevolent extraterrestrial civilization could
  accidentally unleash the extraterrestrial equivalent of an "unFriendly Artificial Intelligence" (uFAI <span
      class="source">E. Yudkowsky: "Cognitive biases potentially affecting judgment of global risks", in: N. Bostrom, M. Ćirković (Eds.) <em>Global catastrophic risks</em>, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2008, pp. 91-119.</span>).
  This ET uFAI would be out of the control of its (benevolent) makers and would likely destroy humanity as it attempted
  to fulfill whatever objective function it happened to have. The odds that this objective function will happen to
  benefit humans seems extremely small. Indeed, it may be difficult for humans to create such an objective function even
  with considerable dedicated effort <span class="source">E. Yudkowsky: "Cognitive biases potentially affecting judgment of global risks", in: N. Bostrom, M. Ćirković (Eds.) <em>Global catastrophic risks</em>, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2008, pp. 91-119.</span>.
  In another example, ETI that explore the galaxy using automated self-replicating probes (also known as von Neumann
  probes) may inadvertently unleash a catastrophic colonization wave that rapidly spreads throughout the galaxy and
  destroys other civilizations [10,<span class="source">M. M. Ćirković: "Observation selection effects and global catastrophic risks", in: N. Bostrom, M.M. Ćirković (Eds.), <em>Global Catastrophic Risks</em>, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2008, pp. 120-145.</span>.
  Such a scenario may arise either from faulty design of automated probes or from the malicious intent of artificially
  intelligent probes. Bostrom <span class="source">N. Bostrom, The future of human evolution, in: C. Tandy (Ed.), Death and Anti-Death: Two Hundred Years After Kant, Fifty Years After Turing, Ria University Press, Palo Alto, 2004, pp. 339-371.</span>
  suggests that such undesirable outcomes could be the result of evolutionary dynamics in which the undesirables are the
  strong which survive evolutionary pressures. Finally, it is possible that ETI could render some portion of the galaxy
  uninhabitable via an accident in a physics experiment, just as there are concerns that certain human physics
  experiments with particle accelerators could be accidentally destructive <span class="source">A. Kent: "A critical look at risk assessments for global catastrophes", <em>Risk Analysis</em> 24 (2004) 157-168.</span>.
  Any of these scenarios would involve the ETI accidentally harming humanity and probably also itself.</p>
