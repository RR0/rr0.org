<p>If humanity did not come into direct physical contact with ETI, it could still be possible for ETI to unintentionally
  harm humanity. This could occur if ETI send harmful information to humanity via electromagnetic transmission. A
  malicious ETI broadcaster could, for example, send a message containing harmful information that either damages human
  technology, analogous to a computer virus, or coerces humans into a seemingly benign but ultimately destructive course
  of action, such as the construction of a dangerous device <span class="source">R. A. Carrigan Jr, "Do potential SETI signals need to be decontaminated?", <em>Acta Astronautica</em> 58 (2006) 112-117. </span>.

<p>As another example, ETI might send information about its biology, perhaps hoping that humanity could use this
  information to protect itself against ET diseases or invasive species. However, perhaps such an effort would backfire
  on humanity if we use the information to create a disease, invasive species, or other hazard. The hazard would be
  created by humans from the information received, and the creation could be intentional or unintentional. But if the
  creation was intentional, then it would be human intent, not ETI intent. The possibility of an intentional or
  unintentional informational hazard suggests that at least some care should be taken in efforts to detect and analyze
  electromagnetic signals sent from ETI.</p>
<p>There is one final information hazard scenario to consider. In this scenario, contact with ETI serves as a
  demoralizing force to humanity, with strong negative consequences. In human history, contact between modern society
  and stone age culture usually leads to the demise of the more primitive society. Likewise, in the event of contact
  with ETI, humanity may be driven toward global cultural collapse when confronted with ETI technology, beliefs, and
  lifestyle <span class="source"> D. Morrison, McNeill: "Consequences of contact", in: C. Sagan (Ed.), <em>Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence</em>, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1973, pp. 333-349.</span>.
  Even if the ETI are friendly toward us and give us the choice to accept or reject their knowledge, the vast
  differences between our respective societies may force the more primitive one (ours) into a demoralizing state of
  societal collapse. For this reason, if ETI do already know of our presence and if they wish to preserve the integrity
  of our civilization, then they may choose to reveal themselves to us slowly and gradually in order to avoid a
  calamitous response <span class="source">J.W. Deardorff, "Examination of the embargo hypothesis as an explanation for the great silence", <em>Journal of the British Interplanetary Society</em> 40 (1987) 373-379.</span>.
