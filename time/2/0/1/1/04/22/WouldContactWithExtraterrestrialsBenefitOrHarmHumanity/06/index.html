<p>The harm scenarios considered thus far have all involved ETI that intend to cause us harm, but it 21is not the only
  type of scenario in which ETI actually do cause us harm. Specifically, it is possible for ETI to cause us harm despite
  them not wishing to do so. Here the desires of ETI may even be irrelevant: such ETI could hold any value system from
  selfish to universalist while still causing unintentional harm in several ways. In one set of scenarios, ETI could
  inadvertently bring us some sort of physical hazard, such as a disease or an invasive species. In another set of
  considerations, ETI could inadvertently bring an information hazard, such as technological damage or a presence that
  demoralizes or destabilizes human society. </p>
