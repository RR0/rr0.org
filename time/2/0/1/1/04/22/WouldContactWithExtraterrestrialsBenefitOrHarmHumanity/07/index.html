<p>The outcome of contact between humanity and ETI depends on many factors that cannot be fully known at this time. The
  scenario analysis presented in this paper therefore serves as a means of training our minds to recognize patterns and
  analyze outcomes before contact with ETI ever occurs. Actual contact may not precisely follow the scenarios considered
  here, but any amount of analysis to prepare ourselves for contact will increase the likelihood of a positive outcome.
  Therefore, the analysis presented here serves as a step toward developing a comprehensive strategy for responding to
  contact with ETI. </p>
<p>Based on the infeasibility of sustained exponential expansion through space, it seems less likely that ETI will
  destroy us because of their lack of resources. Nevertheless, ETI could still decide to harm us intentionally because
  of their own ethical considerations, or they may cause us unintentional harm through invasive species or cultural
  collapse. It is also entirely possible that contact with ETI will have little impact on Earth or humanity, especially
  if the form of ETI life is vastly different from life on Earth. SETI often assumes that any two intelligent
  civilizations in the universe could communicate, but we cannot neglect the possibility that the human species will be
  completely unable to comprehend the language or communication efforts of ETI. The possibility of a neutral ETI
  encounter, then, is just as worthy of consideration as a scenario with friendly or hostile ETI. </p>
<p>Our analysis suggests some immediate practical recommendations for humanity. One recommendation is that messages to
  extraterrestrials should be written cautiously. For example, prior messages have included details of human biology,
  such as the numbers one through ten (our base ten system is likely derived from the number of fingers on our hands)
  and the form and structure of the DNA molecule. However, details about our biology, though seemingly harmless, may
  actually help certain ETI to cause us harm. A malicious ETI listener may use a message about human biology to design a
  potent biological weapon for use against Earth. Since these messages will ultimately be sent toward unknown ETI, we
  cannot know whether or not they might be received by such a malicious ETI. Therefore, caution is warranted. For
  example, initial communication with ETI may be best limited to simple mathematical discourse for security purposes
  until we have a better idea of the type of ETI we are dealing with. In our view, decision making regarding messaging
  should factor in the probabilities and magnitudes of possible message scenarios through a formal risk analysis that
  could draw on the scenario analysis presented here.</p>
<p> Another recommendation is that humanity should avoid giving off the appearance of being a rapidly expansive
  civilization. If an ETI perceives humanity as such, then it may be inclined to attempt a preemptive strike against us
  so as to prevent us from growing into a threat to the ETI or others in the galaxy. Similarly, ecosystem-valuing
  universalist ETI may observe humanityâ€™s ecological destructive tendencies and wipe humanity out in order to preserve
  the Earth system as a whole. These scenarios give us reason to limit our growth and reduce our impact on global
  ecosystems. It would be particularly important for us to limit our emissions of greenhouse gases, since atmospheric
  composition can be observed from other planets. We acknowledge that the pursuit of emissions reductions and other
  ecological projects may have much stronger justifications than those that derive from ETI encounter, but that does not
  render ETI encounter scenarios insignificant or irrelevant.</p>
<p> A final recommendation is that preparations for ETI encounter, whether through METI, SETI, human explorations of
  space, or any other form, should consider the full breadth of possible 26encounter scenarios. Indeed, perhaps the
  central conclusion of the analysis presented here is that ETI contact could proceed in a wide range of ways. It is
  inappropriate and inadequate to blindly assume that any one specific scenario would result from contact. Until such
  contact occurs, we simply do not know what would happen. Given the uncertainty, the broad scenario analysis presented
  here is an important step towards helping us think through and prepare for possible contact.</p>
<p> Despite its merits, our scenario analysis remains fundamentally limited in several important ways. As is common with
  scenario analysis in general, we offer no quantification scheme for the probabilities of specific scenarios. We also
  do not quantify the magnitude of the impacts (benefit or harm) of specific scenarios. The result of this is that we
  are unable to produce a cumulative analysis of the risks and rewards of contact with ETI or attempting to do so with
  METI. Such a quantitative risk analysis would be of tremendous value for decision making purposes. Indeed, the need
  has been acknowledged for such analysis in order to inform decisions about METI and other SETI activities <span
      class="source">A. Tough: "Positive consequences of SETI before detection", <em>Acta Astronautica</em> 42 (1998) 745-748. 33</span>.
  However, the effort required for such an analysis is far beyond the scope of what we can accomplish in a single paper
  and thus must be left for future work. The scenario analysis presented here is an important step towards a
  quantitative risk analysis, but it is not a complete risk analysis on its own. </p>
<p>An additional caveat to our scenario analysis derives from the limits of our knowledge about contact with ETI.
  Because we have no empirical data about ETI, we must extrapolate from the information that we do have available,
  including knowledge about the observable universe and knowledge about ourselves. We must bear in mind that our
  observations are inevitably confined to human experience, and so our extrapolations, no matter how generalized, may
  still contain implicit anthropocentric biases. It is entirely possible that ETI will resemble nothing we have
  previously experienced or imagined, in which case the contact may not resemble any scenario we could develop. This
  possibility does not mean that we should completely dismiss any analysis of extraterrestrials, since there is also a
  strong possibility that the contact would have some resemblance to our scenarios. Nevertheless, the possibility that
  our experience and imagination could come up severely short reminds us to use caution in interpreting our analysis.
  Until we actually detect ETI, we will remain highly uncertain as to their nature and to the outcomes that would follow
  from our contact with them.</p>
<p> One area for future work concerns impacts (benefits and harms) to nonhumans. This paper has focused on the impacts
  of contact to humanity. We have thus neglected impacts to the ETI, to the rest of Earth, to the rest of the galaxy,
  and possibly even to other entities as well. We focused on humanity to maintain a reasonably narrow scope for the
  paper, not because we believe that impacts to nonhumans are unimportant. Indeed, we feel strongly that consideration
  of impacts to nonhumans represents an important area for future work. </p>
<p>An additional area for future work concerns quantitative risk assessment. A quantitative assessment of the scenarios
  presented in this paper would be of tremendous use in developing strategies for responding to contact with ETI.
  However, because we have no observations of ETI, any attempt at quantitative analysis will struggle to assign
  numerical probabilities to the qualities of an unknown ETI civilization. Certain aspects of this problem, such as
  rates of expansion and exploration, can be constrained with known physical models, though, so at least some degree of
  quantification is possible. Additionally, continued exploration of our galaxy and universe will reveal information
  that will further constrains some of these scenarios such as the distribution of terrestrial planets, the prevalence
  of Earth-like atmospheric biosignatures, or the existence of artificial radio signals. A complete quantitative
  assessment of risk from an encounter with extraterrestrials may be difficult to complete in the near future, but even
  incremental progress will help us choose an optimal strategy if and when we make actual contact with ETI.</p>
<p> Even if contact with extraterrestrials never occurs, our scenario analysis still acts as a set of future
  trajectories for human civilization. Our thinking about the nature of extraterrestrials and intelligent life in
  general is really an exercise in imagining the ways that future humans could exist under different circumstances or in
  different environments. This scenario analysis therefore helps to illuminate the consequences of particular decisions,
  such as the mode of expansion or the ethical framework of an intelligent civilization, and may help us distinguish
  between desirable and undesirable trajectories for humanity. As we continue the search for extraterrestrials into the
  future, perhaps our thinking about the different modes of contact will help human civilization to avoid collapse and
  achieve long-term survival.</p>
