<title>The Continued Conflicting Accounts from the Complainant Regarding the Charged Incident</title>
<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<p><strong>Version One</strong>. From the date of the incident until June 28, 2011, the complainant repeatedly stated to
  prosecutors that after the sexual encounter with the defendant, she immediately fled the defendant's suite and went to
  the far end of the 28th floor hallway. The complainant further stated that after spitting on the carpet in the 28th
  floor hallway, she remained there, fearful, until she unexpectedly encountered her supervisor. At that point, the two
  of them entered Suite 2806. There, she began to tell her supervisor what had happened between her and the defendant,
  and repeated her account after a second supervisor joined them. When asked by prosecutors why she had remained in the
  28th floor hallway rather than fleeing to the protection of an empty room on that floor and telephoning her
  supervisors or security, she stated that all of the other rooms on the floor had "do not disturb" signs on them and
  were thus unavailable to her. </p>
<p><strong>Version Two</strong>. In an interview conducted on June 28, 2011, in the presence of her lawyer, the
  complainant provided a materially different account of her actions immediately following the incident in the
  defendant's suite. At the outset of this interview, she admitted for the first time that she had been untruthful about
  this key point with prosecutors and had lied about it in her testimony before the grand jury. The complainant gave a
  new version of these events, stating that after leaving the defendant's room, she had gone directly into another room
  (2820) to finish cleaning it She gave specific details, saying that she had vacuumed the floor and cleaned the mirrors
  and other furniture in that room. She further stated that after completing her tasks in Room 2820, she had returned to
  the defendant's suite and began to clean it as well. She reported that when she subsequently went to a linen closet in
  the 28th floor hallway to retrieve supplies, she encountered her supervisor, and the two of them went back into Suite
  2806 together. Rather than immediately telling her supervisor about the encounter with the defendant, the complainant
  asked the supervisor a hypothetical question about whether guests were allowed to force themselves on staff members,
  and reported the incident with the defendant only when her supervisor pressed her. Given the significance of this new
  account - which was at odds with her sworn testimony in the grand jury - prosecutors questioned her about it
  extensively during the course of the June 28 interview.</p>
<p>Because the complainant now reported that she had entered Room 2820, the Office obtained the electronic swipe
  records for that room. Those records, which were also provided to complainant's counsel by someone outside of this
  Office, established that the complainant entered Room 2820 at 12:26 p.m., and also entered defendant's suite during
  the same minute (also 12:26 p.m.). The exceedingly short window of time that the complainant spent in Room 2820 belied
  her statement that she had completed several cleaning tasks in that room before returning to the defendant's
  suite. </p>
<p><strong>Version Three</strong>. In a subsequent interview conducted on July 27, 2011, the complainant again changed
  her account of her actions immediately after the encounter with the defendant. On that date, she said that she had
  cleaned Room 2820 earlier in the morning of May 14. Immediately after the incident, she stated, she left Suite 2806
  and ran around the comer, as she had originally reported, not right into Room 2820. After seeing the defendant leave
  in the elevator, she entered Room 2820 only momentarily to retrieve cleaning supplies. As to the statements that the
  complainant had made on June 28, she denied making them, and asserted that they must have been mistranslated by the
  interpreter or misunderstood by prosecutors <span class="note">The complainant demonstrated her ability to speak and understand English over the course of numerous interviews with investigators and prosecutors. Indeed, at times, she corrected the interpreter's translation of her remarks. Notably, she did not do so during the extended questioning on this topic in the June 28 interview. </span>.
  But that claim is not believable in light of the extensive follow-up questioning about these events, as well as the
  complainant's insistence on June 28 that the account she gave on that day was truthful. Critically, her willingness to
  deny having made those statements to the very same prosecutors who had heard her make them on June 28 calls her
  credibility into question at the most fundamental level <span class="note">There is at least a question whether the complainant ran out of the suite immediately, if at all, after the defendant ejaculated. The report completed by the certified Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner ("SAFEU) who examined the complainant at the hospital on the date of the injury describes the complainant's account of the defendant's ejaculation, and then states, "Pt. reports he got dressed + left the room, and that he said nothing to her during the incident. u This report certainly suggests that the defendant left first, although the SAFE examiner concedes the possibility that the report might con ?late different portions of the complainant's narrative in the same sentence.</span>.
</p>
<p>Under any view of the available evidence, the People remain unable to elicit a consistent narrative from the
  complainant regarding her actions surrounding the charged incident - issues that would be central at trial. Not only
  does this impair her reliability as a witness, but these varying accounts also make it difficult to ascertain what
  actually occurred in the critical time frame between 12:06 and 12:26, and we have no confidence that the complainant
  would tell the truth on this issue if she were called as a witness at trial <span class="source">See New York Rules of ProfI Conduct R. 3.3(a)(3) ("[a] lawyer shall not knowingly ... offer or use evidence that the lawyer knows to be false," and "[a] lawyer may refuse to offer evidence ... that the lawyer reasonably believes is false"); id. R. 3.3 cmt. 6A (prosecutors have additional duty "to correct any false evidence that the government has already offered," and prosecutor should inform the tribunal when she comes to know that a prosecution witness has testified falsely); id. cmt. 9.</span>.
