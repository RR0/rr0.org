<title>False Account of a Rape</title>
<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<p>In response to questioning by prosecutors on May 16, 2011, the complainant volunteered that she had previously been
  gang raped by soldiers who had invaded her home in Guinea. In an interview held on May 30, 2011, she offered precise
  and powerful details about the number and nature of her attackers and the presence of her 2-year-old daughter at the
  assault scene, who, she said, was pulled from her anTIS and thrown to the ground. During both interviews, she
  identified certain visible scars on her person, which she claimed were sustained during the attack. On both occasions,
  the complainant recounted the rape with great emotion and conviction: she cried, spoke hesitatingly, and appeared
  understandably distraught, and during the first interview, even laid her head face down on her arms on a table in
  front of her. </p>
<p>In subsequent interviews conducted on June 8,2011, and June 9, 2011, the complainant admitted to prosecutors that she
  had entirely fabricated this attack. When asked to explain why, she initially stated that she had lied about the gang
  rape because she had included it in her application for asylum, and she was afraid to vary from her application
  statement; she also stated that at the time she told prosecutors this account, she was not under oath. When confronted
  with the fact that her written asylum application statement made no mention of the gang rape, she stated that she had
  fabricated the gang rape, as well as other details of her life in Guinea, in collaboration with an unnamed male with
  whom she consulted as she was preparing to seek asylum. She told prosecutors this man had given her a cassette tape
  that included an account of a fictional rape, which she had memorized. Ultimately, she told prosecutors she decided
  not to reference the rape in her written application <span class="note">In her interviews of June 9 and June 28, the complainant stated that she had indeed been raped in the past in her native country, but in a completely different incident than the one that she had described in her earlier interviews. Our interviews of the complainant yielded no independent means of investigating or verifying this incident.</span>.
</p>
<p>It is clear that, in a case where a complainant is accusing a defendant of a sexual assault, the fact that she has
  given a prior false account of a different sexual assault is highly relevant. That it was told to prosecutors as an
  intentional falsehood, and done in a completely persuasive manner - identical to the manner in which she recounted the
  encounter with the defendant - is also highly significant. But most significant is her ability to recount that fiction
  as fact with complete conviction.</p>
<p> Prosecutors often argue to a jury that a witness' demeanor is a key factor in assessing credibility, and a judge
  gives jurors the same instruction as a matter of law. In this case, proof of the elements of forcible compulsion and
  lack of consent rest on a sole witness, the complainant. That she has previously persuaded seasoned prosecutors and
  investigators that she was the victim of another serious and violent - but false - sexual assault, with the same
  demeanor that she would likely exhibit at trial, is fatal. Knowing that her compelling manner cannot serve as a
  reliable measure of truthfulness, coupled with the number of falsehoods uncovered in our interviews with her, compel
  our conclusion that we are no longer convinced of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and cannot ask a
  jury to convict based on the complainant's testimony <span class="note">On occasion, the complainant's untruths were accompanied by dramatic displays of emotion. In the course of one interview, the prosecutor asked the complainant about a particular personal circumstance, and she calmly responded in the negative to the inquiry. In an interview two days later, she was asked a more specific question about the same subject. In response, she dropped to the floor, and physically rolled around while weeping; once composed, she said that she did not know the answer to the prosecutor's question. In yet a later interview, the prosecutor revisited the issue. This time, the complainant responded affirmatively, in a matter-of-fact manner, to the question.</span>.
