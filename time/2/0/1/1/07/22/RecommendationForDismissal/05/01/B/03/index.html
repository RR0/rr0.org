<title>Additional Falsehoods</title>
<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<p>In addition to the complainant's false account of a rape and false statements made under oath or penalty of perjury,
  she has been untruthful to law enforcement about so many other things that we simply can no longer credit her. For
  example, she executed repeated certifications that she now admits were fraudulent to re-establish her eligibility for
  the low-income housing where she resided, in which she intentionally omitted the income she made from the Sofitel. The
  complainant also displayed a repeated lack of candor about a wide range of additional topics concerning her history,
  background, present circumstances, and personal relationships. </p>
<p>Further, in response to routine questions from prosecutors regarding her sources of income, the complainant failed to
  disclose a stream of cash deposits - totaling nearly $60,000 - that were made into her checking account by other
  individuals in four different states. When asked about these transactions, she stated that she had allowed her fiance
  in Arizona <span class="note">The complainant's fiance has been convicted in Arizona of conspiracy to possess marijuana for sale, after delivering some $36,500 to undercover police officers for purchase of a large amount of marijuana. The complainant stated that she had no information about whether any funds deposited in her account were the proceeds of drug trafficking.</span>
  to use her checking account in order to make cash deposits for what, according to her, she believed to be a clothing
  and accessory business. At times, she said, he had asked her to withdraw cash that he had deposited and give the money
  to a business partner of his who was located in New York City. She claimed not to know how much money had gone through
  her account in this fashion. Although she denied profiting from any of these banking transactions, portions of each
  deposit frequently remained in her account. </p>
<p>Additionally, as early as May 16, 2011, the complainant was asked about potential financial motivations, given that
  she had retained a civil attorney. She unequivocally professed to have no interest in obtaining money as a result of
  her involvement in the case. She maintained this position during other pre- and post-indictment interviews,
  emotionally claiming on one occasion that no one could ''buy'' her. But very close in time to these statements, the
  complainant had a recorded conversation with her incarcerated fiance, in which the potential for financial recovery in
  relation to the May 14, 2011 incident was mentioned <span class="note">This call was translated and certified as true and accurate by two Fulani-English translators. While differing in their precise word-for-word transcriptions of the call, both translations are materially similar in their discussion of making money with the assistance of a civil lawyer. On August 8, 2011, the complainant filed a civil suit against the defendant, seeking unspecified monetary damages.</span>.
  Although there is nothing wrong with seeking recovery from a defendant in a civil suit, the complainant's disavowal of
  any financial interest is relevant to her credibility.</p>
<p> In sum, the complainant has been persistendy, and at times inexplicably, untruthful in describing matters of both
  great and small significance. In our repeated interviews with her, the complete truth about the charged incident and
  her background has, for that reason, remained elusive.</p>
