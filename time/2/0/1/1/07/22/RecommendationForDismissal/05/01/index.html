<title>The Complainant's Testimony at Trial Cannot Be Relied Upon to Establish Proof Beyond A Reasonable Doubt</title>
<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<p>In the course of numerous interviews, the complainant has given irreconcilable accounts of what happened immediately
  after her encounter with the defendant, leaving us unable to ascertain what actually occurred or to count on truthful
  testimony from the complainant in this regard. She has also made numerous false statements, both to prosecutors and in
  the past. Some of these statements were made under oath or penalty of perjury; some constituted fraudulent acts. </p>
