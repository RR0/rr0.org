<p>Based on the complainant's initial account of the charged incident, two locations of the Sofitel Hotel were
  identified and processed by the NYPD's Crime Scene Unit: Suite 2806, where the incident occurred, and the area at the
  end of the 28th floor hallway that the complainant had identified in her earlyaccounts as the location to which she
  fled immediately after the incident <span class="note">Because the complainant did not reveal that she had entered Room 2820 until June 28, 2011, that room was not processed by crime scene detectives. </span>.
  The Crime Scene Unit identified five distinct areas in Suite 2806's interior hallway that potentially contained
  biological fluids such as semen or saliva <span class="note">The processing detective took swabs of each area for further examination at aCME's Forensic Biology Laboratory. Those swabs were negative for the presence of semen and amylase, an enzyme found in semen, saliva, and in other bodily fluids, including vaginal fluid.</span>.
  The next day, Crime Scene Unit detectives removed the carpet from the suite's interior hallway, as well as the
  wallpaper from the suite's hallway wall, and delivered this evidence to aCME's Forensic Biology Department Preliminary
  tests conducted by aCME identified five areas of the carpet that contained biological fluid. One of these stains,
  which was located approximately six to eight feet from where the complainant said the sexual encounter occurred,
  tested positive for the presence of semen and amylase and contained a mixture of the defendant's and the complainant's
  DNA. None of the other stains from the carpet or the single stain on the wallpaper contained either the complainant's
  or the defendant's DNA <span class="note">Three of the other stains on the carpet contained the semen and DNA of three different unknown males, and one other stain contained amylase and a mixture of DNA from three additional unknown individuals. The stain on the wallpaper contained the semen and DNA of a fourth unknown male. As there is no evidence that any other person was present during the charged incident, the circumstances under which the unidentified DNA was deposited are unrelated to the incident under investigation.</span>.
</p>
<p>On May 14,2011, the complainant's hotel uniform, consisting of a dress and an apron, was recovered from her by
  responding police officers and forwarded to aCME's Forensic Biology Laboratory. Three stains on the upper portion of
  the uniform dress were identified as containing semen; two of the three contained amylase consistent with semen,
  saliva, or vaginal fluid. A single DNA profile matching the defendant's was obtained from these three stains.
  Additional swabs taken from the complainant's body as part of the forensic sexual assault examination failed to
  identify semen or amylase and therefore yielded no DNA results. Similarly, scrapings from underneath her fingernails
  also yielded no results.</p>
<p>Fingernail scrapings from the defendant's left hand contained his own DNA profile; scrapings from his right hand
  yielded no results. A penile swab taken from the defendant tested positive for semen and contained the defendant's DNA
  profile, as did a stain on the boxer shorts that were recovered from him shortly after his arrest. Two small blood
  stains on the defendant's boxer shorts contained the defendant's DNA, as did a single small spot of human blood found
  on the suite's top bed sheet. These stains appeared to be unrelated to the incident under investigation, since at the
  time of his arrest, the defendant was suffering from a skin condition that caused the skin on his hands to bleed. The
  condition and bleeding were clearly observable to arresting detectives and are depicted in photographs taken of the
  defendant's hands at the time of his arrest. At no time did the complainant state that she was bleeding during the
  incident, or that either of the two sustained any type of injury that might have bled; nor was any blood found on the
  complainant's clothing or body. </p>
<p>At the time of the incident, the complainant was wearing two pairs of panty hose (a pair that was darker in shade and
  a pair that was lighter in shade) <span class="note">When submitted to aCME, the lighter pair of hose was inside the darker pair.</span>.
  Underneath both pairs she wore a pair of panties. On May 14,2011, police recovered these items of clothing from the
  complainant after she had been escorted to the hospital, and forwarded them to OCME for testing. The defendant's DNA,
  in the form of epithelial cells, was found on both the interior and exterior waistband of both pairs of hose, as well
  as on the waistband of the panties. The defendant's DNA, also from epithelial cells, was also found on the exterior
  crotch of the lighter colored pair of hose but was not found on the interior or exterior crotch of the darker colored
  hose or of the panties. Because an individual can touch fabric and not necessarily deposit his DNA on it, these
  findings suggest that the defendant touched the complainant's undergarments, but they do not controvert or confinn the
  complainant's account that the defendant placed his hand inside her underwear and groped her genital area directly.
</p>
<p>On May 16, 2011, the Crime Scene Unit returned to the hotel suite and, among other things, swabbed the sink in the
  suite's small half-bathroom and collected some used tissues from the full bathroom. The complainant had stated that
  after the incident and while she was in the suite on May 14, 2011 with her supervisor, she had spit into the sink in
  the small half-bathroom. The two sink swabs, along with the tissues, were forwarded to aCME, and all tested negative
  for semen and positive for amylase. aCME could not extract sufficient material from the sink swabs to develop a DNA
  profile. </p>
