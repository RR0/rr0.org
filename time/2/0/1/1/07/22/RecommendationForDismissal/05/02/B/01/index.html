<p>On the date of the incident, the complainant was examined by a registered nurse who is an experienced and certified SAFE examiner at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital. During her initial examination, the examiner noted no visible injuries to the complainant and documented that she had no trauma to her body or oral cavity. The only physical finding that the examiner noted was "redness," which was observed during the gynecological examination. The examiner could not say to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that this "redness" was a direct result of the incident, nor that it was even an injury or a bruise. The examiner stated that this finding could be attributed to the incident described by the complainant, but could also be attributed to a host of other causes.</p>
<p> In the post-indictment period, we retained and consulted with a second, highly-experienced physician who is an expert in the field of sexual assault forensic examinations. This expert inspected complainant's medical records from May 14, 2011, and concurred with the SAFE examiner's conclusion that the observed red coloration was a very non-specific finding that could be attributed to a host of causes other than trauma, including any type of friction, irritation, or inflammation to the area. This expert further opined that although it was possible for the redness to have been caused by the defendant's grabbing the complainant in the manner that she had described, it was not likely caused by such an act.</p>
