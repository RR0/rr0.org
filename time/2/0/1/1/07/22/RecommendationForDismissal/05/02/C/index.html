<p>The relatively brief nature of the encounter between the defendant and the complainant initially suggested that the sexual act was not likely consensual. Specifically, key card records from the hotel indicated that the complainant first entered Suite 2806 at 12:06 p?.m., and telephone records later showed that the defendant had placed a call to his daughter at 12:13 p.m <span class="note">On the day of the incident, there was a possible discrepancy of approximately two minutes between the time indicated on the record of electronic key card entries in the hotel system and the acrual time, in that the recorded times could be two minutes earlier than the acrual time. Although we have been informed that the call detail times in the cellular records are synchronized to acrual time, because of the hotel discrepancy, the exact passage of time cannot be determined with certainty.</span>. Accordingly, it appeared that whatever had occurred between the complainant and the defendant was over in approximately seven to nine minutes. But in light of the complainant's failure to offer an accurate and consistent nanative of the immediate aftermath of the encounter, it is impossible to determine the length of the encounter itself. That the defendant placed a brief phone call at 12:13 p.m. is not dispositive of when the encounter took place, how long it lasted, or where the complainant was from 12:06 to 12:26.  Any inferences that could conceivably be draw from  timeline of the encounter arc necessarily weakened by the inability to solidify the timeline itself.</p>
