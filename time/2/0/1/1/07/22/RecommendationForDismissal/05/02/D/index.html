<p>The prompt outcry witnesses have been interviewed repeatedly and appeared reliable. Both witnesses indicated that the complainant appeared upset when telling them about her encounter with the defendant. But in light of our inability, detailed above, to credit the complainant, along with her ability to muster emotion for effect, the strength and effect of the available prompt outcry evidence is greatly diminished. It is also no table that the complainant's current version of her prompt outcry to her first supervisor is inconsistent with certain aspects of that supervisor's account. </p><div class="menu"><div class="menu"><div class="menu"><ul>
