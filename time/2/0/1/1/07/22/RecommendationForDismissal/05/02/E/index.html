<p> During the pendency of the case, evidence came to the Office's attention concerning an alleged sexual assault
  committed by the defendant on another woman in France, Tristane Banon. After the filing of the indictment, Ms. Banon
  reported publicly that during an interview in France in 2003, the defendant had attempted to rape her inside an empty
  apartment <span class="source">Claire Chartier &amp; Delphine Saubaber, "<a

  It appears unlikely, however, that prosecutors would be permitted to introduce in their case-in-chief any testimony by
  Ms. Banon regarding this alleged attack <span class="source">27 Su Pro plr /1. M()linmx, 168 N.
