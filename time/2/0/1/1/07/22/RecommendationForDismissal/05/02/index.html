<p>The physical, medical, and other evidence available in this case is of limited value to the key contested issues of forcible compulsion and lack of consent. It conclusively establishes that the defendant engaged in a sexual encounter with the complainant on May 14, 2011. It does not, however, prove or corroborate that their encounter was forcible or non-consensual, and fails to corroborate certain aspects of the complainant's account of the charged incident. </p>
