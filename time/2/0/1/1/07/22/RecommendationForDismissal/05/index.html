<title>Reasons for Recommendation of Dismissal</title>
<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<p>The prosecution has the burden at trial to prove the guilt of an accused beyond a reasonable doubt For a host of
  reasons, including those set forth below, the complainant's untruthfulness makes it impossible to credit her. Because
  we cannot credit the complainant's testimony beyond a reasonable doubt, we cannot ask a jury to do so. The remaining
  evidence is insufficient to satisfy the elements of the charged crimes. We are therefore required, as both a legal and
  ethical matter, to move for dismissal of the indictment.</p>
