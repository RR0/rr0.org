<title>The Incident at Exeter</title>

<p>By <time>1965-09-03 02:00</time>, eighteen-year old Norman Muscarello had walked <span itemscope
    itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">9</span> <span content="SMI" itemprop="unitCode">mile</span>
    </span> and had another <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">3</span> <span content="SMI" itemprop="unitCode">mile</span>
    </span> to go before he reached his home in <span class="place">Exeter (New Hampshire)</span>. He had sold his car
  because he was headed to boot camp in three weeks and hitchhiked that evening to visit his girlfriend. Rides were
  scarce on the return trip and he had to walk most of the way. As he passed a farmhouse a reddish glow illuminated the
  surrounding area. The source was five flashing lights tilted at a 60-degree angle; only one light shone at a time as
  they pulsed in a rapid pattern back and forth, 1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1. The lights were so bright that he could not
  distinguish any object behind them, but they stayed together as a body as they moved out over the fields and swayed
  with a motion like a falling leaf. Sometimes the lights disappeared behind the house or some trees then reappeared
  again, and once came so close that he dived into a ditch for fear of being struck. The UFO finally retreated across
  the wood-lands after about <time>P15M</time>.
</p>
<p>Muscarello knocked at the farmhouse but received no response. He was able to flag a passing car and get to the Exeter
  police station, where the officer on duty radioed Officer Eugene Bertrand to investigate. Bertrand had heard the story
  of a woman motorist upset by a red-lighted object that followed her earlier in the evening, and after hearing
  Muscarello’s account, drove him back to the scene. They arrived about <time>03:00</time> and the two of them had
  walked into the field when a group of five red lights, flashing one at a time, appeared over a stand of trees then
  moved across the field. The farm animals became agitated and noisy at this time. As the lights approached him Bertrand
  dropped to his knees and started to pull his revolver, then thought better and pulled Muscarello back to the cruiser.
  He radioed another officer, David Hunt, who arrived in a few minutes. By the time Hunt saw the lights they were moving
  off into the distance, but he stated that the group of lights flashed in sequence and maintained an altitude of about
  a <span itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/QuantitativeValue">
      <span itemprop="value">100</span> <span content="FOT" itemprop="unitCode">pieds</span>
    </span>. The animals quieted down as the UFO departed to the southeast in the direction of Hampton, where a man
  phoned the police soon after to report that a UFO had chased him <span class="source"><span class="people">Hynek, Josef Allen</span>: The Hynek UFO Report (New York: Dell, 1977), 154-165.</span>.
</p>
<p>When ufologist Raymond Fowler interviewed Bertrand a week after the event, Bertrand compared the brightness of the
  lights to facing an automobile headlight at close range. They lit up the entire field and two nearby houses with a red
  light. The five lights always maintained a 60-degree angle and when they moved, the lowest light always led the way.
  He suspected that the lights were attached to an object the size of a barn, and also remarked that the object could
  stop, hover, and turn on a dime. When asked to compare the apparent size of the UFO to a familiar object, he said that
  the object at its closest looked as wide as a grapefruit at arm’s length <span class="source">Fowler, Raymond E. Casebook of a UFO Investigator (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1981), 34-43.</span>.
</p>
<p>The Exeter case lacked nothing for documentation and field investigation. All three witnesses filed statements with
  the Air Force and some of ufology’s best investigators followed up with further questioning. J. Allen Hynek took an
  interest in the case, while Ray Fowler’s meticulous report was published in the Congressional Record for <time>1966-04-05</time>,
  as part of the House Committee on Armed Services hearings on unidentified flying objects. <span class="people">John G. Fuller</span>,
  a columnist for Saturday Review , learned of the case from Fowler and began his own investigation, leading to magazine
  articles in Saturday Review, Look, and Reader’s Digest , while a popular book, Incident at Exeter, followed in <time>1966</time>.
  In this book Fuller also explored scores of other cases reported around New Hampshire during the fall of
  <time>1965</time>.
</p>
<p>The Air Force had a ready explanation for the Exeter sighting—nighttime maneuvers designated “Operation Big Blast”
  operated out of Pease Air Force Base, ten miles outside the town, on the evening of September 2. The witnesses simply
  saw an aerial refueling operation at the end of these maneuvers. This seemingly plausible explanation foundered on the
  fact that all Big Blast aircraft had returned to base by <time>01:30</time> on the 3rd, while Bertrand complained that
  he gained extensive familiarity with refueling operations during his four years in the Air Force and the UFO resembled
  nothing he had ever seen. As a result of Bertrand’s protest Project Blue Book reversed its verdict and declared the
  case “unknown.” <span class="source">Hynek, Hynek UFO Report , 161-165</span>.
</p>
<p>Other attempts to explain this UFO have ranged from the improbable, like an advertising aircraft (at 3:00 a.m.?) and
  electrical plasmas that detached from nearby power lines and floated across the countryside (unfounded and unlikely),
  to the more reasonable proposal that the planet Jupiter was responsible (probably true for some other reports but does
  not fit the testimony of the Exeter witnesses). Another explanation postulated a hoaxer flying a kite with flashing
  lights attached to the string. This proposal explained the 60-degree angle and the “falling leaf” motion, but raised
  too many other questions, like why would anyone carry out a hoax so late at night, or how could anyone run off through
  the woods but not entangle the kite string in the trees? <span class="source">Bullard: The Myth and Mystery of UFOs , 37-38.</span>.
  With no viable conventional explanations at hand, ufologists trusted that a genuine UFO had descended on the rural
  fields outside Exeter, one of a series of sightings in that same area. Three credible witnesses confirmed the sighting
  and elements like the falling-leaf motion and animal reactions tallied with other reports as typical of UFO
  encounters. Truly, then, this case seemed to be one for the ages.
</p>
<p>A reexamination of the case by <span class="people">James McGaha</span> and <span class="people">Joe Nickell</span>
  reopened the possibility that a refueling aircraft was responsible. They pointed out in the
  <time>2011-11/2011-12</time> issue of <em>Skeptical Inquirer</em> that the KC-97 tanker very probably participated in
  the Big Blast maneuvers. This tanker had five lights above its refueling boom that flashed to guide aircraft to
  docking, and since the boom hung at a 60-degree angle, reflections of these lights off the boom could account for the
  witness observations. A slow-moving tanker circling the rendezvous area might appear to chase the witnesses on the
  ground while fluttering of the boom in the wind could explain the falling leaf motion. The tanker could thus answer
  the most striking observational questions raised by the Exeter UFO. At last a conventional solution to the
  long-standing Exeter mystery seemed at hand <span class="source">McGaha, James, & Joe Nickell: “’Exeter Incident’ Solved! A Classic UFO Case, Forty-Five Years ‘Cold’.” Skeptical Inquirer 35/6 (Nov.-Dec. 2011), 16-19.</span>.
</p>
<p>Ufologists did not buy this new solution. No refueling operations should have been underway an hour and a half after
  the end of the maneuvers, and in any case a low-level refueling operation over an inhabited area in the dead of night
  would be foolhardy and dangerous. And the fact remains that Officer Bertrand was familiar with nighttime refueling
  operations <span class="source">(The Big Study) “<a
      href="https://thebiggeststudy.blogspot.com/2012/04/ recent-fuss-about-exeter-case.html">The
    Recent Fuss about the Exeter Case</a>".</span>. The most trenchant rebuttal came from <span class="people">Martin Shough</span>,
  an association of the <a href="/org/us/asso/narcap">NARCAP</a>. He pointed out that for the guide lights to appear as
  individual lights, the tanker would have to be no more than a mile away, and more probably a half mile at most. To
  stay in sight for as long as the observations lasted, the tanker would have to be flying as slow as about ten miles an
  hour, far too slow to stay airborne; and even allowing for significant overestimates in timing, the tanker’s air speed
  would still be too slow. Shough’s rebuttal makes clear that the tanker explanation does not fit the reported facts and
  is, in fact, mathematically impossible <span class="source"><span class="people" title="Martin Lawrence Shough">Shough, Martin</span>: "<a
      href="https://www.martinshough.com/aerialphenomena/EXETER%20N.H.%20Sep%202-3%201965.pdf">Exeunt
    Exeter?</a>” (posted <time>2012-04</time>).</span>. The dispute might end here, but Shough suggested an alternative
  solution in which aircraft might explain the Exeter incident. He said that rotating red anti-collision beacons on
  several B-47s flying in formation at some distance could explain both the UFO lights and the duration of the sighting.
  The witness observations would depend on a lot of coincidences and he did not muster any enthusiasm for his own
  proposal, but here at least was one conventional explanation with some viability. Some evidence even exists that there
  were B-47s or other large aircraft in the air as late as <time>03:00</time>, even if not related to Operation Big
  Blast. The skeptics did not explain the Incident at Exeter but they opened a dialogue that led to another possibility.
  Ufologists may continue to defend Exeter as a genuine UFO case, and legitimately so; but these new examinations have
  diminished it to the point that it can no longer settle securely on every ufologist’s top-ten list.
