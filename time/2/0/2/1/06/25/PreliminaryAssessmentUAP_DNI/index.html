    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>This preliminary report is provided by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (<abbr
        title="Office of the Director of National Intelligence">ODNI</abbr>) in response to the provision in Senate
      Report 116-233, accompanying the <abbr title="Intelligence Authorization Act">IAA</abbr> for Fiscal Year <time>2021</time>,
      that the <abbr title="Director of National Intelligence">DNI</abbr>, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense
      (SECDEF), is to submit an intelligence assessment of the threat posed by unidentified aerial phenomena (<a
          href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>) and the progress the <a href="/org/us/dod">DoD</a> <abbr
          title="Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force">UAPTF</abbr> has made in understanding this threat.</p>
    <p>This report provides an overview for policymakers of the challenges associated with characterizing the potential
      threat posed by <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> while also providing a means to develop relevant
      processes, policies, technologies, and training for the U.S. military and other U.S. Government (USG) personnel if
      and when they encounter <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>, so as to enhance the Intelligence
      Community’s (IC) ability to understand the threat. The Director, UAPTF, is the accountable official for ensuring
      the timely collection and consolidation of data on <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>. The dataset
      described in this report is currently limited primarily to U.S. Government reporting of incidents occurring from
      November 2004 to March 2021. Data continues to be collected and analyzed.</p>
    <p>ODNI prepared this report for the Congressional Intelligence and Armed Services Committees. UAPTF and the ODNI
      National Intelligence Manager for Aviation drafted this report, with input from USD(I&S), DIA, FBI, NRO, NGA, NSA,
      Air Force, Army, Navy, Navy/ONI, DARPA, FAA, NOAA, NGA, ODNI/NIM-Emerging and Disruptive Technology, ODNI/National
      Counterintelligence and Security Center, and ODNI/National Intelligence Council.</p>

    <h3>Assumptions</h3>
    <p>Various forms of sensors that register <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> generally operate correctly
      and capture enough real data to allow initial assessments, but some <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>
      may be attributable to sensor anomalies.</p></section>

<section>
  <h2>Executive summary</h2>
  <p><strong>The limited amount of high-quality reporting on unidentified aerial phenomena (<a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>) hampers our ability to draw firm conclusions about the nature or
    intent of <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>.</strong> The Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force
    (UAPTF) considered a range of information on <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> described in U.S.
    military and IC (Intelligence Community) reporting, but because the reporting lacked sufficient specificity,
    ultimately recognized that a unique, tailored reporting process was required to provide sufficient data for analysis
    of <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> events.</p>
  <ul><li>As a result, the UAPTF concentrated its review on reports that occurred between 2004 and 2021, the majority of
    which are a result of this new tailored process to better capture <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>
    events through formalized reporting.</li><li>
    Most of the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> reported probably do represent physical objects given
    that a majority of <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> were registered across multiple sensors, to
    include radar, infrared, electro-optical, weapon seekers, and visual observation.</li></ul>
  <p><strong>In a limited number of incidents, <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> reportedly appeared to
    exhibit unusual flight characteristics. These observations could be the result of sensor errors, spoofing, or
    observer misperception and require additional rigorous analysis.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>There are probably multiple types of <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> requiring different
    explanations based on the range of appearances and behaviors described in the available reporting.</strong> Our
    analysis of the data supports the construct that if and when individual <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> incidents are resolved they will fall into one of five potential
    explanatory categories: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, USG or U.S. industry developmental
    programs, foreign adversary systems, and a catchall “other” bin.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> clearly pose a safety of flight issue and may pose a
    challenge to U.S. national security.</strong> Safety concerns primarily center on aviators contending with an
    increasingly cluttered air domain. <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> would also represent a national
    security challenge if they are foreign adversary collection platforms or provide evidence a potential adversary has
    developed either a breakthrough or disruptive technology.</p>
  <p><strong>Consistent consolidation of reports from across the federal government, standardized reporting, increased
    collection and analysis, and a streamlined process for screening all such reports against a broad range of relevant
    USG data will allow for a more sophisticated analysis of <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> that is
    likely to deepen our understanding.</strong> Some of these steps are resource-intensive and would require additional
    investment.</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Available reporting largely inconclusive</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>Limited Data Leaves Most UAP Unexplained…</h3>
    <p>Limited data and inconsistency in reporting are key challenges to evaluating <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>. No standardized reporting mechanism existed until the Navy
      established one in March 2019. The Air Force subsequently adopted that mechanism in November 2020, but it remains
      limited to USG reporting. The UAPTF regularly heard anecdotally during its research about other observations that
      occurred but which were never captured in formal or informal reporting by those observers.</p>
    <p>After carefully considering this information, the UAPTF focused on reports that involved <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> largely witnessed firsthand by military aviators and that were
      collected from systems we considered to be reliable. These reports describe incidents that occurred between 2004
      and 2021, with the majority coming in the last two years as the new reporting mechanism became better known to the
      military aviation community. We were able to identify one reported <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>
      with high confidence. In that case, we identified the object as a large, deflating balloon. The others remain
      unexplained.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>144 reports originated from USG sources. Of these, 80 reports involved observation with multiple sensors.
        <ul><li>Most reports described <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> as objects that interrupted
          pre-planned training or other military activity.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <figure class="right">
    <h2>UAP Collection Challenges</h2>
    <p>Sociocultural stigmas and sensor limitations remain obstacles to collecting data on <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>. Although some technical challenges—such as how to appropriately
      filter out radar clutter to ensure safety of flight for military and civilian aircraft—are longstanding in the
      aviation community, while others are unique to the UAP problem set.</p>
    <ul><li>Narratives from aviators in the operational community and analysts from the military and IC describe
      disparagement associated with observing <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>, reporting it, or
      attempting to discuss it with colleagues. Although the effects of these stigmas have lessened as senior members of
      the scientific, policy, military, and intelligence communities engage on the topic seriously in public,
      reputational risk may keep many observers silent, complicating scientific pursuit of the topic.</li>
      <li>The sensors mounted on U.S. military platforms are typically designed to fulfill specific missions. As a
        result, those sensors are not generally suited for identifying <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Sensor vantage points and the numbers of sensors concurrently observing an object play substantial roles in
        distinguishing <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> from known objects and determining whether a <a
            href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> demonstrates breakthrough aerospace capabilities. Optical
        sensors have the benefit of providing some insight into relative size, shape, and structure. Radiofrequency
        sensors provide more accurate velocity and range information.</li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h3>But Some Potential Patterns Do Emerge</h3>
    <p>Although there was wide variability in the reports and the dataset is currently too limited to allow for detailed
      trend or pattern analysis, there was some clustering of <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>
      observations regarding shape, size, and, particularly, propulsion. <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>
      sightings also tended to cluster around U.S. training and testing grounds, but we assess that this may result from
      a collection bias as a result of focused attention, greater numbers of latest-generation sensors operating in
      those areas, unit expectations, and guidance to report anomalies.</p></section>
  <section>
    <h3>And a Handful of <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> Appear to Demonstrate Advanced Technology</h3>
    <p>In <strong>18</strong> incidents, described in <strong>21</strong> reports, observers reported unusual <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> movement patterns or flight characteristics.</p>
    <p>Some <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> appeared to remain stationary in winds aloft, move against
      the wind, maneuver abruptly, or move at considerable speed, without discernable means of propulsion. In a small
      number of cases, military aircraft systems processed radio frequency (RF) energy associated with <a
          href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> sightings.</p>
    <p>The <a href="/org/us/dod/navy/uaptf">UAPTF</a> holds a small amount of data that appear to show <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> demonstrating acceleration or a degree of signature management.
      Additional rigorous analysis are necessary by multiple teams or groups of technical experts to determine the
      nature and validity of these data. We are conducting further analysis to determine if breakthrough technologies
      were demonstrated.</p></section>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>UAP probably lack a single explanation</h2>
  <p>The <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> documented in this limited dataset demonstrate an array of
    aerial behaviors, reinforcing the possibility there are multiple types of <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> requiring different explanations. Our analysis of the data supports
    the construct that if and when individual <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> incidents are resolved they
    will fall into one of five potential explanatory categories: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, USG or
    industry developmental programs, foreign adversary systems, and a catchall “other” bin. With the exception of the
    one instance where we determined with high confidence that the reported <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> was airborne clutter, specifically a deflating balloon, we currently
    lack sufficient information in our dataset to attribute incidents to specific explanations.</p>
  <dl class="bullet">
    <dt>Airborne Clutter</dt>
    <dd>These objects include birds, balloons, recreational <abbr title="Unmanned Aerial Vehicles">UAV</abbr>, or
      airborne debris like plastic bags that muddle a scene and affect an operator’s ability to identify true targets,
      such as enemy aircraft.
    </dd>
    <dt>Natural Atmospheric Phenomena</dt>
    <dd>Natural atmospheric phenomena includes ice crystals, moisture, and thermal fluctuations that may register on
      some infrared and radar systems.
    </dd>
    <dt>USG or Industry Developmental Programs</dt>
    <dd>Some <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> observations could be attributable to developments and
      classified programs by U.S. entities. We were unable to confirm, however, that these systems accounted for any of
      the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> reports we collected.
    </dd>
    <dt>Foreign Adversary Systems</dt>
    <dd>Some <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> may be technologies deployed by China, Russia, another
      nation, or a non-governmental entity.
    </dd>
    <dt>Other</dt>
    <dd>Although most of the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> described in our dataset probably remain
      unidentified due to limited data or challenges to collection processing or analysis, we may require additional
      scientific knowledge to successfully collect on, analyze and characterize some of them. We would group such
      objects in this category pending scientific advances that allowed us to better understand them. The <abbr
          title="UAP Task Force">UAPTF</abbr> intends to focus additional analysis on the small number of cases where a
      <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> appeared to display unusual flight characteristics or signature
      management.

  <h2>UAP THREATEN FLIGHT SAFETY AND, POSSIBLY, NATIONAL SECURITY</h2>
  <p><a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> pose a hazard to safety of flight and could pose a broader danger if
    some instances represent sophisticated collection against U.S. military activities by a foreign government or
    demonstrate a breakthrough aerospace technology by a potential adversary.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Ongoing Airspace Concerns</h3>
    <p>When aviators encounter safety hazards, they are required to report these concerns. Depending on the location,
      volume, and behavior of hazards during incursions on ranges, pilots may cease their tests and/or training and land
      their aircraft, which has a deterrent effect on reporting.</p>
    <ul><li>The <a href="/org/us/dod/navy/uaptf">UAPTF</a> has 11 reports of documented instances in which pilots
      reported near misses with a <a
          href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>.</li></ul>
  </section>
  <h3>Potential National Security Challenges</h3>
  <p>We currently lack data to indicate any <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> are part of a foreign
    collection program or indicative of a major technological advancement by a potential adversary. We continue to
    monitor for evidence of such programs given the counter intelligence challenge they would pose, particularly as some
    <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> have been detected near military facilities or by aircraft carrying
    the USG’s most advanced sensor systems.</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>EXPLAINING UAP WILL REQUIRE ANALYTIC, COLLECTION AND RESOURCE INVESTMENT</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>Standardize the Reporting, Consolidate the Data, and Deepen the Analysis</h3>
    <p>In line with the provisions of Senate Report 116-233, accompanying the IAA for FY 2021, the <abbr
        title="UAP Task Force">UAPTF</abbr>’s long-term goal is to widen the scope of its work to include additional <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> events documented by a broader swath of USG personnel and technical
      systems in its analysis. As the dataset increases, the <a href="/org/us/dod/navy/uaptf">UAPTF</a>’s ability to
      employ data analytics to detect trends will also improve. The initial focus will be to employ artificial
      intelligence/machine learning algorithms to cluster and recognize similarities and patterns in features of the
      data points. As the database accumulates information from known aerial objects such as weather balloons,
      high-altitude or super-pressure balloons, and wildlife, machine learning can add efficiency by pre-assessing <a
          href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> reports to see if those records match similar events already in
      the database.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="/org/us/dod/navy/uaptf">UAPTF</a> has begun to develop interagency analytical and processing
        workflows to ensure both collection and analysis will be well informed and coordinated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The majority of <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> data is from U.S. Navy reporting, but efforts are
      underway to standardize incident reporting across U.S. military services and other government agencies to ensure
      all relevant data is captured with respect to particular incidents and any U.S. activities that might be relevant.
      The <a href="/org/us/dod/navy/uaptf">UAPTF</a> is currently working to acquire additional reporting, including
      from the U.S. Air Force (USAF), and has begun receiving data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Although USAF data collection has been limited historically the USAF began a six month pilot program in
        November 2020 to collect in the most likely areas to encounter <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>
        and is evaluating how to normalize future collection, reporting, and analysis across the entire Air Force.</li>
      <li>The FAA captures data related to <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> during the normal course of
        managing air traffic operations. The FAA generally ingests this data when pilots and other airspace users report
        unusual or unexpected events to the FAA’s Air Traffic Organization.</li>
      <li>In addition, the FAA continuously monitors its systems for anomalies, generating additional information that
        may be of use to the <a href="/org/us/dod/navy/uaptf">UAPTF</a>. The FAA is able to isolate data of interest to
        the <a href="/org/us/dod/navy/uaptf">UAPTF</a> and make it available. The FAA has a robust and effective
        outreach program that can help the <a href="/org/us/dod/navy/uaptf">UAPTF</a> reach members of the aviation
        community to highlight the importance of reporting <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Expand Collection</h3>
    <p>The <a href="/org/us/dod/navy/uaptf">UAPTF</a> is looking for novel ways to increase collection of <a
        href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> cluster areas when U.S. forces are not present as a way to baseline
      “standard” <a
          href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> activity and mitigate the collection bias in the dataset. One
      proposal is to use advanced algorithms to search historical data captured and stored by radars. The <abbr
          title="UAP Task Force">UAPTF</abbr> also plans to update its current interagency <a
          href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> collection strategy in order bring to bear relevant collection
      platforms and methods from the DoD and the IC.</p></section>
  <section>
    <h3>Increase Investment in Research and Development</h3>
    <p>The <a href="/org/us/dod/navy/uaptf">UAPTF</a> has indicated that additional funding for research and development
      could further the future study of the topics laid out in this report. Such investments should be guided by a <a
          href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> Collection Strategy, <a
          href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">UAP</a> R&D Technical Roadmap, and a <a
