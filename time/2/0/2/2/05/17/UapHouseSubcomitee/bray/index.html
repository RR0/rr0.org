<h2>STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE RONALD S. MOULTRIE</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Chairman Schiff, Chairman Carson, Ranking Member Crawford, and committee members, thank you very much for the
    opportunity to be here today to highlight the ongoing work of the Department of Defense regarding unidentified
    aerial phenomena.</p>
  <p>Since the early 2000s, we have seen an increasing number of unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft or objects in
    military-controlled training areas and training ranges and other designated airspace. Reports of sightings are
    frequent and continuing.</p>
  <p>We attribute this increase in reporting to a number of factors including our work to destigmatize reporting and
    increase in the number of new systems such as quadcopters and unmanned aerial systems that are in our airspace,
    identification of what we can classify as clutter, mylar balloons and other types of air trash, and improvements in
    the capabilities of our various sensors to detect things in our airspace.</p>
  <p>Almost 2 years ago, in <time>2020-08</time>, Deputy Secretary of Defense Norquist directed the establishment of the
    Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force within the Department of the Navy. The UAP Task Force was built on the
    foundation of the Navy's initial efforts to respond to the reports from our aviators on unidentified objects
    observed in our training ranges.</p>
  <p>The basic issues then and now are twofold. First, incursions in our training ranges by unidentified objects
    represent serious hazards to safety of flight. In every aspect of the naval aviation, safety of our air crews is
    paramount.</p>
  <p>Second, intrusions by unknown aircraft or objects pose potential threats to the security of our operations. Our
    aviators train as they would fight. So any intrusions 13 that may compromise the security of our operations by
    revealing our capabilities, our tactics, techniques, or procedures are of great concern to the Navy and the
    Department of Defense.</p>
  <p>From the very beginning, we took these reports very seriously. We instituted a data-driven approach to the
    investigations where we could collect as much data as possible and use all available resources to analyze and make
    informed decisions on the best ways to address our findings. Our main objective was to transition UAP efforts from
    an anecdotal or narrative-based approach to a rigorous science and technology engineering focused study.</p>
  <p>This data-driven approach requires input from a wide variety of sources. In the early stages, the task force worked
    to standardize the reporting mechanisms and processes to make it as easy as possible for personnel to report any
    engagement so that we were getting that wide range of reporting that we needed.</p>
  <p>We also spent considerable efforts engaging directly with our naval aviators and building relationships to help
    destigmatize the act of reporting sightings or encounters.</p>
  <p>And we worked with naval aviation leadership to provide additional equipment to record any encounter. Navy and Air
    Force crews now have step-by-step procedures for reporting on a UAP on their kneeboard in their -- in the cockpit
    and in their postflight debrief procedures. The direct result of those efforts has been increased reporting with
    increased opportunities to focus a number of sensors on any objects.</p>
  <p>The message is now clear: If you see something, you need to report it.</p>
  <p>And the message has been received. In fact, recently I received a call from a senior naval aviator with over 2,000
    flight hours. He called me personally from the flight line after landing to talk about an encounter that he had just
    experienced.</p>
  <p>Those were just the initial steps. We also made a concerted effort to assemble subject-matter experts from across
    the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community and other U.S. Government agencies and departments. We
    forged partnerships with the research, development, and acquisition communities, with industry partners, and with
    academic research labs. And we brought many allies and international partners into our discussions on UAP.</p>
  <p>Additionally, subject-matter experts from a wide variety of fields, including physics, optics, metallurgy,
    meteorology, just to name a few, have been brought in to expand our understanding in areas where we may not have
    organic expertise. In short, we have endeavored to bring an all-hands-on-deck approach to better understand this
    phenomenon.</p>
  <p>So what have we learned so far? Any given observation may be fleeting or longer. It may be recorded or not. It may
    be observable by one or multiple assets. In short, there is rarely an easy answer.</p>
  <p>For example, let me share with you the first video that we have here today which shows an observation in real
    time.</p>
  [Video shown.]
  <p>There it was. That is in many cases that is all that a report may include, and in many other cases, we have far
    less than this.</p>
  <p>As we detailed in both the unclassified and classified versions of the preliminary assessment released by the
    Office of the Director of National Intelligence last June, this often limited amount of high-quality data and
    reporting hampers our ability to draw firm conclusions about the nature or intent of UAP.</p>
  <p>As detailed in the ODNI report, if and when individual UAP incidents are resolved, they likely fall into one of
    five potential explanatory categories: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, U.S. Government or U.S.
    industry developmental programs, foreign adversary systems, or an other bin that allows for a holding bin of
    difficult cases and for the possibility of surprise and potential scientific discovery. We stand by those initial
    results.</p>
  <p>Since the release of that preliminary report, UAP database has now grown to contain approximately 400 reports. The
    stigma has been reduced. We have also made progress in resolving the character of a limited number of UAP
    encounters. For example, let me show a couple -- another video and image taken years apart in different areas.</p>
  [Video shown.]
  <p>In this video, U.S. Navy personnel recorded what appears to be triangles, some flashing, recorded several years ago
    off the coast of the United States. This was the recorded while the U.S. Navy ship observed a number of small,
    unmanned aerial systems in the area. Importantly, the video was taken through night vision goggles with a
    single-lens reflex camera. These remained unresolved for several years.</p>
  [Video shown.]
  <p>Several years later and off a different coast, U.S. Navy personnel, again in a swarm of unmanned aerial systems
    and, again, through night vision goggles and an SLR camera, recorded this image. But this time other U.S. Navy
    assets also observed unmanned aerial systems nearby, and we are now reasonably confident that these triangles
    correlate to unmanned aerial systems in the area. The triangular appearance is a result of light passing through the
    night vision goggles and then being recorded by an SLR camera.</p>
  <p>I don't mean to suggest that everything that we observe is identifiable. But the -- it -- but this is a great
    example of how it takes considerable effort to understand what we are seeing in the examples that we are able to
    collect.</p>
  <p>In this example, we accumulated sufficient data from two similar encounters from two different time periods in two
    different geographic areas to help us draw these conclusions. That is not always the case, though. We recognize that
    that can be unsatisfying or insufficient in the eyes of many. It is a popular topic in our Nation with various
    theories as to what these objects may be and where they originate. By nature, we are all curious. And we seek to
    understand the unknown. And, as a lifelong necessary professional, I am impatient. I want immediate explanations for
    this as much as anyone else.</p>
  <p>However, understanding can take significant time and effort. It is why we have endeavored to concentrate on this
    data-driven process, to drive fact-based results. And given the nature of our business, national defense, we have
    had to sometimes be less forthcoming with information in open forums than many would hope.</p>
  <p>If UAP do indeed represent a potential threat to our security, then the capability, systems, processes, and sources
    we use to observe, record, study, or analyze these phenomena need to be classified at appropriate levels. We do not
    want, we do not want potential adversaries to know exactly what we are able to see or understand or how we come to
    the conclusions we make. Therefore, public disclosures must be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
  <p>So what is next? We are concentrating on a seamless transition to the new organization. Future analysis of
    complicated issues, of UAP issues, will greatly benefit from the infrastructure of the process and the procedures
    that we have developed to date. I am confident that the task force under Navy leadership has forged a path forward
    that will allow us to anchor assessments in science and engineering vice anecdotal evidence. We remain committed to
    that goal, as I know the USDI organization does as well.</p>
  <p>So thank you very much for your interest and continuing support for the UAP Task Force. The team has made a lot of
    progress, but we really are just establishing the foundation for the more detailed analysis that is yet to be done.
    And with your continued support, we can sustain that momentum necessary to produce data-centric analysis and
    understanding of phenomena.</p>
  <p>I look forward to your questions. Thank you.</p>
