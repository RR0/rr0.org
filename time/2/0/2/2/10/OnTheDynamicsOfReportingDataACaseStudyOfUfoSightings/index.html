<p class="abstract">There are a growing number of large databases online. In this study, we used data from 80,332 cases
  of UFO sightings reported from 1906 to 2014 as a tool for investigating the human behavior in reporting events and how
  a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/time-lag">time lag</a> influences the patterns of
  reporting events. We identified that new reports were sensitive to media broadcasting and daytime hours. This last
  pattern was ruled by different reporting mechanisms distinguishing daytime and night hours with an evident phase
  transition in the rank distribution. Also, we verified that more than 41% of the sightings reported supposedly
  happened in perfect o’clock hours, indicating that observers have a strong preference for rounder numbers, a result
  that could be relevant for investigations of <a
    href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/experimental-data">experimental data</a> collected by humans
  in mechanical and analog measuring instruments.</p>
<p class="abstract">This <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/rounding">rounding</a> pattern also
  led to different mechanisms underlying the rank distribution of round or non-round minutes. Finally, we found
  numerical evidence that observers have an urgency in reporting the sighting. The probability distribution of reporting
  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/time-lag">time lag</a> revealed a critical reporting lag of
  83.5 days after the contact. Additionally, we identified that the month-day <a
    href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/rounding">rounding</a> mechanism varies with time being
  connected to the critical reporting lag obtained.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Humans have odd behavior. Apart from some exceptions, in general, humans tend to round values even in answer to a
    simple question such as ‘What time is it?’. Another simple test is to check alarm clocks. Indeed, we will see many
    alarms set at 6 o’clock, but rarely alarms are programmed to sound at 5:58 h, 5:59 h, 6:01 h, or even 6:02 h.
    Prevalently, humans prefer rounder number, i.e., numbers ending in 0 or 5. Also, it has been identified that round
    numbers can act as a goal that influences the behavior of baseball players [1]. Such rounding pattern can be
    associated with a preferential choice that has already been observed in situations such as clustering on round
    numbers in trading in global markets [2], in orders of Israeli IPO auctions [3], on round fractions of stock prices
    [4] and on the income numbers of Indian companies [5]. Nevertheless, this rounding can be originated as an
    approximation performed because the speaker forgot the exact value. Such a case seems to be true for situations that
    happened in the past, such as in simple addition problems [6].</p>
  <p>As technology advances, information becomes more accessible and more broadcasted. As a result, data on events are
    more reported and stored than ever. Examples include a large variety of fields, incorporating animal population data
    [7], [8], data on Twitter for predicting epidemics [9] and data on conflicts available [10]. In particular, studies
    concerning human biological aspects such as comportment [11], [12] and performance enhancement [13] have raised
    great interest in the scientific community in the last years. Among that universe of data already available, there
    is still a need for datasets related to memory and rounding patterns that cover different periods of time, from a
    few minutes up to many years. As a consequence, there are not many empirical studies on that subject.</p>
  <p>Our primary goal in this study was to investigate human behavior by analyzing data of reported sighting events. We
    focused on the reporting dynamics rather than the sighting events per se. The first approach was to identify
    patterns concerning sighting hours reported by observers. Another analysis was to investigate patterns of sighting
    minutes. We also evaluated a reporting lag (time between the sighting and the reporting date) and how the reported
    values were connected to a feature of rounding numbers.</p>

  <h2>Data presentation and methods</h2>
  <p>In this work, we employed data from UFO sightings dating back as far as 1906 up to 2014. The data contain 80,332
    records with details about sighting date, geolocation of the event, sighting duration, UFO shape, standardized date
    and time of the sighting, and the documented date (when the UFO sighting was reported, not to be confused with the
    sighting date). These data are freely available on the Kaggle platform [14] and were curated by The National UFO
    Reporting Center (NUFORC) [15]. We used (...)</p>

  <h2>Profile of data</h2>
  <p>As expected, the number of sightings cases has not increased constantly over time. It has been growing since 1906,
    when the first case in our database was reported, as evident in Fig. 1. The continuous line is the number of
    sighting cases accumulated by year. The straight dotted line was obtained as a fit for the data. It indicates that
    the general growth in the number of reported cases by year follows an exponential behavior with coefficient 0.1077
    year<sup>−1</sup> (95% CI: (0.1049, 0.1104), R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9828) ...</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This study analyzed data from more than 80,000 UFO sighting report cases arousing since the beginning of the last
    century. We searched for patterns in human behavior when reporting events. From Fig. 1 it was identified that new
    reports were sensitive to media broadcasting. It was evident that reported contacts happened mainly out of sunlight
    and that the contrast between daytime and night plays a role in the rank distribution of sighting hours, as
    identified in Fig. 2. In particular, two (...)</p>
