</figure>
<p class="abstract">As the <em>Last Original Roswell Researcher</em>, I shake my head but do not smile when I see UFO
  newbies, media Ignorati and UFO Beliebers and UFO Disclosure nuts have a poregasm over "Art’s Parts," which is FAKE
  "<a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell">Roswell UFO crash</a> debris"</p>
<p>Of the more curious aspects of the alleged Roswell UFO crash of <time>1947</time> are the numerous claims by
  individuals who purport to have either seen or handled the supposed "alien" debris. Without fail their descriptions
  are always the same: metal that looked a lot like tin foil, yet (1) couldn't be torn, cut, or burned; (2) couldn’t be
  bent; (3) would straighten itself out after being crumpled up and couldn’t be permanently creased or dented.</p>
<p>To the Roswell advocates, the consistency of these testimonies is a researcher’s dream come true. However, dreams and
  reality are often two different things entirely. Why is it, for example, that none of the descriptions by any of the
  witnesses ever deviates from that which was originally reported by <span class="people" title="William L. Moore">Moore
  </span> and <span class="people" title="Charles Berlitz">Berlitz</span> in their original <i lang="en">Roswell
    Incident</i> book of <time>1980</time>? Can’t any of these "witnesses" add anything new to the description stockpile
  that already exists?</p>
<p>If a person were to take an object, especially one that was so unlike anything anyone had seen before, and hand it to
  twelve different people for examination, one would expect both a wide variety of descriptions, plus some
  commonalities. On the other hand, if all twelve descriptions were identical almost down to the very words used, as
  numerous court trials have demonstrated, then there would most likely be something wrong. In fact, this would probably
  indicate either collusion among the witnesses or at least some copycatting taking place.</p>
<p>Add to this scenario the fact that these twelve people are free to "beat up" the object by trying to burn, cut, fold,
  dent, and tear it (or any other thing they can think of), and the number of descriptions should increase even further.
  Yet we do not find this perfectly normal, expected result when it comes to the testimonies of the alleged “witnesses”
  who claim to have handled the Roswell alien debris.</p>
<p>More importantly, despite the numerous witnesses who now claim to have seen and handled the "alien" metallic foil,
  none of them appears to have ever kept a piece of this metal as a souvenir if nothing else. This is despite the fact
  that several of these “witnesses” claim that hey knew the metal they were holding was "extraterrestrial" at the time
  they first handled it in <time>1947</time>!</p>
<p>While there are a couple of people, as we discussed in chapter 3, who claim to have “pocketed a piece,” conveniently,
  and suspiciously, none of them has ever managed to produce for scientific examination any of the fragment(s) he claims
  to possess. Until this happens, the testimonies of those who claim to have such samples cannot be considered
  credible.</p>
<p>As the Roswell UFO craze has gained in popularity over the past few years, it was predictable that “anonymous”
  individuals would step forward, claiming to have actual pieces of the alien metal. While such claims must be regarded
  with caution, at least any purported fragments offered by sources (even anonymous ones) can be scientifically tested
  and quantified in a laboratory. If a genuinely verifiable piece of material that proved to be technically beyond what
  could be manufactured on Earth, or at least to not have originated on Earth, were ever revealed, then at last the
  pro-UFO community would have its long sought after "smoking gun" blowing open the Roswell “cover-up” once and for
  all.</p>

  <h2>Art Bell and the “Roswell” Fragment</h2>
  <p><span class="people">Art Bell</span> is a nighttime radio talk show personality who hosts “Coast to Coast” and
    “Dreamland.” Enormously popular, Bell’s syndicated programs are carried by more than 210 stations and heard by
    countless millions of people.</p>
  <p>On <time>1996-04-18</time>, Bell received a letter written by an anonymous individual who claimed to be serving in
    the US military and whose father (later grandfather, perhaps the hoaxer was bad at math) was part of the secret
    “recovery team” at Roswell.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>April 10, 1996</p>
    <p>Dear Mr. Bell,</p>
    <p>I’ve followed your broadcasts over the last year or so, and have been considering whether or not to share with
      you and your listeners some information related to the Roswell UFO crash.</p>
    <p>My grandfather was a member of the Retrieval Team sent to the crash site just after the incident was reported. He
      died in <time>1974</time>, but not before he had sat down with some of us and talked about the incident.</p>
    <p>I am currently serving in the military, and hold a Security Clearance, and do NOT wish to "go public," and risk
      losing my career and commission.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, I would like to briefly tell you what my own grandfather told me about Roswell. In fact, I enclose
      for your safekeeping "samples" that were in the possession of my grandfather until he died, and which I have had
      since his estate was settled. As I understand it, they came from the UFO debris, and were among a large batch
      subsequently sent to Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio from New Mexico.</p>
    <p>My grandfather was able to “appropriate” them, and stated that the metallic samples are “pure extract aluminum.”
      You will note that they appear old and tempered, and they have been placed in tissue paper and in baggies for
      posterity.</p>
    <p>I have had them since <time>1974</time>, and after considerable thought and reflection, give them to you. Feel
      free to share them with any of your friends in the UFO research community.</p>
    <p>I have listened to many people over the years discuss Roswell and the crash events, as reported by many who were
      either there or who heard about it from eyewitnesses.</p>
    <p>The recent Roswell movie was similar to my grandfather’s own account, but a critical clement was left out, and it
      is that clement which I would like to share.</p>
    <p>As my grandad stated, the Team arrived at the crash site just after the AAF/USAF [Army Air Force/United States
      Air Force reported the ground zero location. They found two dead occupants hurled free of the disc.</p>
    <p>A lone surviving occupant was found within the disc, and it was apparent its left leg was broken. There was a
      minimal radiation contamination, and it was quickly dispersed with a water/solvent wash, and soon the occupant was
      dispatched for medical assistance and isolation. The bodies were sent to the Wright-Patterson AF for dispersal.
      The debris was also loaded onto three trucks which finished the on-load just before sunset.</p>
    <p>Grandad was part of the Team that went with the surviving occupant. The occupant communicated via telepathic
      means. It spoke perfect English, and communicated the following:</p>
    <p>The disc was a “probeship“ dispatched from a “launchship“ that was stationed at the dimensional gateway to the
      Terran Solar System thirty-two light years from Terra. They had been conducting operations on Terra for over 100
      years.</p>
    <p>Another group was exploring Mars and lo Tone of the moons of Jupiter]. Each “probeship” carried a crew of three.
      A “launchship” had a crew of (100) one hundred.</p>
    <p>The disc that crashed had collided with a meteor in orbit of Terra and was attempting to compensate its flight
      vector, but because of the collision. the inter-atmospheric propulsion system malfunctioned, and the occupants
      sent out a distress signal to their companions on Mars. The “launchship” commander made the decision to authorize
      an attempted soft-landing on the New Mexican desert. At the same time, the inter-atmospheric propulsion system had
      a massive electrical burnout, and the disc was soon virtually helpless.</p>
    <p>There was another option available to the occupants, but it involved activating the Dimensional power plant
      [sic!] for deep space travel. However, it opens an energy vortex around the disc for 1.500 miles in all
      directions. Activating the Dimensional power plant would have resulted in the annihilation of the states of New
      Mexico, Arizona, California, and portions of Mexico. Possibly even further states would have been affected.</p>
    <p>Thus, the occupants chose to ride the ship down and hope for the best. They literally sacrificed their lives
      rather than destroy the populations within their proximity.</p>
    <p>The Dimensional power plant self-destructed, and the inter-atmospheric propulsion system was also deactivated to
      prevent the technology from falling into the hands of the Terrans. This was done in accordance with their standing
      orders in regard to any compromise with contact experiences.</p>
    <p>Grandad spent a total of twenty-six weeks on the Team that examined and debriefed the lone survivor of the
      Roswell crash. Grandad’s affiliation with the "project" ended when the occupant was to be transported to a
      long-term facility. He was placed onboard a USAF transport aircraft that was to be sent to Washington, D.C.</p>
    <p>It may interest you that three fighter aircraft, dispatched to investigate a distress call from the transport,
      experienced many electrical malfunctioning systems failures as they entered the airspace of the transport’s last
      reported location. No crash or debris of the transport was ever found. The Team was disbanded.</p>
    <p>Well. I realize I have likely shocked you with this bizarre and incredible account, and seeking to remain
      "unknown" likely doesn’t do anything for my credibility eh? And the metal “samples” only will likely add to the
      controversy. [Ellipses in the original.]</p>
    <p>But, I know you will take this with a “grain of salt,” and I don’t blame you, Mr. Bell. I just hope that you can
      understand my reasons and my own desire to maintain my career and commission. I am passing through Southern
      California with an Operational Readiness Mobility Exercise, and will mail this just prior to this exercise,
      possibly from the Charleston are.</p>
    <p>I will listen to your broadcast to receive any acknowledging or confirmation that you have received this
      package.</p>
    <p>This letter and the contents of the package are given to you, with the hope that it helps contribute to
      discussion on the subject of UFO phenomena.</p>
    <p>I agree with <span class="people">Neil Armstrong</span>, a good friend of mine, who dared to say, at the White
      House no less, that there are things “out there,” which boggle the mind and are far beyond our ability to
      comprehend.</p>
    <p>Sign me,</p>
    <p>A Friend</p>

  <h2>Aftermath</h2>
  <p>As expected, when <span class="people">Bell</span> received the “mysterious” letter, he promptly announced it on
    the air with all the excitement and hyperbole for which his show is noted. Much to Bell’s credit, however, he made
    arrangements to have the pieces of metallic debris scientifically analyzed.</p>
  <p>Immediately after Bell’s startling announcement, the Internet and computer-based online services were ‘abuzz’ with
    stories about "Roswell UFO fragments" having finally been found. Expectations ran high, with the UFO faithful
    keeping their collective fingers crossed. Perhaps the Roswell case would he settled once and for all, with
    irrefutable proof having at last been found.</p>
  <p>While the metallic samples were starting to undergo scientific testing, Bell received <strong>a second
    letter</strong> from his ‘mysterious’ source. This second letter, dated April 22, 1996, was also posted on the
    Internet into the public domain and reads as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dear Mr. Bell,</p>
    <p>At great risk, I am writing you in regard to the package sent your way. I had opportunity to listen to a tape
      recording of the radio broadcasts, when I returned home after having participated in the Readiness Mobility
      Exercises.</p>
    <p>My son, a senior in college, recorded them for me.</p>
    <p>I must say that I was somewhat surprised by the negative and close-minded responses directed your way, by some of
      your own listeners.</p>
    <p>You seemed to indicate that receiving the package has vastly upset your life, and in this I would like to say
      that wasn’t my intention, and I offer my apologies.</p>
    <p>Further information regarding the Roswell Crash, and my grandfather’s affiliation, would likely be potentially
      beneficial in your efforts at correlation and verification.</p>
    <p>In this regard, I can only say, based on past conversations on the subject with Grandad, that the Retrieval Team
      consisted of three segments: the On-site Team, the In-House Team, and the Security Team. The credentials of the
      team members weren’t only military related. There were individuals with backgrounds from the University of
      Colorado, Office of Naval Research, AF/USAF and U.S. Army, UCLA and Atomic Energy Commission, and National
      Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, and Office of Scientific Research and Development. Additionally, there were
      consultants from England, France, and Russia involved.</p>
    <p>Grandad stated their own analysis of the sample indicated it as pure extract aluminum, as a conductor for the
      electromagnetic fields created in the propulsion systems. However, critically needed data was “eliminated” by the
      self-destruct mechanisms on the disc vehicle itself. Furthermore, the occupant-survivor of the crash refused to
      disclose technical information, despite a series of interrogative attempts to extract technological data. No means
      could be found to secure the information.</p>
    <p>There were always two Security Team members present at every face-to-face meeting with the survivor. The survivor
      had the ability to deduce thoughts and questions, prior to them being asked. Sometimes it became frustrating.</p>
    <p>The disc itself was literally dissected, and it was discovered that the propulsion system had actually fused
      together the many components. There were control-type devices forged in the shape of the alien hand which were
      assumed to be control and activation surfaces.</p>
    <p>What is today fiber-optic technology was part and parcel of the alien technology within the control panels,
      albeit fused and melted when the self-destruct mechanism was activated.</p>
    <p>There were Westinghouse-affiliated persons on the Team, and Grandad always thought some of them had gone back
      with the knowledge and incorporated it into the future research with the phone systems.</p>
    <p>Of course, he military was concerned as to the ability of the aliens to enter our atmosphere at will, undetected,
      and thusly they recommended to the President that a space program be set into motion, and that a system of
      satellites be placed into orbit by <time>1957</time>, and this satellite system be patched into the DEW Line early
      warning system ... which became later <a href="/org/NORAD.html">NORAD</a>. [Ellipses in the original.]</p>
    <p>Grandad stated that it was his opinion that NORAD was formed not only to track possible ICBMs from hostile
      nations, but as an established detection system for UFO craft. That is why the NASA space agency has been
      “incorporated” by and large with our armed forces, and there are so many “classified” missions.</p>
    <p>This is my opinion, but Grandad prophesied such occurring as far back as <time>1971</time>.</p>
    <p>Well, I am scheduled to travel back to Charleston AFB and then Pope AFB. T’Il mail this from somewhere in (South
      Carolina].</p>
    <p>I’ll not likely communicate again. My wife is concerned, as am I, that the intelligence agencies will put two and
      two together, so it is inadvisable to further communicate this information. I hope you understand my position.</p>
    <p>I could likely face a martial court or sedition charges for stating some of this information and [these]
      opinions.</p>
    <p>You would be surprised at the extent of internal policies on this subject, and the consequences for current
      commissioned officers talking about UFO phenomena.</p>
    <p>I wish you all the best, and will be listening.</p>
    <p>I commend your courage and integrity.</p>
    <p>I hope your listeners understand that the subject of Roswell has great potential at extrapolating the truth on
      UFOs, and what has come to be known as a Cosmic Watergate is only the tip of an iceberg. Grandad said that when
      the truth does come out, humanity will be changed beyond comprehension.</p>
    <p>He also said many on the In-House Team lobbied to release the information to the public. Not all of them were
      paranoid in trusting the public with the truth.</p>
    <p>Sign me, Still</p>
    <p>A friend</p>

  <h2>FRAUD UFO Cattle Mutilation Lady — Linda Molten Howe</h2>
  <p>On <time>1996-05-19</time>, <span class="people">Art Bell</span> featured UFO researcher <span class="people">Linda MoultonHowe</span>,
    whom he had hired to report on the metallurgical and scientific analyses that were being conducted on the mysterious
    pieces of metal that Bell had received. Howe is noted for her study of alleged UFO-related cattle mutilations and
    crop circles. She is also a believer of the infamous Eduard <span class="people">"Billy" Meier</span> hoax in
    Switzerland and has a reputation for not always being entirely objective.</p>
  <p>At the <time>1995</time> MUFON Annual Symposium in <span class="place">Seattle, Washington</span>, Howe approached
    this author [<span class="people">Kal Korff</span>] and had the temerity to chastise me for my research exposing the
    <span class="people">Billy Meier</span> UFO Contactee case as a hoax! Howe accused me of being “closed-minded” and
    admonished me not to dismiss the case entirely. This was the first time I had ever met Howe in person.</p>
  <p>Surprised, I asked Howe if she had ever been to <span class="place">Switzerland</span> or had ever bothered
    conducting any firsthand investigation of her own into the Meier case as I had. Howe admitted that she had not, I
    then asked Howe if she had read my expose book Spaceships of the Pleiades: the <span
      class="people">Billy Meier</span> Story, and she replied that she had not.</p>
  <p>I then asked all Testosticles on Howe and asked her how she could comment on my research when she had not bothered
    reading it?</p>
  <p>Howe, of course, had no answer. I then assured her that while I have never claimed to have disproven all aspects of
    the Meier case (this is impossible for anyone to do), I simply maintain that the so-called evidence offered up by
    Meier and his proponents is either grossly misrepresented or fraudulent. Howe did not know quite how to respond, so
    she advised me to keep an “open mind.”</p>
  <p>While I always do, I found the hypocrisy of her advice extremely ironic, and revealing.</p>
  <p><span class="people">Linda MoultonHowe</span> is also exposed in Volume 5 of the UFOlogy UFOOLogy book series as
    shown here. Howe took the metal specimens and made arrangements for a colleague of hers to test them. Although she
    refused to divulge the scientist’s name, for fear of ridicule she claimed, the results of the tests were released
    nonetheless over a series of broadcasts Howe submitted via tape to Art Bell.</p>

      FAKE “Roswell UFO Crash” debris. This was all exposed back in <time>1996</time>. Real History, matters!

  <p>In short, the electron dispersion spectroscopy revealed that some of the samples were almost pure aluminum. The
    other items, various odd-shaped pieces of metal, consisted of silicon granules (i.c., sand), iron, manganese,
    calcium, bismuth, and zinc.</p>
  <p>Nowhere, among any of the samples Art Bell had received, was there any indication that the items were
    extraterrestrial in nature or had not been manufactured on Earth.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, these alleged “Roswell” metal samples did not behave according to the numerous witnesses who are on
    record as having supposedly handled the material. None of the samples bore any resemblance to the thin, lightweight
    aluminum foil-like metal that <span class="people">Jesse Marcel</span> and others claimed would straighten itself
    right back out after being folded up. Instead, all of the metallic specimens Bell had received were hard, sharp
    pieces of metal (they looked somewhat like pieces of scrap metal actually), some of which were as thick as four
    millimeters.</p>
  <p>In truth, there is no evidence whatsoever to connect the fragments Bell had been sent to the incident at Roswell,
    other than the “anonymous” letter that had accompanied them claiming that they were from the famous 1947 incident.
    If the letter and fragments are genuine, then the Roswell “UFO crash” involved an ordinary man-made object. However,
    given the weight of the evidence we have examined so far, it appears that the letter and *’spaceship fragments” sent
    to Art Bell are simply a hoax. For the Roswell faithful, their hopes and dreams of finally blowing open the case
    were dashed once again.</p>

  <h2>More FAKE “Roswell UFO Crash” Fragments</h2>
  <p>Around the time of the Art Bell hyperbole/disappointment roller-coaster, the Roswell International UFO Museum and
    Research Center, one of three dedicated UFO museums that now exist in the <span class="place">town of Roswell</span>,
    reported that they had received a piece of metal from the famous UFO crash of <time>1947</time> from a man named
    Blake Larsen.</p>
  <p>Shortly after receiving the metal, arrangements were made to test the material scientifically. <span
    class="people">Max Littell</span>, a museum official, summed up the research center’s position by saying “If some
    metallurgist says there is nothing in the book like this [ic., the material is unidentifiable], and he has got all
    his degrees and is an expert source, then we are home free. This is it. “Shortly after the museum’s receipt of the
    metallic specimen, the media began to cover the story that a possible Roswell flying saucer fragment had been
    located.</p>
  <p>Physicist <span class="people">David E. Thomas</span>, who was watching a television news story about the subject,
    immediately contacted <span class="people">Charles B. Moore</span>, a professor emeritus of atmospheric physics at
    the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro. Moore, intrigued by the metal described by Thomas,
    telephoned museum board member Miller Johnson, who accepted Professor Moor’s offer to help scientifically test the
    fragment.</p>
  <p>On <time>1996-03-29</time>, the specimen was studied in a preliminary examination at the Bureau of Mines at New
    Mexico Tech. Chris McKcc, the department manager, conducted the analysis, while no less than Roswell’s chief of
    police, Raymond Mounts, made recordings documenting the event.</p>
  <p>X-ray fluorescence measurements revealed that the metal was approximately 50 percent copper and 50 percent silver
    on what was dubbed the “front side” of the specimen, and 87 percent silver and 12 percent copper on the back side.
    The other 1 percent consisted of various trace elements.</p>
  <p>Once again, not the slightest shred of evidence that the specimen was extraterrestrial in origin had been
    detected.</p>
  <p>The sample also suffered from the same problem as the one turned into Art Bell and analyzed by Howe’s source – it
    was very rigid and did not straighten itself out when folded. In fact, it could not be folded at all, unless quite a
    bit of force was applied, and then it would break!</p>
  <p>While no evidence that the fragment was extraterrestrial had been detected, another test would be needed in order
    to determine its plant of origin. After all, it was either created on Barth or it was not. Since spectrographic
    analyses of various stars and galaxies throughout the universe prove that the same elements that are found on Barth
    exist elsewhere, then isotopic study using mass spectrometry would definitively settle the issue of the fragment’s
    origin once and for all.</p>
  <p>The clement copper, which comprised at least fifty percent of the specimen, was used as a control. While most
    isotopes of copper (Cu) decay relatively quickly, (none are known to be stable: Cu-63 and Cu-65. As physicist David
    Thomas put it “No matter where copper is found on Earth, it always consists of the same percentages of these
    isotopes.</p>
  <p>But heavy elements like copper are forged by a variety of Thermonuclear events in red giants and supernovae [types
    of stars, and thus the ratios of various isotopes will most likely vary from star to star." Isotopes are two or more
    forms of an element having the same number of protons in the nucleus but having a different number of neutrons.</p>
  <p>In other words, the Earth and all its elements have an isotopic fingerprint which can be measured and used as a
    control when examining the alleged Roswell specimen, or any other one. If the isotopic ratios of copper in the
    fragment, for example, deviated significantly from those of other control copper samples from Earth, then the piece
    of metal would definitely be extraterrestrial in origin.</p>
  <p>On <time>1996-08-01</time>, an isotopic analysis on the fragment was conducted at <a href="/org/us/region/nm/lanl">Los
    Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)</a> in New Mexico. The study took two days, and was performed by <span
    class="people">B. Larry Callis</span> of the Chemical Metallurgical Research Division. The examination procedure was
    recorded and photographed by both LANL personnel and Miller Johnson.
  </p>
  <p>At the LAN facility, both the fragment and a second piece which had been turned in were placed inside a mass
    spectrometer and carefully measured. The Cu-63 readings results for both pieces turned out to be 69.174 percent and
    69.120 percent. As a control, a piece or ordinary, refined copper was measured. Its Cu-63 reading measured 69.174
    percent, the scientifically accepted value for Cu-63.10</p>
  <p>Physicist <span class="people">David Thomas</span> summed up the results of the copper readings succinctly by
    noting that “the copper was not found to deviate significantly from Earthly isotopic ratios.”</p>
  <p>Since he other clement present in the sample was silver, it, too, was measured in the mass spectrometer. The
    results revealed that for the silver (Ag-107) isotopic ratios, readings of 48.160 percent and 51.840 percent were
    obtained, well within their earthly norms. In other words, this was conclusive proof that the sample originated from
    this planet, and was not the product of extraterrestrial technology!</p>
  <p>After the test results were complete, they were published by various media. One of the people who heard about them
    was Albuquerque Journal reporter <span class="people">John Fleck</span>, who had seen an article in the newsletter
    New Mexicans for Science and Reason Reports, a publication produced by a group of the same name, of which physicist
    David Thomas is a vice president and communications officer.</p>
  <p>Fleck wrote an article for the Albuquerque Journal on <time>1996-08-13</time>, which was read by artist <span
    class="people">Randy Fullbright</span> in St. George, Utah. <span class="people">Fullbright</span>, it turned out,
    is a jewelry artist and he immediately recognized the alleged Roswell fragment as one of his creations! <span
      class="people">Fullbright</span> had given the piece of metal to the owner of a gallery, and informed him that it
    was pieces of “scraps from his own artwork.**12 The gallery owner then gave it lo Blake Larsen, who at the time was
    in the process of leaving St. George, Utah, and moving to Roswell, New Mexico. The gallery owner had told Larsen
    that the piece of metal was “found near Roswell in 1947” after learning that Larsen was headed there! 13 On <time>1996-09-06</time>,
    the Albuquerque Journal published a front pace exposé of the Roswell fragment saga. The story was written by Fleck
    and titled Artist: Fragment is Bogus.</p>
  <p>While this alleged “saucer fragment” turned out to be a hoax, just like the metallic debris mailed anonymously to
    Art Bell, the Roswell International UFO Muscum and Research Center nonetheless deserves kudos for not only promptly
    analyzing the material, but making sure that the personnel and steps to document all procedures were processed in
