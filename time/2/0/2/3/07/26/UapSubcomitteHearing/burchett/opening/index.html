<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here. I want to thank everybody for making this happen today. And
    I want to remind everybody this is a nonpartisan issue. This has nothing to do with party politics. I think the
    coverup goes a lot deeper than that. I also want to thank my colleagues: representative Anna Paulina Luna, sitting
    beside me here, Jared Moskowitz, my friend across the aisle has an incredible mind, and I'm anxious to hear his
    questions. My buddy Eric Burleson, and it's not in my notes here, but Matt Gates, if it hadn't been for Matt Gates
    myself, him and Luna would still be down at Eglin Air Force Base trying to get some answers. He's got an incredible
    legal mind.</p>
  <p>Also -I know I saw him in the crowd there - <span class="people">George Knapp</span>, my buddy <span
      class="people">Jeremy Corbell</span>. They're not witnesses, but they've provided some statements on this subject.
    And I seek unanimous consent to enter those statements into the record Mr. Chairman.</p>
  <p><b>Grothman</b>: Without objection.</p>
  <p><b>Burchett</b>: Also would like to enter in... I understand now that this is unclassified, and it's public record,
    but as we all know, that's sometimes difficult for the public to get a hold of a report. Defense Intelligence
    Reference Documents advanced space propulsion based on vacuum spacetime metric engineering. Some light reading for
    some of our members.</p>
  <p><b>Grothman</b>: Without objection.</p>
  <p><b>Burchett</b>: Thank you. Mr. <span class="people">Knapp</span> wrote, since <time>1969
  </time>, the position our military has been that UFOs pose no threat to national security and are not worthy of
    further study. I'd say that's the biggest <em>understatement</em> of the decade.</p>
  <p>He also goes on to talk about the dismissive attitude and said odds with what was revealed in documents, reports,
    and internal memos. Mr. <span class="people">Corbell</span> says, as he writes these words, the UFO is emerging as a
    major topic of global importance.</p>
  <p>I can state that as a fact out there, I met a fellow who came in here all the way from Denmark to be here for this
    meeting, so this is huge, this is worldwide. I think we <em>suspect</em> what's going on. But I'd also like to thank
    the members of Congress who have supported our efforts to make this hearing happen. Some have even confided to me
    that they've had UFO sightings of their own. Those members... of course some of them wish to remain anonymous and
    I'll keep it that way.</p>
  <p>But also, finally, I'd like to thank these three brave witnesses here. They took an oath to uphold the Constitution
    of the United States and dad Gamut, they're doing it. And we owe them a debt of gratitude. </p>
  (claps)
  <p>Y'all quit clapping, you're cutting in on my time - just kidding. These folks, they've got nothing to gain from
    this, and I think you're going to find out that they've endured quite a few slings and arrows. We need to remember
    them in our prayers and their families. And I'm thankful them for their honest testimonies. They have done
    interviews and appeared in documentaries like <i>Accidental Truth</i> to get their stories out there. And now they
    are all here to testify under oath for Congress. It's been so difficult to get here today, I said you know, in the
    Baptist Church, we'd say that the devil's in our way and the devil has been in our way. Through this thing. We've
    run into roadblocks from members from the intelligence community, the Pentagon... I proposed legislation to go in
    the FAA reauthorization that just said if an airline pilot has a sighting that when he makes that report to the FAA
    that it would come to Congress. But I was told that the intelligence community did not like that and the bill...
    amendment was not even heard in committee. I think it's time for this country to take back our country. We need to
    tell the folks at the Pentagon they work for us, Dad Gamut, we don't work for them. And that's exactly the point.
  </p>
  <p>This is an issue of government transparency. We can't trust a government that does not trust its people. We're not
    bringing little green men or flying saucers into the hearing - sorry to disappoint about half, y'all. We're just
    going to get to the facts. We're going to uncover the coverup, and I hope this is just the beginning of many more
    hearings and more people coming forward about this. And I yield back the remainder of my time, I think, is it, to
    Representative Luna, Mr. Chairman?</p>
