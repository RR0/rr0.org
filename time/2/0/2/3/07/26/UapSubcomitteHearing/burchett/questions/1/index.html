<blockquote>
  <p class="question">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Garcia. I would like to have you on my legislation to do
    just that on the reporting and we'll get together on that. Maybe you can be my co sponsor on that. That'd be really
    cool. Thank you for those great questions. Mr. Graves, again, I'd like to know, how do you know that these were not
    our aircraft?</p>
  <p class="answer">Some of the behaviors that we saw in a working area, we would see these objects being at 0.0 Mach.
    That's zero air speed over certain pieces of the ground. So what that means just like a river, if you throw a bobber
    in, it's going to float downstream. These objects were staying completely stationary in category four hurricane
    winds. These same objects would then accelerate to supersonic speeds 1.11.2 Mach. And they would do so in very
    erratic and quick behaviors that I don't have an explanation for.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. Have you spoken to commercial and military pilots that have seen these off of our East
    Coast?</p>
  <p class="answer">I have.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. Mr. Faber. I noticed that in the Tic TAC video... - It's tic. TAC like the candy, not
    TikTok, like the Chinese communist app.</p>
  <p class="answer"> That's correct.</p>
  <p class="question">Yes, sir. I just want to make that because my daughter corrected me on that and called me a boomer
    and said, hey, boomer. And I said, no, baby, it's Tic TAC, kike the candy. You're going to have to just look it up.
    But now I would also like to say today is a day of many. First, it's a miracle that we're having this meeting, and
    it's also a miracle that my wife has put up with me for nine years. Today is my anniversary. So I want to tell my
    wife happy anniversary and that I love her very much. As she likes to say, this, nine years have been the best two
    years of her life. Thank you. Mr. <span class="people" title="David Fravor">Fravor</span>, what astonished you the
    most about the flight capabilities of these Tic TACs? Very briefly.</p>
  <p class="answer">The performance, absolute performance.</p>
  <p class="question">You're not aware of any other objects that anybody in the world has in this world that has those
    capabilities?</p>
  <p class="answer"> No, I think it's far beyond, actually, our material science that we currently possess. Are you
    aware of any other reconnaissance platforms that tracked or recorded the Tic TACs maneuvers? Maybe the NORAD system
    or any of the others? I am not.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. Mr. Grusch, thank you for being here, brother. Thank you all very much. Have you faced any
    retaliation or reprisals for any of your testimony or anything on these lines?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Yeah, I have to be careful what I say in detail, because there is an open whistleblower reprisal
    investigation on my behalf, and I don't want to compromise that investigation by providing anything that may help
    provide somebody information. But it was very brutal and very unfortunate. Some of the tactics they used to hurt me,
    both professionally and personally, to be quite frank.</p>
  <p class="question">It's very unfortunate. As they say, when you're over the target, that's when they do the most
    firing action. Do you have any personal knowledge of people who've been harmed or injured in efforts to cover up or
    conceal these extraterrestrial technology?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Yes, personally.</p>
  <p class="question"> Have anyone been murdered that you know of or have heard of?</p>
  <p class="answer"> I guess I have to be careful asking that question. I directed people with that knowledge to the
    appropriate authorities.</p>
  <p class="answer">Maybe if we could get in a confidential area <abbr
      title="Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility">SCIF</abbr>, we could talk about that. But unfortunately, we
    were denied access to the <abbr title="Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility">SCIF</abbr>, and that's very
    unfortunate in this scenario.</p>
  <p class="question"> Mr. Faber, do you believe that you witnessed an additional object under the water in relation to
    your encounter?</p>
  <p class="answer">I will say we did not see an object. There was something there to cause the whitewater, and when we
    turned around, it was gone. So there was something there that obviously moved.</p>
  <p class="question">
    Okay. It was not the same object, though, that you were looking at, correct?</p>
  <p class="answer"> No, we actually joked that the Tic TAC was communicating with something when we came back, because
    the whitewater disappeared. We were, in another instance, were told about the capabilities of a jamming during
    viewing of some of when there were some people chasing some of these objects.</p>
  <p class="question">Did you experience any of that jamming or interrupting your radar or weapon system?</p>
  <p class="answer">My crew that launched after we landed experienced significant jamming to the APG 73 radar, which was
    what we had on board, which is a mechanically scanned, very high end system prior to the APG 79. And yes, it did
    pretty much everything you could do, range, velocity, aspect. And then it spit the lock, and the targeting pod is
    passive. That's what we were able to get the video on.</p>
  <p class="question"> I'm about to run out of time, but are you aware of any of our enemies that have that
    capability?</p>
  <p class="answer">No.</p>
  <p class="question"> Okay. I would also like to note for the record that, like George Knapp breaking Area 51, he's the
    reason I knew about that. And the reason I know about the Tic TACs is Leslie Keane from New York Times article. And
    I would encourage everybody to read that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yield back to you for no time.</p>
