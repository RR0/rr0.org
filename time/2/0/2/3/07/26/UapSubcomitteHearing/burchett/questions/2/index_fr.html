<blockquote>
  <p class="question">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm going to direct this, I believe, to Mr. Grusch, but if any of you all
    feel like you need to jump in, just jump right in. We're good. Has the US. Government become aware of actual
    evidence of extraterrestrial, otherwise unexplained forms of intelligence? And if so, when do you think this first
    occurred?</p>
  <p class="answer"> I like to use the term non-human. I don't like to denote origin. Keeps the aperture open, both
    scientifically, certainly, like I've discussed publicly previously, 1930s.</p>
  <p class="question"> Okay. Can you give me the names and titles of the people with direct firsthand knowledge and
    access to some of this crash retrieval some of these crash retrieval programs and maybe which facilities, military
    bases that the recovered material would be in. And I know a lot of congress talked about we're going to go to <a
        href="/org/us/dod/af/base/Area51">Area 51</a>, and there's nothing there anymore anyway, and we move like a
    glacier as soon as we announce it. I'm sure the moving vans would pull up, but please.</p>
  <p class="answer">I can't discuss that publicly, but I did provide that information both to the intel committees and
    the Inspector General.</p>
  <p class="question">And we could get that in the <abbr
      title="Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility">SCIF</abbr>. If we were allowed to get in a <abbr
      title="Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility">SCIF</abbr> with you, would that be probably what you would
    think?</p>
  <p class="answer">Sure. If you had the appropriate accesses, yeah.</p>
  <p class="question">What special access programs cover this information, and how is it possible that they have evaded
    oversight for so long?</p>
  <p class="answer">I do know the names. Once again, I can't discuss that publicly. And how they've evaded oversight in
    a closed setting, I could tell you the specific tradecraft use.</p>
  <p class="question">All right. When do you think those programs began and who authorized them?</p>
  <p class="answer">I do know a lot of that information, but that's something I can't discuss publicly because
    since...</p>
  <p class="question">All right, if any of you all want to jump in on any of this, you're more than welcome. To what
    level of security clearance is required to fully access these programs?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Well, anybody who has...</p>
  <p class="question">...and I say that because myself, representative Gates, and Representative Luna were basically
    turned away at one point at Eglin. So please go right ahead.</p>
  <p class="answer">Certainly difference between member access and, say, somebody like me, but anybody who has a TSSCI
    clearance and meets the eligibility criteria, the access adjudicative authority should be able to grant you
    access.</p>
  <p class="question"><b>Gaetz</b>: Mr. Burchett, if you'll yield. So just to put a fine point on that: there's nothing
    that you're aware of that's above special access program classification?</p>
  <p class="answer">
    It's a misnomer that there's anything actually above top secret executive order 13 526 delineates the classification
    levels.</p>
  <p class="question"> Right, but I draw a point on that because we can have access to those programs, and so the notion
    that we're not being given that access sort of defies our typical muscle memory here in Congress. Thank you, Mr.
    Birch. I'll yield back to you.</p>
  <p class="question"> Thank you, Mr. Gates. Along those lines, title Ten, you may not know this or not, but title Ten
    and title 50 authorization. They seem to say they're inefficient. So who gets to decide this, in your opinion? In
    the past?</p>
  <p class="answer">The group of career senior executive officials.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. Are they government officials?</p>
  <p class="answer">Both in and out.</p>
  <p class="question">Do what?</p>
  <p class="answer">Both in and out of government. And that's about as far as I got you there.</p>
  <p class="question"> All right, well, that leads to my next question. Which private corporations are directly involved
    in this program? How much taxpayer money has been invested in these programs, to your knowledge? We know we audit
    the Pentagon every year, and I've been here five years. And they failed the Dadgum thing every year. They lose over
    a billion dollars a year, we think, and I've told Department of Defense maybe 60% of their assets are unaccounted
    for, whatever the heck that means in the public sector. You go to jail for that kind of crap. So tell me.</p>
  <p class="answer"> Yeah, I know when I'm a dollar off of my DTS travel voucher, I get hammered.</p>
  <p class="question">
    But seems like it doesn't work the other way if you sell over $600 worth of stuff on ebay now, you get a call from
    the IRS. So, please, what corporations?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Yeah, I don't know these specific metrics towards the end of your question. The specific
    corporations. I did provide to the committees in specific divisions, and I spent eleven and a half hours with both
    intel committees.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. Has there been an active US government disinformation campaign to deny the existence of
    unidentified aerial phenomena? And if so, why?</p>
  <p class="answer">I can't go beyond what I've already exposed publicly about that's.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. I've been told to ask you what that... what that is, and how to get it in the record.</p>
  <p class="question"><b>Luna</b>: What have you stated publicly in your interviews for the Congressional Record?</p>
  <p class="answer"> If you reference my News Nation interview and I talk about a multidecade campaign to disenfranchise
    public interest, basically.</p>
  <p class="question">I apologize, Mr. Chairman. I yield back negative 21 seconds.</p>
