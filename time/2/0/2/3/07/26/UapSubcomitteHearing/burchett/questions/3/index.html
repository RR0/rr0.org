<blockquote>
  <p class="question">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Ogles, for the great questions. Brother. Mr. Grusch, I
    might have asked this before, but I want to make sure. Do you have any personal knowledge of someone who’s possibly
    been injured working on legacy UAP reverse engineering?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Yes.</p>
  <p class="question"> Okay. How were they injured? Is it something like a radioactive type situation or something we
    didn’t understand? I’ve heard people talk about Havana Syndrome type incidences. What was your recollection of
    that?</p>
  <p class="answer">I can’t get into specifics. But you can imagine assessing an unknown? Unknown. There’s a lot of
    potentialities you can’t fully prepare for.</p>
  <p class="question"> How do you think we ought to handle UAP whistleblower complaints like yours in the future? </p>
  <p class="answer"> Yeah, there was some issue with mine. So PPD 19 process, it goes to the intel committees either
    through PPD 19 or ICD 120. There’s not a good way for the intelligence Community Inspector General to provide that
    to other committees. And I asked my information to be sent to the House and Senate Armed Services Committee because
    there are Title X Equities at play, but there was no smooth process to do so.</p>
  <p class="question"> Yeah, it’s a trash can. Are you aware of any individuals that. Are participating in reverse
    engineering programs for non terrestrial craft?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Personally, yes. Do you know any that would be willing to testify if there were protections for
    them?</p>
  <p class="question"> Certainly. Closed door and assurances breaking their NDA. They’re not going to get
    administratively punished for sale. Yeah.</p>
  <p class="question">I yield. Mr. Chair.</p>
