<blockquote>
  <p class="question">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is for all three of y’all, starting with Mr. Grace. Why did you come
    forward on this issue?</p>
  <p class="answer"> I came forward because I felt that my colleagues did not have a way to mitigate this safety threat,
    and I wanted to help them. I was trained as an aviation safety officer by the Navy, and this seemed it just felt
    right. I felt like I had to help the folks that were still flying and dealing with this.</p>
  <p class="question">Mr. Grush?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Purely a sense of duty. I first swore an oath when I was a cadet 18 years ago, and I still uphold
    that, even out of the uniform.</p>
  <p class="question">Commander?</p>
  <p class="answer">I was pestered by a friend and I asked Why? And he said, you’re the one person that they can’t
    discredit and you’ll add credibility to The New York Times article. And so after about six times, I said, okay.</p>
  <p class="question">This town isn’t made, unfortunately, by people like y’all. We thank y’all. And I do want to also
    thank the people in the audience and the people that are watching this that can’t be people all over the world that
    have kept this issue alive. You’ve endured criticism and derogatory remarks, and we’re trying to get to the bottom
    of it. And so God bless you all. Thank you all so much. We really appreciate you guys and gals. (claps) That’s why
    we need term limits. Y’all keep clapping. US politicians just keep talking. Let me ask y’all, how can the public
    contribute to UAP reporting and what avenues you think are available to the public to report these sightings?</p>
  <p class="answer"><b>Graves</b>: Right now, I don’t think there is a lot of public options for every man to be able to
    report on this. I think even for professionals that have sensor data that are seeing these on a regular basis,
    they’re still hesitant to come forward. And so for the general public, I think encouraging the conversations that
    we’re having today, looking for technology solutions that can be distributed so that objective data can be gathered,
    is the first place to go.</p>
  <p class="question">Mr. Grusch?</p>
  <p class="answer">I’ll just touch on the whistleblower side of it. I do encourage current former military,
    intelligence community and industry contractors to come forward in a <em>legal</em> way, either through the IC or
    DoD or whatever the Cognizant. IGS are to join me in this discussion.</p>
  <p class="question"> Commander, and I guess I should say this for the record. My daddy was united states marine corps.
    First marine division. So, yes, sir. He was old school. Him and chesty puller on pellaloo. So thank you, brother.
    Wow. Yes, sir. I’m not anything like my daddy. He was incredible. I’m very mediocre, to say the least, but go
    ahead.</p>
  <p class="answer">You seem to be doing fine for me. I was an accident investigator. So the biggest thing that you
    learned, and I think that witnesses need to do is, one, don’t try and make the fish bigger than it was. Stick to the
    facts. Write it down and don’t speculate what you think it is because it will spoil your decision. Just write the
    facts down. We can get all the facts together and we can start to investigate and get a real honest story instead of
    it was this big.</p>
  <p class="question">Thank you all. And I want to thank everybody. We made a history today. Mr. Chairman, I yield.</p>
