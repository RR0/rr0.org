<blockquote>
  <p class="question">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate you guys coming out today, testifying. Look, I've been here
    for six months, and I'm pretty skeptical. I don't trust anything in this. So and I think that's because I'm from
    Missouri, you've got to show me. Right. With that being said, there's been a lot of things that have been said in
    the public, Mr. <span class="people" title="David Grusch">Grusch</span>, and so I want to get down to, if we can,
    some specifics. Right. So at one point, you had said that there has been harmful activity or aggressive activity.
    Has any of the activity been aggressive, been hostile in your reports?</p>
  <p class="answer"><b>Grusch</b>I know of multiple colleagues of mine that got physically injured. And the activity...
  </p>
  <p class="question">By UAPs or by people within the federal government?</p>
  <p class="answer">Both.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. So there has been activity by alien or non-human technology and or beings that has caused
    harm to humans.</p>
  <p class="answer">I can't get into the specifics in an open environment, but at least the activity that I personally
    witnessed and I have to be very careful here, because they tell you never to acknowledge the aircraft. Right. So
    what I personally witnessed myself and my wife was very disturbing.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. One of my constituents actually sent this next question, and I figured I'd ask it since I
    had the same thought. You've said that US has intact spacecraft. You said that the government has alien bodies or
    alien species. Have you seen the spacecraft?</p>
  <p class="answer">I have to be careful to describe what I've seen firsthand and not in this environment, but I could
    answer that question behind closed doors.</p>
  <p class="question"> And have you seen any of the bodies?</p>
  <p class="answer"> That's something I've not witnessed myself.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. And so with that being said, the other statement that has been made, that was intriguing to
    me... and it's intriguing because my view has been that we are billions of light years away from any other system.
    And the concept that an alien species that's technologically advanced enough to travel billions of light years gets
    here and somehow is incompetent enough to not survive Earth or crashes is something that I find a little bit
    far-fetched. And with that being said, you have mentioned that there's interdimensional potential. Could you expound
    on that?</p>
  <p class="answer">Yeah. To answer your first question, and I'm here as the fact witness and expert, but I will give
    you a theoretical framework, at least to work off, to kind of expose crashes, regardless of your level of sentience.
    Right. Planes crash, cars crash, N, number of sorties, however high, a small percentage are going to end in mission
    failure, if you will, as we say in the Air Force. And then in terms of multi-dimensionality, that kind of thing, the
    framework that I'm familiar with, for example, is something called the Holographic Principle. Both it derives itself
    from general relativity and quantum mechanics. And that is, if you want to imagine a 3D object, such as yourself
    casting a shadow onto a 2D surface, that's the holographic principle. So you can be projected quasi projected from
    higher dimensional space to lower dimensional. It's a scientific trope that you can actually cross, literally, as
    far as I understand. But there's probably guys of PhDs that we could probably argue about that.</p>
  <p class="question">But you have not seen any documentation that that's what's occurring?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Only theoretical framework discussion.</p>
  <p class="question"> Okay. Okay. Occam's Razor is that these aircraft have they been identified that they are being
    produced by domestic military contractors? Is there any evidence that that's what's being recovered?</p>
  <p class="answer">Not to my knowledge. Plus, the recoveries predate a lot of our advanced programs that I previously
    am witting of.</p>
  <p class="question"> Would it be safe to say that there could be a scenario today where you have an aircraft that
    crashes because it's been involved in one program from one federal agency, but the agency that retrieves it is not
    aware of that program, and to them, it appears alien in origin?</p>
  <p class="answer"> I mean, that's a hypothetical situation. I'm not aware of any historical situation that would match
    that you described.</p>
  <p class="question">It has not happened that you're aware of.</p>
  <p class="answer">That I'm aware of.</p>
  <p class="question">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.</p>
