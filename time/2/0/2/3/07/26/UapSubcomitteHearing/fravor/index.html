  <p>Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Congressmen, Congresswoman.</p>
  <p>I want to first thank you for the invitation to speak to the committee on the UAP topic that has been in the news
    for the past six years and seems to be continuing to gain momentum.</p>
  <p>As you know, my name is <span class="people">David Fravor</span>. I'm a retired commander in the United States
    Navy. In 2004, I was a commanding officer of Strike Fighter Squadron 41, the world famous Black Aces.</p>
  <p>We were attached to Carrier Wing Eleven, stationed on board the USS Nimitz, and had begun a two month workup cycle
    off the coast of California.</p>
  <p>On this day, we were scheduled for a two V two aired air training with the USS Princeton as our control. When we
    launched off NIMITS, my wingman was joining up, we were told that the training was going to be suspended and we were
    going to proceed with real world tasking. As we proceeded to the west, the air controller was counting down the
    range to an object that we were going to, and we were unaware of what we were going to see when we arrived. The
    controller had told us that these objects had been observed for over two weeks, coming down from over 80,000ft,
    rapidly descending to 20,000ft, hanging out for hours, and then going straight back up. For those who don't realize,
    above 80,000ft is space. We arrived at the location at approximately 20,000ft in a controller called Merge Plot,
    which means that our radar blip was now in the same resolution cell as the contact. As we looked around, we noticed
    that we saw some whitewater off our right side. It's important to note that the weather on this day was as close to
    perfect as you could ask for off the coast of San Diego: clear skies, light winds, calm seas, no white caps from
    waves; so the white water stood out in a large blue ocean. All four of us, because we were in F 18 F, so we had
    pilots and wizzo in the backseat looked down a small, saw white Tic TAC object with a longitudinal axis pointing
    north south and moving very abruptly over the water like a ping pong ball. There were no rotors, no rotor wash or
    any sign of visible control surfaces like wings. As we started clockwise towards the object, my Wizzo and I decided
    to go down and take a closer look with the other aircraft staying in high cover to observe both us and the Tic
    TAC.</p>
  <p>We proceeded around the circle about 90 degrees from the start of our descent, and the object suddenly shifted its
    longitudinal axis, aligned it with my aircraft and began to climb.</p>
  <p>We continued down another 270 degrees, nose low, where the Tic TAC or we considered 270 degrees, and we went nose
    low to where the Tic TAC would have been. Our altitude at this point was about 15,000ft, and the Tic TAC was about
    12,000. As we pulled nose onto the object, within about a half mile of it, it rapidly accelerated in front of us and
    disappeared. Our wingmen, roughly 8000ft above us, lost contact also. We immediately turned back to see where the
    whitewater was at, and it was gone also. So as you started to turn back towards the east, the controller came up and
    said, sir, you're not going to believe this, but that thing is at your cat point, roughly 60 miles away. In less
    than a minute, you can calculate the speed. We returned to Nimitz, were taking off our gear. We were talking to one
    of my crews that was getting ready to launch. We mentioned it to them, and they went out and luckily got the video
    that you see, that 92nd video. What you don't see is the radar tape that was never released, and we don't know where
    it's at of the active jamming that the object put on an APG 73 radar. And I can get into modes later if you're
    interested.</p>
  <p>What is shocking to us is that the incident was never investigated. None of my crew were ever questioned, tapes
    were never taken, and after a couple of days, it turned into a great story with friends. It wasn't until
    <time>2009</time> till Jay Stratton had contacted me to investigate unbeknownst all. He was part of the ATIP program
    and the Pentagon, led by <span class="people">Lou Elizondo</span>. There was an unofficial official report that came
    out that's now on the Internet. Years later, I was contacted by the other pilot, Alex Dietrich, and asked if I'd
    been contacted, and I said no, but I'm willing to talk.</p>
  <p>I was contacted by Mr. <span class="people">Elizondo</span>, and we talked for a short period of time, and he said
    we'd be in contact. A few weeks after that, I was made aware that Lou had left the Pentagon in protest and joined
    forces with <span class="people">Tom DeLong</span>, <span class="people">Chris Mellon</span>, <span class="people">Steve Justice</span>,
    and others to form <a href="/org/us/company/tts/a">Two the Stars Academy</a>, an organization that pressed the issue
    with leading industry experts and US Government officials. They worked with <span class="people">Leslie Kean</span>,
    who was present today, <span class="people">Ralph Bluenthal</span> and <span class="people">Helene Cooper</span>, to
    publish the articles in <i>The New York Times</i>, <time>2017</time> <i>New York Times</i>, and it removed the
    stigma on the topic of UFOs, which is why we're here today.</p>
  <p>Those articles open the door for the government and public that cannot be closed. It has led to an interest from
    our elected officials who are not focused on little green men, but figuring out where these craft are, where they
    from, the technology they possess, how do they operate. It also led to the Whistleblower Protection Act and the
    NDAA. There are multiple witnesses coming forward to say that have firsthand knowledge, and Mr. <span
        class="people">Grusch</span> just covered that.</p>
  <p>What concerns me is that there's no oversight from our elected officials on anything associated with our government
    processing or working on craft believe not from this world. This issue is not a full public disclosure that could
    undermine national security, but is about ensuring that our system of checks and balances works across all work done
    in the government using taxpayer funds.</p>
  <p>Relative to government programs, even unacknowledged waive programs have some level of oversight by the appropriate
    committee members in the House and Senate. And this work that is said to be occurring from whistleblower testimonies
    should not be exempt.</p>
  <p>In closing, I would like to say that the Tic TAC object we engaged in <time>2004</time> was far superior to
    anything that we had on time, have today or looking to develop in the next 10 years. If we in fact have programs
    that possess this technology and needs to have oversight from those people that the citizens of this great country
    elected in office to represent what is best for the United States and best for the citizens.</p>`
  <p>I thank you for your time.</p>
  <p>Thank you very much.</p>
