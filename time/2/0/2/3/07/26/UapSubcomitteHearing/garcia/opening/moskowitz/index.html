<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you. Ranking Member Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank Tim Burchett and Anna Paulina Luna for
    their leadership in pushing this hearing forward. I want to thank, obviously, committee staff and their staff
    working on this on a bipartisan basis because many Americans are deeply interested in this issue, and it shouldn’t
    take the potential of non-human origin to bring us together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, I want to thank the witnesses for coming forward to share your perspectives, your thoughts, and the
    sightings of UAPs. Unlike other hearings many times in Congress, you’re not here to help a political party, but
    you’re here to share information with the American people. And it’s not something that is just going on in this
    administration.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s something that’s spanned many administrations for decades. Many Americans have been fascinated by objects
    mysterious and unexplained, and it’s long past time that they got some answers. The American public has a right to
    learn about technologies of unknown origins, non-human intelligence, and unexplainable phenomena.
  </p>
  <p>
    Those are not the words of a UFO Twitter account, though that is a direct quote from Majority Leader Chuck Schumer
    that the American public has a right to learn about technologies of unknown origins, non human intelligence, and
    unexplainable phenomena. In an interview with Fox News, recent former director of national intelligence, John
    Radcliffe confirmed the US Government is aware a lot more sightings of UAPs and that they have not made that
    information public. I quote, there are a lot more sightings that have not been made public, radcliffe said to Fox
    News.
  </p>
  <p>
    For me, this hearing is about transparency. We unfortunately live in a time in which many people distrust government
    and our institutions. An overclassification of information away from the American public, or even Congress
    contributes to today’s politics.
  </p>
  <p>
    The American people have regular questions. What are UAPs? How come the media doesn’t report more on them? Are they
    foreign adversaries? Are they us technology? Are they something else? They ask themselves how come when a Russian
    jet shoots flares at one of our drones, we have perfect pictures and videos to show the American people and the
    world. But when it comes to UAPs, nothing. Of course, we must always protect our national security to maintain our
    superiority, like when Stealth helicopters were only rumored to exist, but were used in the Osama bin Laden raid in
    <time>2011</time>.</p>
  <p>But we can’t allow that to be used as a shield to keep the American people completely in the dark. From basic
    truths, the American people deserve to hear more about special access programs. Congress has a right to know if
    there’s any unsanctioned weapons development satellite imagery that has not been provided to Congress.
  </p>
  <p>
    Congress created the All Domain Resolution Office in the NDAA of <time>2022</time>. In its initial analysis, there
    are 171 uncharacterized UAP reports. And this is the words from the report that appear to have demonstrated unusual
    flight characteristics or performance capabilities.</p>
  <p>I believe more information is known about the 171 instances. It’s time for Congress to reinsert ourselves. I call
    on our military leaders and intelligence officials to release more information to the American people about UAPs and
    to our military leaders.</p>
  <p>If there’s nothing to conceal, let Congress go to <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/WPAFB">Wright-Patterson Air Force
    Base</a>, the Dugway Proving Ground, or even Groom Lake in Nevada. We should have disclosure today. We should have
    disclosure tomorrow, the time has come.</p>
  <p>Thank you, ranking member.</p>
