<blockquote>
  <p class="question">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen, let's talk about the laws of physics for a second. Mr. Graves
    and Commander Fravor, I heard you talk about speed. When those objects broke the sound barrier, did they make a
    sonic boom?</p>
  <p class="answer"><b>Fravor</b>: I was in a jet, you can't hear anything; it's kind of loud in there.</p>
  <p class="answer"><b>Graves</b> Yeah, you're not able to actually personally tell within the vehicle. I will say the
    objects that we were seeing, they were spherical and they were observed up the Mach 2, which is a very
    non-aerodynamic shape.</p>
  <p class="question">What about G forces? Let's talk about G forces of those vehicles. Could a human survive those G
    forces with known technology today?</p>
  <p class="answer"><b>Graves</b> No.</p>
  <p class="answer"><b>Fravor</b> No, not for the acceleration rates that we observed.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. What about what they look like? How close did you get? Did you see a seam or a rivet or a
    section? And what I mean is, obviously the jets you're flying have all those things. Did these objects have
    those?</p>
  <p class="answer"><b>Fravor</b> to <b>Graves</b>: Do you want to go ride?</p>
  <p class="answer"><b>Graves</b>: I didn't have the detail to be able to tell that.</p>
  <p class="answer"><b>Fravor</b>: So we got within a half mile of Tic TAC, which people say that's pretty far, but in
    airplanes, that's actually relatively close. No, it was perfectly white, smooth, no windows. Although when we did
    take the original FLIR video that is out there, when you put it on a big screen, it actually had two little objects
    that came out of the bottom of it. But other than that, no windows, no seams, no nothing.</p>
  <p class="question">Mr. <span class="people">Grusch</span>, as a result of your previous government work, have you met
    with people with direct knowledge or have direct knowledge yourself of non-human origin craft?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Yes, I personally interviewed those individuals.</p>
  <p class="question"> Mr. Grusch, as a result of your previous government work, have you met with people with direct
    knowledge or have direct knowledge yourself about ATS advanced technologies that the US. Government has based on
    conventional advanced tech?</p>
  <p class="answer"> I was briefed to the preponderance of the Defense Department's, both space and aerospace
    compartment of programs.</p>
  <p class="question"> Do you have knowledge or do you have reason to believe that there are programs in the advanced
    tech space that are unsanctioned?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Yes, I do.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. And when you say that they're above congressional oversight, what do you mean?</p>
  <p class="answer">Complicated question. So there's some I would call it abuse here. So, congressional oversight of
    conventional special access programs. So I'll use title Ten. So DoD as an example. Right? So Ten. US. Code section
    119 discusses congressional oversight of SAPS, discusses the depth sect's ability to waive congressional reporting.
    However, the Gang of Eight is at least supposed to be notified if a waived or waived bigoted, unacknowledged SAP is
    created. And that's public law...</p>
  <p class="question">I don't want to cut you off, but how does a program like that get funded?</p>
  <p class="answer">I will give you generalities. I can get very specific in a closed session. But misappropriation of
    funds...</p>
  <p class="question">Does that mean that there is money in the budget that is said to go to a program, but it doesn't,
    and it goes to something else?</p>
  <p class="answer">Yes, I have specific knowledge of that.</p>
  <p class="question">Do you think US Corporations are overcharging for certain tech they're selling to the US
    Government and that additional money is going to programs?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Correct. Through something called Irad.</p>
  <p class="question"> Okay, satellite imagery. Let's talk about satellite imagery. We have satellites all over the
    place. Some that we're aware of and many that we're not aware of. Right. We're taking pictures of everything at
    every point in second. Mr. Grusch, are you aware, do you have direct knowledge, or have you talked to people with
    direct knowledge that there are satellite imagery of these events.</p>
  <p class="answer">That was one of my primary tasks at Nga since we process, exploit, and disseminate that kind of
    information. I've seen multiple cases, some of which, to my understanding, and of course, I left Ng in April, so
    that's my information cutoff date. But I personally reviewed both what we call overhead collection and from other
    strategic and tactical platforms that were I could not even explain prosaically. And I have a degree in physics, by
    the way, as well. And I am aware that you guys have not seen these reports, unfortunately, and I don't know why.</p>
  <p class="question"> Do you have direct knowledge? We've spoken people with direct knowledge that this imagery applies
    to crash sites, crash imagery?</p>
  <p class="answer">I can't discuss that in an open session.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. Do you have any information that the US government is involved in a disinformation campaign
    to deny the existence of certain UAPs?</p>
  <p class="answer">I can't go beyond what I've already stated publicly in my News Nation interview because it touches
    other sensitivities.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. I'll yield the balance of my time back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>
