<blockquote>
  <p>The subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena or UAPs will come to order. Welcome, everyone.</p>
  <p>Without objection, the chair may declare a recess at any time. Additionally, without objection, the following
    members are waived onto the subcommittee for the purpose of participating in today’s hearing. Mr. Burchett of
    Tennessee, Ms. Luna of Florida, Mr. Getz of Florida, Mr. Burlison of Missouri, Mrs. Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and
    Mr. Ogles of Tennessee. Without objections, so ordered.</p>
  <p>For today’s subcommittee hearing, both the chair and ranking member will have 10 minutes for opening remarks. We
    may both be giving some of those minutes to other members of our party. I'm now going to recognize myself for 10
    minutes. I’m actually going to try to get out of here in about 4, and then we'll give it to some of my friends over
    here.</p>
  <p>Good morning, and welcome to the most exciting subcommittee in Congress this week, the Subcommittee on National
    Security of the Border and Foreign Affairs for discussion of Unidentified Anomalous phenomenon.</p>
  <p>I’d like to thank the brave military pilots and personnel, such as the witnesses on the panel today, for sharing
    their stories on how they've engaged UAPs, which has brought attention to this matter. Curiosity and speculation
    from all walks of life have generated interest in studying what UAPs are and what threats they may pose. I will say
    that when I was younger in school, I read a book, a <time>1966</time> book called <i>Flying Saucers Serious
      Business</i> and for a while, when I was a little bit younger, I thought it was the most important issue out
    there. The lack of transparency regarding UAPs, which was one of the themes of that book... In any event, it’s led
    interest in studying what UAPs are and what threats they pose. The lack of transparency regarding UAPs has fueled
    wild speculation and debate for decades, eroding public trust in the very institutions that are meant to serve and
    protect them, as is evidenced by the large number of people we have here.</p>
  <p>I also want to point out, in <time>1966</time>, president <span class="people">Gerald Ford</span> claimed to have
    seen a UFO. And in <time>1969</time>, in Georgia, <time>Jimmy
    Carter</time> claimed to have seen the UFO.</p>
  <p>So this has led Congress to establish entities to examine UAPs. The National Defense Authorization Act of <time>2022</time>
    established the <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro"><i>All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office</i>, or ADARO</a>, to
    conduct or to coordinate efforts across the <a href="/org/us/dod">Department of Defense</a> and other federal
    agencies to detect, identify and investigate UAPs. However, AARO’s budget remains classified, prohibiting meaningful
    oversight from Congress. In addition to AARO’s efforts, nassau is leading an independent study on UAPs that will
    identify how UAP data is gathered from both civilian and government entities that can be analyzed to shed light on
    the topic.</p>
  <p>However, despite these offices being established, there lies a pressing demand for government transparency and
    accountability that cannot be overlooked. And that's been a problem that’s been around for 50 years. The Biden
    administration handling of the Chinese spy balloon that violated US Air space is one example how the government is
    not prepared for these. The Biden Administration’s description of events has shown that the government continues not
    to be forthright between the Chinese balloon being shot down and two UAPs subsequently shot down following the
    event. Earlier this year, the US government spent one and a half million dollars in taxpayer dollars on missiles.
    Yet we have seen little clarity from the Biden administration. We must demand transparency from the Department of
    Defense, our intelligent community, and our defense industry on the UAP work. We’re going to ask some questions
    about that today. Congress recognizes the subject of UAPs is multifaceted and requires a careful, data driven
    approach.</p>
  <p>Today we’ll see clarity from these witnesses testimonies, or we'll seek clarity as to what can be done to improve
    reporting for military and civilians and remain committed to objective inquiry. Congress should work to ensure that
    knowledge is not driven by fear.</p>
  <p>Today we are not just debating the existence of UAPs. We are deliberating on the principles that define our
    republic, which is a commitment to transparency and accountability. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses
    today about ways we can improve government efficiency and openness when it comes to UAPs.</p>
  <p>I thank each of you for your presence here today and for your dedication to safeguarding the interests of the
    American people. I look forward to your testimony.</p>
