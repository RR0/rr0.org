<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Chairman, Ranking Members and Congressmen, thank you, I'm happy to be here; this is an important issue and I'm
    grateful for your time.</p>
  <p>My name is <span class="people" title="David Grusch">David Charles Grusch</span>; I was an intelligence officer for
    14 years, both in the <a href="/org/us/dod/af">US Air Force</a>, both active duty Air National Guard and Reserve at
    the rank of major, and most recently, from <time>2021/2025</time>... oh just <time>2023</time> at the <a
        href="/org/us/dod/nga">National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA)</a> at the GS-15 civilian level, which is
    the military equivalent of a full-bird colonel.</p>
  <p>I was my agency's co-lead in unidentified anomalous phenomena and trans-medium object analysis, as well as
    reporting to the <a href="/org/us/dod/navy/uaptf"><i>UAP Task Force</i> (UAPTF)</a>, and eventually, once it was
    established, the <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro"><i>All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office</i> (AARO)</a>. I
    became a whistleblower through a <a
        href="https://www.dodig.mil/Portals/48/Presidential%20Policy%20Directive%2019_update.pdf"><abbr
        title="Presidential Policy Directive">PPD</abbr>-19</a> Urgent Concern filing in <time>2022-05</time> with the
    <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/organizations/icig/icig-who-we-are">Intelligence Community
      Inspector General</a>, following concerning reports from multiple esteemed and credentialed current and former
    military and intelligence community individuals that the US Government is operating with secrecy - above
    congressional oversight - with regards to UAPs.</p>
  <p>My testimony is based on information I've been given by individuals with a longstanding track record of legitimacy
    and service to this country, many of whom also have shared compelling evidence in the form of photography, official
    documentation and classified oral testimony to myself and many my various colleagues.</p>
  <p>I have taken every step I can to corroborate this evidence over a period of 4 years while I was with the <a
      href="/org/us/dod/navy/uaptf"><i lang="en">UAP Task Force</i></a>, and do my due diligence on the individuals
    sharing it, and it is because of these steps that I believe strongly in the importance of bringing this information
    before you. I am driven by a commitment of both to truth and transparency, rooted in our inherent duty to uphold the
    United States Constitution and protect the American people.</p>
  <p>I'm asking Congress to hold our government to this standard and thoroughly investigate these claims. But as I stand
    here under oath now, I am speaking to the facts as I've been told them. In the US Air Force, in my National
    Reconnaissance Office. NRO reservist capacity, I was a member of the UAP Task Force from <time>2019/2021</time>. I
    served at the NRO Operations Center on the Director's briefing staff, which included the coordination of the
    Presidential Daily Brief and supporting variety of contingency operations, which I was the Reserve Intelligence
    Division Chief backup. In <time>2019</time>, the UAP Task Force Director asked me to identify all special access
    programs and controlled access programs, also known as SAPS and CAPS. We needed to satisfy our Congressionally
    mandated mission, and we were direct report at the time to the Dep SEC Deaf. At the time, due to my extensive
    executive level intelligence support duties, I was cleared to literally all relevant compartments and in a position
    of extreme trust both in my military and civilian capacities. I was informed in the course of my official duties of
    a multi decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program, to which I was denied access to those additional
    read ons when I requested it.</p>
  <p>I made the decision based on the data I collected, to report this information to my superiors and multiple
    Inspectors General, and in effect, becoming a whistleblower.</p>
  <p>As you know, I've suffered retaliation for my decision, but I am hopeful that my actions will ultimately lead to a
    positive outcome of increased transparency.</p>
  <p>Thank you, and I'm happy to answer your questions.</p>
