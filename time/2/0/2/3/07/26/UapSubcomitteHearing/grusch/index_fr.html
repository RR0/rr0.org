  <p>M. le président, membres de la Commission et du Congrès, merci, je suis heureux d'être là ; il s'agit d'un sujet
    important et je vous remercie pour votre temps.</p>
  <p>Mon nom est <span class="people">David Charles Grush</span> ; j'ai été officier de renseignement pendant 14 ans,
    pour l'<a href="/org/us/dod/af">US Air Force</a>, both active duty Air National Guard and Reserve at the rank of
    major, and most recently, from <time>2021/2025</time>... oh excuse me <time>2023</time> at the National Geospatial
    Intelligence Agency NGA at the GS 15 civilian level, which is the military equivalent of a full bird. Colonel.</p>
  <p>I was my agency's co lead in unidentified anomalous phenomena and transmedium object analysis, as well as reporting
    to the UAP Task Force (UAPTF). And eventually, once it was established, the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office
    (ADARO). Arrow I became a whistleblower through a PPD 19 Urgent Concern filing in May 2022 with the Intelligence
    Community Inspector General. Following concerning reports from multiple esteemed and credentialed current and former
    military and intelligence community individuals that the US Government is operating with secrecy above congressional
    oversight with regards to UAPs.</p>
  <p>My testimony is based on information I've been given by individuals with a longstanding track record of legitimacy
    and service to this country, many of whom also have shared compelling evidence in the form of photography, official
    documentation and classified oral testimony to myself and many my various colleagues.</p>
  <p>I have taken every step I can to cooperate this evidence over a period of 4 years while I was with the UAP Task
    Force, and do my due diligence on the individual sharing it. This is because of these steps. I believe strongly in
    the importance of bringing this information before you. I am driven by a commitment of both to truth and
    transparency, rooted in our inherent duty to uphold the United States Constitution and protect the American
    people.</p>
  <p>I'm asking Congress to hold our government to this standard and thoroughly investigate these claims. But as I stand
    here under oath now, I am speaking to the facts as I've been told them. In the US Air Force, in my National
    Reconnaissance Office. NRO reservist capacity, I was a member of the UAP Task Force from <time>2019/2021</time>. I
    served at the NRO Operations Center on the Director's briefing staff, which included the coordination of the
    Presidential Daily Brief and supporting variety of contingency operations, which I was the Reserve Intelligence
    Division Chief backup. In <time>2019</time>, the UAP Task Force Director asked me to identify all special access
    programs and controlled access programs, also known as SAPS and CAPS. We needed to satisfy our Congressionally
    mandated mission, and we were direct report at the time to the Dep SEC Deaf. At the time, due to my extensive
    executive level intelligence support duties, I was cleared to literally all relevant compartments and in a position
    of extreme trust both in my military and civilian capacities. I was informed in the course of my official duties of
    a multi decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program, to which I was denied access to those additional
    read ons when I requested it.</p>
  <p>I made the decision based on the data I collected, to report this information to my superiors and multiple
    Inspectors General, and in effect, becoming a whistleblower.</p>
  <p>As you know, I've suffered retaliation for my decision, but I am hopeful that my actions will ultimately lead to a
    positive outcome of increased transparency.</p>
  <p>Thank you, and I'm happy to answer your questions.</p>
