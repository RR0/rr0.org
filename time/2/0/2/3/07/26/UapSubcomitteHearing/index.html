<blockquote>
  <p><b>Burchett</b>: And I yield back the remainder of my time, I think, is it, to Representative Luna, Mr. Chairman?
  </p>
  <p><b>Grothman</b> (chairman): Yeah, we’ll call Ms. Luna for her statement.</p>

  <p><b>Grothman</b> (chairman): Thank you very much. And I’d like to thank you and Mr. Burchett for bringing this topic
    to my attention. Now, we’ll recognize National Security Subcommittee ranking Member Garcia for ten minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="garcia">Déclaration de Garcia</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Grothman</b> (chairman): Right, now, I’d like to introduce our witnesses. Our first witness is Lieutenant <span
      class="people">Ryan
    Graves</span>. He’s the executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace. Lieutenant Graves is also a former US
    Navy F 18 pilot with his own UAP experience.</p>
  <p>The next witness. <span class="people">David Grusch</span> is a former senior intelligence officer with the
    National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and was a senior technical advisor for UAP issues.</p>
  <p>And finally, retired Navy Commander <span class="people">David Fravor</span>, squadron leader, who worked as a
    Naval aviator for 18 years. Mr. Fraver has his own UAP experience, known as the "tic-tac" event.
  </p>
  <p>I look forward to hearing from all three of you today. Pursuant to Committee Rule Nine G, the witnesses will please
    stand and raise their right hands. Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the
    truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.</p>
  <p>Let the record show that all the witnesses answered in the affirmative. You may be seated. We appreciate you all
    being here today and look forward to your testimony. I’ll remind the witnesses that we have read your written
    statements, and they will appear in full in the hearing record. Please try to limit your oral statements to 5 mn. As
    a reminder, please press the button on the microphone in front of you so that it’s on and the members can hear you.
    When you begin to speak, the light in front of you will turn green. After 4 mn, it’ll turn yellow. And the red light
    when that comes on, it tells you your 5 mn have expired.</p>
  <p>I’ll now recognize Mr. Graves for five minutes for your opening statement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you. I’d like to one more time thank Mr. Berchin, Ms. Luna, for bringing this to our attention. It’s a topic
    that has interest me since I was in school. It was a very illuminating hearing. Obviously, I think several of us are
    going to look forward to getting some answers in a more confidential setting. I assume some legislation will come
    out of this...</p>
  <p><b>Burchett</b>: ...</p>
  <p>Sure.</p>
  <p><b>Burchett</b>I apologize, Mr. Chairman. I need to compliment the folks in my office that did a lot of the work on
    this.Rachel and Noah sitting behind me here, they’re very quiet and humble, but without them, this thing would not
    have come off like it did. So I apologize.</p>
  <p>Thank you. I think we’re going to want to look into what we can do to make more of this information public. I think
    there’s certainly a time period after which it should always be made public. And people have been concerned about
    these issues, like I said, since I was in high school.</p>
  <p>But in any event, like to thank everybody who was here sticking through the entire hearing without objection, the
    members will have 5 legislative days to submit materials and to submit additional written questions for the
    witnesses, which will be forward to the witnesses for their response. If there’s no further business without
    objection, the subcommittee stands adjourned.</p>
