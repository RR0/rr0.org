<title>Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs Hearing</title>
<!--#include virtual="/header-end.html" -->
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Grothman</b> (président) : So can’t leave us here’s. It’s the subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous
    phenomena or UAPs will come to order. Welcome, everyone.</p>
  <p>
  <p>Without objection, the chair may declare a recess at any time. Additionally, without objection, the following
    members are waived onto the subcommittee for the purpose of participating in today’s hearing Mr. Burchett of
    Tennessee, Ms. Luna of Florida, mr. Getz of Florida, mr. Burlison of Missouri, Mrs. Ocasio Cortez of New York, and
    Mr. Ogles of Tennessee. Without objections.

    So ordered. For today’s subcommittee hearing, both the chair and ranking member will have ten minutes for opening
    remarks. We may both be giving some of those minutes to other members of our party.

    I’m now going to recognize myself for ten minutes. I’m actually going to try to get out of here in about four, and
    then we’ll give it to some of my friends over here. Good morning, and welcome to the most exciting subcommittee in
    Congress this week, the Subcommittee on National Security of the Border and Foreign Affairs for discussion of
    Unidentified Anomalous phenomenon.

    I’d like to thank the brave military pilots and personnel, such as the witnesses on the panel today, for sharing
    their stories on how they’ve engaged UAPs, which has brought attention to this matter. Curiosity and speculation
    from all walks of life have generated interest in studying what UAPs are and what threats they may pose. I will say
    that when I was younger in school, I read a book, a 1966 book called Flying Saucers Serious Business.

    And for a while, when I was a little bit younger, I thought it was the most important issue out there, the lack of
    transparency regarding UAPs, which was one of the themes of that book. In any event, it’s led interest in studying
    what UAPs are and what threats they pose. The lack of transparency regarding UAPs has fueled wild speculation and
    debate for decades, eroding public trust in the very institutions that are meant to serve and protect them, as is
    evidenced by the large number of people we have here.

    I also want to point out, in 1966, president Gerald Ford claimed to have seen a UFO. And in 1969, in Georgia, Jimmy
    Carter claimed to have seen the UFO. So this has led Congress to establish entities to examine UAPs.

    The National Defense Authorization Act of 2022 established the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or Aaro, to
    conduct or to coordinate efforts across the Department of Defense and other federal agencies to detect, identify and
    investigate UAPs. However, AARO’s budget remains classified, prohibiting meaningful oversight from Congress. In
    addition to AARO’s efforts, nassau is leading an independent study on UAPs that will identify how UAP data is
    gathered from both civilian and government entities that can be analyzed to shed light on the topic.

    However, despite these offices being established, there lies a pressing demand for government transparency and
    accountability that cannot be overlooked. And that’s been a problem that’s been around for 50 years. The Biden
    administration handling of the Chinese spy balloon that violated US.

    Air space is one example how the government is not prepared for these. The Biden Administration’s description of
    events has shown that the government continues not to be forthright between the Chinese balloon being shot down and
    two UAPs subsequently shot down following the event. Earlier this year, the US government spent one and a half
    million dollars in taxpayer dollars on missiles.

    Yet we have seen little clarity from the Biden administration. We must demand transparency from the Department of
    Defense, our intelligent community, and our defense industry on the UAP work. We’re going to ask some questions
    about that today.

    Congress recognizes the subject of UAPs is multifaceted and requires a careful, data driven approach. Today we’ll
    see clarity from these witnesses testimonies or we’ll seek clarity as to what can be done to improve reporting for
    military and civilians and remain committed to objective inquiry. Congress should work to ensure that knowledge is
    not driven by fear.

    Today we are not just obeying the existence of UAPs. We are deliberating on the principles that define our republic,
    which is a commitment to transparency and accountability. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about
    ways we can improve government efficiency and openness when it comes to UAPs.

    I thank each of you for your presence here today and for your dedication to safeguarding the interests of the
    American people. I look forward to your testimony. Now I’m going to turn it over for two and a half or three minutes
    to Representative Birchett from Tennessee.

    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here.

    I want to thank everybody for making this happen today. And I want to remind everybody this is a nonpartisan issue.
    This has nothing to do with party politics.

    I think the COVID up goes a lot deeper than that. I also want to thank my colleagues. Representative Anna Paulina
    Luna, sitting beside me here.

    Jared Moskowitz, my friend across the aisle has an incredible mind, and I’m anxious to hear his questions. My buddy
    Eric Burleson, and it’s not in my notes here, but Matt Gates, if it hadn’t been for Matt Gates myself, him and Luna
    would still be down at Eglin Air Force Base trying to get some answers. He’s got an incredible legal mind also.

    I know I saw it in the crowd there. George Knapp. My budy.

    Jeremy Corbell. They’re not witnesses, but they’ve provided some statements on this subject. And I seek unanimous
    consent to enter those statements into the record.

    Mr. Chairman, without objection, also would like to enter in. I understand now that this is unclassified and it’s
    public record, but as we all know, that’s sometimes difficult for the public to get a hold of a report.

    Defense Intelligence Reference Documents advanced space propulsion based on vacuum spacetime metric engineering.
    Some light reading for some of our members without objection. Thank you.

    Mr. Knapp wrote, since 1969, the position our military has been that UFOs pose no threat to national security and
    are not worthy of further study. I’d say that’s the biggest understatement of the decade.

    He also goes on to talk about the dismissive attitude and said odds with what was revealed in documents, reports,
    and internal memos. Mr. Cabel says, as he writes these words, the UFO is emerging as a major topic of global
    importance.

    I can state that as a fact out there. I met a fellow who came in here all the way from Denmark to be here for this
    meeting. So this is huge.

    This is worldwide. I think we suspect what’s going on. But I’d also like to thank the members of Congress who have
    supported our efforts to make this hearing happen.

    Some have even confided to me that they’ve had UFO sightings of their own. Those members, of course, some of them
    wish to remain anonymous and I’ll keep it that way. But also, finally, I’d like to thank these three brave witnesses
    here.

    They took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and dad Gamut, they’re doing it. And we owe them a
    debt of gratitude. Y’all quit clapping.

    You’re cutting in on my time. Just kidding. These folks, they’ve got nothing to gain from this.

    And I think you’re going to find out that they’ve endured quite a few slings and arrows. We need to remember them in
    our prayers and their families. And I’m thankful them for their honest testimonies.

    They have done interviews and appeared in documentaries like Accidental Truth to get their stories out there. And
    now they are all here to testify under oath for Congress. It’s been so difficult to get here.

    Said, you know, in the Baptist Church, we’d say that the devil’s in our way and the devil has been in our way.
    Through this thing. We’ve run into roadblocks from members from the intelligence community, the Pentagon.

    I proposed legislation to go in the FAA reauthorization that just said if an airline pilot has a sighting that when
    he makes that report to the FAA that it would come to Congress. But I was told that the intelligence community did
    not like that and the amendment was not even heard in committee. I think it’s time for this country to take back our
    country.

    We need to tell the folks at the Pentagon they work for us. Dad Gamut, we don’t work for them. And that’s exactly
    the point.

    This is an issue of government transparency. We can’t trust a government that does not trust its people. We’re not
    bringing little green men or flying saucers into the hearing.

    Sorry to disappoint about half, y’all. We’re just going to get to the facts. We’re going to uncover the COVID up.

    And I hope this is just the beginning of many more hearings and more people coming forward about this. And I yield
    back the remainder of my time, I think, is it, to Representative Luna, Mr. Chairman? Yeah, we’ll call Ms.

    Luna for her statement. The circumstances surrounding UAPs has captivated the intention of the American people for
    decades, ingrained in even the minds of our nation’s leaders, from Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama, hillary Clinton to
    Donald Trump, marco Rubio to Chuck Schumer, john Radcliffe to National Security Council officials. Yet from Roswell,
    New Mexico to the coast of Jacksonville, Florida, the sightings of UAPs have rarely been explained by the people who
    have firsthand accounts of these situations.

    This is largely due to the lack of transparency by our own government and the failure of our elected leaders to make
    good on their promises to release explanations and footage and mountains of overclassified documents that continue
    to be hidden from the American people. This isn’t just how I feel. In fact, the American people largely believe that
    the government has actively covered up the truth about UAPs.

    One poll in particular found that 68% of Americans believe that the government is hiding information about UAPs and
    not being honest about what we know about them. And from my personal experience, I believe the same thing. Another
    poll found that nearly half Americans believe that the federal government is doing a very bad or somewhat bad job of
    dealing with reports of UFO sightings.

    As Representative Burchett just referenced on the FA bill that just went through, you can tell that that’s exactly
    happening. Considering the thousands of testimonies and videos taken on people’s phones and eyewitnesses accounts
    made by credible witnesses such as doctors, pilots, scientists, and active duty service members. It is unacceptable
    to continue to gaslight Americans into thinking that this is not happening or that the potential of intelligent life
    forms exist other than humans.

    Even more alarming is the fact that these eyewitnesses are many of times service members and have no assurance that
    their lives will not be negatively impacted or even harmed by their experiences. In being an active duty service
    member working on an airfield, I’ve had conversations with many pilots where they were in fear of coming forward for
    retribution and or being taken off flight status. How do we know this? Because the government has said nothing to
    assure us otherwise.

    They have also did nothing to calm the concerns of over 20% of Americans who have reported to have seen UFOs or
    UAPs. We are simply told not to question the government and that the government has it under control. Today is the
    first hearing of its kind where we will attempt to get down to the bottom of what is actually happening with UAPs,
    but we will hear from people who have had personal sightings rather than Pentagon bureaucrats who have always been
    sent to Stonewaller Investigations, just so that the press knows and the people know.

    We were even denied access to a classified briefing in a skiff prior to this hearing due to the amount of hoops that
    we had to jump through to grant temporary clearance to witness grush who has knowledge of classified information. It
    is time to have an open minded discussion on this topic, to hear the evidence and understand the magnitude of what
    this means, not just for our nation, but for humanity. Thank you, Chairman.

    I yield back the rest of my time. Thank you very much. And I’d like to thank you and Mr.

    Birchtt for bringing this topic to my attention. Now, we’ll recognize National Security Subcommittee ranking Member
    Garcia for ten minutes. Well, thank you, Mr.

    Chairman. And I want to thank first our witnesses for joining us today. I want to begin by thanking you all for your
    service to our country and for sharing your voices today and your courage to be here as well to Mr.

    Graves. I’m particularly grateful to you to spend some time that we had for you to share with Candor some of your
    experiences. So I appreciate that as well.

    I do want to thank all the members of our subcommittee today and also those that are here and have waved on for
    their incredible interests in this issue, particularly to Congressman Birchtt. I know that your leadership has
    brought us to this place today, and I want to thank you for that as well as everyone else that’s been engaged in
    this work. I also want to thank the oversight staff, who I know has been working very hard to ensure that today’s
    hearing is serious, that it’s transparent, and that it also provides appropriate answers, as our oversight body
    always demands.

    Now, it’s really important that we’re here in a bipartisan way to have this conversation, which really to the heart
    of it is about national security and key to the subcommittee’s core purpose. This is the Subcommittee on National
    Security of the Oversight Committee. Now, our witnesses will testify today that UAPs have posed a serious safety
    threat, and we must understand this more broadly.

    We’re dealing with real questions that get to the heart of our faith in government. Faith in our institutions, as we
    all know, is at an all time low. Partisanship and alternative facts make it too easy to doubt narrative or our
    institutions.

    But this hearing will offer the public unique perspectives, building on years of reporting by both federal agencies
    and the independent media. Now, some of the earliest reporting on this issue was a groundbreaking 2017 New York
    Times report, which revealed research as we know now on unidentified anomalous phenomena of many call UFOs by the
    Defense Intelligence Agency. Mr.

    Graves and Commander Favor’s experiences with UAPs have also been documented by the public, not just by The New York
    Times, but CNN and many other national news outlets. Now, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has
    published public reports documenting UAPs. And on June 9, 2022, NASA announced that the agency is commissioning a
    study to, of course, examine unidentified anomalous phenomena.

    Now, the sheer number of reports, whistleblowers, and stories of unidentified anomalous phenomena should raise real
    questions and warrant investigation and oversight. And that’s why we are here today. Now, pilots have reported
    encounters for years now because of the stigma around reporting these incidents.

    We still don’t have a complete picture of actually what’s going on, particularly as your witnesses will testify on
    the civilian side. And that is a real problem that we have today in the country. Now, it’s very important that we
    show that Democrats and Republicans in Congress can come together in a bipartisan way to cut through misinformation
    and to look at the facts in a serious and thoughtful manner.

    If we are to advance oversight and public disclosure, we must also gain the broad support of the public. We will
    succeed getting facts out to the public faster if there is a broad public support as part of the process. Now, I
    understand fully the Department of Defense is hesitant to share information that could also undermine our national
    security by revealing information on the capabilities of our own aircraft, our sensors, and other sensitive
    material.

    At the same time, many people believe that we’re withholding information from them, and that is dangerous. Also, I
    believe in openness and transparency. That is also the role of Congress, and I want to trust that the American
    people will be able to weigh the evidence and make up their own minds.

    Now, we have incidents where sensors, sometimes even multiple types of sensors, detect things that we cannot
    explain. UAPs, whatever they may be, may pose a serious threat to our military or civilian aircraft, and that must
    be understood. Now, my career in training as a longtime and career educator and teacher and researcher tell me that
    we should never rule anything out.

    We know that our space, of course, is vast and undiscovered. I also want to note that Mr. Sean Kirkpatrick, director
    of the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, the component of the DoD office that investigates UAP data, has
    testified before the Senate this year that his unit has found no evidence of extraterrestrial activity.

    NASA has also stated they don’t have evidence of extraterrestrial life either. And we’ve heard this, of course, from
    some of our government agencies. And we should remind viewers and witnesses, which I think is really important, that
    we also cannot share classified information in public settings.

    But questions, of course, remain that people want to see data and information for themselves. The enormous interest
    in the hearing today underscores the importance of a fair and open look at the evidence from witnesses who can share
    their unique perspectives. Now, I know I certainly have a lot of questions, and I know that all the members of our
    committee do as well.

    We should come to this hearing with an open mind, and we should not let our existing ideas restrict us on either
    side. I hear over and over from many agencies the stigma around reporting and investigating UAPs prevents us from
    getting real answers. We know that whistleblowers have reported harassment, intimidation, or stigma as well.

    And this is not acceptable. If people can’t report incidents which would have national security or safety
    implications, then that also has serious consequences for us. As a ranking member of this subcommittee, I know my
    job would be completely impossible if whistleblowers or others feel intimidated to come before this committee.

    We can’t be afraid of asking questions, and we can’t be afraid of the truth. I’m proud to say that this hearing
    builds upon bipartisan work by members of the House and Senate dating many years back, which has sought to increase
    awareness within the Department of Defense and to mandate more of Congress of UAPs. We know the Senate is taking up
    an amendment to their defense authorization bill, which will create a commission with broad declassification
    authority, and we should all agree that is an important step.

    Members of both parties and senior officials in multiple administrations have taken an interest in this issue, and
    we’re proud to carry and build that confidence in the American people. This hearing will also not be the end of this
    discussion, but a new chapter and start to years and years of work that many folks, both in the public and within
    government, have been working on. We should encourage more reporting, not less on UAPs.

    The more we understand, the safer we will be. We will hear testimony from witnesses today with a long record of
    service to the American people and with subject matter expertise. Our witnesses have a unique opportunity to share
    their perspective, insights and their experiences with the American people.

    And I encourage all of my colleagues to engage with these difficult questions with an open mind and to follow the
    facts on behalf of our country. I also just want to say more broadly that we should look at this hearing and believe
    that everything is on the table as it relates to UAPs. I think an open mind is absolutely the best.

    I want to yield two and a half minutes the remainder of my time to the representative from Florida, Representative
    Moskovic, for an opening statement. He also has been very much engaged in this issue, and I want to thank him for
    his leadership. Congressman.

    Thank you. Ranking Member Garcia. Thank you, Mr.

    Chairman. I want to thank Tim Burchett and Anna Paulina Luna for their leadership in pushing this hearing forward. I
    want to thank, obviously, committee staff and their staff working on this on a bipartisan basis because many
    Americans are deeply interested in this issue, and it shouldn’t take the potential of non human origin to bring us
    together.

    Additionally, I want to thank the witnesses for coming forward to share your perspectives, your thoughts, and the
    sightings of UAPs. Unlike other hearings many times in Congress, you’re not here to help a political party, but
    you’re here to share information with the American people. And it’s not something that is just going on in this
    administration.

    It’s something that’s spanned many administrations for decades. Many Americans have been fascinated by objects
    mysterious and unexplained, and it’s long past time that they got some answers. The American public has a right to
    learn about technologies of unknown origins, non human intelligence, and unexplainable phenomena.

    Those are not the words of a UFO Twitter account, though that is a direct quote from Majority Leader Chuck Schumer
    that the American public has a right to learn about technologies of unknown origins, non human intelligence, and
    unexplainable phenomena. In an interview with Fox News, recent former director of national intelligence, John
    Radcliffe confirmed the US Government is aware a lot more sightings of UAPs and that they have not made that
    information public. I quote, there are a lot more sightings that have not been made public, radcliffe said to Fox
    News.

    For me, this hearing is about transparency. We unfortunately live in a time in which many people distrust government
    and our institutions. An overclassification of information away from the American public, or even Congress
    contributes to today’s politics.

    The American people have regular questions. What are UAPs? How come the media doesn’t report more on them? Are they
    foreign adversaries? Are they us? Technology? Are they something else? They ask themselves how come when a Russian
    jet shoots flares at one of our drones, we have perfect pictures and videos to show the American people and the
    world? But when it comes to UAPs, nothing. Of course, we must always protect our national security to maintain our
    superiority, like when Stealth helicopters were only rumored to exist, but were used in the Osama bin Laden raid in
    2011.

    But we can’t allow that to be used as a shield to keep the American people completely in the dark. From basic
    truths, the American people deserve to hear more about special access programs. Congress has a right to know if
    there’s any unsanctioned weapons development satellite imagery that has not been provided to Congress.

    Congress created the All Domain Resolution Office in the NDAA of 2022. In its initial analysis, there are 171
    uncharacterized UAP reports. And this is the words from the report that appear to have demonstrated unusual flight
    characteristics or performance capabilities.

    I believe more information is known about the 171 instances. It’s time for Congress to reinsert ourselves. I call on
    our military leaders and intelligence officials to release more information to the American people about UAPs and to
    our military leaders.

    If there’s nothing to conceal, let Congress go to write Patterson Air Force Base, the Dugway Proving Ground, or even
    Groom Lake in Nevada. We should have disclosure today. We should have disclosure tomorrow.

    The time has come. Thank you, ranking member. Thank you.

    Mr. Moskowitz and I would yield back now to our chairman. Thank you.

    Right now, I’d like to introduce our witnesses. Our first witness is Lieutenant Ryan Graves. He’s the executive
    director of Americans for Safe Aerospace.

    Lieutenant Graves is also a former US Navy F 18 pilot with his own UAP experience. The next witness. David Grush is
    a former senior intelligence officer with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and was a senior technical
    advisor for UAP issues.

    And finally, retired Navy Commander David Fravor, squadron leader, who worked as a Naval aviator for 18 years. Mr.
    Fraver has his own UAP experience, known as the TikTok Event.

    I look forward to hearing from all three of you today. Pursuant to Committee Rule Nine G, the witnesses will please
    stand and raise their right hands. Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the
    truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Let the record show that all the witnesses
    answered in the affirmative.

    You may be seated. We appreciate you all being here today and look forward to your testimony. I’ll remind the
    witnesses that we have read your written statements, and they will appear in full in the hearing record.

    Please try to limit your oral statements to five minutes. As a reminder, please press the button on the microphone
    in front of you so that it’s on and the members can hear you. When you begin to speak, the light in front of you
    will turn green.

    After four minutes, it’ll turn yellow. And the red light when that comes on, it tells you your five minutes have
    expired. I’ll now recognize Mr.

    Graves for five minutes for your opening statement. Thank you, Chairman Grothman, ranking Member Garcia,
    distinguished members of the House Oversight Subcommittee on National Security. Representatives Burchette and Luna.

    My name is Ryan Fobbs. Graves, and I am a former F 18 pilot with a decade of service in the US. Navy, including two
    deployments in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Inherent Resolve.

    I have experienced advanced UAP firsthand, and I’m here to voice the concerns of more than 30 commercial air crew
    and military veterans who have confided their similar encounters with me. Today, I would like to highlight three
    critical issues that demand our action as we convene here. UAP are in our airspace, but they are grossly
    underreported.

    These sightings are not rare or isolated. They are routine military air crew and commercial pilots. Trained
    observers whose lives depend on accurate identification, are frequently witnessing these phenomenon.

    The stigma attached to UAP is real and powerful, and challenges national security. It silences commercial pilots who
    fear professional repercussions, discourages witnesses, and is only compounded by recent government claims
    questioning the credibility of eyewitness testimony. Parts of our government are aware of more about UAP than they
    let on, but excessive classification practices keep crucial information hidden.

    Since 2021, all UAP videos are classified as secret or above. This level of secrecy not only impedes our
    understanding, but fuels speculation and mistrust. In 2014, I was an F 18 Foxtrot Pilot in the Navy Fighter Attack
    Squadron Eleven the Red Rippers, and I was stationed at Nas, Oceania in Virginia Beach.

    After upgrades were made to our jet’s radar systems, we began detecting unknown objects operating in our airspace at
    first we assumed they were radar errors, but soon we began to correlate the radar tracks with multiple onboard
    sensors, including infrared systems. Eventually, through visual ID, during a training mission in warning area
    Whiskey 72, 10 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach, two F 18 Super Hornets were split by a UAP. The object,
    described as a dark gray or a black cube inside of a clear sphere, came within 50ft of the lead aircraft and was
    estimated to be five to 15ft in diameter.

    The mission commander terminated the flight immediately and returned base. Our squadron submitted a safety report,
    but there was no official acknowledgment of the incident and no further mechanism to report the sightings. Soon
    these encounters became so frequent that air crew would discuss the risk of UAP as part of their regular pre flight
    briefs.

    Recognizing the need for action and answers, I founded Americans for Safe Aerospace. The organization has since
    become a haven for UAP witnesses who were previously unspoken due to the absence of a safe intake process. More than
    30 witnesses have come forward, and almost 5000 Americans have joined us in the fight for
    transparency@safeaerospace.org.

    The majority of witnesses are commercial pilots at majority major airlines. Often they are veterans with decades of
    flying experience. Pilots are reporting UAP at altitudes that appear above them at 40,000ft, potentially in low
    Earth orbit or in the gray zone below the Carmen Line, making inexplainable maneuvers like right hand turns and
    retrograde orbits or J hooks.

    Sometimes these reports are reoccurring with numerous recent sightings north of Hawaii and in the North Atlantic.
    Other veterans are also coming forward to us regarding UAP encounters in our airspace and oceans. The most
    compelling involve observations of UAP by multiple witnesses and sensory systems.

    I believe these accounts are only scratching the surface, and more will share their experiences once it is safe to
    do so. In closing, I recognize the skepticism surrounding this topic. If everyone could see the sensor and video
    data I witnessed, our national conversation would change.

    I urge us to put aside stigma and address the security and safety issue this topic represents. If UAP are foreign
    drones, it is an urgent national security problem. If it is something else, it is an issue for science.

    In either case, unidentified objects are concerned for flight safety. The American people deserve to know what is
    happening in our skies. It is long overdue.

    Thank you, Mr. Greysch. Mr.

    Chairman. Ranking Members and Congressmen. Thank you.

    I’m happy to be here. This is an important issue and I’m grateful for your time. My name is David Charles Grush.

    I was an intelligence officer for 14 years, both in the US. Air Force, both active duty Air National Guard and
    Reserve at the rank of major, and most recently, from 2021 to 2025 or, excuse me, 2023 at the National Geospatial
    Intelligence Agency Nga at the GS 15 civilian level, which is the military equivalent of a full bird. Colonel.

    I was my agency’s co lead in unidentified anomalous phenomena and transmedium object analysis, as well as reporting
    to the UAP Task Force UAPTF. And eventually, once it was established, the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.
    Arrow I became a whistleblower through a PPD 19 Urgent Concern filing in May 2022 with the Intelligence Community
    Inspector General following concerning reports from multiple esteemed and credentialed current and former military
    and intelligence community individuals that the US.

    Government is operating with secrecy above congressional oversight with regards to UAPs. My testimony is based on
    information I’ve been given by individuals with a longstanding track record of legitimacy and service to this
    country, many of whom also have shared compelling evidence in the form of photography, official documentation and
    classified oral testimony to myself and many my various colleagues. I have taken every step I can to cooperate this
    evidence over a period of four years while I was with the UAP Task Force, and do my due diligence on the individual
    sharing it.

    This is because of these steps. I believe strongly in the importance of bringing this information before you. I am
    driven by a commitment of both to truth and transparency, rooted in our inherent duty to uphold the United States
    Constitution and protect the American people.

    I’m asking Congress to hold our government to this standard and thoroughly investigate these claims. But as I stand
    here under oath now, I am speaking to the facts as I’ve been told them in the US. Air Force, in my National
    Reconnaissance Office.

    NRO reservist capacity, I was a member of the UAP Task Force from 2019 to 2021. I served at the NRO Operations
    Center on the Director’s briefing staff, which included the coordination of the Presidential Daily Brief and
    supporting variety of contingency operations, which I was the Reserve Intelligence Division Chief backup. In 2019,
    the UAP Task Force Director asked me to identify all special access programs and controlled access programs, also
    known as SAPS and Caps.

    We needed to satisfy our Congressionally mandated mission, and we were direct report at the time to the Dep SEC Deaf
    at the time. Due to my extensive executive level intelligence support duties, I was cleared to literally all
    relevant compartments and in a position of extreme trust both in my military and civilian capacities. I was informed
    in the course of my official duties of a multi decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program, to which
    I was denied access to those additional read ons when I requested it.

    I made the decision based on the data I collected, to report this information to my superiors and multiple
    Inspectors General, and in effect, becoming a whistleblower. As you know, I’ve suffered retaliation for my decision,
    but I am hopeful that my actions will ultimately lead to a positive outcome of increased transparency. Thank you,
    and I’m happy to answer your questions.

    Thank you, Commander Fravor. Thank you. Thank you, Mr.

    Chairman. Congressmen. Congresswoman, I want to first thank you for the invitation to speak to the committee on the
    UAP topic that has been in the news for the past six years and seems to be continuing to gain momentum.

    As you know, my name is David Fravor. I’m a retired commander in the United States Navy. In 2004, I was a commanding
    officer of Strike Fighter Squadron 41, the world famous Black Aces.

    We were attached to Carrier Wing Eleven, stationed on board the USS Nimitz, and had begun a two month workup cycle
    off the coast of California. On this day, we were scheduled for a two V two aired air training with the USS
    Princeton as our control. When we launched off NIMITS, my wingman was joining up.

    We were told that the training was going to be suspended and we were going to proceed with real world tasking. As we
    proceeded to the west, the air controller was counting down the range to an object that we were going to, and we
    were unaware of what we were going to see. When we arrived, the controller had told us that these objects had been
    observed for over two weeks, coming down from over 80,000ft, rapidly descending to 20,000ft, hanging out for hours,
    and then going straight back up.

    For those who don’t realize, above 80,000ft is space. We arrived at the location at approximately 20,000ft in a
    controller called Merge Plot, which means that our radar blip was now in the same resolution cell as the contact. As
    we looked around, we noticed that we saw some whitewater off our right side.

    It’s important to note that the weather on this day was as close to perfect as you could ask for off the coast of
    San Diego. Clear skies, light winds, calm seas, no white caps from waves. So the white water stood out in a large
    blue ocean, all four of us, because we were in F 18 F, so we had pilots and wizzo in the backseat looked down a
    small, saw white Tic TAC object with a longitudinal axis pointing north south and moving very abruptly over the
    water like a ping pong ball.

    There were no rotors, no rotor wash or any sign of visible control surfaces like wings. As we started clockwise
    towards the object, my Wizzo and I decided to go down and take a closer look with the other aircraft staying in high
    cover to observe both us and the Tic TAC. We proceeded around the circle about 90 degrees from the start of our
    descent, and the object suddenly shifted its longitudinal axis, aligned it with my aircraft and began to climb.

    We continued down another 270 degrees, nose low, where the Tic TAC or we considered 270 degrees, and we went nose
    low to where the Tic TAC would have been. Our altitude at this point was about 15,000ft, and the Tic TAC was about
    12,000. As we pulled nose onto the object, within about a half mile of it, it rapidly accelerated in front of us and
    disappeared.

    Our wingmen, roughly 8000ft above us, lost contact also. We immediately turned back to see where the whitewater was
    at, and it was gone also. So as you started to turn back towards the east, the controller came up and said, sir,
    you’re not going to believe this, but that thing is at your cat point, roughly 60 miles away.

    In less than a minute, you can calculate the speed. We returned to Nimitz, were taking off our gear. We were talking
    to one of my crews that was getting ready to launch.

    We mentioned it to them, and they went out and luckily got the video that you see, that 92nd video. What you don’t
    see is the radar tape that was never released, and we don’t know where it’s at of the active jamming that the object
    put on an APG 73 radar. And I can get into modes later if you’re interested.

    What is shocking to us is that the incident was never investigated. None of my crew were ever questioned, tapes were
    never taken, and after a couple of days, it turned into a great story with friends. It wasn’t until 2009 till Jay
    Stratton had contacted me to investigate unbeknownst all.

    He was part of the ATIP program and the Pentagon, led by Lou Elizondo. There was an unofficial official report that
    came out that’s now on the Internet. Years later, I was contacted by the other pilot, Alex Dietrich, and asked if
    I’d been contacted, and I said no, but I’m willing to talk.

    I was contacted by Mr. Elizondo, and we talked for a short period of time, and he said we’d be in contact. A few
    weeks after that, I was made aware that Lou had left the Pentagon in protest and joined forces with Tom DeLong,
    Chris Mellon, Steve Justice, and others to form Two Stars Academy, an organization that pressed the issue with
    leading industry experts and US.

    Government officials. They worked with Leslie Keane, who was present today, ralph Bluenthal and Helene Cooper, to
    publish the articles in The New York Times, 2017 New York Times, and it removed the stigma on the topic of UFOs,
    which is why we’re here today. Those articles open the door for the government and public that cannot be closed.

    It has led to an interest from our elected officials who are not focused on little green men, but figuring out where
    these craft are, where they from, the technology they possess, how do they operate. It also led to the Whistleblower
    Protection Act and the NDAA. There are multiple witnesses coming forward to say that have firsthand knowledge, and
    Mr.

    Grush just covered that. What concerns me is that there’s no oversight from our elected officials on anything
    associated with our government processing or working on craft believe not from this world. This issue is not a full
    public disclosure that could undermine national security, but is about ensuring that our system of checks and
    balances works across all work done in the government using taxpayer funds relative to government programs.

    Even unacknowledged waive programs have some level of oversight by the appropriate committee members in the House
    and Senate. And this work that is said to be occurring from whistleblower testimonies should not be exempt. In
    closing, I would like to say that the Tic TAC object we engaged in 2004 was far superior to anything that we had on
    time, have today or looking to develop in the next ten years.

    If we in fact have programs that possess this technology and needs to have oversight from those people that the
    citizens of this great country elected in office to represent what is best for the United States and best for the
    citizens. I thank you for your time. Thank you very much.

    Thank you very much. I know it’s very difficult for all of you, all you’ve done in the past, to try to eliminate
    this issue. Calling myself first for some questions.

    I’m going to start with Mr. Graves. Are pilots that you interact with as part of your organization.

    Do you feel adequately trained and briefed on how to handle encounters with UAPs? No. Right now, military witnesses
    to UAP have limited options for reporting UAP, but more concerning is that commercial aviation sector has not
    adapted to the lessons that the military has implemented. The military and Department of Defense has stated that UAP
    represent a critical aviation safety risk.

    We have not seen that same language being used in the commercial markets. They are not acknowledging this risk.
    Okay.

    What steps do you think you have to be taken to improve a pilot’s UAP reporting, be it military or commercial? Right
    now we need a system where pilots can report without fear of losing their jobs. There is a fear that the stigma
    associated with this topic is going to lead to professional repercussions, either through management or perhaps
    through their yearly physical check. So having a secure system, reducing the stigma and making this information
    available through the public is going to reduce the concerns that air crew have.

    Could you just give me a little idea that the degree to which reports in the past are not made public right now?
    Well, I don’t think there has been a proper reporting system to gather those reports and thus not report them. So to
    answer your question, I think there is a dearth of data due to the fact that the reporting has been limited up to
    this time. Could you tell me why you believe it’s kind of to play the devil’s advocate, a reason why some of this
    stuff should not be available to the public? There’s certainly some national security concerns when we use our
    advanced sensors and our tactical jets to be able to identify these objects.

    However, there’s no reason that the objects themselves would be classified. I would be curious to see how the
    security classification guideline actually spells out the different nuances of how this topic is classified from the
    perspective of UAP, not national security. I’ll give you a follow up on that, assuming that there are reasons why
    not all this should be made public.

    This has been around for a long period of time. Can any of the three of you think of any reason why anything related
    to UAPs, say, 15 years and back, should not be immediately made public? I think one of it is acknowledging a
    vulnerability, both from a collection and I’ll just say a countermeasure perspective, not we haven’t cracked for
    many years, even, say 20 years back. Is there any reason why, when you go back that far, things shouldn’t be made
    public unless it shows a specific national security vulnerability as it relates to a weakness in particular
    defenses? Okay.

    Mr. Fraver, the TikTok incident that you were engaged occurred in 2004. What kind of reporting took place after that
    incident? None.

    We had a standard debrief where the backseaters went down to our carrier intel center and briefed what had happened,
    and that was it. No one else talked to us. And I was in the top 20 in the battle group.

    No one came. That captain was aware, admiral was aware. Nothing was done.

    Your commanding officers provide any sort of justification? No, because I was the commanding officer, the squadron.
    So no. Was this incident the only UAP event that you encountered while you were a pilot? Yes, it was.

    Okay. This is for any one of you. Based off of each of your experiences and observations, do you believe UAPs pose a
    potential threat to our national security? Yes.

    And here’s why. The technology that we faced was far superior than anything that we had, and you could put that
    anywhere if you had one. You captured one, you reverse engineered it, you got it to work.

    You’re talking something can go into space, go someplace, drop down in a matter of seconds, do whatever it wants and
    leave, and there’s nothing we can do about it. Nothing. Okay.

    Either. The other you two I would also like to add, from commercial aviation and military aviation perspective, we
    deal with uncertainty in our operating space as a matter of our professional actions. Identifying friend from foe is
    very important to us.

    And so when we have unidentified targets and we continue to ignore those due to a stigma or a fear of what it could
    be, that’s an opening that our adversaries can take advantage of. What steps should be taken to better understand
    and respond to UAP encounters in the interest of national security. There needs to be a location where this
    information is centralized for processing, and there needs to be a two way communication loop so the operators on
    the front end have a feedback and can get best practices on how to process information, what to do and to ensure
    that their reporting is being listened to.

    Right now, there is not a lot of back and forth. Mr. Grush, in your complaint to the intelligence community,
    inspector inspector General, you claim that you believe information is being hidden.

    What kind of information do you think was hidden and do you think it should remain hidden? Yes, I can speak to that
    very briefly in unclassified manner, as the preponderance in my complaint was classified to the intelligence
    communities, both material acquisition and exploitation activity, also baselining the UAPs, but not sharing it with
    intelligence professionals that are actually doing step briefs to pilots, that kind of information. Okay, thank you
    very much. Now we’ll go to Mr.

    Garcia. Thank you again. Thank you all for your service and for testifying.

    I want to just talk about UAPs as it relates to what we’re seeing in pilots interaction with UAPs, particularly Mr.
    Graves. One of the concerns for members of this committee is this idea that pilots there’s no system to actually
    report UAPs and the stigma around pilots.

    And so, just briefly, you mentioned that you’re working with 30 pilots right now that have had encounters with UAPs.
    But you’ve also, I believe, discussed and know of many more pilots. This is just those that you’re currently working
    with.

    Is that correct? Can you expand on that? Certainly. I’ll break that down in two ways. First, when we were first
    experiencing these objects off the Eastern Seaboard in the 2014 to 2015 time period, anyone that had upgraded their
    radar systems were seeing these objects.

    So there was a large number of my colleagues that were detecting these objects off the Eastern Seaboard. They were
    further correlating that information with their other onboard centers. And many of them also had their own
    eyesightings as well of these objects.

    Now, that was our personal firsthand experience at the time. Since then, as I’ve engaged this topic, others have
    reached out to me that shared their experiences both on the military side as well as the commercial aviation side.
    On the military aviation side, veterans that have recently got out have shared their stories and have expressed how
    the objects we were seeing in 2014, 2015 continued all the way to 2019, 2020, and beyond.

    And so it became a generational issue for naval aviators on the Eastern Seaboard. This was something we are briefing
    to new students. This is something that was included in the notice to airmen to ensure that there was no accidents.

    And now with commercial aviators, they are reaching out because they’re having somewhat similar experiences as our
    military brothers and sisters, but they do not have any reporting system that they can send us to. And let me just
    add both to Mr. Fravor as well as Mr.

    Graves not having this system for reporting. Would you both agree that it’s harmful to not just our national
    security interests, but to understand this phenomenon of what’s happening with UAPs? I think it’s a travesty that we
    don’t have a system to correlate this and actually investigate. So if you took the East Coast, there’s coastal
    radars out there that monitor our air defense identification zone.

    So out to 200 miles, they can track these. So when you see them, they could actually go and pull that data and get
    maneuvering. And instead of just having the airplanes, there’s other data sources out there.

    And I’ve talked to other government officials on this. So you need a centrally located repository that these reports
    go to. So if you just stuck it in DoD, you wouldn’t get anything out of the Intelligence Committee because they have
    a tendency to not to talk.

    But if you had a central location where these reports would come in, not just military, but also commercial
    aviation, because there’s a lot of that going on, especially if you talk to anyone that flies from here to Hawai
    over the Pacific, they see OD lights. So I think you need to develop something that allows you a central point to
    collect the data in order to investigate. Mr.

    Graves, I would concur with everything Mr. Fraver said. I’ll continue to say that the commercial pilots that have
    reached out to me through Americans for Safe Aerospace are doing so because they don’t feel there’s another way for
    them to report this safety issue.

    And I think one of the clear outcomes of this hearing already is that there has to be a safe and transparent
    reporting process for pilots, both on the commercial side and the military side, to be able to report UAPs in a way
    that’s also transparent but also understands the scope of our national security interests and what may be classified
    or not. But I think there has to be some sort of system, and so that’s something that I hope can be an outcome that
    this committee can work on. Is there anything else for just for the two of you briefly, beyond this reporting system
    that you think that we can do as a government to encourage and facilitate more civilian reporting? We’re doing it
    right now.

    Okay, great. I think this hearing is going to show the American people that their government takes this topic
    seriously. And how about civilians that may not be pilots? What kind of process could be in place for civilians who
    are not pilots who may have UAP encounters? Do either of you have any suggestions that could facilitate that? My
    recommendations would be to make that a sensor centric operation in order to make it as objective as possible.

    Okay, sir. Mr. Faber? No, I agree with Mr.

    Graves on that. Okay, just briefly, I also just want to note, particularly for the two pilots, I have a question for
    Mr. Grush.

    One of the things that I found fascinating in our discussion, Mr. Graves, last night as well, is that you both
    described UAPs and formations and the way they are observed in space or in our air. And the way that they move is
    essentially ways in which current technology or aircraft that we know of are unable to actually function or move.

    And so will you. Just for the public record, again, once again, just briefly, either describe or note that aircraft
    that are being witnessed, particularly by the 30 folks that you’re working with, are essentially outside the scope
    of anything that we know of today and the technology we have today. Mr.

    Graves? Mr. Favor? Yes. The objects that are being seen by commercial pilots are performing maneuvers that are
    unexplainable due to our current understanding of our technology and our capabilities as a country.

    And that applies for the military as well. Mr. Faber? Yeah, I concur with that.

    We have nothing that can stop in midair and go the other direction, nor do we have anything that can, like in our
    situation, come down from space, hang out for 3 hours and go back up. Thank you. My last question sometimes I know
    you have also said some of these answers in the past.

    We’re trying to get them on the public record as well, which is really important. Mr. Gresh, finally, do you believe
    that our government is in possession of UAPs? Absolutely.

    Based on interviewing over 40 witnesses over four years. And where? I know the exact locations and those locations
    were provided to the Inspector General and some of which to the Intelligence Committees. I actually had the people
    with the first hand knowledge provide a protected disclosure to the Inspector General.

    Thank you. And Mr. Chairman, I would just say that I think that these questions are important questions and I look
    forward to being involved in the process to get those answered.

    I know there’ll be a lot of questions for the committee members, so I yield back. Thank you. We’ll go to Mr.

    Bertrand himself. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

    Thank you, Mr. Garcia. I would like to have you on my legislation to do just that on the reporting and we’ll get
    together on that.

    Maybe you can be my co sponsor on that. That’d be really cool. Thank you for those great questions.

    Mr. Graves, again, I’d like to know, how do you know that these were not our aircraft? Some of the behaviors that we
    saw in a working area, we would see these objects being at 0.0 Mach.

    That’s zero air speed over certain pieces of the ground. So what that means just like a river, if you throw a bobber
    in, it’s going to float downstream. These objects were staying completely stationary in category four hurricane
    winds.

    These same objects would then accelerate to supersonic speeds 1.11.2 Mach. And they would do so in very erratic and
    quick behaviors that I don’t have an explanation for.

    Okay. Have you spoken to commercial and military pilots that have seen these off of our East Coast? I have. Okay.

    Mr. Faber. I noticed that in the Tic TAC video.

    It’s tic. TAC like the candy, not TikTok, like the Chinese communist app. That’s correct.

    Yes, sir. I just want to make that because my daughter corrected me on that and called me a boomer and said, hey,
    boomer. And I said, no, baby, it’s Tic TAC.

    Like the candy. You’re going to have to just look it up. But now I would also like to say today is a day of many.

    First, it’s a miracle that we’re having this meeting, and it’s also a miracle that my wife has put up with me for
    nine years. Today today is my anniversary. So I want to tell my wife happy anniversary and that I love her very
    much.

    As she likes to say, this, nine years have been the best two years of her life. Thank you. Mr.

    Faber, what astonished you the most about the flight capabilities of these Tic TACs? Very briefly, the performance,
    absolute performance. You’re not aware of any other objects that anybody in the world has in this world that has
    those capabilities? No, I think it’s far beyond, actually, our material science that we currently possess. Are you
    aware of any other reconnaissance platforms that tracked or recorded the Tic TACs maneuvers? Maybe the NORAD system
    or any of the others? I am not.

    Okay. Mr. Grush, thank you for being here, brother.

    Thank you all very much. Have you faced any retaliation or reprisals for any of your testimony or anything on these
    lines? Yeah, I have to be careful what I say in detail, because there is an open whistleblower reprisal
    investigation on my behalf, and I don’t want to compromise that investigation by providing anything that may help
    provide somebody information. But it was very brutal and very unfortunate.

    Some of the tactics they used to hurt me, both professionally and personally, to be quite frank. It’s very
    unfortunate. As they say, when you’re over the target, that’s when they do the most firing action.

    Do you have any personal knowledge of people who’ve been harmed or injured in efforts to cover up or conceal these
    extraterrestrial technology? Yes, personally. Have anyone been murdered that you know of or have heard of? I guess I
    have to be careful asking that question. I directed people with that knowledge to the appropriate authorities.

    Maybe if we could get in a confidential area Skiff, we could talk about that. But unfortunately, we were denied
    access to the Skiff, and that’s very unfortunate in this scenario. Mr.

    Faber, do you believe that you witnessed an additional object under the water in relation to your encounter? I will
    say we did not see an object. There was something there to cause the whitewater, and when we turned around, it was
    gone. So there was something there that obviously moved.

    Okay. It was not the same object, though, that you were looking at, correct? No, we actually joked that the Tic TAC
    was communicating with something when we came back, because the whitewater disappeared. We were, in another
    instance, were told about the capabilities of a jamming during viewing of some of when there were some people
    chasing some of these objects.

    Did you experience any of that jamming or interrupting your radar or weapon system? My crew that launched after we
    landed experienced significant jamming to the APG 73 radar, which was what we had on board, which is a mechanically
    scanned, very high end system prior to the APG 79. And yes, it did pretty much everything you could do, range,
    velocity, aspect. And then it spit the lock, and the targeting pod is passive.

    That’s what we were able to get the video on. I’m about to run out of time, but are you aware of any of our enemies
    that have that capability? No. Okay.

    I would also like to note for the record that, like George Knapp breaking Area 51, he’s the reason I knew about
    that. And the reason I know about the Tic TACs is Leslie Keane from New York Times article. And I would encourage
    everybody to read that.

    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yield back to you for no time.

    Very good, Mr. Raskin. Thank you, Mr.

    Chairman. Mr. Graves, you reported UAP encounters during training flights, I think, and have since come forward to
    warn the Pentagon that these encounters may be putting pilots at risk.

    My first question is, you’ve identified these as taking place on the East Coast. Is it just on the East Coast where
    these encounters have been reported? No. Since the events initially occurred, I’ve learned that the objects have
    been detected essentially where all operations, navy operations, are being conducted across the world.

    And that’s from the Altima Anomaly Resolutions office reporting. Can you describe your experience after you decided
    to come forward and go public with your experience? Certainly, like many others in 2017, I saw The New York Times
    article come out as well. And for me, it was special because I recognized the voices on the video.

    I recognized the video itself. I had seen it when it was taken. I’d seen it when it was debriefed.

    And so that was kind of shook me because I realized that this problem was still ongoing. And so I reached out to
    colleagues back on the East Coast and realized that this was still a safety risk that they were dealing with, that
    they had essentially hit a wall with how they could move forward on this conversation. It was at that point when I
    decided to try to move the conversation forward myself.

    Are there common characteristics to the UAPs that have been cited by different pilots? And can you describe what the
    convergence of descriptions is? Certainly we were primarily seeing dark gray or black cubes inside of a clear
    sphere. I’m sorry? Dark gray or black cubes? Yes, inside of a clear sphere where the apex or tips of the cube were
    touching the inside of that sphere. And that was primarily what was being reported when we were able to gain a
    visual tally of these objects that occurred over almost eight years.

    And as. Far as I know, it’s still occurring. So I take it that you’re arguing what we need is real transparency in a
    reporting system so we can get some clarity on what’s going on out there, because there are many pilots in your
    situation, but we should have a way of developing a systematic inventory of all of such encounters, is that right?
    Yes.

    And I think we need both transparency and the reporting. We have the reporting, but we need to make sure that
    information can be promulgated to commercial aviation as well as the rest of the populace. Mr.

    Grush. What about you? What was your experience after you came forward? Well, it’s only been about two months or so,
    so I guess my experience has been overwhelming support from former colleagues of mine that have privately messaged
    me. And I do appreciate that.

    But I do have knowledge of active, planned reprisal activity against myself and other colleagues. And it’s very
    upsetting to me coming from where certain senior leadership at previous agencies I was associated with. And that’s
    all I’ll say publicly, but I can provide more details in a closed environment.

    Okay, well, I hope you understand that there would be bipartisan rejection of any attempt to vilify, demonize or
    engage in other reprisals against our witnesses and people who are telling the truth from their perspective. Yeah,
    there were certain colleagues of mine that were brutally, administratively attacked, and it actually makes me very
    upset as a leader, to see that happen to other coworkers and actually superiors of mine over the last three years.
    How do you account for that response? That seems like a bizarre response.

    I call it administrative terrorism. That’s their quiver, their tool in the toolbox to silence people, especially the
    career government service cares about their career, cares about their clearance, their reputation to climb the
    ladder. And when you threaten that flow career path, a lot of people back off.

    But I’m here to represent those people. Mr. Fravor.

    What about you? What has your experience been since you’ve come forward with your perspective on this? Actually,
    I’ve been treated very well, and the six people that were involved, myself included, all of them have or will be
    retiring from the military as five s or six s. And all my friends that are very senior, three and four stars, I’ve
    talked to them. They believe they understand there’s a problem.

    But no, I was actually treated really well. And what is your general interpretation of these phenomena? What is your
    current thinking of trying to make sense of them? Well, I’ll say I’m not like a UFO fanatic. It’s not me.

    But I will tell you that what we saw with four sets of eyes over a five minute period, still there’s nothing. We
    have nothing close to it. It was amazing to see.

    I told my budy I wanted to fly it, but it’s just an incredible technology. All right, Mr. Chairman, thank you very
    much, I’ll yield back to you.

    Thanks. And Ms. Luna.

    Mr. Grush, in speaking to you yesterday, I just wanted to follow up on Representative Raskin’s questions. In the
    last couple of years, have you had incidences that have caused you to be in fear for your life for addressing these
    issues? Yes.

    Personally, I just want everyone to note that he’s coming forward in fear of his life. To put in perspective, if
    they were really not scared about this information coming out, why would someone be intimidated like that? To your
    knowledge, are NHIS working with adversarial foreign governments in either technology exchange programs or back
    engineering programs? I don’t have data on that. I’m not sure.

    Have you heard or you had people come forward to present that evidence? Not that particular evidence that you just
    espoused. Okay. On the 19 April, dr.

    Kirkpatrick, head of Arrow, had said that he did not find any evidence of UAPs. You also stated that you had in your
    interview that you had briefed him on information that you were uncovering, but that he did not follow up with you.
    Were the items that you divulged to him pertain to national security? Yes.

    Him and I had a classified conversation in April 2022 before he took over Arrow in July 2022. And I provided him
    some concerns I had. Do you know why he might not have followed up with you? Unfortunately, I cannot read his mind.

    I wish he did. I was happy to give Sage counsel to him on where to look when he took the helm of Arrow. Okay.

    And then my last question for you before I move to Mr. Graves is you received prior approval from the Defense
    Department to speak on certain issues, correct? Correct. Through Dopser, DoD pre publication and security review.

    And I just want to remind the public they’re just looking from a security perspective. These are my own personal
    views and opinions, not the departments. Okay.

    I’m asking that, though, mainly because I think that there are many people that would like to discredit you. So it
    does bring a certain amount of credibility to your testimony. I’m required by law to do that as a former
    intelligence officer, or I go to jail for revealing classified information.

    Yeah, we don’t want you to go to jail. My next question would actually be for Mr. Graves.

    Can you please explain to me in detail the event that occurred at Vandenberg Air Force Base? Certainly. In the 2003
    time frame. A large group of Boeing contractors were operating near one of the launch facilities at Vandenberg Air
    Force Base when they observed a very large, 100 yard sided red square approach the base from the ocean and hover at
    low altitude over one of the launch facilities.

    This object remained for about 45 seconds or so before darting off over the mountains. There was a similar event
    within 24 hours later in the evening. This was a morning event, I believe 845 in the morning.

    Later in the evening, post sunset, there were reports of other sightings on base, including some aggressive
    behaviors. These objects were approaching some of the security guards at rapid speeds before darting off. And this
    is information that was received through one of the witnesses that have approached me at Americans for Safe
    Aerospace.

    Was this documented in any official form, whether it was a police blotter? Yes, they had official documentation and
    records from the event that the witness held over the years. And I’m not going to ask you to do it right now for
    time reasons, but you’d be able to sketch what was witnessed? Correct. And have you seen that before on any other
    equipment and or during your flight time? I have not seen what they have described.

    This object was estimated to be almost a size of a football field, and I have not seen anything personally that
    large. Okay. And then another question on follow up referencing the Gimbal video go Fast incident, can you just
    clarify? Because to our understanding, the footage was actually cut off at a certain point.

    But what happens at the end of that video just for those Americans specifically that are wanting to know about the
    rest of that footage? Certainly there was some uncertainty or instability with the object. It seemed to rock a bit,
    and that’s the last I had seen of the video. Much of the data that I would recommend be analyzed would consist of
    radar data that would provide precise kinematics on the object as well as the fleet of objects that were operating
    nearby.

    Okay. And follow up in regards to the reporting procedures that Mr. Garcia had addressed on, as well as
    Representative Burchett with the FAA.

    To your understanding, pilots that are seeing this, commercial airline pilots, are they receiving cease and desist
    letters from corporations for coming forward with information in regards to safety for potential airline passengers?
    I have been made privy to conversations with commercial aviators who have received cease and desist orders. So the
    American public should know that corporations are putting their own reputations on the basic, not the line, but
    ahead of the safety of the American people. And I think would you agree with that statement? I guess this would be
    my last.

    I’m out of time. I yield. I’ll be back.

    Good. Mr. Moskowitz.

    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen, let’s talk about the laws of physics for a second.

    Mr. Graves and Commander Favor, I heard you talk about speed. When those objects broke the sound barrier, did they
    make a sonic boom that was in a jet? You can’t hear anything.

    It’s kind of loud in there. Yeah, you’re not able to actually personally tell within the vehicle. I will say the
    objects that we were seeing, they were spherical and they were observed up the Mach Two, which is a very non
    aerodynamic shape.

    What about G forces? Let’s talk about G forces of those vehicles. Could a human survive those G forces with known
    technology today? No, not for the acceleration rates that we observed. Okay.

    What about what they look like? How close did you get? Did you see a seam or a rivet or a section? And what I mean
    is, obviously the jets you’re flying have all those things. Did these objects have those? Do you want to go ride? I
    didn’t have the detail to be able to tell that. So we got within a half mile of Tic TAC, which people say that’s
    pretty far, but in airplanes, that’s actually relatively close.

    No, it was perfectly white, smooth, no windows. Although when we did take the original FLIR video that is out there,
    when you put it on a big screen, it actually had two little objects that came out of the bottom of it. But other
    than that, no windows, no seams, no nothing.

    Mr. Grush, as a result of your previous government work, have you met with people with direct knowledge or have
    direct knowledge yourself of non human origin craft? Yes, I personally interviewed those individuals. Mr.

    Grush, as a result of your previous government work, have you met with people with direct knowledge or have direct
    knowledge yourself about ATS advanced technologies that the US. Government has based on conventional advanced tech?
    I was briefed to the preponderance of the Defense Department’s, both space and aerospace compartment of programs. Do
    you have knowledge or do you have reason to believe that there are programs in the advanced tech space that are
    unsanctioned? Yes, I do.

    Okay. And when you say that they’re above congressional oversight, what do you mean? Complicated question. So
    there’s some I would call it abuse here.

    So, congressional oversight of conventional special access programs. So I’ll use title Ten. So DoD as an example.

    Right? So Ten. US. Code section 119 discusses congressional oversight of SAPS, discusses the depth sect’s ability to
    waive congressional reporting.

    However, the Gang of Eight is at least supposed to be notified if a waived or waived bigoted, unacknowledged SAP is
    created. And that’s public mean, I don’t want to cut you off, but how does a program like that get funded? I will
    give you generalities. I can get very specific in a closed session.

    But misappropriation of funds, does that mean that there is money in the budget that is said to go to a program, but
    it doesn’t, and it goes to something else? Yes, I have specific knowledge of that. Do you think us? Corporations are
    overcharging for certain tech they’re selling to the US. Government and that additional money is going to programs?
    Correct.

    Through something called Irad. Okay, satellite imagery. Let’s talk about satellite imagery.

    We have satellites all over the place. Some that we’re aware of and many that we’re not aware of. Right.

    We’re taking pictures of everything at every point in second. Mr. Grush, are you aware, do you have direct
    knowledge, or have you talked to people with direct knowledge that there are satellite imagery of these events.

    That was one of my primary tasks at Nga since we process, exploit, and disseminate that kind of information. I’ve
    seen multiple cases, some of which, to my understanding, and of course, I left Ng in April, so that’s my information
    cutoff date. But I personally reviewed both what we call overhead collection and from other strategic and tactical
    platforms that were I could not even explain prosaically.

    And I have a degree in physics, by the way, as well. And I am aware that you guys have not seen these reports,
    unfortunately, and I don’t know why. Do you have direct knowledge? We’ve spoken people with direct knowledge that
    this imagery applies to crash sites.

    Crash imagery? I can’t discuss that in an open session. Okay. Do you have any information that the US government is
    involved in a disinformation campaign to deny the existence of certain UAPs? I can’t go beyond what I’ve already
    stated publicly in my News Nation interview because it touches other sensitivities.

    Okay. I’ll yield the balance of my time back. Thank you, Mr.

    Chairman. Ms. Fox.

    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank our witnesses for being here today.

    Mr. Garush, in your sworn testimony, you state that the United States government has retrieved supposedly
    extraterrestrial spacecraft and other UAP related artifacts. You go so far as to state that the US is in possession
    of, quote, non human spacecraft, end quote, and that some of these artifacts have circulated with defense
    contractors.

    Several other former military and intelligence officials have come forward with similar allegations, albeit and non
    public settings. However, Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, the director of Aaro, previously testified before Congress that
    there has been, and I quote, no credible evidence thus far of extraterrestrial activity or of, quote, off world
    technology brought to the attention of the office.

    To your knowledge, is that statement correct? It’s not accurate. I believe Dr. Kopatrick mentioned he had about 30
    individuals that have come to Arrow thus far.

    A few of those individuals have also come to Arrow that I also interviewed, and I know what they provided Dr.
    Kapatrick and their team. Okay.

    I was able to evaluate information I need to go on. Sure. But my understanding that his statement is accurate came
    from a direct quote.

    And this contradiction is a perfect example of why we need to inject transparency into our government. And for
    another example, look no further than the pitiful response to the Chinese spy balloon debacle earlier this year. You
    may remember the mass confusion that ensued when the balloon was first spotted over Montana, four days after it
    first entered US airspace over Alaska.

    The Biden administration’s initial inability to address the object grew into a continuous series of embarrassments.
    After news of the balloon reached the mainstream media, we were assured that the balloon posed no threat to our
    security. However, after the balloon was allowed to transit the entire continental United states, fighter jets were
    scrambled off the coast of South Carolina to shoot it down.

    This flip flopping and obfuscation caused needless confusion, fear and panic across the country. It’s my hope, Mr.
    Chairman, that this sort of confusion will not be repeated.

    We should investigate the extent to which elements of our government possess or do not possess information that is
    of critical value to the American people. We owe it to the citizens of this nation to make sure that our government
    is transparent and accountable. We must make sure that our government provides answers, and Congress must do its
    duty to solicit those answers.

    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Yeah.

    Mr. Frost. Thank you, Mr.

    Chairman. In 2022, NASA announced that it was commissioning an independent study team to examine UAPs. The NASA team
    is comprised of scientists across different fields, as well as former astronauts and pilots.

    In May, the independent study team held that its first public meeting, which included the perspectives from NASA
    senior leaders, as well as perspectives from the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies. The NASA study
    team is also expected to release its first report pretty soon, and I think it’s safe to say that we all eagerly
    await its results. Mr.

    Graves, how might NASA’s research influence the commercial industry regarding safety in UAP? I think NASA has a big
    role to play as far as commercial aviation safety, and it’s one of their original charges as an organization. One of
    the recommendations that have been put forward is to utilize their existing aviation Safety Reporting System to
    serve as a short term fill and trusted platform for pilots that want to report on UAP. It also has built in
    analytics capability and is funded by Congress.

    Gotcha. And also, Mr. Graves, are there any other industries that may be influenced by the NASA research on the
    UAPs? And if so, how so? Well, I think there is a large swath of commercial capabilities that could be brought to
    bear on this topic from space based or ground based sensor systems that are available, open source or through
    commercial marketplaces.

    And I think NASA’s work as they work to identify and highlight specific parameters that can be found. We can take
    that information and promulgate this through the public sector so that we can have a more open conversation about
    what we’re seeing. In 2020, the Department of Defense released several videos of UAPs, including Mr.

    Frayer’s experience us. Navy pilots that recorded footage. In 2021, the Office of the Director of National
    Intelligence released a preliminary report on UAP events.

    NASA Administrator Bill Nelson stated that NASA would begin to investigate these events. In fact, I sit on Science,
    Space and Technology Committee, and when we were doing a hearing with the NASA administrator, Bill Nelson, I asked
    why NASA needed to be fully funded. And there were many great reasons, but one of them actually had to do with UAPs.

    He actually know, is there life out there, I don’t know. And so either way, these actions ultimately led NASA to
    assemble the independent study team that I mentioned earlier. Also, in 2021, Harvard University stood up the Galileo
    Project to research and examine the origins of UAP.

    So it seems like both from NASA and in the higher education community, because of the work that y’all have done and
    people standing know, I think we’re seeing some of that stigma slowly going away. Mr. Freyer, do you believe that
    military pilots feeling empowered to share their UAP experiences has directly impacted the scientific community’s
    research goals? On this topic, I would say yes.

    I would say that starting in 2017, when it actually came out, it took that stigma away. I’ve talked to multiple
    senators who said, prior to that, if you’d have mentioned UAP, you’d have been laughed off the hill. And now we’re
    sitting here today for a public testimony on what’s actually going on.

    I’m hoping that this curve will be more of an exponential and we’ll get more and more transparent to the level that
    we can. Yeah, it’s important. I couldn’t imagine I’m not a pilot, but I used to fly gliders in civil air patrol.

    Yeah, pilot. And so either way, I couldn’t imagine being in the glider and seeing something and then not feeling
    like I had the agency to talk about it. Mr.

    Graves, can you discuss the importance of seeking scientists to sit on your advisory board? Absolutely. I think
    ultimately, this is going to be a scientific problem. And not only that, it’s also an engineering problem.

    I’ve been working with American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics to help them stand up a UAP integration
    Committee to help integrate their engineering prowess into this problem. And so, yes, very much. I think this is an
    engineering and scientific problem as much as a national security problem.

    And how might Congress help to facilitate partnerships between the scientific community and the UAP focused groups
    within government? Well, I think one of the things they can do is to have these types of hearings to communicate to
    the public that this is a topic of interest. I think that there is a pseudo market, if you will, of interested
    capabilities and talent that want to approach this topic. And we’re seeing that start to grow now.

    So I think continued conversation reduction of stigma is going to allow that to flourish and allow answers to help
    generate themselves 100%. Well, thank you all for being here, and thank you for your work. I think it’s important
    that we keep our top scientific minds focused on this issue and look for ways to increase collaboration.

    Thank you so much. I yield back. Mr.

    Comer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

    Let me say I want to thank you for having this hearing, and I want to thank Mr. Burcht, Ms. Luna, for leading this
    hearing.

    And with that, I yield my five minutes to Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr.

    Chairman. I’m going to direct this, I believe, to Mr. Grush, but if any of you all feel like you need to jump in,
    just jump right in.

    We’re good. Has the US. Government become aware of actual evidence of extraterrestrial, otherwise unexplained forms
    of intelligence? And if so, when do you think this first occurred? I like to use the term non human.

    I don’t like to denote origin. Keeps the aperture open, both scientifically, certainly, like I’ve discussed publicly
    previously, 1930s. Okay.

    Can you give me the names and titles of the people with direct firsthand knowledge and access to some of this crash
    retrieval some of these crash retrieval programs and maybe which facilities, military bases that the recovered
    material would be in. And I know a lot of congress talked about we’re going to go to Area 51, and there’s nothing
    there anymore anyway, and we move like a glacier as soon as we announce it. I’m sure the moving vans would pull up,
    but please.

    I can’t discuss that publicly, but I did provide that information both to the intel committees and the Inspector
    General, and we could get that in the skiff. If we were allowed to get in a skiff with you, would that be probably
    what you would think? Sure. If you had the appropriate accesses, yeah.

    What special access programs cover this information, and how is it possible that they have evaded oversight for so
    long? I do know the names. Once again, I can’t discuss that publicly. And how they’ve evaded oversight in a closed
    setting? I could tell you the specific tradecraft use.

    All right, when do you think those programs began and who authorized them? I do know a lot of that information, but
    that’s something I can’t discuss publicly because since all right, if any of you all want to jump in on any of this,
    you’re more than welcome. To what level of security clearance is required to fully access these programs? Well,
    anybody who has, and I say that because myself, representative Gates, and Representative Luna were basically turned
    away at one point at Eglin. So please go right ahead.

    Certainly difference between member access and, say, somebody like me, but anybody who has a TSSCI clearance and
    meets the eligibility criteria, the access adjudicative authority should be able to grant you access, ms. Bertrand,
    if you’ll yield. So just to put a fine point on that, there’s nothing that you’re aware of that’s above special
    access program classification.

    It’s a misnomer that there’s anything actually above top secret executive order 13 526 delineates the classification
    levels. Right, but I draw a point on that because we can have access to those programs, and so the notion that we’re
    not being given that access sort of defies our typical muscle memory here in Congress. Thank you, Mr.

    Birch. I’ll yield back to you. Thank you, Mr.

    Gates. Along those lines, title Ten, you may not know this or not, but title Ten and title 50 authorization. They
    seem to say they’re inefficient.

    So who gets to decide this, in your opinion? In the past? The group of career senior executive officials. Okay. Are
    they government officials? Both in and out.

    Do what? Both in and out of government. And that’s about as far as I got you there. All right, well, that leads to
    my next question.

    Which private corporations are directly involved in this program? How much taxpayer money has been invested in these
    programs, to your knowledge? We know we audit the Pentagon every year, and I’ve been here five years. And they
    failed the Dadgum thing every year. They lose over a billion dollars a year, we think, and I’ve told Department of
    Defense maybe 60% of their assets are unaccounted for, whatever the heck that means in the public sector.

    You go to jail for that kind of crap. So tell me. Yeah, I know when I’m a dollar off of my DTS travel voucher, I get
    hammered.

    But seems like it doesn’t work the other way if you sell over $600 worth of stuff on ebay now, you get a call from
    the IRS. So, please, what corporations? Yeah, I don’t know these specific metrics towards the end of your question.
    The specific corporations.

    I did provide to the committees in specific divisions, and I spent eleven and a half hours with both intel
    committees. Okay. Has there been an active US government disinformation campaign to deny the existence of
    unidentified aerial phenomena? And if so, why? I can’t go beyond what I’ve already exposed publicly about that’s.

    Okay. I’ve been told to ask you what that what that is, and how to get it in the record. What have you stated
    publicly in your interviews for the Congressional Record? If you reference my News Nation interview and I talk about
    a multidecade campaign to disenfranchise public interest, basically.

    I apologize, Mr. Chairman. I yield back negative 21 seconds.

    Thank you, Ms. Ocasio. Cortez.

    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to our witnesses for coming here today.

    I do concur with the ranking member, as well as several other members here on this committee, that this is a
    committee for whistleblowers and for the protection of whistleblowers as well. So we understand what you’re putting
    on the table here and what you’re putting on the line here. And we thank you for that.

    Mr. Crush, you sat on the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon task force created in the 2020. NDAA, correct? Yes.

    There have been some things that have been mentioned here during this hearing that I wanted to pick up on. Mr.
    Graves, you mentioned specifically during the answer to one of your questions you named Boeing contractors being
    engaged in an incident regarding this red cube about a football field wide.

    I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about the interaction or Mr. Gresh, either of you, the interactions
    between defense contractor companies and any UAP related programs or activities. So I’ll just say that the
    information about the contractor himself were provided by a witness, and I have no particular detail in that
    relationship.

    Mr. Gresh? The kind of general, unclassed wave tops. Certainly the contractors are the metal benders, so to speak.

    They’re the ones actually doing specific performance on government contracts. Are they required to issue any
    disclosure regarding UAP sightings, or do they engage in any reporting around this? In terms of the contractors? Not
    that I’m aware of, they do not. Okay.

    Now, when it comes to notification that you had mentioned about IRAP programs, we have seen defense contractors
    abuse their contracts before through this committee. I have seen it personally, and I have also seen the
    notification requirements to Congress abused. I am wondering, one of the loopholes that we see in the law is that
    there is, at least from my vantage point, is that depending on what we’re seeing, is that there are no actual
    definitions or requirements for notification.

    What methods of notification did you observe? Like when they say they notified Congress, how did they do that? Do
    you have insight into that? For certain Irat activities? I can only think of ones conventional in nature. Sometimes
    they flow through certain, I’ll just say SAP programs that have cognizant authority over the Air Force or something.
    And those are congressionally reported compartments, but I read is literally internal to the contractor.

    So as long as it’s money, either profits, private investment, et cetera, they can do whatever they want. To put a
    finer point on it, when there is a requirement for any agency or company or any agency to notify Congress, do they
    contact the chairman of a committee? Do they get them on the phone? Specifically? Is this through an email to,
    hypothetically, a dead email box? A lot of it comes through what they call the PPR periodic program review process.
    If it’s a SAP or Controlled Access Program.

    Equity. And then those go to the specific committees, whether it be the SAS task. Hise thank you.

    I apologize. My time is limited. Mr.

    Graves, one of your main concerns, that the FAA currently does not have an official process to receive reports of
    UAP from pilots or others, correct? Correct. And in your experience, what data should the Aero program prioritize
    for potential collection? We have location, date, time. But are there other specific characteristics that should be
    included in these reports? Certainly.

    I think that there’s two categories that would be important. One would be kinematics and understanding the specifics
    of how the vehicle or objects are moving. And the second would be a more zoomed out approach of being able to look
    at origin and destination after before the incident, as well as getting a better contextual understanding of how
    these objects are interacting with each other.

    Thank you. Now, because I only have a minute left, I apologize, we only have five minutes today. But for the record,
    if you were me, where would you look? Titles.

    Programs, departments, regions. If you could just name anything and I put that as an open question to the three of
    you, I’d be happy to give you that. In a closed environment, I can tell you specifically.

    Thank you, commander Frafer, I would say, and I’ve told people that you have to know where to look. They’re not
    going to divulge it to you because of classification levels. But if you know where to look and who to talk to, which
    is exactly what Mr.

    Grush can point you, then you have them. Okay. Mr.

    Graves, I was an operator, so I was depending on folks like Mr. Grush to do that homework. Okay.

    Thank you very much. I yield back to the chair. Mr.

    Beggs. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.

    I thank the witnesses for being here today. I’m over here. Thank you so much for being here.

    I want to get into specifics here. And the reason I’m going to go this way is because you’ve talked a bit about what
    I would call misdirection by official US government with regard to UAPs. Right.

    And so I’m going to get to that in a second. But last week, White House NSC spokesman John Kirby stated that UAPs
    are having an impact on our training ranges and need to be treated as a legitimate issue. Do you concur with the
    statements that’s for each of you? Yes.

    Okay. Now, having said that, I’m going to take you to specific instances around the Phoenix Valley because that’s
    where I live. In 97, we had the famous Phoenix Light case.

    I don’t know if any of you are familiar with that. There were two things that went along with that and the
    explanation was military training range off Luke and the Barry Goldwater range. Do you know anything different other
    than the official explanation of those lights? Only what’s in the public vernacular about it that was outside the
    scope of my duties.

    And if we wanted to just my question, along with my colleague from New York, Miz Ocasio Cortez, if we wanted to find
    out more about that, where would we go to find the files and who would we address? And are you going to tell me we
    need to go to a skiff so you can tell us in a skiff? I could potentially give you a vector on that. That specific
    mean, I’m familiar with it in terms of public, but I give you a vector in closed environment. Yeah, that would be
    good.

    Thank you. So if it’s true that UAPs are having an impact on training ranges and this administration considers it to
    be a legitimate issue, what steps can Congress take to address training range impacts? And I say that having two
    very large training ranges in my state. And so we’ll start with Mr.

    Graveson going down the panel. Some of the initial procedures have been implemented, such as within the United
    States Navy that have a range follow report that gathers information from pilots. I understand that a service wide
    reporting mechanism is still pending.

    However, that would be a great next step, not only for gathering information, but for showing the troops that is an
    acceptable topic and reducing the stigma. Okay. Please, all of you, continue.

    Yeah. As a recipient of a lot of those training range reports, sometimes we only get contextual kind of oral
    reporting. It’d be nice if they attached all sensor data and there’s a system in place that can handle multiple
    classifications of data.

    And that’s an issue with the F 35. Right. That jet was never built to be an ISR platform, and it’s a pain in the
    we’ll say butt to get that data off.

    Great, thank you. Yeah, I would agree with the previous two, being a user of those training ranges, that the data
    has to be out there. You have to acknowledge that you’re seeing them and then you have to collect the data.

    Right. Now, you get the report, someone says, I saw something, but no one collects the radar data to back it up and
    do research. Okay.

    Do you believe that the 2019 classification guidelines for UAPs interferes with the federal government’s ability to
    be transparent with the American people? And do you think we need to be more transparent with the American people?
    All of you? Yeah, I’ll say yes to that. Yeah. I’m familiar with at least the UAP task Force 2019 security
    classification guide.

    I think it’s fair. I did actually help author that with the you got a bias that way then. But I will say I’ll call
    it a lazy attitude about declassifying videos.

    I mean, I’ve seen some of the videos of the recent shootdown and I saw no reason that couldn’t have been released.
    As long as they mask some data, the American people deserve to see that imagery and full motion video, I would
    think. Well, in my opinion, I will say that are overclassified.

    I know for a fact the video or the pictures that came out in the 2020 report that had the stuff off the East Coast,
    they were taken with an iPhone off the East Coast. A budy of mine was one of the senior people there, and he said
    they were originally classified as TSSCI. And my question to him was, what’s TSSCI about these? They’re an iPhone
    literally off the vacates.

    That’s not TSSCI. So they’re overclassified. And as soon as they do that, they go in a vault and then you all have
    to look for them.

    Yeah. So with the overclassification, that may be one way. Are there other ways that the DoD or intelligence
    agencies are keeping this information from the American people or even from Congress? I think part of that has been
    not encouraging reporting.

    If the problem is not something that can be measured, it’s not something that’s going to be fixed. Okay, very good.
    Well, I’m out of time.

    And I thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I yield back.

    First of all, without objection, representative Nick Langworthy of New York has waived on the subcommittee for
    purpose of questioning witnesses at today’s subcommittee hearing. And then we go to Mr. Burlson.

    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate you guys coming out today, testifying.

    Look, I’ve been here for six months, and I’m pretty skeptical. I don’t trust anything in this. So and I think that’s
    because I’m from Missouri, you’ve got to show me.

    Right. With that being said, there’s been a lot of things that have been said in the public, Mr. Grush, and so I
    want to get down to, if we can, some specifics.

    Right. So at one point, you had said that there has been harmful activity or aggressive activity. Has any of the
    activity been aggressive, been hostile in your reports? I know of multiple colleagues of mine that got physically
    injured.

    And the activity by UAPs or by people within the federal government? Both. Okay. So there has been activity by alien
    or non human technology and or beings that has caused harm to humans.

    I can’t get into the specifics in an open environment, but at least the activity that I personally witnessed and I
    have to be very careful here, because they tell you never to acknowledge trade craft. Right. So what I personally
    witnessed myself and my wife was very disturbing.

    Okay. One of my constituents actually sent this next question, and I figured I’d ask it since I had the same
    thought. You’ve said that US has intact spacecraft.

    You said that the government has alien bodies or alien species. Have you seen the spacecraft? I have to be careful
    to describe what I’ve seen firsthand and not in this environment, but I could answer that question behind closed
    doors. And have you seen any of the bodies? That’s something I’ve not witnessed myself.

    Okay. And so with that being said, the other statement that has been made, that was intriguing to me. And it’s
    intriguing because my view has been that we are billions of light years away from any other system.

    And the concept that an alien species that’s technologically advanced enough to travel billions of light years gets
    here and somehow is incompetent enough to not survive Earth or crashes is something that I find a little bit far
    fetched. And with that being said, you have mentioned that there’s interdimensional potential. Could you expound on
    that? Yeah.

    To answer your first question, and I’m here as the fact witness and expert, but I will give you a theoretical
    framework, at least to work off, to kind of expose crashes, regardless of your level of sentience. Right. Planes
    crash, cars crash, N, number of sorties, however high, a small percentage are going to end in mission failure, if
    you will, as we say in the Air Force.

    And then in terms of multi dimensionality, that kind of thing, the framework that I’m familiar with, for example, is
    something called the Holographic Principle. Both it derives itself from general relativity and quantum mechanics.
    And that is, if you want to imagine a 3D object, such as yourself casting a shadow onto a 2D surface, that’s the
    holographic principle.

    So you can be projected quasi projected from higher dimensional space to lower dimensional. It’s a scientific trope
    that you can actually cross, literally, as far as I understand. But there’s probably guys of PhDs that we could
    probably argue about that.

    But you have not seen any documentation that that’s what’s occurring? Only theoretical framework discussion. Okay.
    Okay.

    Occam’s Razor is that these aircraft have they been identified that they are being produced by domestic military
    contractors? Is there any evidence that that’s what’s being recovered? Not to my knowledge. Plus, the recoveries
    predate a lot of our advanced programs that I previously am witting of. Would it be safe to say that there could be
    a scenario today where you have an aircraft that crashes because it’s been involved in one program from one federal
    agency, but the agency that retrieves it is not aware of that program, and to them, it appears alien in origin? I
    mean, that’s a hypothetical situation.

    I’m not aware of any historical situation that would match that you described. It has not happened that you’re aware
    of. That I’m aware of.

    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.

    Several months ago, my office received a protected disclosure from Eglin Air Force Base indicating that there was a
    UAP incident that required my attention. I sought a briefing regarding that episode and brought with me Congressman
    Birchett and Congresswoman Luna. We asked to see any of the evidence that had been taken by flight crew in this
    endeavor and to observe any radar signature, as well as to meet with the flight crew.

    We were not afforded access to all of the flight crew, and initially, we were not afforded access to images and to
    radar. Thereafter, we had bit of a discussion about how authorities flow in the United States of America, and we did
    see the image, and we did meet with one member of the flight crew who took the image. The image was of something
    that I am not able to attach to any human capability, either from the United States or from any of our adversaries.

    And I’m somewhat informed on the matter, having served on the Armed Services Committee for seven years, having
    served on the committee that oversees DARPA and advanced technologies for several years. When we spoke with the
    flight crew, and when he showed us the photo that he’d taken, I asked why the video wasn’t engaged, why we didn’t
    have a FLIR system that worked. Here’s what he said.

    They were out on a test mission that day over the Gulf of Mexico. And when you’re on a test mission, you’re supposed
    to have clear airspace, not supposed to be anything that shows up. And they saw a sequence of four craft in a clear
    diamond formation for which there is a radar sequence that I and I alone have observed in the United States
    Congress.

    One of the pilots goes to check out that diamond formation and sees a large floating what I can only describe as an
    orb. Again, like I said, not of any human capability that I’m aware of. And when he approached, he said that his
    radar went down he said that his FLIR system malfunctioned and that he had to manually take this image from one of
    the lenses and it was not automated in collection as you would typically see in a test mission.

    So I guess I’ll start with Commander Fraver. How should we think about the fact that this craft that was approached
    by our pilot had the capability of disarming a number of the sensor and collection systems on that craft? Well, I
    think this goes to that national security side and you can go back through history of things showing up at certain
    areas and disabling our capabilities, which is disheartening. And for us, like I said, it completely disabled the
    radar on the aircraft when it tried to do it.

    The only way we could see it is passively which is how he got that image. So I think that’s a concern on what are
    these doing not only how do they operate but their capabilities inside to do things like this and how should we
    think about craft moving in a very clear formation equidistant from one another in a diamond in all of the
    phenomenon? Perhaps, Mr. Grave, that you’ve analyzed have we ever seen multiple craft in a single formation? I have
    one particular case and that was during the Gimbal incident.

    The recording on the At FLIR system shows a single object that rotates. You hear the pilots refer to a fleet of
    objects that is not visible on the FLIR system. And that was something that I witnessed during the debrief as part
    of the radar data on the situational awareness page.

    I would like to add whoever congressman, there’s small bit of anger, I would say. I would feel that those pilots are
    still facing that difficulty in reporting this topic and they don’t have the tools to be able to mitigate this
    issue. It just goes to show how serious this is and why this is such an important issue for our pilots and for our
    nation.

    It was stated explicitly to me by these test pilots that if you have au of AP experience, the best thing you can do
    for your career is forget it and not tell anyone. Because any type of reporting, either above the surface or below
    the surface, does have a perceived consequence to these people. And that is a culture we must change if we want to
    get to the truth.

    Mr. Chairman, I would observe that perhaps as we move forward from this hearing there are some obvious next steps.
    Every person watching this knows that we need to meet with Mr.

    Grush in a secure compartmentalized facility so that we can get fulsome answers that do not put him in jeopardy and
    that give us the information we need. Second. I would suggest that the radar images that were collected of this
    formation of craft out of Eglin Air Force Base, and specifically the actual image taken by the actual flight crew
    that we can actually validate be provided.

    To the committee subpoenaed if necessary, so that we’re able to track how to get this type of reporting and analysis
    done in a more fulsome way. That would be my recommendation. Humbly.

    As a guest here of the Fine Oversight Committee, I yield back. Ms. Mace.

    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And good morning to our witnesses who are testifying today.

    I want to thank each of you for being here to discuss a topic of grave importance to our national security. Earlier
    this year, a Chinese spy balloon was shot down off the coast of my home state of South Carolina. Since the Roswell
    incident in 1947, many Americans have wondered about the dangers of unknown objects crisscrossing our skies, whether
    these are UAPs or weather phenomena, advanced technology from American allied or enemy forces, or something more out
    of this world.

    So my first question, I have several questions, and if we can just be quick on these first two, I’m going to ask
    each of you the same question, and then I’ll get to each of you individually. The first one. When you reported your
    experiences with a UAP, did MVU face any repercussions with your superiors? Yes or no? No.

    I’ve actually never seen anything personally, believe it or not. All right. And then do you believe there’s an
    active disinformation campaign within our government to deny existence of UAPs? Yes or no? I don’t have an answer to
    that.

    As previously stated. Publicly? Yes, I think. Previously.

    With, like, project Blue Book. Yes, but currently I don’t speak for the United States government. Okay, thank you.

    I have a few questions for Mr. Graves. What percentage of UAP sightings, in your belief, go unreported by our
    pilots? This is an approximation based off of my personal experience speaking with a number of pilots, but I would
    estimate we’re somewhere near 5% reporting, perhaps.

    So like 95% basically don’t report seeing UAPs. That’s just my personal estimate. In the incident off Virginia
    Beach, do you believe the Navy took the danger to your aircraft seriously after it was reported? Absolutely.

    A few questions for Mr. Favor. As an expert naval aviator, have you ever seen an object that looked and moved like
    the Tic TAC UAP? No.

    Did the Tic TAC UAP move in such a way that defied the laws of physics the way we understand them? Yes. Many dismiss
    UAP reports as classified weapons testing by our own government. But in your experience as a pilot, does our
    government typically test advanced weapon systems right next to multimillion dollar jets without informing our
    pilots? No.

    We have test ranges for that. It took over 15 years for your encounter with the Tic TAC to be declassified. Do you
    feel there was a good reason to prevent lawmakers from having access to this footage? No, I just think it was
    ignored when it happened and it just sat somewhere in a file, never got reported in a drawer.

    It happens a lot up here. Shocker. Mr.

    Grush, a couple of questions for you too, sir, this morning, what percentage of UAPs do you feel are adequately
    investigated by the US government? Of the 5% that are reported, I can only speak for my personal leadership over at
    Nga. I tried to look at every report that came through that I could triage. Do you believe that officials at the
    highest levels of our national security apparatus have unlawfully withheld information from Congress and subverted
    our oversight authority? There are certain elected leaders that had more information that I’m not sure what they’ve
    shared with certain gang of eight members or et cetera, but certainly I would not be surprised.

    Okay. You’ve stated that the government is in possession of potentially non human spacecraft. Based on your
    experience and extensive conversations with experts, do you believe our government has made contact with intelligent
    extraterrestrials? Something I can’t discuss in public setting.

    Okay. I can’t ask when you think this occurred, if you believe we have crashed craft stated earlier, do we have the
    bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft? As I’ve stated publicly already in my News Nation interview, biologics
    came with some of these recoveries. Yeah.

    Were they, I guess, human or non human? Biologics non human. And that was the assessment of people with direct
    knowledge on the program I talked to that are currently still on the program. And was this documentary evidence as
    video, photos, eyewitness? Like, how would that be determined? The specific documentation I would have to talk to
    you in a skiff about got you.

    Okay. And you may or may not be able to answer my last question, and maybe we get into a skiff at the next hearing
    that we have. But who in the government either what agency subagency, what contractors, who should be called into
    the next hearing about UAPs, either in a public setting or even in a private setting.

    And you probably can’t name names, but what agencies or organizations, contractors, et cetera, do we need to call in
    to get these questions answered? Whether it’s about funding, what programs are happening, and what’s out there, I
    can give you a specific, cooperative and hostile witness list of specific individuals that were in those. And how
    soon can we get that list? I’m happy to provide that to you after the hearing. Super.

    Thank you. And I yield back. Okay, now we have Mr.

    Langworth. Is he here? Okay. Thank you very much.

    I’d like to thank all of the witnesses for being here today to discuss this very unique topic. And I’d like to jump
    right into my questions, if you don’t mind. Commander Fravor, can you briefly describe your background? Yeah, I was
    an enlisted Marine, Naval Academy graduate, Navy, flew for 18 years, got a master’s from University of Houston, and
    I’ve worked in the private sector for the last, what now? 1916 years? 17 years.

    I do a lot of defense work. Really? Gold plated credentials. Commander Fraver, we have all seen the floating Tic TAC
    video that you engaged with on November 14, 2004.

    Can you briefly talk about why you were off the coast of San Diego that day? Yeah, we were at a workup with all the
    battle groups, so we integrate the ships with the carrier, the airwing with the carrier, and we start working. So we
    were doing an air defense to hone not only our skills, but those of the USS Princeton when they had been tracking
    them for two weeks. The problem was that there was never manned aircraft airborne when they were tracking them.

    And this was the first day, and unfortunately, we were the ones airborne and went and saw it. Do you remember the
    weather that day? Was it cloudy or windy or anything out of the ordinary on the Pacific Coast? It was actually, if
    you’re familiar with San Diego, it was a perfect day. Light winds, no white caps, clear skies, not a cloud.

    It was for flying. It was the best. Now, is it true that you saw, in your words, a 40 foot flying Tic TAC shaped
    object? That’s correct.

    Or for some people that can’t know what a Tic TAC is, it’s a giant flying propane tank. Fair enough. Did this object
    come up on radar or interfere with your radar or the USS Princeton? The Princeton tracked it.

    The Nimitz tracked it. The E two tracked it. We never saw it on our radars.

    Our fire control radars never picked it up. The other airplane that took the video did get it on a radar. As soon as
    it tried to lock it jammed the radar, spit the lock, and he rapidly switched over to the targeting pod, which you
    can do in the F 18.

    From what you saw that day and what you’ve seen on video, did you see any source of propulsion from the flying
    object, including on any potential thermal scans from your aircraft? No, there’s none. There’s no IR plume coming
    out. And Chad, who took the video, went through all the EO, which is black and white TV and the IR modes, and
    there’s no visual signs of propulsion.

    It’s just sitting in space at 20,000ft. In your career, have you ever seen a propulsion system that creates no
    thermal exhaust? No. Can you describe how the aircraft maneuvered? Abruptly, very determinant.

    It knew exactly what it was doing. It was aware of our presence, and it had acceleration rates that mean it went
    from zero to matching our speed in no time at all. Now, if the fastest plane on Earth was trying to do these
    maneuvers that you saw, would it be capable of doing that? No, not even close.

    And just to confirm, this object had no wings, correct? No wings. Now, was the aircraft that you were flying, was it
    armed? No. Never felt threatened at all if the aircraft was armed, do you believe that your aircraft or any aircraft
    in possession of the United States could have shot the Tic TAC down? I’d say no.

    Just on the performance. It would just left in a split second. It looks like we have a problem here that needs
    further investigation.

    Yes. In your belief, is this flying Tic TAC, I mean, is it capable of being the product of any other nation on the
    Earth? No, actually, I said like I said earlier, I think it defies current material science and the ability to
    develop that much propulsion. And I know there’s been some physicists have done calculations, which is beyond
    anything that we have.

    Well, either the United States has an adversary here in this world that we don’t know, or we really have some
    serious investigations to do. I really appreciate you being here. Is there anything else about the November 14, 2004
    incident that you think is important for this committee to know that you haven’t been asked here today? No.

    It’s been said it’s probably the most credible UFO sighting in history, based on all the sensors that were tracking
    it. And then for us to get visual and to go against the naysayers, it’s something on the screen or whatever. I mean,
    there’s four sets of human eyeballs.

    We’re all very credible of the six of us that were involved in the thing, including the video, every one of us is
    going to do 20 plus years in the military in very responsible positions. So I’d say the world needs to know that
    it’s not a joke. Thank you very much for your testimony here today, for all of you, and I yield back.

    Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ogles.

    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you all for being here and the courage it took to come forward, and again, the
    sacrifice that each of you have made.

    I serve on the National Security Subcommittee for the Financial Services Committee, so I really want to stay in the
    National Security Lane, if I may. So when we think about traditional adversaries, and both us towards them and them
    towards us, we probe their capabilities, we look for weaknesses, and we collect that data. That reconnaissance in
    the event we need it in the future.

    For each of you, yes or no question. Based off of your own experience or the data that you’ve been privy to, is
    there any indication that these UAPs could be essentially collecting reconnaissance information? Mr. Graves? Yes.

    Mr. Grush? Fair assessment. Mr.

    Fravor? Very possible. Again, in the national security vein, is it possible that these UAPs would be probing our
    capabilities? Yes or no. Mr.

    Graves? Yes. Rush yes. Fravor definitely.

    Is it possible that these UAPs are testing for vulnerabilities in our current yes, yes, possible. Do you feel, based
    off of your experience and the information that you’ve been privy to, that these UAPs provide an existential threat
    to the national security of the United States? Mr. Graves? Potentially, yes.

    Or potentially. Same answer. Potentially.

    I would say definitely. Potentially. Mr.

    Graves. And know, in the event that your encounters had become hostile, would you have had the capability to defend
    yourself, your crew, your aircraft? Absolutely not, sir, no. Based off of the information that you’ve been privy to,
    is there any indication that these UAPs are interested in our nuclear technology and capabilities? Yes.

    By external observation? Sure. That could be a fair assessment, yeah. Yes.

    Is there any indication that the Department of Energy is involved in UAP data collection and housing? I don’t have
    an answer. I can’t confirm or deny that. In a public setting.

    Could you do it in a secure setting? Yes. Mr. Fravor.

    No, I don’t you know, I think I’m the last member to go, but there clearly is a threat to the national security of
    the United States of America. As members of Congress, we have a responsibility to maintain oversight and be aware of
    these activities so that, if appropriate, we take action. I would encourage the Chairman to demand that we have any
    and all, but in particular, Mr.

    Grush, talk to us in a skiff. And if that access is denied, I will personally volunteer to initiate the Holman rule
    against any personnel or any program or any agency that denies access to Congress. Mr.

    Chairman. With that, I will yield the remainder of my time to my fellow colleague from Tennessee, Mr. Bercha.

    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr.

    Ogles, for the great questions. Brother. Mr.

    Grush, I might have asked this before, but I want to make sure. Do you have any personal knowledge of someone who’s
    possibly been injured working on legacy UAP reverse engineering? Yes. Okay.

    How were they injured? Is it something like a radioactive type situation or something we didn’t understand? I’ve
    heard people talk about Havana Syndrome type incidences. What was your recollection of that? I can’t get into
    specifics. But you can imagine assessing an unknown? Unknown.

    There’s a lot of potentialities you can’t fully prepare for. How do you think we ought to handle UAP whistleblower
    complaints like yours in the future? Yeah, there was some issue with mine. So PPD 19 process, it goes to the intel
    committees either through PPD 19 or ICD 120.

    There’s not a good way for the intelligence Community Inspector General to provide that to other committees. And I
    asked my information to be sent to the House and Senate Armed Services Committee because there are Title X Equities
    at play, but there was no smooth process to do so. Yeah, it’s a trash can.

    Are you aware of any individuals that. Are participating in reverse engineering programs for non terrestrial craft?
    Personally, yes. Do you know any that would be willing to testify if there were protections for them? Certainly.

    Closed door and assurances breaking their NDA. They’re not going to get administratively punished for sale. Yeah.

    I yield. Mr. Chair.

    Thank you. I’m going to do something a little bit out of the ordinary here. We’re going to give three people a
    chance at additional three minutes.

    So, Mr. Burcht, do you want to keep going? Why don’t you come back to me? Mr. Chairman.

    Ms. Luna, is she on that list? Sure. Chairman, I’d like to submit for the record an article by News Nation and it
    follows Mr.

    Grush’s full interview for the record, without objection. Thank you. Mr.

    Grush, why is it that you refer to the phenomenon as non human intelligence? Why deviate from the basis of
    extraterrestrial life? I think the phenomenon is very complex and I like to leave an open mind analytically, to
    specific origin. When you say specific origin, can you elaborate on that for those that might? If it’s a traditional
    extraterrestrial origin or something else that we don’t quite understand from either a biological or astrophysics
    perspective? I just like to keep an open mind on what it could be. Yeah.

    Okay. And referring to your News Nation interview, you had referenced specific treaties between governments. Article
    Three of the nuclear arms treaty with Russia identifies UAPs.

    It specifically mentions them. To your knowledge, are there safety measures in place with foreign governments or
    other superpowers to avoid an escalatory situation in the event that a UAP malevolent event occurs? Yeah. You’re
    referring to actual a public treaty in the UN register? It’s funny you mentioned that.

    The agreement on measures to reduce the risk of outbreak of nuclear war sign in 1971, unclassified treaty publicly
    available. And if you cite the George Washington University National Security Archives, you will find the
    declassified in 2013 specific provisions in the specific red line, flask message traffic with the specific codes
    pursuant to article three and article also situation two, which is in the previously classified NSA archive. What I
    would recommend, and I tried to get access, but I got a wall of silence at the White House, was those specific
    incidents when those message traffic was used, I think some scholarship on that would open the door to a further
    investigation using those publicly available information.

    Thank you. And then my last question with 51 seconds remaining. You mentioned white collar crimes potentially being
    taking place in regards to a cover up.

    Can you please elaborate? I have concerns based on the interviews I conducted under my official duties of potential
    violations of the Federal Acquisition Regulations thus far. Thank you very much, Chairman. I yield the remainder of
    my time.

    Okay, we’ll go to Mr. Raskin for three minutes. Thanks, Mr.

    Chair. I thank the witnesses for their endurance and service today. Mr.

    Fraver, you’ve described your episode in detail now, and you call it the most credible UFO sighting in history. I
    wonder, was this the first time that you encountered a UFO or a UAP in 2004? Yes. And what was your general attitude
    or perspective on the UFO discussion before that happened? I never felt that we were alone with all the planets out
    there, but I wasn’t a UFO person.

    I wasn’t watching History Channel and MUFON and all that. And have you had experiences or encounters since that
    happened? No. And so have you formed any general conclusions about what you think you experienced then? Yes, I think
    what we experienced was, like I said, well beyond the material science and the capabilities that we had at the time
    that we have currently or that we’re going to have in the next ten to 20 years.

    Very good. Mr. Gresh, you’ve been able to answer in great detail on certain questions and then other things you say
    you’re not able to respond to.

    Can you just explain where you’re drawing the line? What’s the basis for that? Yeah, based on my Dopser security
    review and what they’ve determined, that is unclassified. I see. So you’re answering any questions that just call
    upon your knowledge of unclassified questions, but anything that relates to classified matters, you’re not
    commenting on in this context in an open session, but happy to participate in a closed session at the right level.

    Yeah. Okay. And, Mr.

    Graves, you’ve said that there are dozens of fellow pilots, military pilots. Are there also commercial pilots who’ve
    encountered the same kind of sightings that you described before? They are similar pilots. Commercial pilots have
    less range and less sensors to be able to reach out and look for objects over wide swaths of airspace.

    And so pilots are seeing them? Commercial pilots are seeing them, and they’re typically closer, and the range of
    what they’re seeing is pretty large. What is the most vivid concrete sighting with the naked eye of the objects that
    you described before? The cube like objects? Certainly. I think the most vivid sighting of that would have been near
    midair that we had at the entrance to our working area.

    One of these objects was completely stationary at the exact entrance to our working areas, not only geographically,
    but also at altitude. So it was right where all the jets are going, essentially on the Eastern Seaboard. The two
    aircraft flew within about 50ft of the object, and that was a very close visual sighting.

    And you were in one of the aircraft? I was not. I was there when the pilot landed. He canceled the mission after,
    and I was there.

    He was in the ready room with all his gear on with his mouth open, and I asked him what the problem was, and he said
    he almost hit one of those darn things. He said he was 50ft away from it. Yes, sir.

    And his description of the object was consistent with the description you gave us before? A dark gray or a black
    cube inside of a clear sphere? Inside of a clear sphere, yes. And with no self evident propulsion system, no wings,
    no IR energy coming off of the vehicle, nothing tethering it to the ground. And that was primarily what we were
    experiencing out there.

    I’m, over time. Thank you very much for your service, and I yield back to Mr. Chairman.

    Very good, Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr.

    Chairman. This is for all three of y’all, starting with Mr. Grace.

    Why did you come forward on this issue? I came forward because I felt that my colleagues did not have a way to
    mitigate this safety threat, and I wanted to help them. I was trained as an aviation safety officer by the Navy, and
    this seemed it just felt right. I felt like I had to help the folks that were still flying and dealing with this.

    Mr. Grush? Purely a sense of duty. I first swore an oath when I was a cadet 18 years ago, and I still uphold that,
    even out of the uniform.

    Commander. I was pestered by a friend and I asked Why? And he said, you’re the one person that they can’t discredit
    and you’ll add credibility to The New York Times article. And so after about six times, I said, okay, this town
    isn’t made, unfortunately, by people like y’all.

    We thank y’all. And I do want to also thank the people in the audience and the people that are watching this that
    can’t be people all over the world that have kept this issue alive. You’ve endured criticism and derogatory remarks,
    and we’re trying to get to the bottom of it.

    And so God bless you all. Thank you all so much. We really appreciate you guys and gals.

    That’s why we need term limits. Y’all keep clapping. US politicians just keep talking.

    Let me ask y’all, how can the public contribute to UAP reporting and what avenues you think are available to the
    public to report these sightings? Right now, I don’t think there is a lot of public options for every man to be able
    to report on this. I think even for professionals that have sensor data that are seeing these on a regular basis,
    they’re still hesitant to come forward. And so for the general public, I think encouraging the conversations that
    we’re having today, looking for technology solutions that can be distributed so that objective data can be gathered,
    is the first place to go.

    Mr. Garage, I’ll just touch on the whistleblower side of it. I do encourage current former military, intelligence
    community and industry contractors to come forward in a legal way, either through the IC or DoD or whatever the
    Cognizant.

    IGS are to join me in this discussion. Commander, and I guess I should say this for the record. My daddy was united
    states marine corps.

    First marine division. So, yes, sir. He was old school.

    Him and chesty puller on pellaloo. So thank you, brother. Wow.

    Yes, sir. I’m not anything like my daddy. He was incredible.

    I’m very mediocre, to say the least, but go ahead. You seem to be doing fine for me. I was an accident investigator.

    So the biggest thing that you learned, and I think that witnesses need to do is, one, don’t try and make the fish
    bigger than it was. Stick to the facts. Write it down and don’t speculate what you think it is because it will spoil
    your decision.

    Just write the facts down. We can get all the facts together and we can start to investigate and get a real honest
    story instead of it was this big. Thank you all.

    And I want to thank everybody. We made a history today. Mr.

    Chairman, I yield. Thank you much. Mr.

    Garcia. Thank you. I know now we’re going to be making some closing remarks, and so I just want to just say a few
    things first to our witnesses.

    I want to thank all of you for being here with us today. I know that it takes a lot, a lot of courage. You’re
    telling really important information to this committee, and I just want to thank you also for all three of your
    service to our country.

    I also want to just note that today’s hearing was both important but also serious. And I want to thank our
    subcommittee chairman, Mr. Groffman, I think, for running a very fair and substantive hearing.

    I do want to thank the committee staff on both sides for the amount of work that it took to put this hearing in
    place and certainly to all the members that have been involved in this issue prior to the hearing. I also want to
    note for our witnesses and for the public that I’m a freshman member of Congress and I’ve only been here for seven
    months, but this is by far the most bipartisan conversation and discussion that I have seen happen in the Congress.
    And I think that a topic of this significance, as it relates to our national security, as it relates to information
    that we’re trying to gather for the American public, does bring people together.

    And I think that’s been really great to see. I think it’s also important to note for the public today in our
    hearing, we had on our side also both our full ranking member, which is Mr. Raskin, and our vice ranking member,
    which is Ms.

    Ocasio Cortez, both here at our hearing. I think it shows the importance and seriousness that our side of the aisle
    is taking to this important hearing, but also the broader issue as it relates to working with our Republican
    counterparts on this committee. I want to additionally add that I think and I encourage I think it’s really
    important that we have and continue these discussions and these hearings.

    Clearly, there’s a lot of information that we don’t know, but it’s also very clear that we have to continue our
    investigation and accountability on asking the right questions and ensuring that they’re part of the public record.
    One thing that was important today is some folks might wonder why are we asking questions that might already be out
    there or that have been asked before? It’s important that they’re asked and put into the public record as it relates
    to this committee. And so I want to thank you for answering some questions multiple times.

    I know not just in maybe meetings you had with some members, but also here in the public. Let me also just add an
    additional note, that it’s important also that our friends in the media and those that are not just reporting on
    this hearing, but that have reported on this topic and that may in the future. The media has an important role in
    this process.

    And it’s very important that the media engages does independent investigation and reports on not just what happened
    today, but what they see independently as what is happening around UAPs in the broader community. That is also an
    important public benefit that we have in trying to get the information and the facts as it relates to this. Let me
    also just say finally that as a teacher and an educator and a longtime teacher and researcher, that I also really
    believe in following facts, in doing your homework and making sure that you follow science as we try to get as much
    information as possible.

    And so I want to thank you all for agreeing to do that today. Transparency is a cornerstone of government. We live
    in a vast galaxy, a lot of unanswered questions.

    And thank you all for being here today. Mr. Chairman.

    Thank you. I’d like to one more time thank Mr. Berchin, Ms.

    Luna, for bringing this to our attention. It’s a topic that has interest me since I was in school. It was a very
    illuminating hearing.

    Obviously, I think several of us are going to look forward to getting some answers in a more confidential setting. I
    assume some legislation will come out of this. Sure.

    I apologize, Mr. Chairman. I need to compliment the folks in my office that did a lot of the work on this.

    Rachel and Noah sitting behind me here, they’re very quiet and humble, but without them, this thing would not have
    come off like it did. So I apologize. Thank you.

    I think we’re going to want to look into what we can do to make more of this information public. I think there’s
    certainly a time period after which it should always be made public. And people have been concerned about these
    issues, like I said, since I was in high school.

    But in any event, like to thank everybody who was here sticking through the entire hearing without objection, the
    members will have five legislative days to submit materials and to submit additional written questions for the
    witnesses, which will be forward to the witnesses for their response. If there’s no further business without
    objection, the subcommittee stands adjourned.</blockquote>
