  <p><a href="burchett/opening">[Déclaration préliminaire de Burchett]</a></p>
  <p><b>Burchett</b>: Et je laisse le reste de mon temps, je crois que c'est, est-ce que c'est... à la députée Luna, M.
    le Président ?</p>
  <p><b>Grothman</b>: Oui, nous appelons Melle Luna pour sa déclaration.</p>
  <p><a href="luna/opening">[Déclaration préliminaire de Luna]</a></p>
  <p><b>Grothman</b>: Thank you very much. And I’d like to thank you and M. Burchett for bringing this topic to my
    attention. Now, we’ll recognize National Security Subcommittee ranking Member Garcia for ten minutes.</p>
  <p><a href="garcia/opening">[Garcia opening statement]</a></p>
  <p><b>Grothman</b>: Maintenant, j'aimerais présenter nos témoins. Notre 1er témoin est le lieutenant <span
      class="people">Ryan Graves</span>. He’s the executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace. Lieutenant Graves
    is also a former US Navy F 18 pilot with his own UAP experience.</p>
  <p>The next witness. <span class="people">David Grusch</span> is a former senior intelligence officer with the
    National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and was a senior technical advisor for UAP issues.</p>
  <p>And finally, retired Navy Commander <span class="people">David Fravor</span>, squadron leader, who worked as a
    Naval aviator for 18 years. M. Fraver has his own UAP experience, known as the "tic-tac" event.
  </p>
  <p>I look forward to hearing from all three of you today. Pursuant to Committee Rule Nine G, the witnesses will please
    stand and raise their right hands. Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the
    truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.</p>
  <p>Let the record show that all the witnesses answered in the affirmative. You may be seated. We appreciate you all
    being here today and look forward to your testimony. I’ll remind the witnesses that we have read your written
    statements, and they will appear in full in the hearing record. Please try to limit your oral statements to 5 mn. As
    a reminder, please press the button on the microphone in front of you so that it’s on and the members can hear you.
    When you begin to speak, the light in front of you will turn green. After 4 mn, it’ll turn yellow. And the red light
    when that comes on, it tells you your 5 mn have expired.</p>
  <p>I’ll now recognize M. Graves for five minutes for your opening statement.</p>

  <p>Thank you. Commander Fravor?</p>
  <p><a href="fravor/opening">[Fravor opening statement]</a></p>
  <p>Thank you very much. I know it’s very difficult for all of you, all you’ve done in the past, to try to eliminate
    this issue. Calling myself first for some questions.</p>
  <p><a href="grothman/questions">[Grothman questions to witnesses]</a></p>
  <p class="question">Okay, thank you very much. Now we’ll go to M. Garcia.</p>

  <p>Thank you, M. Chairman. Let me say I want to thank you for having this hearing, and I want to thank M. Burcht, Ms.

  <p><a href="burchett/questions/three.html">[Burchett third questions to witnesses]</a></p>
  <p>Thank you. I’m going to do something a little bit out of the ordinary here. We’re going to give 3 people a chance
    at additional 3 minutes. So, M. Gursch, do you want to keep going?</p>
  <p><b>Burchett</b>: Why don’t you come back to me? M. Chairman. Ms. Luna, is she on that list?</p>
  <p>Sure.</p>
  <p><a href="luna/questions/second.html">[Luna second questions to witnesses]</a></p>
  <p>Okay, we’ll go to M. Raskin for 3 mn.</p>
  <p><a href="raskin/second.html">[Luna second questions to witnesses]</a></p>
  <p>Very good, M. Burchett.</p>
  <p><a href="burchett/questions/fourth.html">[Burchett fourth questions to witnesses]</a></p>
  <p>Thank you much. M. Garcia.</p>
  <p><a href="garcia/closing">[Garcia closing remarks]</a></p>
  <p>Thank you. I’d like to one more time thank M. Berchin, Ms. Luna, for bringing this to our attention. It’s a topic
    that has interest me since I was in school. It was a very illuminating hearing. Obviously, I think several of us are
    going to look forward to getting some answers in a more confidential setting. I assume some legislation will come
    out of this...</p>
  <p><b>Burchett</b>: ...</p>
  <p>Sure.</p>
  <p><b>Burchett</b>I apologize, M. Chairman. I need to compliment the folks in my office that did a lot of the work on
    this.Rachel and Noah sitting behind me here, they’re very quiet and humble, but without them, this thing would not
    have come off like it did. So I apologize.</p>
  <p>Thank you. I think we’re going to want to look into what we can do to make more of this information public. I think
    there’s certainly a time period after which it should always be made public. And people have been concerned about
    these issues, like I said, since I was in high school.</p>
  <p>But in any event, like to thank everybody who was here sticking through the entire hearing without objection, the
    members will have 5 legislative days to submit materials and to submit additional written questions for the
    witnesses, which will be forward to the witnesses for their response. If there’s no further business without
    objection, the subcommittee stands adjourned.</p>
