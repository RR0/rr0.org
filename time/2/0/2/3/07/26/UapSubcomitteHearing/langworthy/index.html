<blockquote>
  <p class="question">Thank you very much. I'd like to thank all of the witnesses for being here today to discuss this
    very unique topic. And I'd like to jump right into my questions, if you don't mind: Commander Fravor, can you
    briefly describe your background?</p>
  <p class="answer">Yeah, I was an enlisted Marine, Naval Academy graduate, Navy, flew for 18 years, got a master's from
    University of Houston, and I've worked in the private sector for the last, what now? 1916 years? 17 years. I do a
    lot of defense work.</p>
  <p class="question">Really Gold plated credentials. Commander Fravor, we have all seen the floating Tic TAC video that
    you engaged with on November 14, 2004. Can you briefly talk about why you were off the coast of San Diego that
    day?</p>
  <p class="answer">Yeah, we were at a workup with all the battle groups, so we integrate the ships with the carrier,
    the airwing with the carrier, and we start working. So we were doing an air defense to hone not only our skills, but
    those of the USS Princeton when they had been tracking them for two weeks. The problem was that there was never
    manned aircraft airborne when they were tracking them. And this was the first day, and unfortunately, we were the
    ones airborne and went and saw it.</p>
  <p class="question">Do you remember the weather that day? Was it cloudy or windy or anything out of the ordinary on
    the Pacific Coast?</p>
  <p class="answer">It was actually, if you're familiar with San Diego, it was a perfect day. Light winds, no white
    caps, clear skies, not a cloud. It was for flying. It was the best.</p>
  <p class="question"> Now, is it true that you saw, in your words, a 40 foot flying Tic TAC shaped object?</p>
  <p class="answer"> That's correct. Or for some people that can't know what a Tic TAC is, it's a giant flying propane
    tank.</p>
  <p class="question"> Fair enough. Did this object come up on radar or interfere with your radar or the USS
    Princeton?</p>
  <p class="answer">The Princeton tracked it. The Nimitz tracked it. The E two tracked it. We never saw it on our
    radars. Our fire control radars never picked it up. The other airplane that took the video did get it on a radar. As
    soon as it tried to lock it jammed the radar, spit the lock, and he rapidly switched over to the targeting pod,
    which you can do in the F-18.</p>
  <p class="question">From what you saw that day and what you've seen on video, did you see any source of propulsion
    from the flying object, including on any potential thermal scans from your aircraft?</p>
  <p class="answer">No, there's none. There's no IR plume coming out. And Chad, who took the video, went through all the
    EO, which is black and white TV and the IR modes, and there's no visual signs of propulsion. It's just sitting in
    space at 20,000ft.</p>
  <p class="question">In your career, have you ever seen a propulsion system that creates no thermal exhaust?</p>
  <p class="answer"> No.</p>
  <p class="question">Can you describe how the aircraft maneuvered?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Abruptly, very determinant. It knew exactly what it was doing. It was aware of our presence, and it
    had acceleration rates that mean it went from zero to matching our speed in no time at all.</p>
  <p class="question">Now, if the fastest plane on Earth was trying to do these maneuvers that you saw, would it be
    capable of doing that?</p>
  <p class="answer"> No, not even close.</p>
  <p class="question">
    And just to confirm, this object had no wings, correct?</p>
  <p class="answer"> No wings.</p>
  <p class="question"> Now, was the aircraft that you were flying, was it armed?</p>
  <p class="answer"> No. Never felt threatened at all</p>
  <p class="question">if the aircraft was armed, do you believe that your aircraft or any aircraft in possession of the
    United States could have shot the Tic TAC down?</p>
  <p class="answer"> I'd say no. Just on the performance. It would just left in a split second.</p>
  <p class="question"> It looks like we have a problem here that needs further investigation.</p>
  <p class="answer">Yes.</p>
  <p class="question">In your belief, is this flying Tic TAC, I mean, is it capable of being the product of any other
    nation on the Earth?</p>
  <p class="answer">No, actually, I said like I said earlier, I think it defies current material science and the ability
    to develop that much propulsion. And I know there's been some physicists have done calculations, which is beyond
    anything that we have.</p>
  <p class="question">Well, either the United States has an adversary here in this world that we don't know, or we
    really have some serious investigations to do. I really appreciate you being here. Is there anything else about the
    November 14, 2004 incident that you think is important for this committee to know that you haven't been asked here
    today?</p>
  <p class="answer"> No. It's been said it's probably the most credible UFO sighting in history, based on all the
    sensors that were tracking it. And then for us to get visual and to go against the naysayers, it's something on the
    screen or whatever. I mean, there's four sets of human eyeballs. We're all very credible of the six of us that were
    involved in the thing, including the video, every one of us is going to do 20 plus years in the military in very
    responsible positions. So I'd say the world needs to know that it's not a joke.</p>
  <p class="question"> Thank you very much for your testimony here today, for all of you, and I yield back, Mr.
    Chairman</p>
