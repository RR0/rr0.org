<blockquote>
  <p class="question">Mr. Grush, in speaking to you yesterday, I just wanted to follow up on Representative Raskin's
    questions. In the last couple of years, have you had incidences that have caused you to be in fear for your life for
    addressing these issues?</p>
  <p class="answer">Yes, Personally, I have.</p>
  <p class="question"> I just want everyone to note that he's coming forward in fear of his life. To put in perspective,
    if they were really not scared about this information coming out, why would someone be intimidated like that? To
    your knowledge, are <abbr title="Non-Human Intelligences">NHI</abbr> working with adversarial foreign governments in
    either technology exchange programs or back engineering programs?</p>
  <p class="answer">I don't have data on that. I'm not sure.</p>
  <p class="question">Have you heard or you had people come forward to present that evidence?</p>
  <p class="answer">Not that particular evidence that you just exposed.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. On the 19 April, dr. Kirkpatrick, head of <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">ADARO</a>,
    had said that he did not find any evidence of UAPs. You also stated that you had -in your interview- that you had
    briefed him on information that you were uncovering, but that he did not follow up with you. Were the items that you
    divulged to him pertain to national security?</p>
  <p class="answer">Yes. Him and I had a classified conversation in April 2022 before he took over ADARO in July 2022.
    And I provided him some concerns I had.</p>
  <p class="question">Do you know why he might not have followed up with you?</p>
  <p class="answer">Unfortunately, I cannot read his mind. I wish he did. I was happy to give Sage counsel to him on
    where to look when he took the head of <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">ADARO</a>.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. And then my last question for you before I move to Mr. Graves is you received prior approval
    from the Defense Department to speak on certain issues, correct?</p>
  <p class="answer">Correct. Through <a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/DOPSR">DOPSR, DoD Prepublication and Security
    Review</a>. And I just want to remind the public they're just looking from a security perspective. These are my own
    personal views and opinions, not the departments.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. I'm asking that, though, mainly because I think that there are many people that would like
    to discredit you. So it does bring a certain amount of credibility to your testimony.</p>
  <p class="answer">I'm required by law to do that as a former intelligence officer, or I go to jail for revealing
    classified information.</p>
  <p class="question">Yeah, we don't want you to go to jail. My next question would actually be for Mr. Graves. Can you
    please explain to me in detail the event that occurred at Vandenberg Air Force Base?</p>
  <p class="answer">Certainly. In the 2003 time frame. A large group of Boeing contractors were operating near one of
    the launch facilities at Vandenberg Air Force Base when they observed a very large, 100 yard sided red square
    approach the base from the ocean and hover at low altitude over one of the launch facilities. This object remained
    for about 45 seconds or so before darting off over the mountains. There was a similar event within 24 hours later in
    the evening. This was a morning event, I believe 845 in the morning. Later in the evening, post sunset, there were
    reports of other sightings on base, including some aggressive behaviors. These objects were approaching some of the
    security guards at rapid speeds before darting off. And this is information that was received through one of the
    witnesses that have approached me at Americans for Safe Aerospace.</p>
  <p class="question">Was this documented in any official form, whether it was a police blotter?</p>
  <p class="answer">Yes, they had official documentation and records from the event that the witness held over the
    years.</p>
  <p class="question">And I'm not going to ask you to do it right now for time reasons, but you'd be able to sketch what
    was witnessed? And have you seen that before on any other equipment and or during your flight time?</p>
  <p class="answer"> I have not seen what they have described. This object was estimated to be almost a size of a
    football field, and I have not seen anything personally that large.</p>
  <p class="question"> Okay. And then another question on follow up referencing the Gimbal video go Fast incident, can
    you just clarify? Because to our understanding, the footage was actually cut off at a certain point. But what
    happens at the end of that video just for those Americans specifically that are wanting to know about the rest of
    that footage?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Certainly there was some uncertainty or instability with the object. It seemed to rock a bit, and
    that's the last I had seen of the video. Much of the data that I would recommend be analyzed would consist of radar
    data that would provide precise kinematics on the object as well as the fleet of objects that were operating
    nearby.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. And follow up in regards to the reporting procedures that Mr. Garcia had addressed on, as
    well as Representative Burchett with the FAA. To your understanding, pilots that are seeing this, commercial airline
    pilots, are they receiving cease and desist letters from corporations for coming forward with information in regards
    to safety for potential airline passengers?</p>
  <p class="answer"> I have been made privy to conversations with commercial aviators who have received cease and desist
    orders.</p>
  <p class="question">So the American public should know that corporations are putting their own reputations on the
    basic, not the line, but ahead of the safety of the American people. And I think would you agree with that
    statement?</p>
  <p class="answer">Appears so.</p>
  <p class="question"> I guess this would be my last... I'm out of time. I yield. I'll be back.</p>
