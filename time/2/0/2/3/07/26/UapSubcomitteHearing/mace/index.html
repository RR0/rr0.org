<blockquote>
  <p class="question">
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And good morning to our witnesses who are testifying today. I want to thank each of you for
    being here to discuss a topic of grave importance to our national security. Earlier this year, a Chinese spy balloon
    was shot down off the coast of my home state of South Carolina. Since the Roswell incident in 1947, many Americans
    have wondered about the dangers of unknown objects crisscrossing our skies, whether these are UAPs or weather
    phenomena, advanced technology from American allied or enemy forces, or something more out of this world. So my
    first question, I have several questions, and if we can just be quick on these first two, I’m going to ask each of
    you the same question, and then I’ll get to each of you individually. The first one. When you reported your
    experiences with a UAP, did MVU face any repercussions with your superiors? Yes or no?</p>
  <p class="answer"><b>Graves</b> No.</p>
  <p class="answer"><b>Fravor</b>: No!</p>
  <p class="answer"><b>Grusch</b>: I’ve actually never seen anything personally, believe it or not.</p>
  <p class="question">All right. And then do you believe there’s an active disinformation campaign within our government
    to deny existence of UAPs? Yes or no?</p>
  <p class="answer"><b>Graves</b>: I don’t have an answer to that.</p>
  <p class="answer"><b>Grusch</b>As previously stated publicly, yes.</p>
  <p class="answer"><b>Fravor</b>I think. Previously. With, like, project Blue Book. Yes, but currently I don’t speak
    for the United States government.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay, thank you. I have a few questions for Mr. Graves. What percentage of UAP sightings, in your
    belief, go unreported by our pilots?</p>
  <p class="answer">This is an approximation based off of my personal experience speaking with a number of pilots, but I
    would estimate we’re somewhere near 5% reporting, perhaps.</p>
  <p class="question">So like 95% basically don’t report seeing UAPs.</p>
  <p class="answer">That’s just my personal estimate.</p>
  <p class="question">In the incident off Virginia Beach, do you believe the Navy took the danger to your aircraft
    seriously after it was reported?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Absolutely.</p>
  <p class="question">A few questions for Mr. Favor. As an expert naval aviator, have you ever seen an object that
    looked and moved like the Tic TAC UAP?</p>
  <p class="answer">No.</p>
  <p class="question">Did the Tic TAC UAP move in such a way that defied the laws of physics ?</p>
  <p class="answer">The way we understand them, yes.</p>
  <p class="question">Many dismiss UAP reports as classified weapons testing by our own government. But in your
    experience as a pilot, does our government typically test advanced weapon systems right next to multimillion dollar
    jets without informing our pilots?</p>
  <p class="answer">No, we have test ranges for that.</p>
  <p class="question">It took over 15 years for your encounter with the Tic TAC to be declassified. Do you feel there
    was a good reason to prevent lawmakers from having access to this footage?</p>
  <p class="answer">No, I just think it was ignored when it happened and it just sat somewhere in a file, never got
    reported in a drawer.</p>
  <p class="question">It happens a lot up here. Shocker. Mr. Grusch, a couple of questions for you too, sir, this
    morning, what percentage of UAPs do you feel are adequately investigated by the US government? Of the 5% that are
    reported.</p>
  <p class="answer">I can only speak for my personal leadership over at Nga. I tried to look at every report that came
    through that I could triage.</p>
  <p class="question"> Do you believe that officials at the highest levels of our national security apparatus have
    unlawfully withheld information from Congress and subverted our oversight authority?</p>
  <p class="answer">There are certain elected leaders that had more information that I’m not sure what they’ve shared
    with certain gang of eight members or et cetera, but certainly I would not be surprised.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. You’ve stated that the government is in possession of potentially non-human spacecraft.
    Based on your experience and extensive conversations with experts, do you believe our government has made contact
    with intelligent extraterrestrials?</p>
  <p class="answer">Something I can’t discuss in public setting.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay. I can’t ask when you think this occurred (laughs), if you believe we have crashed craft
    stated earlier, do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted this craft?</p>
  <p class="answer"> As I’ve stated publicly already in my News Nation interview, biologics came with some of these
    recoveries. Yeah.</p>
  <p class="question">Were they, I guess, human or non-human?</p>
  <p class="answer">Biologics non-human. And that was the assessment of people with direct knowledge on the program I
    talked to that are currently still on the program.</p>
  <p class="question">And was this documentary evidence as video, photos, eyewitness? Like, how would that be
    determined?</p>
  <p class="answer"> The specific documentation I would have to talk to you in a <abbr
      title="Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility">SCIF</abbr> about got you.</p>
  <p class="question">
    Okay. And you may or may not be able to answer my last question, and maybe we get into a <abbr
      title="Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility">SCIF</abbr> at the next hearing that we have. But who in the
    government either what agency subagency, what contractors, who should be called into the next hearing about UAPs,
    either in a public setting or even in a private setting. And you probably can’t name names, but what agencies or
    organizations, contractors, et cetera, do we need to call in to get these questions answered? Whether it’s about
    funding, what programs are happening, and what’s out there.</p>
  <p class="answer"> I can give you a specific, cooperative and hostile witness list of specific individuals that were
    in those.</p>
  <p class="question"> And how soon can we get that list?</p>
  <p class="answer">I’m happy to provide that to you after the hearing.</p>
  <p class="question">Super. Thank you. And I yield back.</p>
