<blockquote>
  <p class="question">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you all for being here and the courage it took to come forward,
    and again, the sacrifice that each of you have made. I serve on the National Security Subcommittee for the Financial
    Services Committee, so I really want to stay in the National Security Lane, if I may. So when we think about
    traditional adversaries, and both us towards them and them towards us, we probe their capabilities, we look for
    weaknesses, and we collect that data. That reconnaissance in the event we need it in the future. For each of you,
    yes or no question. Based off of your own experience or the data that you’ve been privy to, is there any indication
    that these UAPs could be essentially collecting reconnaissance information? Mr. Graves?</p>
  <p class="answer">Yes.</p>
  <p class="question">Mr. Grush?</p>
  <p class="answer">Fair assessment.</p>
  <p class="question">Mr. Fravor?</p>
  <p class="answer">Very possible.</p>
  <p class="question">Again, in the national security vein, is it possible that these UAPs would be probing our
    capabilities? Yes or no. Mr. Graves?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Yes.</p>
  <p class="question">Rush?</p>
  <p class="answer">yes.</p>
  <p class="question">Fravor?</p>
  <p class="answer">Definitely.</p>
  <p class="question">Is it possible that these UAPs are testing for vulnerabilities in our current systems?</p>
  <p class="answer">Yes.</p>
  <p class="answer">Yes.</p>
  <p class="answer">Possible.</p>
  <p class="question">Do you feel, based off of your experience and the information that you’ve been privy to, that
    these UAPs provide an existential threat to the national security of the United States? Mr. Graves?</p>
  <p class="answer">Potentially, yes.</p>
  <p class="question">Yes or potentially?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Same answer, potentially.</p>
  <p class="answer"> I would say definitely potentially.</p>
  <p class="question"> Mr. Graves and Fravor, in the event that your encounters had become hostile, would you have had
    the capability to defend yourself, your crew, your aircraft?</p>
  <p class="answer">Absolutely not</p>
  <p class="question">Sir?</p>
  <p class="answer">No.</p>
  <p class="question">Based off of the information that you’ve been privy to, is there any indication that these UAPs
    are interested in our nuclear technology and capabilities?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Yes.</p>
  <p class="answer"> By external observation? Sure. That could be a fair assessment, yeah.</p>
  <p class="answer"> Yes.</p>
  <p class="question">
    Is there any indication that the Department of Energy is involved in UAP data collection and housing?</p>
  <p class="answer">I don’t have an answer.</p>
  <p class="answer">I can’t confirm or deny that in a public setting.</p>
  <p class="question"> you do it in a secure setting?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Yes.</p>
  <p class="question"> Mr. Fravor.</p>
  <p class="answer">No, I don’t you know</p>
  <p class="question">I think I’m the last member to go, but there clearly is a threat to the national security of the
    United States of America. As members of Congress, we have a responsibility to maintain oversight and be aware of
    these activities so that, if appropriate, we take action. I would encourage the Chairman to demand that we have any
    and all, but in particular, Mr. Grusch, talk to us in a skiff. And if that access is denied, I will personally
    volunteer to initiate the Holman rule against any personnel or any program or any agency that denies access to
    Congress. Mr. Chairman. With that, I will yield the remainder of my time to my fellow colleague from Tennessee, Mr.
    Burchett.</p>
