<blockquote>
  <p class="question">Merci, M. le président. M. Graves, vous avez signalé des rencontres avec des PAN lors de vols
    d'entraînement, il me semble et, depuis, vous vous êtes fait connaître pour avertir le <a
      href="../../../../../../../../../../org/us/region/wa/arlington/pentagon">Pentagone</a> que ces rencontres
    pourraient
    représenter un risque pour les <a
        href="/people/pilotes.html">pilotes</a>. Ma première question est : you've identified these as taking place on
    the East Coast. Is it just on the East Coast where these encounters have been reported?</p>
  <p class="answer"> No. Since the events initially occurred, I've learned that the objects have been detected
    essentially where all operations, navy operations, are being conducted across the world. And that's from the Altima
    Anomaly Resolutions office reporting.</p>
  <p class="question">Can you describe your experience after you decided to come forward and go public with your
    experience?</p>
  <p class="answer">Certainly, like many others in <time>2017</time>, I saw The New York Times article come out as well.
    And for me, it was special because I recognized the voices on the video. I recognized the video itself. I had seen
    it when it was taken. I'd seen it when it was debriefed. And so that was kind of shook me because I realized that
    this problem was still ongoing. And so I reached out to colleagues back on the East Coast and realized that this was
    still a safety risk that they were dealing with, that they had essentially hit a wall with how they could move
    forward on this conversation. It was at that point when I decided to try to move the conversation forward myself.
  </p>
  <p class="question">Are there common characteristics to the UAPs that have been cited by different pilots? And can you
    describe what the convergence of descriptions is?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Certainly we were primarily seeing dark gray or black cubes inside of a clear sphere...</p>
  <p class="question">I'm sorry? Dark gray or black cubes?</p>
  <p class="answer">Yes, inside of a clear sphere where the apex or tips of the cube were touching the inside of that
    sphere. And that was primarily what was being reported when we were able to gain a visual tally of these objects
    that occurred over almost eight years. And as. Far as I know, it's still occurring.</p>
  <p class="question">So I take it that you're arguing what we need is real transparency in a reporting system so we can
    get some clarity on what's going on out there, because there are many pilots in your situation, but we should have a
    way of developing a systematic inventory of all of such encounters, is that right?</p>
  <p class="answer">
    Yes. And I think we need both transparency and the reporting. We have the reporting, but we need to make sure that
    information can be promulgated to commercial aviation as well as the rest of the populace. </p>
  <p class="question">M. Grusch. What about you? What was your experience after you came forward?</p>
  <p class="answer">Well, it's only been about two months or so, so I guess my experience has been overwhelming support
    from former colleagues of mine that have privately messaged me. And I do appreciate that. But I do have knowledge of
    active, planned reprisal activity against myself and other colleagues. And it's very upsetting to me</p>
  <p class="question">Coming from where?</p>
  <p class="answer">Certain senior leadership at previous agencies I was associated with. And that's all I'll say
    publicly, but I can provide more details in a closed environment.</p>
  <p class="question">Okay, well, I hope you understand that there would be bipartisan rejection of any attempt to
    vilify, demonize or engage in other reprisals against our witnesses and people who are telling the truth from their
    perspective.</p>
  <p class="answer">Yeah, there were certain colleagues of mine that were <em>brutally</em> administratively attacked,
    and it actually makes me very upset as a leader, to see that happen to other coworkers and actually superiors of
    mine over the last three years.</p>
  <p class="question">How do you account for that response? That seems like a bizarre response.</p>
  <p class="answer">
    I call it administrative terrorism. That's their quiver, their tool in the toolbox to silence people, especially the
    career government service cares about their career, cares about their clearance, their reputation to climb the
    ladder. And when you threaten that flow career path, a lot of people back off. But I'm here to represent those
    people.</p>
  <p class="question">M. Fravor. What about you? What has your experience been since you've come forward with your
    perspective on this?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Actually, I've been treated very well, and the six people that were involved, myself included, all
    of them have or will be retiring from the military as five s or six s. And all my friends that are very senior,
    three and four stars, I've talked to them. They believe they understand there's a problem. But no, I was actually
    treated really well.</p>
  <p class="question">And what is your general interpretation of these phenomena? What is your current thinking of
    trying to make sense of them?</p>
  <p class="answer"> Well, I'll say I'm not like a UFO fanatic. It's not me. But I will tell you that what we saw with
    four sets of eyes over a five minute period, still there's nothing. We have nothing close to it. It was amazing to
    see. I told my budy I wanted to fly it, but it's just an incredible technology.</p>
  <p class="question"> All right, M. Chairman, thank you very much, I'll yield back to you.</p>
