<p>L'étude des <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">Phénomènes Anormaux Non-identifiés (PAN)</a> présente une
  opportunité scientifique unique demandant une approche rigoureuse, basée sur les preuves. Adresser ce défi demandera
  de nouvelles méthodes robustes d'acquisition de données, des techniques d'analyse avancées, un cadre de signalement
  systématique et la réduction du stigma associé aux signalements. La <a href="/org/us/nasa">NASA</a> – avec son
  expertise étendue dans ces domaines et sa réputation globale d'ouverture scientifique – est en excellente position
  pour contribuer aux études sur les <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">PAN</a> au sein du cadre gouvernemental plus
  large mené par le <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)</a>.</p>
<p>NASA has a variety of existing and planned Earth- and space-observing assets, together with an extensive archive of
  historic and current data sets, which should be directly leveraged to understand UAP. Although NASA’s fleet of
  Earth-observing satellites typically lack the spatial resolution to detect relatively small objects such as UAP, their
  state-of-the-art sensors can be directly utilized to probe the state of the local earth, oceanic, and atmospheric
  conditions that are spatially and temporally coincident with UAPs initially detected via other methods. Thus, NASA’s
  assets can play a vital role by directly determining whether specific environmental factors are associated with
  certain reported UAP behaviors or occurrences.</p>
<p>Next, the U.S. commercial remote-sensing industry offers a potent mix of Earth-observing satellites that offer
  imagery at sub- to several-meter spatial resolution, which is well-matched to the typical spatial scales of known UAP.
  Although every point on Earth does not have constant high-resolution coverage, the panel finds nonetheless that such
  commercial constellations could offer a powerful complement to the detection and study of UAP when coincident
  collection occurs.</p>
<p>At present, analysis of UAP data is hampered by poor sensor calibration, the lack of multiple measurements, the lack
  of sensor metadata, and the lack of baseline data. Making a concerted effort to improve all aspects is vital, and
  NASA’s expertise should be comprehensively leveraged as part of a robust and systematic data acquisition strategy
  within the whole-of-government framework. Moving forward, NASA should contribute to a comprehensive, government-wide
  approach to collecting future data. The importance of detecting UAP with multiple, well-calibrated sensors is
  paramount, and NASA could potentially leverage its considerable expertise in this domain to utilize multispectral or
  hyperspectral data as part of a rigorous data acquisition campaign.</p>
<aside>NASA is in an excellent position to contribute to UAP studies within the broader whole-ofgovernment framework.

<p>The panel finds that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are essential tools for identifying rare
  occurrences, potentially including UAP, within vast datasets. However, these powerful techniques will only work on
  well-characterized data gathered with respect to strong standards. NASA’s extensive experience in the application of
  state-of-the-art computational and data-analysis techniques should therefore be leveraged to provide critical
  assistance. Once again, appropriate data collection, curation, and distribution are paramount; NASA, with its
  world-leading experience in these aspects is well-positioned to play a leading role.</p>
<p>Engaging the public is also a critical aspect of understanding UAP. The panel sees several advantages to augmenting
  data collection efforts using modern crowdsourcing techniques, including open-source smartphone-based apps that
  simultaneously gather imaging data and other smartphone sensor metadata from multiple citizen observers worldwide.
  NASA should therefore explore the viability of developing or acquiring such a crowdsourcing system as part of its
  strategy. In turn, the panel finds that there is currently no standardized system for making civilian UAP reports,
  resulting in sparse and incomplete data devoid of curation or vetting protocols. NASA should play a vital role by
  assisting AARO in its development of this Federal system.</p>
<p>The negative perception surrounding the reporting of UAP poses an obstacle to collecting data on these phenomena.
  NASA’s very involvement in UAP will play a vital role in reducing stigma associated with UAP reporting, which almost
  certainly leads to data attrition at present. NASA’s long-standing public trust, which is essential for communicating
  findings about these phenomena to citizens, is crucial for destigmatizing UAP reporting. The scientific processes used
  by NASA encourage critical thinking; NASA can model for the public how to best approach the study of UAP, by utilizing
  transparent reporting, rigorous analysis, and public engagement.</p>
<p>Finally, the threat to U.S. airspace safety posed by UAP is self-evident. The panel finds that a particularly
  promising avenue for deeper integration within a systematic, evidenced-based framework for UAP is the Aviation Safety
  Reporting System (ASRS), which NASA administers for the FAA. This confidential and voluntary reporting system for
  pilots, air traffic controllers, and other professional aviation staff, receives approximately 100,000 reports per
  year. Although not initially designed for UAP collection, better harnessing it for commercial pilot UAP reporting
  would provide a critical database that would be valuable for the whole-of-government effort to understand UAP. In
  turn, NASA’s long history of partnership with the FAA should be leveraged to investigate how advanced, real-time
  analysis techniques could be applied to future generations of air traffic management (ATM) systems.</p>
