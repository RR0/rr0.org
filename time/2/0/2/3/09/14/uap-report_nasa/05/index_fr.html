<p>Nous recommandons que la <a href="/org/us/nasa">NASA</a> joue un rôle proéminent dans l'effort gouvernemental global
  pour comprendre les <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">PAN</a> en exploitant son expertise étendue afin de
  contribuer à une approche exhaustive, basée sur les preuves, aux racines de la <a href="/science/methode">méthode
    scientifique</a>. Nous recommandons en particulier que la <a href="/org/us/nasa">NASA</a> utilise ses existing and
  planned Earth-observing assets to probe the local environmental conditions associated with UAP that are initially
  detected by other means. In so doing, NASA can directly probe whether certain environmental factors are coincident
  with known UAP. We further recommend that NASA explore enhancing collaborations with the U.S. commercial
  remote-sensing industry, which offer powerful constellations of high-resolution Earth-observing satellites.</p>
<p>At present, the detection of UAP is often serendipitous, captured by sensors that were not designed or calibrated for
  this purpose, and which lack comprehensive metadata. Coupled with incomplete data archiving and curation, this means
  that the origin of numerous UAP remain uncertain. The importance of detecting UAP with multiple, well-calibrated
  sensors is thus paramount, and accordingly we recommend that NASA leverage its considerable expertise in this domain
  to potentially utilize multispectral or hyperspectral data as part of a rigorous data acquisition campaign.</p>
<p>In turn, the panel finds that sophisticated data analysis techniques, including artificial intelligence and machine
  learning, must be used in a comprehensive UAP detection campaign when coupled with systematic data gathering and
  robust curation. Here, we recommend that NASA’s expertise in these key areas be contributed to the whole-ofgovernment
  UAP effort.</p>
<p>The panel finds that public engagement in the effort to better understand UAP will be vital. NASA, by lending its
  name to UAP studies, is already helping to reduce stigma associated with reporting. Beyond this, we recommend that
  NASA explore the viability of developing or acquiring a crowdsourcing system, such as open-source smartphone-based
  apps, to gather imaging data and other smartphone sensor data from multiple citizen observers as part of a wider
  effort to more systematically gather public UAP reports.</p>
<p>Lastly, we recommend that the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) for commercial pilot UAP reporting be better
  leveraged, providing a critical database for the whole-ofgovernment effort to understand UAP. The agency's long
  history of partnership with the FAA should also be capitalized to investigate how advanced, real-time analysis
  techniques could be applied to future generations of air traffic management (ATM) systems.</p>
<p>In conclusion, NASA is uniquely positioned to contribute to a robust and systematic approach to studying UAP,
  furthering its mission of advancing scientific knowledge, technical expertise, and exploration. When considering the
  above recommendations, and according to budget priorities, NASA should leverage its core capabilities and expertise to
  determine whether it should take a leading or supporting role in implementing a given recommendation. The positioning
  of NASA’s role should further be situated within the context of the broader whole-of-government approach to
  understanding UAP.</p>
