<p>On June 9, 2022, NASA announced an independent study of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), with a focus on
  identifying how the Agency could address the question scientifically. Recently, many credible witnesses, often
  military aviators, have reported seeing objects they did not recognize over U.S. airspace. Most of these events have
  since been explained, but a small handful cannot be immediately identified as known humanmade or natural phenomena.
  These events are now collectively referred to as UAP. But are these objects real or are they sensor artifacts? Are
  they a threat to aerospace safety? Are they a threat to U.S. national security? Are they unknown natural phenomena?
  What else could they be?</p>
<p>This report outlines several approaches NASA could take if the Agency chooses to address the question of UAP.</p>
<p>A vital part of NASA’s mission is to explore the unknown. Often, the most exciting aspect of exploration is
  discovering unexplained phenomena. After discovery, the next step in charting the unknown requires applying rigorous
  scientific approaches to understand an observation. This means scrutinizing our assumptions and intuition;
  transparently and diligently collecting data; reproducing results; seeking independent evaluation; and finally,
  reaching a scientific consensus about the nature of an occurrence. It was Thomas Jefferson who, in an 1808 letter,
  wrote: “A thousand phenomena present themselves daily which we cannot explain, but where facts are suggested, bearing
  no analogy with the laws of nature as yet known to us, their verity needs proofs proportioned to their
  difficulty.”</p>
<p>Today, we summarize Jefferson’s conclusion as “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” This is
  especially true when it comes to claims that could profoundly change how we view our place in the cosmos. Over
  millennia, we’ve developed ever more powerful instruments to study the universe and each time we’ve looked at the
  sky—or our planet—in a different way, we’ve observed surprising and perplexing phenomena that at first defied
  explanation.</p>
<p>For example, in <time>1967</time>, astrophysics graduate student Jocelyn Bell-Burnell discovered a pulsing cosmic
  radio source. Its pulses were so regular—just like a ticking clock—that it at first seemed artificial in origin. But
  she eventually discovered that her confoundingly periodic cosmic object was a rapidly rotating neutron star: a pulsar.
  Today, scientists know of thousands of pulsars, and they can harness their clock-like rotation to probe everything
  from nuclear physics to gravitational waves produced by colliding supermassive black holes. In the 1960s, satellites
  also detected mysterious gamma-ray bursts. These initially looked like evidence for covert Cold War-era nuclear tests.
  Now, astronomers know that these tremendously energetic explosions are caused when massive stars cataclysmically
  collapse and die, and when stellar corpses violently collide.</p>
<p>Science has also solved mysteries that originated much closer to home, including the mechanisms behind
  bioluminescence and glittering atmospheric “sprites”—beautiful orange-red flashes of light that were reported for more
  than a hundred years but only scientifically explained recently. The crucial steps in understanding these events were
  the systematic collection of data, the rigorous testing of hypotheses, the development of new observational techniques
  to study unknowns, and an open and transparent scientific discussion.</p>
<p>The scientific method challenges us to solve problems by stringently evaluating our own ideas, by being willing to be
  wrong, and by following the data into unknown territory—wherever it may lead us. As Carl Sagan wrote in The
  Demon-Haunted World, “science carries us toward an understanding of how the world is, rather than how we would wish it
  to be.”</p>
<p>Science is a process that reveals reality rather than sculpts it—no matter how unsatisfying or confusing that reality
  might be.</p>
<p>That includes the question of whether UAP have an extraterrestrial origin. There is an intellectual continuum between
  hypothesizing that faraway extraterrestrial civilizations might produce detectable technologies, and looking for those
  technologies closer to home. But in the search for life beyond Earth, extraterrestrial life itself must be the
  hypothesis of last resort—the answer we turn to only after ruling out all other possibilities. As Sherlock Holmes
  said, “Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.”</p>
<p>To date, in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, there is no conclusive evidence suggesting an extraterrestrial
  origin for UAP. When it comes to UAP, the challenge we have is that the data needed to explain these anomalous
  sightings often do not exist; this includes eyewitness reports, which on their own can be interesting and compelling,
  but aren’t reproducible and usually lack the information needed to make any definitive conclusions about a
  phenomenon’s provenance.</p>
<p>This report offers a vision of how NASA could contribute to understanding the phenomena and how the agency’s approach
  might complement efforts by other federal entities. Congress has made the Department of Defense’s All-domain Anomaly
  Resolution Office (AARO) the lead Federal organization for resolving these anomalies. With its emphasis on open
  scientific inquiry, NASA can complement AARO’s work.</p>
<p>The following sections highlight the information provided to the panel, and our conclusions, over seven months of
  fact-finding.</p>
