<p>NASA is a science-driven agency committed to exploring and understanding air and space. That mission includes
  tackling unknown phenomena, whether in the farthest reaches of the universe or closer to home, as well as here on
  Earth. For more than 60 years, the Agency has focused on astronomy, astrophysics and aeronautics; it also uses
  space-based assets to study our home world’s aquatic, atmospheric, cryospheric, and terrestrial systems.</p>
<p>As a result of NASA’s long and storied history of space (and space-based) research, the Agency has amassed a robust
  and rigorous scientific arsenal for investigating unexplained observations, which will be crucial for studying UAP.
  The Agency has a variety of existing and planned assets—plus a trove of historic and current data sets—that could be
  used to address the challenges of detecting and/or understanding UAP. NASA research also employs a wide range of
  observation and analytical methods, using calibrated sensors, advanced data analysis, modeling, and cutting-edge
  computational and data visualization tools. As such, NASA’s missions, data, and technical expertise in science and
  engineering could help to investigate and understand reported UAP.</p>
<p>The panel considered how existing and/or planned NASA missions, data, experience, or studies might contribute to the
  understanding of UAP using global satellite and suborbital observations. Chiefly, NASA’s scientific discoveries,
  results, and databases are public. Already, an extensive data archive from NASA satellites and foreign partner space
  agencies is openly available, ensuring transparency as well as the opportunity for citizen scientist
  participation.</p>
<p>In Earth science, NASA’s core mission is to understand and protect our home planet. Passive radiometric
  Earthobserving missions, such as NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites, currently employ a range of sensors that collect
  information about Earth’s land, ocean, atmosphere, and other components. These data sets could help to identify
  weather, ocean, and other environmental characteristics coincident with UAP observations. New Earth-observing
  missions, such as NISAR (NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar), a partnership with the Indian Space Research
  Organization, will provide valuable radar data that could be helpful for examining UAP directly, in addition to their
  environmental context.</p>
<p>These newer observations live within a historical context. For more than 50 years, global time series data gathered
  by NASA (with partners including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA]) have allowed researchers
  to examine trends within and across components of Earth’s systems. Such long-term data sets help scientists better
  understand the evolving Earth, while also identifying natural and anthropogenic variability in the Earth system.
  Knowing that baseline allows researchers to detect and examine Earth’s environment for anomalies. Examples of
  naturally occurring anomalies include events such as harmful algal blooms, hurricanes and typhoons, changes in the jet
  stream, drought and fire conditions, and bioluminescence in the ocean. Understanding the origins of such large-scale
  phenomena is at the heart of NASA’s Earth science mission.</p>
<p>NASA has a long and successful record of partnering with other Federal agencies. In the study of UAP, the
  establishment of a NASA/AARO liaison will be an important step towards enabling interagency cooperation. In addition
  to the Agency’s Earth science research programs, NASA also supports programs in astrobiology. Some of these programs
  investigate life in extreme environments on Earth—with the hypothesis that such organisms and conditions could be
  analogs for habitable environments elsewhere in the universe. Other programs investigate the possibility that
  extraterrestrial life exists.</p>
<p>In astrophysics and space sciences, NASA is focused on understanding the universe. Looking for anomalies in both air
  and space will likely lead to novel discoveries; some might reveal entirely new physics, while others will be
  interesting and important even if their explanations lie in conventional physics. In time-domain astrophysics,
  researchers are increasingly interested in identifying unusual, transient events. At radio wavelengths, this includes
  the recent discovery of fast radio bursts, which astronomers are still struggling to understand. Recently, most
  innovation has been accomplished by combining information from multiple observatories that operate at different
  electromagnetic wavelengths, from radio and optical telescopes on the ground to ultraviolet and gamma-ray telescopes
  in space, and even with different messengers: neutrinos and gravitational waves. Observatories with extensive sky
  coverage and dense time coverage are ideal for spotting near-Earth objects with large proper motions and phenomena
  with anomalous time evolution. For example, the NASA Planetary Defense Coordination program is dedicated to leveraging
  NASA and partner astrophysical research assets to identify and classify near-Earth objects—such as asteroids—that move
  rapidly across the sky.</p>
<p>In addition to its extensive Federal and international partnerships, NASA is also uniquely capable of leveraging
  public and private partnerships—for example, working with commercial partners in Earth-observing satellite data. These
  collaborations could result in new technologies that may be useful in observing and understanding UAP. Partners,
  including other Federal agencies such as NOAA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), may collect data that
  could help to understand UAP. Moreover, NASA has a strong record of international collaboration, which could be
  beneficial, as the study of these phenomena would benefit from global cooperation and data sharing. Given NASA’s
  experience with long-term scientific projects and missions, the Agency is well equipped to handle the extensive and
  ongoing study that UAP investigation likely requires.</p>
<p>Many scientists and aviators consider the study of UAP to be “fringe” at best. The panel heard a first-hand account
  of the type of stigma that may come from reporting UAP, which almost certainly leads to attrition in reporting.</p>
<p>Recently, the DoD began encouraging military aviators to disclose anomalies they encountered, which resulted in a
  significant increase in UAP reports: Between March 5, 2021, and August 30, 2022, DoD received a total of 247 new UAP
  reports, according to an analysis published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) in 2022. In
  contrast, 263 reports had been filed in the 17 years prior to March 2021. Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick reported at this
  panel’s public meeting that AARO has now collected more than 800 reported events. This includes the addition of data
  from the FAA. AARO and ODNI assess that the observed increase in the reporting rate is partially due to a better
  understanding of the possible threats that UAP may represent—either as flight safety hazards or as potential adversary
  collection platforms. This is partially due to reduced stigma surrounding UAP reporting.</p>
<p>The negative stigma that impacts reporting rates in turn impacts the study of UAP. In testimony before the Senate
  Commerce, Science and Technology Committee on February 15, 2023, the Acting FAA Administrator was asked about the
  process for civilian reporting of balloons. The Administrator, who is also a pilot, indicated that the protocols and
  reporting of balloons may be spotty. Thus, even as such reports are being encouraged, there are still barriers to
  reporting observations. For example, how or where should someone make a report? Will the reporter be believed or
  shamed? Will any action be taken to understand the event?</p>
<p>NASA could play an important role in destigmatizing the UAP reporting process. NASA’s long-standing public trust,
  which is essential for communicating findings about these phenomena to the public, is also crucial for destigmatizing
  UAP reporting. The scientific processes used by NASA encourage critical thinking and skepticism; within this
  framework, there should be no credulous acceptance of unlikely reports with unlikely explanations. NASA can model for
  the public how to approach a topic, such as UAP, by applying transparent reporting and rigorous analyses.</p>
<p>Further, the NASA brand is trusted, global, and positive, representing science, curiosity, and technological
  achievement in the face of adversity. NASA serves as an example of professionalism and leadership in technological
  advancement. The NASA logo is enough to generate interest and credibility; studies of things that were previously
  fringe moved into the mainstream when NASA became involved. Prominent examples of NASA's involvement in public life
  include slogans like “NASA is with you when you fly,” which promote aviation safety. In turn, every U.S. commercial
  aircraft and every U.S. air traffic control tower has NASA-supported technology on board.</p>
<p>NASA’s public announcement of its UAP Independent Study Team membership was met with interest and spurred both
  positive and negative feedback. At least one scientist serving on the study team reported receiving negative (hate)
  mail from colleagues due to their membership. Others were ridiculed and criticized on social media. Study Team members
  also noted firsthand knowledge of colleagues who were warned to stay away from research in areas like extraterrestrial
  technosignatures, which could damage their scientific credibility and promotion potential. These experiences further
  confirm the negative stigma associated with studying unusual or unexplained phenomena. Such criticism, either by
  detractors or by proponents of the extraterrestrial hypothesis, are anathema to the scientific method, which NASA
  always has and will continue to promote in an objective and open-minded fashion.</p>
<p>As a Federal agency, NASA can make it safer for researchers to explore data within the civilian aerospace domain by
  starting that work within the Agency itself. NASA can look at how civil data is shared, study how reporting can be
  incentivized, and help to engage the community. For example, NASA can rally the civil space community through requests
  for information, by convening conferences, by offering grand challenges, and other activities.</p>
<p>Many Federal, state, local, private, and other domestic and international partners collect data and observations that
  could be relevant for understanding UAP. As an example, NASA’s potential to study the universe is enhanced through
  partnerships with other agencies, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DoE),
  which are currently building facilities such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory that will generate data that may be
  useful for understanding UAP in space. NASA’s ability to study Earth is enhanced through partnerships with NSF, which
  supports Antarctic research. The Antarctic is a superb environment for collecting meteorites. With its low level of
  human activity, it is a low “clutter” environment for identifying anomalies. Such sparsely occupied airspaces may
  offer a low background environment for UAP searches; however, it is unclear as to whether or not constraining the
  search geographically would exclude their presence, or whether environmental phenomena could also be a significant,
  location-dependent source of noise.</p>
<p>The Federal partnership between AARO and NASA already provides a foundation for a collaborative examination of UAP
  events. In addition, NASA and AARO should engage other agencies, as appropriate and as needed.</p>
<aside>
  <p>A well-known UAP event is the “GoFast” video, recorded by navy aviators from the USS Theodore Roosevelt. A still
    frame from this video is shown in the Figure below, where the infrared camera has locked onto a small object in the
    center. The video gives an impression of an object skimming above the ocean at a great velocity. But analysis of the
    numerical information on the display reveals a less extraordinary interpretation.</p>
  <img src="">
  <p>The circled numbers in the image provide the information needed to estimate the object’s altitude and velocity.
    This information includes (1) elevation angle of the camera (negative = downward), (2) azimuth angle of the camera,
    (3) target range in nautical miles, (4) the aircraft’s altitude in feet, (5) time reference in seconds, and (6)
    indicated air speed in knots. Using items 1, 3, and 4, plus a bit of trigonometry, we calculate that the object is
    at an altitude of 13,000 feet, and 4.2 miles from the ocean behind it (see middle panel). Given that the aircraft’s
    groundspeed is about 435 mph, we may conclude that the impression of rapid motion is at least partly due to the high
    velocity of the sensor, coupled with the parallax effect.</p>
  <p>We can use other information from the display to place some limits on the true velocity of the object. This
    analysis is summarized in the right-hand panel, which depicts an overhead view of the encounter during a 22-second
    interval. The jet was banking left at about 15° during this time, which corresponds to an approximate turning radius
    of 16 kilometers. We know the range and bearing of the object at the start (t=0s) and end (t=22s) times. Using the
    calculated true air speed (TAS) and a bit more trigonometry, we find the object moved about 390 meters during this
    22-second interval, which corresponds to an average speed of 40 mph. This is a typical wind speed at 13,000
    feet.</p>
  <p>Our calculation has neglected wind effects on the aircraft, and thus there is uncertainty in this result. But the
    analysis reveals that the object need not be moving at an extraordinary velocity. Note also that the object appears
    bright against a dark ocean for these display settings. This indicates that the object is colder than the ocean.
    There is thus no evidence of heat produced by a propulsion system. This further supports the conjecture that the
    object is most likely drifting with the wind. The availability of additional data would enable a more firm
    conclusion about the nature of this object.</p>

<p>U.S. Federal agencies that could support the effort to understand UAP include the DoD, Department of State, the FAA,
  the Department of Commerce (DoC) and major agencies within DoC including NOAA, the National Institute of Standards and
  Technology, and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, plus the DoE and NSF.</p>
