<p>There is no standardized Federal system for making civilian UAP reports. While the DoD is establishing a systematic
  mechanism for military UAP reports, <a
    href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc_html/chap9_section_8.html">current FAA guidelines</a>
  instruct persons wanting to report UAP to contact local law enforcement or a non-governmental organization such as the
  National UFO Reporting Center. This results in inhomogeneously collected, processed, and curated data.</p>
<p>Integrating NASA’s open, civilian dataset with DoD’s more focused, restricted information would take some effort.
  Additionally, data integration opportunities exist with NOAA. Assets such as the NEXRAD Doppler radar network (160
  weather radars jointly operated by the FAA, U.S. Air Force, and National Weather Service) or the Geostationary
  Operational Environmental Satellites may be very useful for distinguishing interesting objects from airborne
  (windborne) clutter.</p>
<p>Commercial remote sensing systems could be another source of high-quality UAP-relevant data, as high-resolution,
  high-cadence imagery captured by dense satellite constellations could resolve UAP events. For instance, commercial
  constellations provide daily (or more frequent) cadence imagery, at sub- to several- meter spatial resolution.
  However, integrating anomalous events across platforms, including radar data and commercial downward looking
  satellites, is an expensive exercise.</p>
<p>In addition to integration, data curation is also an important part of the scientific approach. Currently, studying
  even a single UAP event requires a heavy lift in retrieving data (and metadata, when available), which at the moment
  is entirely manual. It cannot be automated due to the poor organization and curation of the data. Organized data
  repositories are needed to facilitate automation in retrieving UAP data—and therefore, to facilitate the systematic,
  scientific approach to studying UAP. NASA’s extensive experience in data calibration, cleaning, curation, management,
  and distribution, and its practice of making all of its data accessible to the public, could be leveraged to set up
  curated data repositories for the study of UAP. These repositories could include data from NASA assets that are
  suitable for the study of UAP, as well as crowd-sourced data from NASA-related platforms.</p>
<p>Curated public repositories of UAP data would facilitate data mining (or knowledge discovery from data) by scientists
  and citizen scientists. Several platforms built for analyzing scientific data have led to historical scientific
  discoveries. For example, the Galaxy Zoo, a platform that collects astrophysical data and enables citizen-scientist
  projects, led to the discovery of Boyajian’s Star—a star with unique and peculiar fluctuations in brightness that at
  one point was considered a potential signature of alien technology. Years later, the star’s behavior was understood to
  be the work of a disk of disrupted comets.</p>
<p>A strategy that encourages citizen analysis of UAP data would bring an element of transparency to the field that
  could help combat biases, preconceived skepticism, and mistrust of authorities. Opening the analysis to a large
  audience would also improve robustness: Multiple competing but independent teams, working on solving science’s biggest
  questions, provide an additional layer of verification. As an example, the unexpected finding that the universe is
  expanding at an accelerating rate (because of the mysterious force that we now call “dark energy”) is a good example
  of how that might work. In the 1990s, two independent teams simultaneously found evidence for the accelerating cosmos
  using data that had been collected and analyzed independently.</p>
