<p>When searching for a signal in data, scientists often have to separate and extract it from a complex background of
  signals produced by unrelated phenomena—commonly referred to as simply “background,” noise, or clutter. Therefore,
  when looking for rare and unusual events, a common strategy is to search where there is little background noise. For
  example, neutrino experiments are often conducted underground (e.g. the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy,
  IceCUBE in Antarctica); most particles cannot reach those depths because they are absorbed by the Earth. Meteorite
  hunters are often most successful in Antarctica—any rock found on top of a glacier is an interesting object.</p>
<p>In contrast, the airspace near military sites is a challenging place to search for UAP: human aircrafts, drones,
  balloons, and other objects, are all significant sources of background.</p>
<p>Geographically, sparsely occupied airspaces—such above the South Pole—may offer a low background environment for UAP
  searches. But UAP are poorly understood, and it’s not clear whether limiting the search geographically would exclude
  their presence, or whether environmental phenomena could also be a significant, location-dependent source of noise.
  Another background-limiting strategy would be to examine astronomical plates for satellites prior to <time>1959</time>,
  when Sputnik, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576522000480">the first artificial
    satellite of Earth</a> launched. (Although, if something unusual were to be found in historical astronomical plates,
  it would be difficult to verify its nature with additional data, as historical records may be incomplete, lost,
  intractable, not reproducible, and at best laborious to cross-reference.)</p>
<p>Fortunately, modern analytical techniques have improved our ability to find extremely rare signals within a sea of
  clutter, whether that is one Higgs event in 1010 collisions with the Large Hadron Collider, or a small number of
  photons from an exoplanet hiding in a billion stellar background photons. If the background cannot be minimized, it
  has to be characterized in detail and completely; detailed knowledge of the signatures (morphological, spectroscopic,
  kinematic) of all known airborne events need to be incorporated to eliminate spurious detections of known phenomena.
  This requires an extensive study of known events with accurately calibrated instruments.</p>
<p>There are numerous balloons and drones in the air at any moment. Observers may report some of these conventional
  objects as anomalies. The DoD already has the responsibility of alert response to unexplained aircraft in U.S.
  airspace. NASA could be a partner in the search for aerospatial events by enabling cross-identification with anomalies
  in the Earth-space environment. Since NASA data are already public and offered to the world in well-curated
  repositories accessible programmatically, the Agency’s portfolio is set up to enable cross-referencing with NASA data
  and contribute to this characterization.</p>
<p>A database that supports the characterization of background signals should include information about the launch rate
  of balloons (weather, scientific, commercial, hobbyist, and military—where allowed by national security
  considerations); number of aircraft in the sky across the United States and the globe; daily drone launch rate within
  U.S. airspace; as well as characteristics of the appearance and motion capabilities of these items.</p>
<p>There are two approaches to detecting anomalies in large datasets. If you are looking for a needle in a haystack, one
  approach is to have a detailed model of the properties of needles and look for anything that looks like a needle. The
  other approach is to have an accurate model of the properties of hay and look for anything that looks different from
  hay.</p>
<p>In the first approach, if one knows the signal to expect, a model (or simulations) can be developed to look for that
  signal in large datasets. While we may be able to anticipate the sorts of signals produced by physical systems that
  adhere to known laws of physics, we cannot comprehensively envision all possible signals that could explain UAP, or
  that come from new technology or new physics (were it adversarial, extraterrestrial, or a naturally occurring but
  as-of-yet unknown phenomena).</p>
<p>The alternative approach to detecting anomalies requires a deep and thorough knowledge of what is normal and known,
  which can subsequently be separated from what is anomalous and unknown.</p>
<p>Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for the search for rare events, such as the creation of a Higgs Boson
  at an accelerator, the detection of rare cancer types, or the detection of fraudulent credit card charges to
  intrusions in cyber infrastructure. Machine learning and AI can play a role in the study of UAP, but not until the
  data both meet the standards described above and enable an extensive characterization of known and anomalous
  signals.</p>
<p>A recommendation about which methodologies specifically should be applied to this problem cannot be given at this
  time, as that selection depends on the nature of the data to be analyzed. Thus this question should be asked after (or
  ideally together with) the questions pertaining to UAP observing platforms and curated repositories for UAP data. Once
  the nature of the data is established, selecting algorithms for their analysis can be completed.</p>
<p>However, in the broad and lively domain of anomaly detection it is likely that methodologies for studying UAP already
  exist or can be adapted from analytical methods developed in other fields. Developing entirely new methodologies will
  likely be unnecessary and even a waste of resources, though adapting existing methods will still require some amount
  of dedicated effort. NASA could leverage its name, broad reach, and popularity to encourage and support an extensive
  review of existing methods for anomaly detection in the context of multidisciplinary conferences, workshops, and data
  challenges with mock datasets.</p>
