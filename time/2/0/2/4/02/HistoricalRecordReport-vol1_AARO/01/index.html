<p>This report represents Volume I of the <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office’s
  (AARO)</a> Historical Record Report (HR2) which reviews the record of the United States Government (USG) pertaining to
  <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP)</a>. In completing this report, AARO
  reviewed all official USG investigatory efforts since <time>1945</time>, researched classified and unclassified
  archives, conducted approximately 30 interviews, and partnered with <a href="/org/us/ic">Intelligence Community
    (IC)</a> and <a href="/org/us/dod">Department of Defense (DoD)</a> officials responsible for controlled and special
  access program oversight, respectively. AARO will publish Volume II in accordance with the date established in Section
  6802 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year <time>2023</time> (FY23); Volume II will provide
  analysis of information acquired by AARO after the date of the publication of Volume I.</p>
<p>Since <time>1945</time>, the USG has funded and supported UAP investigations with the goal of determining whether UAP
  represented a flight safety risk, technological leaps by competitor nations, or evidence of off-world technology under
  intelligent control. These investigations were managed and implemented by a range of experts, scientists, academics,
  military, and intelligence officials under differing leaders—all of whom held their own perspectives that led them to
  particular conclusions on the origins of UAP. However, they all had in common the belief that UAP represented an
  unknown and, therefore, theoretically posed a potential threat of an indeterminate nature.</p>
<p>AARO’s mission is similar to that of these earlier organizations. <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>
  methodology applies both the scientific method and intelligence analysis tradecraft to identify and help mitigate
  risks UAP may pose to domain safety and to discover, characterize, and attribute potential competitor technological
  systems.</p>
<p>A consistent theme in popular culture involves a particularly persistent narrative that the USG—or a secretive
  organization within it—recovered several off-world spacecraft and extraterrestrial biological remains, that it
  operates a program or programs to reverse engineer the recovered technology, and that it has conspired since the 1940s
  to keep this effort hidden from the United States Congress and the American public.</p>
<p>AARO recognizes that many people sincerely hold versions of these beliefs which are based on their perception of past
  experiences, the experiences of others whom they trust, or media and online outlets they believe to be sources of
  credible and verifiable information. The proliferation of television programs, books, movies, and the vast amount of
  internet and social media content centered on UAP-related topics most likely has influenced the public conversation on
  this topic, and reinforced these beliefs within some sections of the population. The goal of this report is not to
  prove or disprove any particular belief set, but rather to use a rigorous analytic and scientific approach to
  investigate past USG-sponsored UAP investigation efforts and the claims made by interviewees that the USG and various
  contractors have recovered and are hiding off-world technology and biological material. AARO has approached this
  project with the widest possible aperture, thoroughly investigating these assertions and claims without any particular
  pre-conceived conclusion or hypothesis. <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> is committed to reaching
  conclusions based on empirical evidence.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> thanks all participants in this review who made this report
  possible, to include the interviewees who came forward with information.</p>
