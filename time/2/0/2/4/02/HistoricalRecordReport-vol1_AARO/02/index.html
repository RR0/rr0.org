<p><strong>AARO found no evidence that any USG investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has
  confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology.</strong> All investigative efforts, at
  all levels of classification, concluded that most sightings were ordinary objects and phenomena and the result of
  misidentification. Although not the focus of this report, it is worthwhile to note that all official foreign UAP
  investigatory efforts to date have reached the same general conclusions as USG investigations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Although many UAP reports remain unsolved or unidentified, AARO assesses that if more and better quality data were
    available, most of these cases also could be identified and resolved as ordinary objects or phenomena. Sensors and
    visual observations are imperfect; the vast majority of cases lack actionable data or the data available is limited
    or of poor quality.</li>
  <li>Resources and staffing for these programs largely have been irregular and sporadic, challenging investigatory
    efforts and hindering effective knowledge transfer.</li>
  <li>The vast majority of reports almost certainly are the result of misidentification and a direct consequence of the
    lack of domain awareness; there is a direct correlation between the amount and quality of available information on a
    case with the ability to conclusively resolve it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AARO found no empirical evidence for claims that the USG and private companies have been reverse-engineering
  extraterrestrial technology. AARO determined, based on all information provided to date, that claims involving
  specific people, known locations, technological tests, and documents allegedly involved in or related to the
  reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial technology, are inaccurate. Additional claims will be addressed in Volume
  II.</strong> AARO successfully located the USG and industry programs, officials, companies, executives, and documents
  identified by interviewees. In many cases, the interviewees named authentic USG classified programs well-known and
  understood to those appropriately accessed to them in the Executive Branch and Legislative Branch; however, the
  interviewees mistakenly associated these authentic USG programs with alien and extraterrestrial activity. AARO has
  reached the following, high confidence conclusions related to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>UAP Nondisclosure Agreements (NDA)</b>: AARO has found no evidence of any authentic UAP-related NDA or other
    evidence threatening death or violence for disclosing UAP information.</li>
  <li><b>A CIA Official Allegedly Managed UAP Experimentation</b>: The named, former CIA official was not involved in
    the movement of extraterrestrial technology. The same former CIA officer signed a memo rejecting a claim made by
    interviewees that he managed the movement of and experimentation on off-world technology. • Alleged UAP Intelligence
    Community Document: An alleged <time>1961</time> Special National Intelligence Estimate that was “leaked” to online
    sources and suggests the extraterrestrial nature of “UFOs,” is inauthentic.</li>
  <li><b>“Aliens” Present During a DoD Technology Test</b>: AARO reviewed information related to an account of an
    interviewee overhearing a conversation about a technology test at a military base where “aliens” allegedly were
    observing, and AARO judges that the interviewee misunderstood the conversation.</li>
  <li><b>Claim That a Military Officer Touched an Off-World Craft</b>: An interviewee claim that a named former military
    officer explained in detail how he physically touched an extraterrestrial spacecraft is inaccurate. The claim was
    denied on the record by the named former officer who recounted a story of when he touched an <a
      href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/f117">F-117</a> Nighthawk stealth fighter that could have been misconstrued by the
    interviewee, though the named former officer does not recall having this conversation with the interviewee.</li>
  <li><b>Test of Off-World Technology</b>: An interviewee claim that he witnessed what he believed to be the testing of
    extraterrestrial technology at a USG facility almost certainly was an observation of an authentic, non-UAP-related,
    technology test that strongly correlated in time, location, and description provided in the interviewee’s account.
  </li>
  <li><b>UAP Disclosure Study</b>: Interviewees’ claims that between 2004 and 2007 the White House requested a research
    institute in Virginia study the theoretical societal impacts of disclosing that UAP are extraterrestrial in origin;
    AARO confirmed the study was conducted, but it was not requested by the White House.</li>
  <li><b>Named Companies Allegedly Experimenting on Alien Technology</b>: AARO has found no evidence that U.S. companies
    ever possessed off-world technology. The executives, scientists, and chief technology officers of the companies
    named by interviewees met with the Director of AARO and denied on the record that they have ever recovered,
    possessed, or engaged in reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial technology.</li>
  <li><b>Experimentation on Alleged Extraterrestrial Spacecraft Sample</b>: AARO has concluded that a sample from an
    alleged crashed off-world spacecraft that AARO acquired from a private UAP investigating organization and the U.S.
    Army is a manufactured, terrestrial alloy and does not represent off-world technology or possess any exceptional
    qualities. The sample is primarily composed of magnesium, zinc, and bismuth with some other trace elements, such as
    lead. This assessment was based on its materials characterization.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AARO assesses that all of the named and described alleged hidden UAP reverse- engineering programs provided
  by interviewees either do not exist; are misidentified authentic, highly sensitive national security programs that are
  not related to extraterrestrial technology exploitation; or resolve to an unwarranted and disestablished
  program.</strong> AARO created a secure process in partnership with the highest-level security officials within the
  DoD, IC, and other organizations to research and investigate these programs; AARO was granted full, unrestricted
  access by all organizations. It is important to note that none of the interviewees had firsthand knowledge of these
  programs—they were not approved for access to nor did they work on these efforts—which likely resulted in
  misinterpretation of the programs’ origins and purpose.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The interviewees and others who have mistakenly associated authentic sensitive national security programs
    with UAP had incomplete or unauthorized access to these programs; discussion of these programs outside of secure
    facilities presents a high risk of exposing national security information.</strong></li>
  <li>One named program was a UAP-related Prospective Special Access Program (PSAP) called KONA BLUE that was proposed
    to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and supported by individuals who believed the USG was hiding off-world
    technology. The program was never approved by DHS and its supporters never provided empirical evidence to support
    their claims.</li>
  <li>In <time>2021</time>, without sufficient justification, the scope of an IC Controlled Access Program was expanded
    to protect UAP reverse-engineering. This program never recovered or reverse-engineered any UAP or extraterrestrial
    spacecraft. This IC program was disestablished due to its lack of merit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AARO assesses that the inaccurate claim that the USG is reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology and
  is hiding it from Congress is, in large part, the result of circular reporting from a group of individuals who believe
  this to be the case, despite the lack of any evidence.</strong> AARO notes that although claims that the USG has
  recovered and hidden spacecraft date back to the 1940s and 1950s, more modern instances of these claims largely stem
  from a consistent group of individuals who have been involved in various UAP-related endeavors since at least 2009.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many of these individuals were involved in or supportive of a cancelled DIA program and the subsequent but failed
    attempt to reestablish this program under DHS, called KONA BLUE.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AARO assesses that UAP sightings and reports of these sightings to USG organizations and claims that some UAP
  constitute extraterrestrial craft and that the USG has secured and is experimenting on extraterrestrial technology
  have been influenced by a range of cultural, political, and technological factors.</strong> AARO bases this conclusion
  on the following factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The aggregate findings of all USG investigations to date have not found even one case of UAP representing
    off-world technology.</li>
  <li>None of the programs mentioned by interviewees are UAP reverse-engineering programs, and all the authentic
    programs have been properly notified and reported to Congress through the congressional defense and/or intelligence
    committees.</li>
  <li>AARO has no evidence for the USG reverse-engineering narrative provided by interviewees and has been able to
    disprove the majority of the interviewees’ claims. Some claims are still under evaluation.</li>
  <li>AARO determined that a piece of metal alleged to be recovered from an off-world spacecraft is ordinary, of
    terrestrial origin, and possesses no exceptional qualities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Several factors—domestic and international—most likely influenced sightings, reports, and the belief by some
  individuals that there is sufficient proof that some UAP represent extraterrestrial technology.</strong> AARO’s
  examination of the historical context of UAP investigations from <time>1945</time> to the present reveals that these
  factors—some common to and distinct between the earlier era of UAP investigations (pre-<time>2009</time>) and the
  modern era (post-<time>2009</time>)— undoubtedly influenced the direction of these investigations, the volume of and
  spikes in sightings, and the overall public interest, concern, and debate. These periods are divided into pre- and
  post-<time>2009</time> timeframe because this is the year of the standup of the Advanced Aerospace Weapons System
  Application Program (<a href="/org/us/dod/dia/dwo/projet/aawsa">AAWSA</a>P) and <a
    href="/org/us/dod/dia/projet/aatip">Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP)</a> efforts. Prior to
  AAWSAP/AATIP there was about a 40 year gap in UAP investigation programs since the termination of <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project BLUE BOOK</a> in <time>1969</time>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Common contextual factors between earlier and modern investigations include a rapidly evolving and dynamic
    national security environment, concern about technological surprise, intense secrecy related to government military
    programs, public interest in UAP, perceived bureaucratic barriers, and the persistent lack of quality data.</li>
  <li>Some contextual factors that were distinct between earlier and modern investigations include: differences in the
    level of public trust in the government; the large volume of popular culture content related to UAP; the perception
    within some segments of the population that the USG is hiding extraterrestrial technology; unauthorized disclosures
    of classified programs mistaken for UAP observations; the proliferation of online sources that reinforce these
    beliefs; the impact that social media has had on circular reporting; and the rapid spread of misinformation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AARO assesses that some portion of sightings since the 1940s have represented misidentification of
  never-before-seen experimental and operational space, rocket, and air systems, including stealth technologies and the
  proliferation of drone platforms.</strong> From the 1940s to the 1960s especially, the United States witnessed a boom
  in experimental technologies driven by World War II and the Cold War.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many of these technologies fit the description of a stereotypical <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/UFO.html">Unidentified
    Flying Object (UFO)</a>. It is understandable how observers unfamiliar with these programs could mistake sightings
    of these new technologies as something extraordinary, even other-worldly.</li>
  <li>Along with these conventional technology research areas, the USG started the <a href="/org/us/dod/Manhattan.html">Manhattan
    Project</a> in <time>1942</time>. This program operated in secrecy and led to the establishment of several “secret
    cities” across the United States to support the development of the nuclear bomb. Any misunderstanding stemming from
    the intense secrecy surrounding this and similar programs could have been misconstrued for other efforts.</li>
</ul>
