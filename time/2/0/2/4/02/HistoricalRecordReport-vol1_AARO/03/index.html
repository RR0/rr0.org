  <h2>Scope</h2>
  <p>This HR2 is provided by DoD in response to a requirement established in the National Defense Authorization Act
    (NDAA) for FY 2023, Section 6802(j), which states: “Not later than 540 days after the date of the enactment of the
    Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, the Director of the Office shall submit to the congressional
    defense committees, the congressional intelligence committees and the congressional leadership a written report
    detailing the historical record of the United States Government relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena.” This
    report, pursuant to the legislation, is based upon the records and documents of the IC and DoD, oral history
    interviews, open source analysis, interviews of current and former government officials, and classified and
    unclassified archives.</p>
  <p>AARO will provide its findings to Congress in two volumes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Volume 1 contains AARO’s findings from <time>1945/2023-10-31</time> based on the requirements, and:</li>
    <li>Volume 2 will include any findings resulting from interviews and research completed from <time>2023-11-01/2024-04-15.</time>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>AARO interviewed approximately 30 people who claimed to have insight into alleged USG involvement in off-world
    technology exploitation or to possess knowledge of UAP that have allegedly disrupted U.S. nuclear facilities in the
    past.</p>

  <h2>Assumptions</h2>
  <p>AARO and DoD assume that individuals convey their accurate recollection of their perception of the events they
    observed or heard. It is important to note that AARO cannot discount nor rely on interviewee accounts alone because
    of the extraordinary claims contained in their reports. Although individual accounts are important, they are only
    one element of the larger picture and provide AARO with the opportunity to initiate an investigation. However, any
    final assessment on the veracity of these accounts must be accompanied by provable facts.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some literature suggests individual accounts can be unreliable as they are subject to a person’s interpretation
      of sensory data through the filter of their experiences, beliefs, or state of mind during the event. A person who
      reports a case might be credible, in that they believe the elements of their account to be accurate. However,
      their reliability, which is their ability to accurately interpret events—as well as to recall and convey those
      events due to a range of factors—is altogether different from their inherent sincerity <span class="source">Anjali Nandan, “Eyewitness Testimony: A Psychological and Legal Perspective,” Journal of
      Positive School of Psychology, 2022; Biswa Prakesh Nayak & H. Khajuria, “Eyewitness
      Testimony: Probative Value in the Criminal Justice System,” Egyptian Journal of Forensic

      Testimony,” from the Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Public Relations and
      Social Sciences, Atlantis Press, 2021</span>.</li>
    <li>Similarly, confirmation bias is a recognized subconscious cognitive process whereby a person tends to seek and
      believe information that supports their hypothesis and to discount information that undermines their hypothesis

    <li>AARO remains open to additional, verifiable information that may alter the conclusions rendered in Volume I and
      will note any changes to the findings in this report in Volume II.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Note on “UAP” Nomenclature</h2>
  <p>Use of the UAP naming convention, while imperfect, is the best manner in which to characterize the multitude of
    unidentified reported sightings. AARO understands that the use of “UAP” to refer to all potential possibilities
    provides a false sense of commonality; such as their origins, identity, purpose, type, and threat they may pose. The
    only commonality that they all share, at least initially, is that they are each unidentified. Beyond initially being
    unidentified or misidentified, drones, balloons, aircraft, rockets, rocket exhaust plumes, satellites, infrared (IR)
    aberrations, sensor artifacts, birds, stars, planets, indistinct lights, vague radar returns, meteors, and optical
    effects—such as parallax—have nothing in common.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Congressional Oversight</h2>
  <p>DoD is committed to providing timely and thorough reporting to Congress and to transparency with the American
    public. Since its establishment, AARO has endeavored to keep Congress fully and currently informed of its activities
    and findings at all levels of classification. AARO and DoD will continue to share the status and findings of its
    research at the appropriate level of classification with Congress.</p>

<section>
  <h2>AARO’s HR2 Program of Analysis</h2>
  <p>AARO established six complementary lines of effort (LOEs) to conduct the HR2 research with the goal of ensuring
    this report conveys an accurate and complete picture. LOEs were conducted in parallel and reinforced each another; a
    lead in one LOE drove new research and pursuits in another. AARO’s goal was to conduct thorough cross-checks to vet
    all information to discover and close gaps in its understanding. These LOEs were to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Conduct open-source research</b> on claims (through historical interviews) about USG investigations of,
      contact with, and recovery of UAP, as well as exploitation of alleged UAP material and technology.</li>
    <li><b>Conduct classified program research</b> across the IC, DoD, and interagency to validate or invalidate any
      claims of classified programs derived from historical interviews.</li>
    <li><b>Conduct historical interviews</b> of individuals who claim knowledge of alleged USG activities related to
      UAP.</li>
    <li><b>Partner with the U.S. National Archives</b> on locating UAP data, refining requests based on the discovery of
      new
      leads derived from historical interviews, as well as open-source and classified research.</li>
    <li><b>Engage with commercial entities</b> on named companies alleged to have worked with the USG on UAP recovery
      and alleged exploitation of UAP technology.</li>
    <li><b>Partner with the archives of key intelligence and national security agencies</b> such as the <a
      href="/org/us/dod/dia">Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)</a>, the <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">Central Intelligence
      Agency (CIA)</a>, <a href="/org/us/DoE.html">Department of Energy (DOE)</a>, <a href="/org/us/ic/nsa">National
      Security Agency (NSA)</a>, the <a href="/org/us/dod/nga">National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)</a>, the
      Services, and DoD Combatant Commands.</li>
  </ul>
