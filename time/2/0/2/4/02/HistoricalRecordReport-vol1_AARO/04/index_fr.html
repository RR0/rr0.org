  <h2>Résumé</h2>
  <p>L'<a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> a examiné les efforts officiels du gouvernement américain liés
    aux OVNIs/PANs depuis <time>1945</time>. Cette recherche a révélé l'existence d'à peu près deux douzaines d'efforts
    d'enquête distincts, en fonction de comment on les compte. Ces efforts ont varié de programmes formels distincts
    employant du personnel dédié avec une certaine longévité comprenant : les projets SAUCER/<a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/sign">SIGN</a>, <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge">GRUDGE</a> et <a

      href="/org/us/dod">Ministère de la Défense</a> menée par la <a href="/org/us/dod/navy">Marine américaine (<abbr

      href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">Bureau de Résolution des Anomalies Tous Domaines (<abbr
      title="All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office">AARO</abbr>)</a>. Il y eut aussi des projets à court terme qui
    contribuèrent à certains de ces programmes établis comme  : les projets <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge/twinkle">TWINKLE</a> et <a
      href="/org/us/bmi/projet/Stork.html">BEAR</a> ainsi que les demandes de court terme sur ou des examens de cas
    spécifiques, comme les 2 rapports de l'USAF sur Roswell. De plus, il y eut des efforts that amounted to short-term,
    outside reviews of USAF-established programs ; such as the <a
      href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a>-sponsored Study Group, the Robertson Panel, the Durant Report, and the University of
    Colorado’s Condon Report (contracted by the USAF). Some of these efforts, including Projects SAUCER and <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/sign">SIGN</a>, were closely connected and essentially the same organization.
    <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge">Project GRUDGE</a> was the name given to two related, but different
    organizations; the second—reorganized Project GRUDGE—was established about a year after the dissolution of the
    original <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge">Project GRUDGE</a>.</p>

  <h2>Project SAUCER (1946/1947–January 1948)</h2>
  <p><b>Background</b>: The exact date of the founding of this first effort as well as its official and unofficial name
    are unclear. According to one source, General Nathan Twining, Commander of the Air Technical Services Command,
    established Project SAUCER on December 30, 1947, to collect and evaluate all information relating to UFO sightings
    which could be construed as of concern to the national security. Captain Edward Ruppelt claimed that Project SAUCER
    was the informal name of Project SIGN and it was designated a high priority. However, in an interview with an
    employee of Project SIGN, the employee claimed the project started a year earlier, in <time>1946</time>, and that
    Project SAUCER was its original, informal name <span class="source"><a
      href="https://military-history.fandom.com/wikiProject-Sign">https://military-history.fandom.com/wikiProject-Sign</a>; Connors, Wendy, Project Blue Book</span>.
    A dearth of data and information is associated with this effort <span class="source">Edward J. Ruppelt, The <a

    </span>.</p>
  <p>Project SAUCER investigated one of the first well-known accounts provided by a private pilot, <span

    while flying near Mount Rainier, Washington, he <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MontRainier">saw nine,
      large circular objects flying in a formation, objects</a> that periodically flipped and were traveling at 1,700
    miles per hour. He also compared the flight characteristics as the <q>tail of a Chinese kite</q> <span

    was picked up by several media outlets, and the term “flying saucer” emerged.7</p>
  <p><b>Results</b>: Project SAUCER did not find evidence of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

  <h2>Project SIGN (January 1948–February 1949)</h2>
  <p><b>Background</b>: Project SAUCER was formalized into an official, high-priority program named Project SIGN. The <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic">Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC)</a> assumed control of Project SIGN on
    <time>1948-01-23</time>. (ATIC later became the National Air and Space Intelligence Center - NASIC). The impetus for
    this effort was to determine if these objects might be Soviet secret weapons or “extraplanetary” objects. The staff
    seemed confident that after a few months of work they could reach a conclusion. As part of their work, the staff at
    Project SIGN reviewed all of the military’s intelligence on German weaponry and aeronautical capabilities to
    determine if some might have fallen into Soviet possession <span class="source">Edward J. Ruppelt, <a

  </p>
  <p><b>Results</b>: The project evaluated 243 reported UFO sightings, and in <time>1949-02</time>, it concluded that
    <q>no definite and conclusive evidence is yet available that would prove or disprove the existence of these
      unidentified objects as real aircraft of unknown and unconventional configuration.</q> <span class="source">J. Marker, “Public Interest in UFOs Persists 50 Years after Project Blue Book Termination,” 2019;
    Hector Quintanilla, Jr., “The Investigation of UFOs,” Studies in Intelligence, Vol. 10, No. 4 (Fall
    1966), 95-110.</span> Project SIGN determined that nearly all were caused by either misinterpretation of known
    objects, hysteria, hallucination, or hoax <span class="source">Hector Quintanilla, Jr., “<a

  <h2>Project GRUDGE (Original Organization) (February–December 1949)</h2>
  <p><b>Background</b>: <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/sign">Project SIGN</a> was renamed <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge">Project GRUDGE</a> in approximately <time>1949-02</time>. The staff,
    especially those who seemed to lean towards belief in the “interplanetary” origin of UFOs, were reportedly purged
    from the organization. One account of this time period suggests that because of perceived pressure from the
    Pentagon’s leadership, the remaining staff who held this view changed their minds. This same account claims that the
    Pentagon’s goals for <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge">Project GRUDGE</a> were to discount and explain
    away all reports of UFOs <span class="source">Edward J. Ruppelt, <a

    <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge">Project GRUDGE</a> was terminated on <time>1949-12-27</time>, around
    the time a comprehensive report on its findings was published. The USAF did not stop collecting and analyzing
    reports of UFOs; rather, it folded that work into its existing intelligence processes.</p>
  <p><b>Results</b>: <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge">Project GRUDGE</a> investigated 244 reports of UFO
    sightings. It did not discover any evidence that the UAP sightings represented foreign technology; therefore, these
    findings did not pose a threat to U.S. national security <span class="source">Gerald K. Haines, “<a

      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge">Project GRUDGE</a>’s very existence fueled a “war hysteria” within
    the public. The USAF subsequently implemented a public affairs campaign designed to persuade the public that UFOs
    constituted nothing unusual or extraordinary. The stated goal of this effort was to alleviate public anxiety <span

  <h2>Project TWINKLE (Summer 1949–Summer 1950)</h2>
  <p><b>Background</b>: <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge/twinkle">Project TWINKLE</a> was established in
    the summer of <time>1949</time> to investigate a series of UFO reports witnessed by numerous observers in Nevada and
    New Mexico. These UFOs were described as “<a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/GreenFireballs">green
      fireballs</a>” streaking across the sky, moving in odd ways, and—in at least one account—the fireball navigated
    near an aircraft. The literature is not clear if <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge/twinkle">Project TWINKLE</a> was officially supported by the original

  <h2>Project GRUDGE (Reestablishment) (October 1951–March 1952)</h2>
  <p><b>Background</b>: In late <time>1951-10</time>, almost two years after <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge">Project GRUDGE</a> was disestablished, the USAF’s UFO mission was
    reorganized into another distinct program—also named <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge">Project
      GRUDGE</a>—led by Capt Ruppelt. By his own account, Capt Ruppelt sought to correct the mistakes of Project SIGN
    and the former <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge">Project GRUDGE</a>. His primary goal was to ensure
    that there would be “no wild speculation” and that if his staff were “too pro or too con” regarding the off-world
    origin of UFOs, they would be let go. He claimed to have fired three staff. He also realized that he needed a range
    of scientific expertise which he sourced through a contract he dubbed Project BEAR. Capt Ruppelt set a policy that
    was intended to foster objectivity. Unlike the previous <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge">Project
      GRUDGE</a>, he allowed his staff to create an “unknown” category of cases which he hoped would dissuade the
    forcing of a particular answer to any case. The new <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge">Project
      GRUDGE</a> reviewed all of the previous cases in Project SIGN, old <a

  </p>
  <p><b>Results</b>: The new <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge">Project GRUDGE</a> noticed that there was
    some correlation between sightings and the publication of UFO stories in the media. Capt Ruppelt noted that there
    were concentrations of cases in the Los Alamos-Albuquerque area, Oak Ridge, White Sands, Strategic Air Command

    reliability of interviewee information recall from UFO sightings, created an improved debriefing questionnaire for
    observers, and developed a computer punch-card system. This system helped automate the statistical study of all the
    UFO reports in <a

    Robert Amory Jr., tasked the CIA <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/osi">Office of Scientific Intelligence’s (OSI)</a> Physics
    and Electronics Division to review UFO cases. A. Ray Gordon took lead on this project, and the Study Group he

  </p>
  <p><b>Results</b>: The Study Group assessed that 90 percent of the reports were explainable and the other 10 percent
    amounted to “incredible” claims but rejected the notion that they represented Soviet or extraterrestrial technology.
    The group also studied Soviet press and found no reports of UFOs, leading the group to assume that the Soviets were
    deliberately suppressing such reports. The Study Group also believed that the Soviets could use reports of UFOs to

  <p><a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project BLUE BOOK</a> organized its cases into one of three
    categories: <b>identified</b>, <b>insufficient data</b>, and <b>unidentified</b>. For those reports that were
    categorized as identified, <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project BLUE BOOK</a> staff used the
    following categorization schema:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Astronomical Sightings</b>: These consisted of bright stars, planets, comets, fireballs, meteors, auroral
      streamers, and other celestial bodies. When observed through haze, light fog, moving clouds, or other obscurations
      or unusual conditions, the planets— including Venus, Jupiter and Mars—were often reported as UFOs.</li>
    <li><b>Balloons</b>: These included weather balloons, radiosondes, and large research balloons with diameters up to
      300 feet, which together accounted for several thousand cases. Balloons were released daily from military and
      civilian airports, weather stations, and research activities. Reflection of the sun on balloons at dawn and sunset
      sometimes produced strange effects which led to many UFO reports. Large balloons can move at speeds of over 100
      miles per hour when in high-altitude wind streams.</li>
    <li><b>Aircraft</b>: According to <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project BLUE BOOK</a>, various
      aircraft accounted for another major source of UFO reports; particularly during adverse weather conditions. The
      staff noted that when observed at high altitudes and at a distance, the reflection of the sun on aircrafts’
      surfaces can make them appear as “disc” or “rocket-shaped. ” They also noted that vapor or condensation trails
      from jet aircraft will sometimes appear to glow fiery red or orange when reflecting sunlight.</li>
    <li><b>Afterburners</b>: Bright afterburner flames from jet aircraft were often reported as UFOs since they could be
      seen from great distances when the aircraft was not visible.</li>
    <li>Other UFO resolutions included <b>stellar mirages, satellites, missiles, reflections, searchlights, birds,
      kites, false radar indications, fireworks, flares</b>, and some confirmed <b>hoaxes</b> <span class="source"><a

  <p>AARO partnered with the U.S. National Archives to examine the records from the USAF’s <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project BLUE BOOK</a>, which spanned from 1947 to 1969. This research
    presented a significant challenge because of the volume of the documentation amounted to 7,252 files holding a total
    of 65,778 digital records. The vast majority of the files are populated with USAF documentation. Some cases contain
    media clippings and images, but these instances are rare.</p>
  <p><b>Results</b>: <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project BLUE BOOK</a> determined that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No UFO reported, investigated, and evaluated by the USAF demonstrated any indication of a threat to national

    <li>There was no evidence submitted to, or discovered by, the USAF that sightings represented technological
      developments or principles beyond the range of then-present day scientific knowledge.</li>
    <li>There was no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as unidentified are “extraterrestrial

  <h2>CIA Evaluation of UFOs (1964)</h2>
  <p><b>Background</b>: Following high-level White House discussions on what to do if alien intelligence was discovered
    or there was a new outbreak of UFO sightings, DCI John McCone tasked the CIA to update its evaluation of UFOs. The
    CIA’s scientific division officially acquired UFO-sighting case information from the director of the <a

  <h2>The Condon Report (April 1968)</h2>
  <p><b>Background</b>: Dr. Edward U. Condon, a physicist and former Director of the National Bureau of Standards, was
    the scientific director of an 18-month study on “flying saucers” funded under a $325,000 USAF contract to the
    University of Colorado. This panel took a narrow and somewhat unique view of UFO investigatory efforts, primarily
    focusing on whether or not UFO phenomena merited formal scientific research in terms of academic or USG-sponsored
    research and in secondary schools. The panel said their remit did not include the study of UFO phenomena as a
    potential risk to U.S. national security interests <span class="source">“<a
      href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0680976.pdf">The Condon Report</a>,”,

  <b><b>Results</b>: The panel’s report stated that: <q>Our general conclusion is that nothing has come from the study
    of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge. Careful consideration of the record as it is
    available to us leads us to conclude that further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified in the
    expectation that science will be advanced thereby.</q> The panel cautioned against support for scientific papers on
    this topic and recommended that teachers should not give credit to students for reading UFO literature and materials

  <ul>
    <li>The panel also investigated and studied a small number of cases of alleged physical evidence of UFO
      visitations—from imprints on the ground and residue allegedly left behind from UFO landings (such as a white
      powder and ethereal strands dubbed “angel hair”)—to metallic debris. The panel found ordinary explanations for
      each of these cases. Some of these cases originated in Brazil, Norway, and Washington, D.C. <span class="source">“<a

    <li>The panel investigated a claim made by radio broadcaster Frank Edwards in a <time>1966</time> book that a piece
      of a UFO was recovered near Washington, D.C. in the summer of <time>1952</time> during the spike in UFO sightings
      over the U.S. Capitol in July and August. He claimed that a USN jet fired on a two-foot diameter glowing disc and
      dislodged a one-pound fragment that was recovered by a ground team. <a
        href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project BLUE BOOK</a> was not aware of this claim. The USAF and
      USN found no incident report of weapons engagement with a UFO that summer, no USN aircraft were present, and the
      retired officer who was the original source of the claim had retired before the summer of 1952, when the event
      allegedly occurred <span class="source">“<a

    <li>Edwards also made the claim in <time>1966</time> that the USG had loaned the Canadian government fragments of a
      UFO it had allegedly recovered. It is not clear if this claim was linked to the alleged Washington, D.C. incident.
      He also claimed that Dr. Vannevar Bush, a prominent inventor, defense industry scientist, and founder of the
      National Science Foundation, led the effort to study the fragment. The Condon panel determined that these claims
      most likely were false <span class="source">“<a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD0680976.pdf">The Condon Report</a>,”,

  <p>In <time>1993</time>, Congressman Steven H. Schiff (R-New Mexico) made inquiries about the Roswell incident to DoD.
    The Roswell incident refers to the July 1947 recovery of metallic and rubber debris from a crashed military balloon
    near Roswell Army Air Field personnel that sparked conspiracy theories and claims that the debris was from an alien
    spaceship and part of a USG cover-up. He asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) (subsequently renamed the
    Government Accountability Office) to determine the requirements for reporting air accidents, such as the crash near
    Roswell, and to identify any government records concerning the Roswell crash <span class="source"><a
      href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-95-187.pdf">Government Accountability Office</a></span>.</p>
  <p>The USAF conducted a systematic search of numerous archives and records centers in support of GAO’s audit of
    Roswell. As part of this review, the USAF also interviewed numerous people who may have had knowledge of the events.
    Secretary of the Air Force Sheila E. Widnall released them from any security obligations that may have restricted
    the sharing of information. The USAF then published The Roswell Report in 1995, which included: “The Report of the
    U.S. Air Force Research Regarding the ‘Roswell Incident’” by Col Richard L. Weaver, and the “Synopsis of Balloon
    Research Findings” by 1st Lt James McAndrew <span class="source">U.S. Air Force, <a
      href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA326148.pdf">The Roswell Report: Fact versus Fiction in the New Mexico Desert</a>
    (Government Printing Office, 1995)</span>.</p>
  <p><b>Results</b>: The report stated that the USAF’s research did not locate or develop any information that indicated
    the “Roswell Incident” was a UFO event, nor was there any “cover-up” by the USG. Rather, the materials recovered
    near Roswell were consistent with a balloon of the type used in the then-classified Project Mogul. No records showed
    any evidence that the USG recovered aliens or extraterrestrial material.56</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The USAF subsequently published a follow-on report in <time>1997</time>, The Roswell Report: Case Closed, with
      additional materials and analysis which supported its conclusion that the debris recovered near Roswell was from
      the U.S. Army Air Force’s balloon-borne program <span class="source"><a

    </li>
    <li>Reports of military units that allegedly recovered a flying saucer and its “crew” were descriptions of Air Force
      personnel engaged in the dummy recovery operations. Claims of “alien bodies” at the Roswell Army Air Force (RAAF)
      hospital were most likely the result of the conflation of two separate incidents: a 1956 KC-97 aircraft accident
      in which 11 Air Force members lost their lives; and a <time>1959</time> manned balloon mishap in which two Air
      Force pilots were injured <span class="source"><a href="https://www.af.mil/The-Roswell-Report">U.S. Air Force</a>; USAF, The Roswell Report: Case

  </ul>
  <p>The GAO’s 1995 report on the results of its investigation found that the U.S. Army Air Force regulations in <time>1947</time>

  <h2>Advanced Aerospace Weapons System Application Program (AAWSAP) (2009–2012)/ Advanced Aerospace Threat
    Identification Program (AATIP)
  </h2>
  <p><b>Background</b>: At the direction of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), the Defense Appropriations Acts of
    Fiscal Years 2008 and 2010 appropriated $22 million for the DIA to assess long-term and over-the-horizon foreign
    advanced aerospace threats to the United States. In coordination with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense
    for Intelligence, DIA established AAWSAP in 2009, which was also known AATIP. The contract for this DIA- managed
    program was awarded to a private sector organization <span class="source">Info Memo, From Former Defense Intelligence Agency Director to the Undersecretary of
    Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, December 1, 2010.</span> <span class="note"><b>Note on program names</b>: The names
      AAWSAP and AATIP have been
    used interchangeably for the name of this program, including on official documentation. Unlike AAWSAP, AATIP was
    never an official DoD program. However, after AAWSAP was cancelled, the AATIP moniker was used by some individuals
    associated with an informal, unofficial UAP community of interest within DoD that researched UAP sightings from
    military observers as part of their ancillary job duties. This effort was not a recognized, official program, and
    had no dedicated personnel or budget.</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The primary purpose of AAWSAP/AATIP was to investigate potential next generation aerospace technologies in 12
      specific areas—such as advanced lift, propulsion, the use of unconventional materials and controls, and signature
      reduction <span class="source">Info Memo, From Former Defense Intelligence Agency Director to the Undersecretary of
      Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, December 1, 2010</span>.</li>
    <li>Although investigating UFO/UAP was not specifically outlined in the contract’s statement of work, the selected
      private sector organization conducted UFO research with the support of the DIA program manager. This research
      included: reviewing new cases and much older <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project BLUE
        BOOK</a> cases, operating debriefing and investigatory teams, and proposals to set up laboratories to examine
      any recovered UFO materials <span class="source">Review of Report from a private sector organization 1, July 30, 2009</span>.
    </li>
    <li>AAWSAP/AATIP also investigated an alleged hotspot of UAP and paranormal activity at a property in Utah—which at
      that time was owned by the head of the private sector organization—including examining reports of “shadow figures”
      and “creatures,” and exploring “remote viewing” and “human consciousness anomalies.” The organization also planned
      to hire psychics to study “inter-dimensional phenomena” believed to frequently appear at that location <span
        class="source">Review of Report from a private sector organization 1, July 30, 2009</span>.</li>
    <li>DIA did not seek, nor specifically authorize, this work though a DIA employee set up and managed the contract
      with the private sector organization <span class="source"><a

    </li>
    <li>On <time>2009-06-24</time>, Senator Reid sent a letter to then Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn III
      requesting that AAWSAP/AATIP be made a DoD Special Access Program. Deputy Secretary Lynn declined to do so based
      on the recommendation of then-Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, James R. Clapper, Jr., that such a
      designation was not justified <span class="source">Memorandum, from the Under Secretary of Defense James Clapper to the Deputy Secretary of
      Defense, 17 November 2009</span>.</li>
    <li>Just prior to DoD’s cancellation of the program, the private sector organization proposed as a new line of
      effort to host a series of “intellectual debates” at academic institutes to influence the public debate, which
      included hiring supportive reporters and celebrity moderators. The goal of this proposed public relations campaign
      was to assume that “E.T. visitations are true” and that the moderators would steer debate away from <q>dead-end
        discussions” and the “morass” about discussing “evidence.</q> <span class="source">Review of Report from a private sector organization, July 30 2009.</span>
      A stated goal of this proposal was to increase public interest in government “disclosure” around the “E.T. topic”
      and explore the consequences of disclosure on the public <span class="source">Review of Report from a private sector organization, July 30 2009.</span>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Results</b>: The AAWSAP/AATIP contract with the private sector organization produced exploratory papers
    addressing the 12 scientific areas tasked in the contract’s statement of work. These scientific papers were never
    thoroughly peer reviewed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AARO has yet to uncover any other substantive UAP case work conducted by AAWSAP/AATIP. Instead, AAWSAP/AATIP
      reviewed a large number of <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project BLUE BOOK</a> and private
      cases and conducted interviews of UAP observers and conducted unrelated work on alleged paranormal activities at
      the private sector organization’s property in Utah.</li>
    <li>AAWSAP/AATIP was terminated in 2012 upon the completion of its deliverables due to DIA and DoD concerns about
      the project.24</li>
    <li>After AAWSAP/AATIP was terminated, its supporters unsuccessfully attempted to convince DHS to support a new
      version of this effort dubbed KONA BLUE.</li>

  <h2>Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) (August 2020-November 2021)</h2>
  <p><b>Background</b>: Deputy Secretary of Defense David L. Norquist approved the establishment of the UAPTF in August
    2020. Under the cognizance of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security (USD(I&S)),
    the Department of the Navy was asked to lead the task force. It was established to improve understanding of, and
    gain insight into, the nature and origins of UAP. The task force’s mission was to detect, analyze, and catalog UAP
    that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security <span class="source"><a
      href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2314065/establishment-of-unidentifiedaerial-phenomena-task-force/">Department of Defense</a></span>.
  </p>
  <p><b>Results</b>: The UAPTF helped standardize, destigmatize, and increase the volume of UAP reporting. Its work also
    helped calibrate sensors to improve the quality of data collected. Its methods and processes directly led to the
    identification of the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) high altitude balloons that traversed over the continental
    United States <span class="source">AARO discussions with UAPTF leadership.</span>. Preliminary Assessment:
    Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (June 2021) Background: Senate Report 116-233, accompanying the Intelligence
    Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, directed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) in
    consultation with the Secretary of Defense to submit an intelligence assessment of the threat posed by UAP and to
    report on the progress the UAPTF had made in understanding this threat. Results: The preliminary assessment
    concluded that: (1) the limited amount of high-quality reporting on UAP hampers the ability to draw firm conclusions
    about their nature or intent; (2) in a limited number of incidents, UAP reportedly appeared to exhibit unusual
    flight characteristics; although those observations could be the result of sensor errors, spoofing, or observer
    misperception and require additional rigorous analysis; (3) there are probably multiple types of UAP requiring
    different explanations based on the range of appearances and behaviors described in the available reporting; (4) UAP
    may pose airspace safety issues and a challenge to U.S. national security; and (5) consistent consolidation of
    reports from across the USG, standardized reporting, increased collection and analysis, and a streamlined process
    for screening all such reports against a broad range of relevant government data will allow for a more sophisticated
    analysis of UAP <span class="source">Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial

  <h2>All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) (Established July 15, 2022)</h2>
  <p><b>Background</b>: In response to the NDAA for FY22, the Deputy Secretary of Defense in coordination with the DNI,
    conveyed direction to the USD(I&S) by renaming the AOIMSG as AARO, and expanded its scope and mission <span

    AARO organized itself around four functions (analysis, operations, science & technology (S&T), and strategic
    communications). AARO is developing IC and S&T analytic tradecraft practices, implementing a science testing plan,
    implementing a secure interviewee debriefing program, and is working to standardize UAP collection and reporting
    across the DoD and the IC.</p>
  <p><b>Results</b>: Consistent with congressional direction, AARO provides quarterly reports, semiannual briefings, and
    an annual report to Congress in coordination with the <a href="/org/us/ic/DNI.html">ODNI</a>. In addition, on <time>2023-01-12</time>,
    the ODNI submitted the 2022 Annual Report on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena to Congress. This report was drafted in
    partnership with AARO and based on AARO’s data.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The report stated that there was a total of 510 UAP reports as of <time>2022-08-30</time>. This included the 144
      UAP reports covered during the 17 years of reporting included in the <a href="/org/us/ic/DNI.html">ODNI</a>’s
      preliminary assessment, as well as 247 new reports and 119 reports that subsequently were discovered or reported.

  <h2>Foreign and Academic Investigatory Efforts</h2>
  <p>AARO reviewed seven other UAP investigatory panels and programs sponsored by a U.S. university, the United Kingdom,
    Canada, and France. Of these efforts, one unofficial report from a Canadian government effort in the early 1950s
    claimed UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin, and the program director claimed he was in contact with aliens. This
    position appeared to reflect the opinions of the director of the effort and was not endorsed or supported by the
    Canadian government.</p>

  </ul>
  <p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>None of these investigations (including USG, foreign, and U.S. academic efforts) reached the conclusion that any
      of the UAP reports indicated extraterrestrial origin.</li>
    <li>All of these efforts and reviews concluded that the vast majority of UAP reports could be resolved as any number
      of ordinary objects, natural phenomena, optical illusions or misidentifications. Many of the cases, however,
      remain unresolved.</li>
    <li>The lack of actionable, researchable data—specifically the lack of speed, altitude, and size of reported
      UAP—combined with resource constraints, high volumes of cases, and perceived differing levels of support from USG
      officials were factors in all investigative efforts. Even with the significant advancements in ground- and air-
      based sensors, the apparent inability to collect sufficient and high-quality data for scientific analysis
      continues to plague investigations.</li>
    <li>Three efforts investigated reports of direct or indirect physical evidence of UFOs (from depressions on the
      ground to metallic debris) and found nothing of foreign or extraterrestrial origin.</li>
    <li>There was at least one USG proposal—by the CIA-sponsored Robertson Panel—to engage in an active “training” and
      “debunking” effort using various public media tools to steer the public away from reporting UFOs. The proposal
      reasoned that it did not believe UFOs were foreign technological threats or of extraterrestrial origin; rather, it
      viewed the persistent flood of reports as cluttering and bogging down government processes, expressing the concern
      that such reports could create “mass hysteria” to the benefit of the Soviet Union.</li>
    <li>At various points in history, individuals inside and outside of the USG, including Dr. J. Allen Hynek, claimed
      the USAF had a key goal of debunking or explaining away reports of UAP. AARO found no evidence to suggest that the
      USAF had a policy intended to cover up the evidence of extraterrestrial knowledge, material, or interactions.
      Rather, the USAF instead sought to focus on what it determined to be more important concerns, such as Soviet
      technology and U.S. defense readiness. Similarly, at least the first iteration of <a
        href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/grudge">Project GRUDGE</a> sought to resolve all cases and prohibited its
      staff from characterizing reports as unknown or unidentified.</li>
    <li>AARO notes that there was possibly one unofficial estimate stating otherwise. Project SIGN staff allegedly
      drafted and signed a report that was circulated for review and approval. It was titled: “The Estimate of the
      Situation” and assessed that at least some UFOs were of “interplanetary” origin. The DoD leadership rejected this
      report on the basis that it lacked any proof, and it was never published. The first Director of <a
        href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project BLUE BOOK</a>, Capt Edward Ruppelt, said that all but a
