  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>As of September 17, 2023, AARO interviewed approximately 30 individuals. AARO categorized these individuals into
    three tiers: Tier 1 interviewees are those who have spoken with congressional staff or Members of Congress and have
    been subsequently referred to AARO; Tier 2 interviewees are those who have been referred to AARO by Tier 1
    interviewees; Tier 3 interviewees are AARO-generated interviewees that have a corroborating touchpoint to the
    principal integrated narrative of reports from Tier 1 and Tier 2 interviewees. Priority is given to those
    interviewees who claimed firsthand knowledge of government programs, events, or details about any resulting
    material. Interviewees relaying second or thirdhand knowledge are lower in priority, but AARO has and will continue
    to schedule interviews with them, nonetheless.</p>
  <p>AARO generated random numbers and assigned one to each interviewee. AARO maintains the key, which is stored and
    handled in a secure manner to protect each interviewee’s privacy. In some instances, AARO assigned a random number
    to a person who has not interviewed with AARO but was referenced by interviewees as a key individual. AARO also
    assigned numbers to organizations mentioned by interviewees.</p>
  <p><strong><em>AARO assesses that two main narratives have emerged, with various and potentially unrelated
    offshoots:</em></strong></p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Primary Narrative</h2>
  <p>The primary narrative alleges that <strong><em>the USG and industry partners are in possession of and are testing
    off-world technology that has been concealed from congressional oversight and the world since approximately 1964,
    and possibly since 1947, if the Roswell events are included.</em></strong> The narrative asserts that this UAP
    program possesses as many as 12 extraterrestrial spacecraft.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An AARO interviewee84 claimed in a thirdhand account that an organization85 was in possession of 12 spacecraft
      recovered from different crash events prior to 1970. Some of the craft allegedly were “intact.” The interviewee
      also stated that the CIA had a partnership with the company that ended in 1989 and wanted all material returned to
      the CIA. AARO discovered no empirical evidence supporting these claims.</li>
    <li>An interviewee86 claimed that an organization87 was in possession of off-world material in 2009 and 2010. A
      separate interviewee stated they participated in negotiations to return the material to the USG. The same
      interviewee stated that a former named senior CIA official quashed the proposal to remove the material from the
      corporation.</li>
    <li>A separate interviewee88 claimed that circa 1999, a former, senior U.S. military officer89 told the interviewee
      that that he touched the surface of an extraterrestrial spacecraft. The interviewee stated that the senior officer
      gave a detailed description of a craft floating in a building. The officer told the interviewee that approximately
      150 individuals were working on the program and that the program was kept “outside of government” so the
      technology could remain proprietary.</li>
    <li>Two interviewees90 said they participated in an alleged White House-tasked UAP study in Northern Virginia
      sometime between 2004 and 2007. The study evaluated the impacts to society should the United States, Russia, or
      China disclose they had evidence of extraterrestrial beings or craft. One interviewee assumed these governments
      possessed such evidence.91 The study was conducted by approximately 12 participants who evaluated 64 different
      aspects of society, such as religion and financial markets, which could be impacted by such a disclosure. 92 The
      study lasted one day, and the interviewee was not aware of any final report or to whom any report may have been
      delivered.</li>
    <li>Another interviewee claimed that in the 1990s he overhead electronic communication of a conversation between two
      military bases where scientists claimed “aliens” were present during specialized materials testing.93 The
      interviewee also reported that on another occasion in the 1990s he observed an “unidentified flying object” at a
      U.S. military facility. The interviewee described the object as exhibiting a peculiar flight pattern.</li>
    <li>An interviewee who is a former U.S. service member said that in 2009, while participating in a humanitarian and
      security mission in a foreign country, he encountered “U.S. Special Forces” loading containers onto a large
      extraterrestrial spacecraft. 94</li>
    <li>A separate interviewee said that a family member was part of an effort to reverse- engineer an object assumed to
      be off-world technology in the 1980s. 95 The engineers failed to reverse-engineer the object and it was sent to a
      different facility for further evaluation.</li>
    <li>An interviewee pointed out to AARO the existence of an alleged leaked Special National Intelligence Estimate
      from 1961 as proof of the existence of UAP crashes.96 AARO obtained a copy of the document through open-source
      research and evaluated its authenticity.</li>
    <li>Some interviewees and public accounts underpin this storyline by claiming through second and thirdhand accounts
      that some NDAs may have been used to protect a “reverse-engineering program of off-world technology.” These
      accounts describe the NDAs as including “punishment by death” provisions should the signatory disclose 30
      information about the program. Some interviewees claimed “verbal” and written NDAs were administered in several
      instances.97</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Secondary Narrative</h2>
  <p>The other narrative is that <strong><em>a cluster of UAP sightings that occurred in close proximity to U.S. nuclear
    facilities have resulted in the malfunctioning and destruction of nuclear missiles and a test reentry vehicle.</em></strong>
    AARO interviewed five former USAF members who served in and around U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)
    silos at Malmstrom, Ellsworth, Vandenberg, and Minot USAF bases between 1966 and 1977.98 Some of these individuals
    claim UAP sightings near the silos, while others claim UAP disruptions to ICBM operations. Specifically, they said
    the ICBM launch control facilities went offline or experienced total power failure. Additionally, one interviewee
    and a USAF videographer claimed to have observed and recorded a UAP destroying an ICBM loaded with a “dummy”
    warhead, mid-flight. AARO is researching U.S. and adversarial activity related to these events, including any U.S.
    programs that tested defensive ballistic missile capabilities.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Findings</h3>
    <p>AARO investigated and reached conclusions on the majority of the claims made in these narratives. In most cases,
      AARO was able to locate the companies, people, and programs that were conveyed to AARO through interviews. AARO
      will report the results of the unresolved allegations in Volume II. AARO’s findings to date are as follows:</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>No Official UAP Nondisclosure Agreements Discovered</h3>
    <p>In the conduct of this review, and to meet the direction of Section 1673 of the NDAA for FY 2023, AARO sent
      guidance and requests to DoD, IC elements, DOE, and DHS to review and provide any NDAs pertaining to UAP (or its
      previous names). To date, AARO personnel have not discovered or been notified of any NDAs that contain information
      related to UAP. Also, apart from the standard NDA language contained in Title 18, Section 794 describing the death
      penalty or jail time for illegally disclosing information relating to the national defense, AARO has not
      discovered any NDAs containing threats to interviewees for disclosing UAP-specific information.</p>
    <p>Historically, most if not all NDAs contained standard language stating that the death penalty can be applied for
      the crime of disclosing classified information. Title 18, Section 794, is referenced in typical NDAs in several
      places in relation to the transmission of classified information:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Whoever, with intent or reason to believe that it is to be used to the injury of the United States or to the
        advantage of a foreign nation, communicates, delivers, or transmits…information relating to the national
        defense, shall be punished by death or by imprisonment for any term of years or for life….</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Former CIA Official Involvement in Movement of Alleged Material Recovered from a UAP Crash Denied on the Record
    </h3>
    <p>AARO interviewed and obtained a signed statement from the former CIA official who was specifically named by AARO
      interviewees. The former official stated he had no knowledge of any aspect of this allegation.99 The allegation
      included the claimed crash of the objects, the possession of the resultant material by the USG and the private
      sector, and the attempt to transfer material that was purported to be of off-world origin. This
      reverse-engineering program allegedly occurred at the named facility in the 2009-2010 time frame. Interviewees
      allege that a separate interviewee100 from the facility attempted to set up a meeting to return material to the
      USG in 2010, but that the former CIA official stopped the transfer from industry to the USG. The interviewee
      alleged to have stopped the transfer denied these allegations.101 The former CIA official stated that he had no
      knowledge of any extraterrestrial material in the possession of the USG or any other organization.102 The official
      signed a Memorandum for the Record (MFR) attesting to the truthfulness of his statements.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>The 1961 Special National Intelligence Estimate on “UFOs” Assessed to be Not Authentic</h3>
    <p>An interviewee 103 brought to AARO’s attention the existence of an alleged Special National Intelligence Estimate
      (SNIE), dated November 5, 1961, titled: “Critical Aspects of Unidentified Flying Objects and the Nuclear Threat to
      the Defense of the United States and its Allies.” Through open-source research, AARO obtained a copy of the
      document. After discussions with the CIA’s Center for the Study of Intelligence (CSI), the NSA Scientific Studies
      Board (one of the alleged authors), and research comparing this document to a number of known SNIEs and National
      Intelligence Estimates, AARO concluded the document is not authentic. NSA archives were searched because “the NSA
      Scientific Advisory Board” purportedly was one of the document’s authors. CIA/CSI and NSA did not possess nor have
      knowledge of the document. AARO found the document lacked IC tradecraft standards and possessed significant
      inconsistencies with SNIE’s and National Intelligence Estimates of the general time period. These inconsistencies
      included: the document’s short length, incorrect formatting, inconsistent branding, lack of a dissemination block
      and coordination language, loose narrative style, convoluted logic, imprecise and casual language, and its
      superficial treatment of globally significant issues.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Aliens Observing Material Test a Likely Misunderstanding of an Authentic, Non-UAP Program Activity</h3>
    <p>AARO determined this account most likely amounted to a misunderstanding. The conversation likely referenced a
      test and evaluation unit that had a nickname with “alien” connotations at the specific installation mentioned. The
      nature of the test described by the interviewee104 closely matched the description of a specific materials test
      conveyed to AARO investigators.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Allegation that a Former U.S. military Service Member Touched an Extraterrestrial Spacecraft</h3>
    A<p>n interviewee 105 stated that a former military member, who was also an interviewee, had stated that he had
    touched an off-world aircraft. AARO contacted and interviewed the former military member106 who denied any knowledge
    of off-world technology in possession of the USG, a private contractor, or any other foreign or domestic entity. The
    former military member attested that he could not remember if this encounter with the original interviewee had ever
    occurred, but opined that if it had happened, the only situation that he might have conveyed was the time when he
    touched an F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter at a facility. The former military member signed an MFR attesting to the
    truthfulness of his account.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>The UAP with Peculiar Characteristics Refers to an Authentic, Non-UAP-Related SAP</h3>
    <p>AARO was able to correlate this account with an authentic USG program because the interviewee was able to provide
      a relatively precise time and location of the sighting which they observed exhibiting strange characteristics. At
      the time the interviewee said he observed the event, DoD was conducting tests of a platform protected by a SAP.
      The seemingly strange characteristics reported by the interviewee match closely with the platform’s
      characteristics, which was being tested at a military facility in the time frame the interviewee was there. This
      program is not related in any way to the exploitation of off-world technology.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Extraterrestrial Disclosure Study Confirmed; Not White House-Sponsored</h3>
    <p>An organization107 in Northern Virginia did conduct a study between 2004 and 2007 on the societal effects should
      the United States or other world governments disclose they have evidence of extraterrestrial life. Interviewees
      believed the White House sponsored it. AARO confirmed through two former White House senior officials108 that the
      White House did not request it, nor were they aware of any such study.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Aerospace Companies Denied Involvement in Recovering Extraterrestrial Craft</h3>
    <p>AARO met with high-ranking officials, including executives and chief technology officers, of the named companies.
      All denied the existence of these programs, and attested to the truthfulness of their statements on the
      record.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Sample of Alleged Alien Spacecraft is an Ordinary, Terrestrial, Metal Alloy</h3>
    <p>AARO learned through an interviewee that a private sector organization109 claimed to have in its possession
      material from an extraterrestrial craft recovered from a crash at an unknown location from the 1940s or 1950s. The
      organization claimed that the material had the potential to act as a THz frequency waveguide, and therefore, could
      exhibit “anti-gravity” and “mass reduction” properties under the appropriate conditions. The organization that
      owned the material negotiated an agreement in 2019 with the U.S. Army to analyze the samples. With permission from
      the stakeholders, AARO acquired this sample to conduct more in-depth analyses.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>AARO and a leading science laboratory concluded that the material is a metallic alloy, terrestrial
        in nature, and possibly of USAF origin, based on its materials characterization.</em></strong> It was also
        assessed that the material is mostly composed of magnesium, and the bismuth present was not a pure layer per
        initial claims.</li>
      <li>The U.S. Army had also conducted in-house analysis on the sample, and while AARO generally agrees with its
        conclusions, AARO found that the structure was not purely layered magnesium alloy and bismuth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><em>AARO assesses that a separate private sector organization’s recreation of this metallic sample was
      almost certainly conflated with claims that the aerospace industry was attempting to reverse-engineer off-world
      technology.</em></strong> Prior to AARO’s acquisition of the sample, the organization fabricated a replica of the
      sample to determine if it could be done. 110</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>The same organization 111 made an attempt to replicate the sample at the same specific location
        cited by the interviewee 112 as the location where the interviewee alleged to have participated in discussions
        about transferring UAP crash materials.</em></strong> The claim that extraterrestrial technology was being
        reverse-engineered almost certainly was conflated with this material fabrication.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>AARO Investigating Unresolved Historical Nuclear-Related UAP Cases</h3>
    <p>Like all historical UAP cases, very little actionable data exists beyond limited firsthand narrative accounts.
      Nevertheless, AARO continues to investigate these cases due to the sensitive nature of these events potentially
      impacting the readiness of the U.S. nuclear program. Although AARO has not been able to recover the alleged film
      of the ballistic missile reentry vehicle being shot down by a UAP in 1964, AARO was able to correlate the general
      time and location with an antiballistic missile test, which could have been the genesis for this observation.</p>
