  <h2>Synthèse</h2>
  <p><time>2023-09-17</time>, l'<a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> a interrogé une trentaine de
    personnes. L'<a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> a catégorisé ces individus en trois groupes : Les
    personnes interrogées dans le 1er tiers sont celles ayant parlé à du personnel ou des membres du Congrès et ont été
    par la suite redirigés vers l'<a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> ; les personnes interrogées du 2ème
    tiers sont celles ayant été orientées vers l'<a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>  par les personnes
    interrogées du 1er tiers ; les personnes interrogées du 3ème tiers sont des AARO-generated interviewees that have a
    corroborating touchpoint to the principal integrated narrative of reports from Tier 1 and Tier 2 interviewees.
    Priority is given to those interviewees who claimed firsthand knowledge of government programs, events, or details
    about any resulting material. Interviewees relaying second or thirdhand knowledge are lower in priority, but AARO
    has and will continue to schedule interviews with them, nonetheless.</p>
  <p>L'<a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> a généré une série de nombres aléatoires et a affecté un de
    chaque à chaque personne interrogée. AARO maintains the key, which is stored and handled in a secure manner to
    protect each interviewee’s privacy. In some instances, AARO assigned a random number to a person who has not
    interviewed with AARO but was referenced by interviewees as a key individual. AARO also assigned numbers to
    organizations mentioned by interviewees.</p>
  <p><strong>L'évaluatin de l'AARO est que les 2 principaux récits ont émergé, avec diveres ramifications
    potentiellement non liées :</strong></p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Récit principal</h2>
  <p>Le récit principal prétend que <strong>le gouvernement américain et des partenaires industriels sont en possession
    de et testent une technologie d'un autre monde qui a été cachée à la supervision du Congrès ainsi qu'au monde depuis
    <time>~1964</time>, et peut-être depuis <time>1947</time>, si l'on inclut les <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell">événements de Roswell</a>.</strong> Le récit affirme que ce
    programme sur les PANs possède jusqu'à 12 vaisseaux spatiaux extraterrestres.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Une personne interrogée par l'<a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> <span class="source">Dossiers
      de cas de l'AARO</span> a déclaré dans un récit de 3ème main qu'une organization <span class="source">Dossiers
      de cas de l'AARO</span> était en possession de 12 vaisseaux spatiaux récupérés de différents <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/scenario/Crashes.html">crashes</a> ayant eu lieu avant <time>1970</time>.
      Certains des appareils auraient été <q>intacts</q>. La personne interrogée a également déclaré que la <a
        href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> avait un partenariat avec la société qui prit fin <time>1989</time> et voulait
      que l'ensemble des matériels soient retournés à la <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a>. L'<a
        href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> n'a découvert aucune preuve empirique étayant ces déclarations.
    </li>
    <li>Une personne interrogée <span class="source">Dossiers de cas de l'AARO</span> a déclaré qu'une organisation
      <span class="source">Dossiers de cas de l'AARO</span> était en possession de matériaux venant d'un autre monde en
      <time>2009</time> et <time>2010</time>. Une interview distincte indique qu'ils avaient participé à des
      négotiations pour rendre les matériaux au gouvernement américain. La même personne interrogée a déclaré qu'un
      ancien responsable sénior nommé de la <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> avait annulé la proposition d'enlever le
      matériau de la société.</li>
    <li>Une autre personne interrogée <span class="source">Dossiers de cas de l'AARO</span> a déclaré que
      <time>~1999</time>, un ancien officier militaire américain sénior <span
        class="source">Dossiers de cas de l'AARO</span> lui aurait affirmé avoir touché la surface d'un appareil
      extraterrestre. The interviewee stated that the senior officer gave a detailed description of a craft floating in
      a building. The officer told the interviewee that approximately 150 individuals were working on the program and
      that the program was kept “outside of government” so the technology could remain proprietary.</li>
    <li>Two interviewees <span class="source">Dossiers de cas de l'AARO</span> said they participated in an alleged
      White House-tasked UAP study in Northern Virginia sometime between <time>2004/2007</time>. The study evaluated the
      impacts to society should the United States, Russia, or China disclose they had evidence of extraterrestrial
      beings or craft. One interviewee assumed these governments possessed such evidence <span class="source"><a
        href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span>. The study was conducted by approximately 12
      participants who evaluated 64 different aspects of society, such as religion and financial markets, which could be
      impacted by such a disclosure <span class="source">Dossiers
      de cas de l'AARO</span>. The study lasted one day, and the interviewee was not aware of any final report or to
      whom any report may have been delivered.</li>
    <li>Another interviewee claimed that in the 1990s he overhead electronic communication of a conversation between two
      military bases where scientists claimed “aliens” were present during specialized materials testing.93 The
      interviewee also reported that on another occasion in the 1990s he observed an <q>unidentified flying object</q>
      at a U.S. military facility. The interviewee described the object as exhibiting a peculiar flight pattern.</li>
    <li>An interviewee who is a former U.S. service member said that in <time>2009</time>, while participating in a
      humanitarian and security mission in a foreign country, he encountered “U.S. Special Forces” loading containers
      onto a large extraterrestrial spacecraft <span class="source"><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span>.
    </li>
    <li>A separate interviewee said that a family member was part of an effort to reverse- engineer an object assumed to
      be off-world technology in the 1980s <span class="source"><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span>.
      The engineers failed to reverse-engineer the object and it was sent to a different facility for further
      evaluation.</li>
    <li>An interviewee pointed out to AARO the existence of an alleged leaked Special National Intelligence Estimate
      from 1961 as proof of the existence of UAP crashes <span class="source"><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span>.
      AARO obtained a copy of the document through open-source research and evaluated its authenticity.</li>
    <li>Some interviewees and public accounts underpin this storyline by claiming through second and thirdhand accounts
      that some NDAs may have been used to protect a <q>reverse-engineering program of off-world technology</q>. These
      accounts describe the NDAs as including “punishment by death” provisions should the signatory disclose 30
      information about the program. Some interviewees claimed “verbal” and written NDAs were administered in several
      instances <span class="source"><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span>.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Récit secondaire</h2>
  <p>The other narrative is that <strong>a cluster of UAP sightings that occurred in close proximity to U.S. nuclear
    facilities have resulted in the malfunctioning and destruction of nuclear missiles and a test reentry
    vehicle.</strong> AARO interviewed five former USAF members who served in and around U.S. intercontinental ballistic
    missile (ICBM) silos at Malmstrom, Ellsworth, Vandenberg, and Minot USAF bases between <time>1966/1977</time> <span
      class="source"><a
      href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span>. Some of these individuals claim UAP sightings near
    the silos, while others claim UAP disruptions to ICBM operations. Specifically, they said the ICBM launch control
    facilities went offline or experienced total power failure. Additionally, one interviewee and a USAF videographer
    claimed to have observed and recorded a UAP destroying an ICBM loaded with a “dummy” warhead, mid-flight. AARO is
    researching U.S. and adversarial activity related to these events, including any U.S. programs that tested defensive
    ballistic missile capabilities.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Findings</h3>
    <p>AARO investigated and reached conclusions on the majority of the claims made in these narratives. In most cases,
      AARO was able to locate the companies, people, and programs that were conveyed to AARO through interviews. AARO
      will report the results of the unresolved allegations in Volume 2. AARO’s findings to date are as follows:</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>No Official UAP Nondisclosure Agreements Discovered</h3>
    <p>In the conduct of this review, and to meet the direction of Section 1673 of the NDAA for FY 2023, AARO sent
      guidance and requests to DoD, IC elements, DOE, and DHS to review and provide any NDAs pertaining to UAP (or its
      previous names). To date, AARO personnel have not discovered or been notified of any NDAs that contain information
      related to UAP. Also, apart from the standard NDA language contained in Title 18, Section 794 describing the death
      penalty or jail time for illegally disclosing information relating to the national defense, AARO has not
      discovered any NDAs containing threats to interviewees for disclosing UAP-specific information.</p>
    <p>Historically, most if not all NDAs contained standard language stating that the death penalty can be applied for
      the crime of disclosing classified information. Title 18, Section 794, is referenced in typical NDAs in several
      places in relation to the transmission of classified information:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Whoever, with intent or reason to believe that it is to be used to the injury of the United States or to the
        advantage of a foreign nation, communicates, delivers, or transmits…information relating to the national
        defense, shall be punished by death or by imprisonment for any term of years or for life….</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Former CIA Official Involvement in Movement of Alleged Material Recovered from a UAP Crash Denied on the Record
    </h3>
    <p>AARO interviewed and obtained a signed statement from the former CIA official who was specifically named by AARO
      interviewees. The former official stated he had no knowledge of any aspect of this allegation <span
        class="source"><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span>. The allegation included the
      claimed crash of the objects, the possession of the resultant material by the USG and the private sector, and the
      attempt to transfer material that was purported to be of off-world origin. This reverse-engineering program
      allegedly occurred at the named facility in the <time>2009/2010</time> time frame. Interviewees allege that a
      separate interviewee <span class="source"><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span> from
      the facility attempted to set up a meeting to return material to the USG in <time>2010</time>, but that the former
      CIA official stopped the transfer from industry to the USG. The interviewee alleged to have stopped the transfer
      denied these allegations <span class="source"><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span>.
      The former CIA official stated that he had no knowledge of any extraterrestrial material in the possession of the
      USG or any other organization.102 The official signed a Memorandum for the Record (MFR) attesting to the
      truthfulness of his statements.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>The 1961 Special National Intelligence Estimate on “UFOs” Assessed to be Not Authentic</h3>
    <p>An interviewee <span class="source"><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span> brought to
      AARO’s attention the existence of an alleged Special National Intelligence Estimate (SNIE), dated
      <time>1961-11-05</time>, titled: “Critical Aspects of Unidentified Flying Objects and the Nuclear Threat to the
      Defense of the United States and its Allies.” Through open-source research, AARO obtained a copy of the document.
      After discussions with the CIA’s Center for the Study of Intelligence (CSI), the NSA Scientific Studies Board (one
      of the alleged authors), and research comparing this document to a number of known SNIEs and National Intelligence
      Estimates, AARO concluded the document is not authentic. NSA archives were searched because “the NSA Scientific
      Advisory Board” purportedly was one of the document’s authors. CIA/CSI and NSA did not possess nor have knowledge
      of the document. AARO found the document lacked IC tradecraft standards and possessed significant inconsistencies
      with SNIE’s and National Intelligence Estimates of the general time period. These inconsistencies included: the
      document’s short length, incorrect formatting, inconsistent branding, lack of a dissemination block and
      coordination language, loose narrative style, convoluted logic, imprecise and casual language, and its superficial
      treatment of globally significant issues.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Aliens Observing Material Test a Likely Misunderstanding of an Authentic, Non-UAP Program Activity</h3>
    <p>AARO determined this account most likely amounted to a misunderstanding. The conversation likely referenced a
      test and evaluation unit that had a nickname with “alien” connotations at the specific installation mentioned. The
      nature of the test described by the interviewee104 closely matched the description of a specific materials test
      conveyed to AARO investigators.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Allegation that a Former U.S. military Service Member Touched an Extraterrestrial Spacecraft</h3>
    <p>An interviewee <span class="source"><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span> stated that
      a former military member, who was also an interviewee, had stated that he had touched an off-world aircraft. AARO
      contacted and interviewed the former military member <span class="source"><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span>
      who denied any knowledge of off-world technology in possession of the USG, a private contractor, or any other
      foreign or domestic entity. The former military member attested that he could not remember if this encounter with
      the original interviewee had ever occurred, but opined that if it had happened, the only situation that he might
      have conveyed was the time when he touched an F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter at a facility. The former military
      member signed an MFR attesting to the truthfulness of his account.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>The UAP with Peculiar Characteristics Refers to an Authentic, Non-UAP-Related SAP</h3>
    <p>AARO was able to correlate this account with an authentic USG program because the interviewee was able to provide
      a relatively precise time and location of the sighting which they observed exhibiting strange characteristics. At
      the time the interviewee said he observed the event, DoD was conducting tests of a platform protected by a SAP.
      The seemingly strange characteristics reported by the interviewee match closely with the platform’s
      characteristics, which was being tested at a military facility in the time frame the interviewee was there. This
      program is not related in any way to the exploitation of off-world technology.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Extraterrestrial Disclosure Study Confirmed; Not White House-Sponsored</h3>
    <p>An organization <span class="source"><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span> in
      Northern Virginia did conduct a study between <time>2004/2007</time> on the societal effects should the United
      States or other world governments disclose they have evidence of extraterrestrial life. Interviewees believed the
      White House sponsored it. AARO confirmed through two former White House senior officials108 that the White House
      did not request it, nor were they aware of any such study.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Aerospace Companies Denied Involvement in Recovering Extraterrestrial Craft</h3>
    <p>AARO met with high-ranking officials, including executives and chief technology officers, of the named companies.
      All denied the existence of these programs, and attested to the truthfulness of their statements on the
      record.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Sample of Alleged Alien Spacecraft is an Ordinary, Terrestrial, Metal Alloy</h3>
    <p>AARO learned through an interviewee that a private sector organization <span class="source"><a
      href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span> claimed to have in its possession material from an
      extraterrestrial craft recovered from a crash at an unknown location from the 1940s or 1950s. The organization
      claimed that the material had the potential to act as a THz frequency waveguide, and therefore, could exhibit
      “anti-gravity” and “mass reduction” properties under the appropriate conditions. The organization that owned the
      material negotiated an agreement in <time>2019</time> with the U.S. Army to analyze the samples. With permission
      from the stakeholders, AARO acquired this sample to conduct more in-depth analyses.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AARO and a leading science laboratory concluded that the material is a metallic alloy, terrestrial in
        nature, and possibly of USAF origin, based on its materials characterization.</strong> It was also assessed that
        the material is mostly composed of magnesium, and the bismuth present was not a pure layer per initial claims.
      </li>
      <li>The U.S. Army had also conducted in-house analysis on the sample, and while AARO generally agrees with its
        conclusions, AARO found that the structure was not purely layered magnesium alloy and bismuth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>AARO assesses that a separate private sector organization’s recreation of this metallic sample was almost
      certainly conflated with claims that the aerospace industry was attempting to reverse-engineer off-world
      technology.</strong> Prior to AARO’s acquisition of the sample, the organization fabricated a replica of the
      sample to determine if it could be done <span class="source"><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The same organization <span class="source"><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span>
        made an attempt to replicate the sample at the same specific location cited by the interviewee <span
          class="source"><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span> as the location where the
        interviewee alleged to have participated in discussions about transferring UAP crash materials.</strong> The
        claim that extraterrestrial technology was being reverse-engineered almost certainly was conflated with this
        material fabrication.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>AARO Investigating Unresolved Historical Nuclear-Related UAP Cases</h3>
    <p>Like all historical UAP cases, very little actionable data exists beyond limited firsthand narrative accounts.
      Nevertheless, AARO continues to investigate these cases due to the sensitive nature of these events potentially
      impacting the readiness of the U.S. nuclear program. Although AARO has not been able to recover the alleged film
      of the ballistic missile reentry vehicle being shot down by a UAP in <time>1964</time>, AARO was able to correlate
      the general time and location with an antiballistic missile test, which could have been the genesis for this
      observation.</p>
