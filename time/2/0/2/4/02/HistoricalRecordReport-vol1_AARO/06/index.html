  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>AARO investigated numerous named, and described, but unnamed programs alleged to involve UAP exploitation conveyed
    to AARO through official interviews. Although at least one interviewee claimed to have seen a captured UAP, none of
    the interviewees had direct access to or firsthand knowledge of the programs alleged to be UAP-related. One
    interviewee had access into one authentic program, but his position was such that he had only limited access to its
    complete details. Interviewees’ indirect and incomplete knowledge of authentic efforts most likely contributed to
    their misinterpretation of what they heard or saw.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AARO concludes many of these programs represent authentic, current and former sensitive, national security
      programs, but none of these programs have been involved with capturing, recovering, or reverse-engineering
      off-world technology or material.</li>
    <li>All the programs assessed to be authentic were or—if still active—continue to be, appropriately reported to
      either or both the congressional defense and intelligence committees.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Process for Protecting Sensitive Programs while Investigating Interviewee Claims</h2>
  <p>AARO instituted a secure process for handling information to allow interviewees to come forward to provide their
    statements to AARO within secure facilities. AARO established a partnership with the Special Access Program Control
    Offices for the DoD, IC, and DHS to review programs identified in interviews by name or description to determine if
    the programs correlated in time and location to historic SAP or Controlled Access Programs (CAP). This agreement
    details how interviewee claims concerning the names and descriptions of the alleged programs are handled, stored,
    and protected so that their veracity can be determined in a secure manner. A key part of this agreement is that AARO
    investigators have been granted full access to all pertinent sensitive USG programs.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When industry partners were named, AARO interviewed senior level, appropriately- cleared executives, department
      leads, senior scientists, and engineers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Findings</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>One Private Program Mistaken for USG Program</h3>
    <p>AARO determined that the following alleged USG program name was portrayed inaccurately by the interviewee:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Virtual Institute for Satellite Integration Training–This program is not a USG-funded and supported effort. It
        was a program operated by a private UAP organization and had a NASA engineer as a participant. NASA verified
        that it did not sponsor the project <span class="source"><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span>.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h3>KONA BLUE: A Proposed UAP Recovery and Reverse-Engineering Program</h3>
    <p>KONA BLUE was brought to AARO’s attention by interviewees who claimed that it was a sensitive DHS compartment to
      cover up the retrieval and exploitation of <q>non-human biologics</q> <span class="source"><a
        href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span>. KONA BLUE traces its origins to the
      DIA-managed AAWSAP/AATIP program, which was funded through a special appropriation and executed by its primary
      contractor, a private sector organization. DIA cancelled the program in 2012 due to lack of merit and the utility
      of the deliverables. As discussed in Section IV of this report, while the official purpose of AAWSAP/AATIP was to
      conduct research into 12 areas of cutting edge science, the contractor team, and at least one supportive
      government program manager, also conducted UAP and paranormal research at a property owned by the private sector
      organization.</p>
    <p>When DIA cancelled this program, its supporters proposed to DHS that they create and fund a new version of
      AAWSAP/AATIP under a SAP <span class="source"><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span>.
      This proposal, codenamed KONA BLUE, would restart UAP investigations, paranormal
      research (including alleged “human consciousness anomalies”) and reverse-engineer any recovered off-world
      spacecraft that they hoped to acquire. This proposal gained some initial traction at DHS to the point where a
      Prospective Special Access Program (PSAP) was officially requested to stand up this program, but it was eventually
      rejected by DHS leadership for lacking merit. As demonstrated by the proposal package and by statements from the
      originator, Senators Lieberman and Reid asked that the PSAP be established with the promise of additional funding
      <span class="source">Senator Harry Reid Letter to Deputy Secretary of Defense, William Lynn III; Memorandum,
      from the Under Secretary of Defense James Clapper to the Deputy Secretary of Defense, 17
      November 2009; program documentation from ARRO case files</span>. The proposed KONA BLUE lines of effort closely
      mirrored those conducted by the private sector
      organization for AAWSAP/AATIP.</p>
    <p>KONA BLUE’s advocates were convinced that the USG was hiding UAP technologies. They believed that creating this
      program under DHS would allow all of the technology and knowledge of these alleged programs to be moved under the
      KONA BLUE program. The program would provide a security and governing structure where it could be monitored
      properly by congressional oversight committees. This belief was foundational for the KONA BLUE proposal, based on
      the proposal documents and several interviewees who have provided the same information to AARO and Congress <span
        class="source">AARO case files</span>.
      The Oral History Initiative section of the KONA BLUE proposal was to collect data:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>…from an already identified and calibrated list of retired, previously highly placed government, armed
        services, contractor and intelligence community individuals. The oral history project will include gathering all
        information pertaining to the location of advanced aerospace technology and biological samples, including
        records, files, reports, photographs, as well as physical samples <span class="source">Program documentation,
          from AARO case files</span>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>It is critical to note that no extraterrestrial craft or bodies were ever collected—this material was
      only assumed to exist by KONA BLUE advocates and its anticipated contract performers. This was the same assumption
      made by those same individuals involved with the AAWSAP/AATIP program.</strong> The SAP was never approved or
      stood up, and no data or material was transferred to DHS <span class="source">Senator Harry Reid Letter to Deputy Secretary of Defense, William Lynn III; Memorandum,
      from the Under Secretary of Defense James Clapper to the Deputy Secretary of Defense, 17
      November 2009.</span>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>KONA BLUE was not reported to Congress at that time because it was never established as a SAP and, therefore,
        did not meet the threshold for congressional reporting. However, the Deputy Secretary of Defense provided a
        Congressional Notification concerning the program when it was identified in the spirit of transparency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Unnecessary IC Program Expansion</h3>
    <p>AARO confirmed the existence of one IC CAP that was unnecessarily expanded in 2021 to include a UAP
      reverse-engineering mission. This program was expanded despite the lack of any evidence or mission need to justify
      the expansion. The appropriate congressional committees were notified. This program never recovered or
      reverse-engineered any technology, let alone off-world spacecraft. This CAP was disestablished due to its
      inactivity, absence of mission need, and lack of merit.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Nexus of Proponents of the USG UAP Reverse-Engineering Allegation</h3>
    <p>AARO found no empirical evidence that any UAP investigatory effort since <time>1945</time>— foreign, domestic,
      government,
      private, or academic—has ever uncovered verifiable information regarding the recovery or existence of
      extraterrestrial beings or crafts. Although AARO continues to conduct interviews, research programs, and pursue
      investigatory leads, AARO’s work has resulted in disproving the majority of these claims using the verifiable
      information made within those claims.</p>
    <p>AARO researched and interviewed numerous people, programs, and leads. It has determined that modern allegations
      that the USG is hiding off-world technology and beings largely originate from the same group of individuals who
      have ties to the cancelled AAWSAP/AATIP program and a private sector organization’s paranormal research efforts.
      These individuals have worked with each other consistently in various UAP-related efforts.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Persons 1-5 and Interviewees 1, 3, 9, 12, 13, and 14 have repeatedly voiced these claims in various public and
        private venues, and they have petitioned Congress in various capacities on UAP issues. They have not provided
        any empirical evidence of their claims to AARO <span class="source"><a
          href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case files</span>.</li>
      <li>Persons 1 and 3 and Interviewees 1, 3, and 12 were involved with the paranormal research conducted under
        AAWSAP/AATIP <span class="source">AARO case files</span>.</li>
      <li>Person 5 and Interviewees 3, 9 and 14 were involved with the alleged crashed UAP materials that were provided
        to the U.S. Army and subsequently to AARO for examination <span class="source">AARO case files</span>.</li>
      <li>Persons 4, 7, and 8 and Interviewees 1, 3, and 13 investigated UAP on their own and were responsible for
        successfully expanding the remit of an existing IC program to include UAP exploitation language <span
          class="source">AARO case files</span>.</li>
      <li>AARO notes that Persons 1 and 4 never formally sat down with AARO to provide official, signed statements;
        these individuals have been mentioned by other interviewees frequently as sources of their claims. Person 8 held
        an informal interview and Interviewee 14 sat for an official interview but has not signed the memo for the
        record documenting this interview.</li>
