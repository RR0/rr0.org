  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p><strong><em>AARO assesses that the incidents of UAP sightings reported to USG organizations, the claims that some
    constitute extraterrestrial craft, and the claims that the USG has secured and is experimenting on alien technology,
    most likely are the result of a range of cultural, political, and technological factors.</em></strong> AARO bases
    this conclusion on the aggregate findings of all USG investigations to date, the misinterpretation of all reported
    named sensitive programs, the lack of empirical evidence to support the USG reverse-engineering narrative, and
    AARO’s assessment that the piece of metal alleged to be recovered from an alien spacecraft in the late 1940s is
    ordinary, of terrestrial origin, and possesses no exceptional qualities.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Although many cases remain unsolved—primarily because of the lack of actionable and researchable data—AARO and
      its predecessor organizations concluded that the vast majority of cases report on events that amount to ordinary
      objects, atmospheric and natural phenomena, and observer misidentification.</li>
    <li>Although many UAP/UFO cases remain unsolved, based on the lack of evidence of the extraterrestrial origin of
      even one UAP report and the assessment that all resolved cases to date have ordinary explanations, AARO assess
      sightings and claims of extraterrestrial visitations have been influenced by a range of factors.</li>

  <h2>Commonalities of 20th and 21st Century UAP Investigations</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>International Security Environment and Technological Surprise</h3>
    <p>In both periods, changes in the international order brought uncertainty. Concern about the Soviet Union’s desire
      for regional hegemony and military and political superiority contributed to U.S. involvement with conflicts in
      Korea, Vietnam, and elsewhere, sparked a boom in U.S. technological innovation, and led to widespread fear within
      society about Soviet capabilities and intentions.</p>
    <p>One primary means of competing with the Soviet Union was to collect intelligence on Soviet leadership intentions
      and military capabilities. The means by which the U.S. accomplished this goal was to develop a range of air- and
      space-based reconnaissance systems to collect an array of intelligence on the Soviet Union—especially over its
      territory. During some early UFO investigation efforts, it was deemed essential to determine if UFOs were Soviet
      “secret weapons” or psychological warfare operations aimed at causing public fear and generating hysteria to
      undermine U.S. societal morale.</p>
    <p>Today’s global security environment is similarly dynamic. Both the Russian Federation and the PRC seek to alter
      the international system at the expense of the security of the United States. AARO recognizes that concern with
      competitor technological surprise is still a real and legitimate driver of UAP investigations today. It is
      imperative to determine whether or not these sightings represent a risk to flight safety, and whether these
      sightings represent technological advances that could pose counterintelligence and national security threats.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Secrecy</h3>
    <p>The USG’s need to maintain secrecy to protect classified information about intelligence sources and methods,
      military operations and technology, and U.S. vulnerabilities is also a shared context among all UAP
      investigations. While secrecy is essential to protect U.S. national security interests, it can reduce the public’s
      trust in government. With a gap in information about UFO/UAP investigations, other information sources and
      narratives, including private UFO investigative organizations and “UFOlogy” emerged to fill that gap. AARO
      assesses that the classification of prior USG investigations have fueled speculation that the government was
      hiding knowledge of extraterrestrials, when, in fact, secrecy was and still is intended to deliberately and
      thoughtfully protect sensitive military and intelligence community programs, capabilities, sources, and
      methods.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Public Interest</h3>
    <p>Segments of the American public have been interested in this topic since the term “flying saucer” emerged after
      <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MontRainier">Arnold’s sighting</a> in <time>1947</time>, as evidenced
      by the proliferation of television, books, movies, and podcasts today on the topic. The subject is deeply rooted
      in popular culture with its own themes, mythologies, and conspiracy theories. Capt Ruppelt, who was involved with
      three UFO investigations efforts, including being the initial leader of Project BLUE BOOK, noted that there would
      be spikes in reported sightings after official press events mentioning UFOs; suggesting that reports of sightings
      can influence the incidence of additional reported sightings <span class="source">Edward J. Ruppelt, <a
        href="https://ia801304.us.archive.org/22/items/FritjofCapraTheTurningPoint/Edward%20J%20Ruppelt%20-%20The%20Report%20on%20Unidentified%20Flying%20Objects.pdf">The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects</a> (Doubleday, 1956). Page 93.</span>.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Alleged Bureaucratic Barriers</h3>
    <p>Alleged bureaucratic barriers including indifference, cognitive dissonance, lack of support or resources, and
      deliberate obstruction are also similarities. Some members of investigatory panels have claimed official
      obstruction, ranging from lack of access to senior decision-makers to insufficient staff and resources.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Insufficient Data and Information</h3>
    <p>Previous and current investigations have been challenged by insufficient data and information for intelligence
      and scientific analysis to resolve anomalous incidents. Insufficient data and information was compounded by
      inconsistent reporting and lack of continuity among investigations and investigative practices. Capt Ruppelt, the
      first director of Project BLUE BOOK, noted that the inability to collect the UFO’s altitude, size, and speed was a
      recurring and significant obstacle to resolving cases <span class="source">Edward J. Ruppelt, <a
        href="https://ia801304.us.archive.org/22/items/FritjofCapraTheTurningPoint/Edward%20J%20Ruppelt%20-%20The%20Report%20on%20Unidentified%20Flying%20Objects.pdf">The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects</a> (Doubleday, 1956). Page 91</span>.
      A similar challenge remains today, even with the advancement in technology. Most UAP sightings have no data
      associated with them beyond an often vague narrative account; and when there is hard data, it is often incomplete
      or of poor quality. In terms of military reporting, the sensors on which UAP most frequently are captured are
      calibrated and optimized for combat. UAP are not routinely captured by exquisite, high-definition,
      multi-capability, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance collection platforms— a threshold which is often
      required to successfully resolve a case.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Perceived Deception</h3>
    <p>There is a conviction among some Americans that the USG has conducted a deception operation to conceal the fact
      that it has recovered extraterrestrial spacecraft and alien beings as well as systematically exploited and
      reverse-engineered extraterrestrial technology <span class="source">J. Allen Hyneck, “The UFO Experience,” Da Capo Press, 1977; Edward J. Ruppelt, The
      Report on Unidentified Flying Objects (Doubleday, 1956),</span>. This perception probably has been fueled by key
      UFO investigators’ public comments. For example, J. Allen Hynek of Project BLUE BOOK, said that the USAF expected
      him to perform the role of debunker; and Capt Ruppelt, the first chief of BLUE BOOK, later wrote that he was
      expected to explain away every report and that the USAF sought to produce press stories in alignment with the
      USAF’s position <span class="source">J. Allen Hyneck, “The UFO Experience,” Da Capo Press, 1977; Edward J. Ruppelt, The
      Report on Unidentified Flying Objects (Doubleday, 1956),</span>.</p>

  <h2>Differences between 20th and 21st Century UAP Investigations</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>Decreased Public Trust</h3>
    <p>Polling data on public trust reflects Americans’ changing views over time. According to the Pew Research Center,
      polling on this topic began in <time>1958</time>, when about 75 percent of Americans trusted the USG “to do the
      right thing almost always or most of the time.” Since <time>2007</time>, however, that figure has not risen above
      30 percent. This lack of trust probably has contributed to the belief held by some subset of the U.S. population
      that the USG has not been truthful regarding knowledge of extraterrestrial craft <span class="source">Pew Research Center, “<a
        href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/public-trust-in-government-1958-2022/">Public Trust in Government: 1958-2022</a>,” June 6, 2022.</span>.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Popular Culture</h3>
    <p>Though there were waves of public interest in UAP in popular culture during the Cold War, especially during the
      1950s, AARO assesses that UAP content in popular culture is more pervasive now than ever. The speed of discovery,
      and the ubiquity of information available through the internet on the topic is unprecedented. Frequent exposure to
      the topic though traditional and social media has increased the number of Americans who believe that UAP are of
      extraterrestrial origin, based on a 2021 Gallup poll <span class="source">“<a
        href="https://www.news/gallup/com/poll/350096/americans-beleive-ufos.aspx">Do Americans Believe in UFOs</a>,” Gallup</span>.
    </p>
    <p>Aside from hoaxes and forgeries, misinformation and disinformation is more prevalent and easier to disseminate
      now than ever before, especially with today’s advanced photo, video, and computer generated imagery tools.
      Internet search and content recommendation algorithms serve to reinforce individuals’ preconceptions and
      confirmation biases just as much as to help educate and inform.</p></section>
