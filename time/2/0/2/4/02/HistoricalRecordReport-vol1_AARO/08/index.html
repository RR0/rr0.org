<section>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>We assess that the majority of UAP sightings in the earlier decades of UAP investigations were the result of
    misidentification of ordinary phenomena and objects, based on AARO’s findings of its own cases to date and the
    findings of all past investigatory efforts. However, we assess that some portion of these misidentifications almost
    certainly were a result of the surge in new technologies that observers would have understandably reported as
    UFOs.</p>
  <p>Along with these systems, a broad and varying technology industry emerged along with a network of highly secretive
    national laboratories across the United States to support these efforts. AARO’s review of <a
      href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project BLUE BOOK</a> cases
    shows a spike in reported UAP sightings from <time>1952/1957</time> and another spike in <time>1960</time> <span

    “CIA's Role in the Study of UFOs, 1947-90,” Studies in Intelligence, Vol. 1, No. 1</span>. These reporting spikes
    most likely are attributed to observers unknowingly having witnessed new technological advancements and testing and
    reporting them as UFOs. The below examples represent formerly classified and sensitive programs that involved
    thousands of test flights, rocket launches, and extensive experimentation which AARO assess most likely were the
    cause of many UAP reports. AARO assesses that this common and understandable occurrence—the misidentification of new
    technologies for UAP— is present today, such as in cases where rocket exhaust plumes, micro-satellite trains, and
    UAS systems with odd morphologies are reported as UAP.</p>

<p><strong>The below examples represent a sample of the unclassified and declassified authentic national security
  programs that AARO assesses probably were associated with erroneous UAP reporting:</strong></p>

  <h2>Manhattan Project (August 1942)</h2>
  <p>The U.S. effort to build an atomic bomb, the <a href="/org/us/dod/Manhattan.html">Manhattan Project</a>, was named
    after the location of its initial offices in what became known as the Manhattan Engineer District at 270 Broadway,
    Manhattan, New York City. General Leslie R. Groves, head of the project, followed the custom of naming the U.S. Army
    Corps of Engineers’ districts after the city in which they were located <span class="source"><a

    Richard Rhodes, The Making of the Atomic Bomb (Simon and Shuster, 1986), Kai Bird and

    national laboratories, such as Los Alamos National Laboratories, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Sandia
    National Laboratories, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to support this
    effort probably contributed to the spike in reported UAP <span class="source"><a

  <h2>V-173/XF5U-1 “Flying Pancake” (1942)</h2>
  <p>The V-173 aircraft flew for the first time on <time>1942-11-23</time> <span class="source">Norman Polmar, “<a

    It was believed that maintaining a uniform airflow over the wingspan—or “pancake” fuselage—would allow the aircraft
    to take off and land at exceptionally low speeds without sacrificing high-speed performance qualities that appealed
    to the USN for its fighter aircraft <span class="source"><a

    23.3 feet in diameter, and could almost hover. The XF5U-1’s design was largely similar to the V-173. However, the
    USN cancelled the project in <time>1948</time> in favor of a switch to turbojet engines <span class="source"><a

  <h2>Project Aquatone/Dragon Lady (1954)</h2>
  <p>President Eisenhower authorized Project Aquatone to develop the U-2 Dragon Lady, a high-altitude reconnaissance
    aircraft to collect intelligence on Soviet nuclear deployments. More than half of the UFO reports investigated in
    the 1950s and 1960s were assessed to be U.S. reconnaissance flights, according to a declassified CIA assessment on
    reconnaissance aircraft Gregory W. Pedlow and Donald E. Welzenbach, <a

    that UFO reports would spike when the U-2 was in flight, especially from airline pilots to Air Traffic Control. At
    that time, commercial flights typically flew below 20,000 feet while the U-2 flew at 60,000 feet. The report noted

    President Eisenhower decided the CIA would have the lead role in the program, called “CORONA,” and that it would be

  <h2>VZ-9AV Avrocar/Project Silver Bug (1958)</h2>
  <p>Canada initially led an effort to develop a supersonic, vertical takeoff and landing fighter-bomber in the early

  <h2>HAVE Blue/F-117A Nighthawk/TACIT Blue (1975)</h2>
  <p>The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) oversaw the development of HAVE Blue in the mid-1970s, which
    was the first practical, combat-stealth aircraft. HAVE Blue completed its first test flight in <time>1977</time>,
    and the success of this program led the USAF to later produce the <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/f117">F-117</a>A
    Nighthawk, as well as the TACIT Blue aircraft. The HAVE Blue, F-117A Nighthawk, and TACIT Blue programs laid the

  <h2>Strategic Defense Initiative (March 1983)</h2>
  <p>At the initiative of President Ronald Reagan, the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization was established in
    <time>1984</time> to explore a multi-layered strategic defense against ballistic missiles; this program involved
    research into space-based and ground-based systems including laser and interceptor missiles. This intensive research
    effort involved national laboratories and academia. Some of the technologies researched were determined to be years
    from development, and funding was reduced. The program ended in <time>1993</time> and was replaced by the Ballistic
    Missile Defense Organization <span class="source"><a href="https://www.mda.mil/about/history.html">Department of Defense</a>; <a

  <h2>Advent of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles 1980s-Present</h2>
  <p>The research and development, flight testing, evaluation, deployment, and the operation of drones—Unmanned Aerial
    Systems (UAS), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), and Remotely Piloted Aircraft
    Systems (RPAS)—almost certainly resulted in reported sightings of UAP. Some of these systems had a “saucer” or
    triangle-shaped appearance and were capable of loitering aloft.</p>
  <p>The USG acquired and operated a number of systems for a range of missions including intelligence, surveillance,
    reconnaissance, and strike, among others. The below systems represent a sample of those that have been operationally
    deployed since the <time>1994</time> Bosnia conflict and subsequently employed in counterterrorism operations around

  <h2>Dark Star</h2>
  <p>The RQ-3 Dark Star was a remote pilot-assisted stealth system intended to conduct reconnaissance missions in
    high-threat areas. Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and DARPA developed Dark Star in the mid-to-late 1990s <a href="https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-

    It never entered production, but the research conducted on Dark Star led to subsequent advances used on other
    platforms. Some observers asserted that Dark Star resembled a flying saucer with long narrow wings <a href="https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-

  <p>It was designed to be fully autonomous from its launch, mission engagement, and return. It used satellite links to
    transmit sensor data. The first prototype flew in <time>1996</time>, but crashed a month later on its second flight.
