<section>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>We assess that the majority of UAP sightings in the earlier decades of UAP investigations were the result of
    misidentification of ordinary phenomena and objects, based on AARO’s findings of its own cases to date and the
    findings of all past investigatory efforts. However, we assess that some portion of these misidentifications almost
    certainly were a result of the surge in new technologies that observers would have understandably reported as
    UFOs.</p>
  <p>Along with these systems, a broad and varying technology industry emerged along with a network of highly secretive
    national laboratories across the United States to support these efforts. AARO’s review of Project BLUE BOOK cases
    shows a spike in reported UAP sightings from 1952-1957 and another spike in 1960.130 These reporting spikes most
    likely are attributed to observers unknowingly having witnessed new technological advancements and testing and
    reporting them as UFOs. The below examples represent formerly classified and sensitive programs that involved
    thousands of test flights, rocket launches, and extensive experimentation which AARO assess most likely were the
    cause of many UAP reports. AARO assesses that this common and understandable occurrence—the misidentification of new
    technologies for UAP— is present today, such as in cases where rocket exhaust plumes, micro-satellite trains, and
    UAS systems with odd morphologies are reported as UAP.</p>
</section>
<p><strong><em>The below examples represent a sample of the unclassified and declassified authentic national security
  programs that AARO assesses probably were associated with erroneous UAP reporting:</em></strong></p>
<section>
  <h2>Manhattan Project (August 1942)</h2>
  <p>The U.S. effort to build an atomic bomb, the Manhattan Project, was named after the location of its initial offices
    in what became known as the Manhattan Engineer District at 270 Broadway, Manhattan, New York City. General Leslie R.
    Groves, head of the project, followed the custom of naming the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ districts after the
    city in which they were located.131 The secrecy surrounding the Manhattan Project and the establishment of several
    other national laboratories, such as Los Alamos National Laboratories, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,
    Sandia National Laboratories, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to support
    this effort probably contributed to the spike in reported UAP.132</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>V-173/XF5U-1 “Flying Pancake” (1942)</h2>
  <p>The V-173 aircraft flew for the first time on November 23, 1942.133 It was believed that maintaining a uniform
    airflow over the wingspan—or “pancake” fuselage—would allow the aircraft to take off and land at exceptionally low
    speeds without sacrificing high-speed performance qualities that appealed to the USN for its fighter aircraft.134
    The V-173 could take off vertically, had a circular wing 23.3 feet in diameter, and could almost hover. The XF5U-1’s
    design was largely similar to the V-173. However, the USN cancelled the project in 1948 in favor of a switch to
    turbojet engines.135</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Project Mogul (1947-1949)</h2>
  <p>The U.S. Army Air Force Air Materiel Command operated Project Mogul between 1947 and 1949. The aim of this program
    was to secure intelligence on Soviet nuclear weapons testing and to provide an early warning mechanism for Soviet
    ballistic missiles. Specifically, Project Mogul scientists worked on developing high-altitude balloons that would
    carry sensors capable of detecting long-range sound waves from weapons tests or missiles traveling through the
    atmosphere. A crashed balloon associated with Project Mogul outside of Roswell, New Mexico, is assessed to be the
    source of early UFO claims.136</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Project High Dive (1950s)</h2>
  <p>Project High Dive was a program that conducted tests on large balloons and used test dummies in its
    experimentation. The goal of this program was to research the effects on pilots when they ejected from aircraft,
    especially pilots’ tolerance to deceleration from wind drag.137</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Project Aquatone/Dragon Lady (1954)</h2>
  <p>President Eisenhower authorized Project Aquatone to develop the U-2 Dragon Lady, a high-altitude reconnaissance
    aircraft to collect intelligence on Soviet nuclear deployments. More than half of the UFO reports investigated in
    the 1950s and 1960s were assessed to be U.S. reconnaissance flights, according to a declassified CIA assessment on
    reconnaissance aircraft.138 The report noted that UFO reports would spike when the U-2 was in flight, especially
    from airline pilots to Air Traffic Control. At that time, commercial flights typically flew below 20,000 feet while
    the U-2 flew at 60,000 feet. The report noted that when commercial pilots were flying east to west, with the sun
    below the horizon, the sunlight would illuminate the U-2.139</p></section>

  <h2>WS-117L/CORONA (Late 1956)</h2>
  <p>In <time>1956</time>, the USAF initiated the WS-117L satellite reconnaissance program equipped with a film-return
    vehicle. Following the launch of Sputnik, the Eisenhower Administration made this program a high-priority. In
    February 1958, President Eisenhower decided the CIA would have the lead role in the program, called “CORONA,” and
    that it would be jointly managed alongside the USAF. The CORONA program performed 140 launches between 1959 and
    1972, with many returning film from space to the Earth for recovery.140</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>VZ-9AV Avrocar/Project Silver Bug (1958)</h2>
  <p>Canada initially led an effort to develop a supersonic, vertical takeoff and landing fighter- bomber in the early
    1950s. A.V. Roe (Avro) Aircraft Limited (later Avro Canada) led the design for the concept, and this effort yielded
    the Avrocar, an aircraft with a circular shape that gave it a stereotypical “flying saucer” appearance.141 Canada
    pulled its support when the project became too expensive. The U.S. Army and U.S. USAF took over the project in 1958
    when Avro offered it to the USG, when it became known as “Project Silver Bug.”142 143 Avro built two test vehicles
    that were designated as the VZ-9AV Avrocar, but the project was cancelled in December 1961 when the vehicle could
    not lift more than a few feet off the ground.144 Project Silver Bug was declassified in 1997.145</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Explorer 1 (January 1958)</h2>
  <p>The United States launched its first satellite, Explorer 1, into space on January 31, 1958. Explorer 1 carried a
    cosmic ray detector and was designed, built, and operated by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.146</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Oxcart/A-12/SR-71 (1958)</h2>
  <p>President Eisenhower approved this CIA-led program to develop a successor to the U-2 spy plane in 1958, which
    became fully operational in 1965. 147 The U-2’s successor, the A-12 OXCART sustained a speed of Mach 3.2 at 90,000
    feet altitude.148 By the time the A-12 was deployed by the CIA in 1967, CORONA satellites were being used to collect
    imagery of denied areas with less provocation than aircraft overflights. 149 In 1968, President Johnson ordered the
    retirement of the A-12 when it was replaced by the SR-71, which itself was a modified version of the A-12.150</p>

<section>
  <h2>Project Mercury (1958-1963)</h2>
  <p>Project Mercury, America’s first human space program made six flights. The objectives of the program were to orbit
    a manned spacecraft around Earth, investigate humans’ ability to function in space, and recover astronauts and
    spacecraft safely.151</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>TATTLETALE/GRAB (September 1960)</h2>
  <p>The United States was the first nation to deliver a reconnaissance satellite to space. This electronic intelligence
    (ELINT) satellite was developed by the Naval Research Laboratory in early 1958 under the code name “TATTLETALE” with
    the mission of intercepting Soviet radar signals.152 The program later became known as GRAB (Galactic Radiation and
    Background), after public disclosure of the ELINT satellite project.153 154</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Project Gemini (1961-1966)</h2>
  <p>The Gemini program was a U.S. human spaceflight program that took place between the Mercury and Apollo programs.
    Similar to Project Mercury, Project Gemini spacecraft was launched using ballistic missiles that were designed to
    carry nuclear payloads.155 Project Gemini conducted 12 missions.156</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Project Apollo (1961-1972)</h2>
  <p>Project Apollo was a NASA human spaceflight program conducted after Project Mercury and Project Gemini. 157 Project
    Apollo totaled 14 missions, 11 spaceflights, and 12 astronauts walking on the moon.158</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Poppy (1962-1977)</h2>
  <p>The successor to GRAB, Poppy was an ELINT satellite system developed by the National Research Laboratory that
    operated from 1962 to 1977 to collect Soviet radar emissions.159 A total of seven Poppy missions were launched
    between December 1962 and December 1971.160 The program was declassified in 2004.161</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Gambit (1963-1971)</h2>
  <p>The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) launched its first high-resolution photoreconnaissance satellite system in
    1963, which became known by its codename, Gambit.162 Two Gambit systems were developed: Gambit 1, initially launched
    in 1963, and Gambit 3, which was first launched in 1966.163 The Gambit 1 satellite’s exposed film was returned to
    Earth in reentry vehicles, or “buckets,” that separated from the satellite, fell through the atmosphere and
    descended by parachute until obtained by USAF aircraft at about 15,000 feet altitude.164 Gambit was declassified in
    2011.</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Hexagon (1971- 1986)</h2>
  <p>Similar to Gambit, Hexagon was an NRO photoreconnaissance satellite system. It was launched in 1971 to conduct
    wide-area searches of denied territory.165 From 1971-1986, 19 missions collected imagery over 877 million square
    miles of the Earth’s surface.166 The Hexagon system was the last satellite employing film reentry vehicles. 167
    Hexagon was declassified in 2011.168</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Space Transportation System/Space Shuttle (1972 - 2011)</h2>
  <p>The Space Shuttle program was NASA’s fourth human spaceflight program and was comprised of the first reusable
    spacecraft to carry humans into Earth’s orbit.169 The space shuttle fleet—Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis,
    and Endeavour—flew 135 missions, serviced the Hubble space telescope, and helped construct the International Space
    Station. 170 The first shuttle launch, Columbia, was conducted on April 12, 1981.171</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>HAVE Blue/F-117A Nighthawk/TACIT Blue (1975)</h2>
  <p>The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) oversaw the development of HAVE Blue in the mid-1970s, which
    was the first practical, combat-stealth aircraft. HAVE Blue completed its first test flight in 1977, and the success
    of this program led the USAF to later produce the F-117A Nighthawk, as well as the TACIT Blue aircraft. The HAVE
    Blue, F-117A Nighthawk, and TACIT Blue programs laid the foundations for the later development of the B-2 stealth
    bomber.172</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Advanced Technology Bomber/B-2 Spirit (1980)</h2>
  <p>The B-2 is a USAF low-observable stealth bomber capable of delivering conventional and nuclear payloads. It uses a
    combination of reduced infrared, acoustic, and electromagnetic signatures. It was first publicly displayed on
    November 22, 1988 in Palmdale, California and conducted its first flight on July 17, 1989. The first aircraft was
    delivered on December 17, 1993.173</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Strategic Defense Initiative (March 1983)</h2>
  <p>At the initiative of President Ronald Reagan, the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization was established in 1984
    to explore a multi-layered strategic defense against ballistic missiles; this program involved research into
    space-based and ground-based systems including laser and interceptor missiles. This intensive research effort
    involved national laboratories and academia. Some of the technologies researched were determined to be years from
    development, and funding was reduced. The program ended in 1993 and was replaced by the Ballistic Missile Defense
    Organization.174</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Advent of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles 1980s-Present</h2>
  <p>The research and development, flight testing, evaluation, deployment, and the operation of drones—Unmanned Aerial
    Systems (UAS), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), and Remotely Piloted Aircraft
    Systems (RPAS)—almost certainly resulted in reported sightings of UAP. Some of these systems had a “saucer” or
    triangle-shaped appearance and were capable of loitering aloft.</p>
  <p>The USG acquired and operated a number of systems for a range of missions including intelligence, surveillance,
    reconnaissance, and strike, among others. The below systems represent a sample of those that have been operationally
    deployed since the 1994 Bosnia conflict and subsequently employed in counterterrorism operations around the
    world.175 Since then, their form and use have spread to civil and commercial applications.</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>GNAT 750</h2>
  <p>The GNAT 750 was developed in the late 1980s by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. The prototype served as
    the basis for a more advanced design under DARPA.176 It was first used in 1994 during the Bosnia conflict where
    satellites were not optimized to collect for extended times over such small areas and where the airspace was heavily
    defended by capable anti-aircraft missile systems.177</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Predator</h2>
  <p>The Predator system, also built by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., was based on the GNAT-750. 178 It
    was initially a joint USN and U.S. Army project but transitioned to the USAF in 1996.179 It was known as the RQ-1.
    180 The system possessed synthetic aperture radar, electro-optical, and infrared sensors. 181 It was used to support
    United Nations and North Atlantic Treaty Organization efforts in Bosnia and was widely used in counterterrorism
    operations.182 It became a platform with a wide array of technical capabilities that performed a variety of
    missions—such as close air support, combat search and rescue, precision strike, convoy/raid over watch, target
    development and terminal air guidance.183 The USAF retired the fleet in 2018. 184</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Reaper</h2>
  <p>General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. also built the MQ-9 Reaper—a newer, larger version of the MQ-1 Predator
    UAV.185 This platform is faster, equipped with more advanced sensors, can carry more munitions than the Predator,
    and can be easily tailored with a variety of mission-specific capabilities.186 The system requires a pilot to
    control the aircraft and an aircrew member to operate the sensors and weapons.187 188 It has an operational altitude
    of 50,000 feet. 189 The aircraft is operated out of a variety of locations worldwide, including Creech Air Force
    Base (AFB) in Nevada.190</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Dark Star</h2>
  <p>The RQ-3 Dark Star was a remote pilot-assisted stealth system intended to conduct reconnaissance missions in
    high-threat areas. Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and DARPA developed Dark Star in the mid-to-late 1990s.191 It never
    entered production, but the research conducted on Dark Star led to subsequent advances used on other platforms. Some
    observers asserted that Dark Star resembled a flying saucer with long narrow wings.192</p>
  <p>It was designed to be fully autonomous from its launch, mission engagement, and return. It used satellite links to
    transmit sensor data. The first prototype flew in 1996, but crashed a month later on its second flight. The system
    completed five test flights before DoD terminated the program in 1999 due to cost and instability problems.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Polecat</h2>
  <p>Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Development Program organization, also known as “Skunk Works” developed the P-175
    Polecat UAV to better understand the flight dynamics of tailless, bat-wing- shaped, 90-foot wingspan high-altitude
    UAV, including the next generation of structural composite materials and configurations.194 The Polecat made its
    first flight in 2005, and Lockheed Martin disclosed its existence in the Farnborough Airshow in 2006.195</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Sentinel</h2>
  <p>The RQ-170 Sentinel is a UAV developed by Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works for the USAF. 196 It is a low observable
    platform with a variety of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance payloads. The Sentinel is operated out of
    Creech AFB and the Tonopah Test Range in Nevada.197</p></section>
<section>
  <h2>Global Hawk</h2>
  <p>Built by Northrop Grumman, the RQ-4 Global Hawk is the largest UAS in operation by the USAF. 198 It can fly at
    65,000 feet more than 34 hours and is also capable of loitering at 60,000 feet while monitoring almost 58,000 square
    miles.199 The aircraft is currently fielded in three different models. 200</p></section>
