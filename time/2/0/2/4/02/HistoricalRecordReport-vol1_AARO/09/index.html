<p><strong><em>To date, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> has not discovered any empirical evidence that
  any sighting of a UAP represented off-world technology or the existence a classified program that had not been
  properly reported to Congress.</em></strong> Investigative efforts determined that most sightings were the result of
  misidentification of ordinary objects and phenomena. Although many UAP reports remain unsolved, <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> assesses that if additional, quality data were available, most of these
  cases also could be identified and resolved as ordinary objects or phenomena.</p>
<p>This report represents Volume I of AAROâ€™s HR2. Volume II will be published in accordance with the date established in
  Section 6802 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year <time>2023</time> (FY23) and will provide
  additional analysis on information not yet secured and analyzed, interviews not yet conducted, and additional avenues
  of investigation not yet completed by the date of the publication of Volume 1.</p>
