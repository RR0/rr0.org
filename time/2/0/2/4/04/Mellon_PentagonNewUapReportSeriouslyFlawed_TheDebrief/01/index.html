<p>The new UAP investigative agency of the U.S. Government is currently called the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office
  (AARO). It reports jointly to the leaders of DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC). AARO recently sent the
  classified version of its first historical report, Vol. I, to Congress. Ostensibly, it covers the period from 1945 to
  October 31, 2023. The administrative cover date is February 2024. Volume II is due on about June 15, 2024.</p>
<p>The Congressional legal mandate, meaning by statutory law, required that this AARO historical report present the
  detailed history of UAP as recorded in US Government records. However, AARO instead presented a summary history of the
  records of flawed USG investigations of UAP, rather than what was actually mandated: the history of UAP and “relating
  to” UAP, meaning the history of UAP sightings and investigations (and to be completed using USG records and other
  official information).</p>
<p>The law required a “written report detailing the historical record of the United States Government relating to
  unidentified anomalous phenomena,” and the word “investigations” nowhere appears – the phrase does not say it is to be
  a historical report solely “relating to” investigations of “unidentified anomalous phenomena.” (NDAA FY2023 Sec.
  6802(j)(1)(A), codified statute 50 U.S. Code § 3373(j)(1)(A), as amended.)</p>
<p>In another breach of the explicit terms of the law, AARO failed to compile, itemize, and report on US intelligence
  agency abuses on UAP (per 50 U.S.C. § 3373, below). The AARO Historical Report was required to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“(ii) include a compilation and itemization of the key historical record of the involvement of the intelligence
    community with unidentified anomalous phenomena [UAP], including— …</li>
  <li>“(III) any efforts to obfuscate, manipulate public opinion, hide, or otherwise provide incorrect unclassified or
    classified information about unidentified anomalous phenomena [UAP] or related activities.” [NDAA FY23 Sec.
    6802(j)(1)(B); 50 U.S. Code § 3373(j)(1)(B)]</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrary to Congressional direction, AARO completely omits entire agencies – NORAD, NSA, DIA (prior to 2009), CBP,
  etc. – agencies with known investigations or activities relating to UAP, and also omits any discussion of “any efforts
  to obfuscate, [or]… hide … unclassified or classified information about unidentified anomalous phenomena [UAP] or
  related activities.” AARO omits these agencies even when there are unclassified documents available on those agencies’
  records and investigations of UAP (for example, see the approximate 100 pages of CBP Customs & Border Protection
  agency internal memos of Records on UAP, plus 10 videos, released in August, 2023, but unmentioned by AARO; Also see
  McMillan, Hanks, Plain, “Incursions at the Border,” The Debrief, May 27, 2022).</p>
