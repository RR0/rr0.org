<p>La nouvelle agence d'enquête sur les PAN du gouvernement américain est actuellement appelée <a
  href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">Bureau de Résolution des Anomalies Tous Domaines (AARO)</a>. Elle rapporte jointly
  to the leaders of DoD and the <a href="/org/us/ic">Intelligence Community (IC)</a>. AARO recently sent the classified
  version of its first historical report, Vol. I, to Congress. Ostensibly, it covers the period from <time>1945/2023-10-31</time>.
  The administrative cover date is <time>2024-02</time>. Volume II is due on about <time>2024-06-15</time>.</p>
<p>The Congressional legal mandate, meaning by statutory law, required that this AARO historical report present the
  detailed <b>history of UAP</b> as recorded in US Government <b><i>records</i></b>. However, AARO instead presented a
  summary history of the records of flawed USG <b><i>investigations</i></b> of UAP, rather than what was actually
  mandated: <b><i>the history of UAP and “relating to” UAP, meaning the history of UAP sightings and investigations</i></b>
  (and to be completed using USG records and other official information).</p>
<p>The law required a <q>written report detailing the historical record of the United States Government <b>relating to
  unidentified anomalous phenomena</b>,</q> and the word <q>investigations</q> nowhere appears – the phrase does not say
  it is to be a historical report solely <q>relating to</q> <b><i>investigations</i></b> of <q>unidentified anomalous
    phenomena.</q> <span class="source">NDAA FY2023 Sec. 6802(j)(1)(A), codified statute 50 U.S. Code § 3373(j)(1)(A), as amended</span>.
</p>
<p>In another breach of the explicit terms of the law, AARO failed to compile, itemize, and report on US intelligence
  agency abuses on UAP <span class="source">per 50 U.S.C. § 3373, below</span>. The AARO Historical Report was required
  to:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(ii) include a compilation and itemization of the key historical record of the involvement of the intelligence
    community with unidentified anomalous phenomena [UAP], including— …</p>
  <p>(III) any efforts to obfuscate, manipulate public opinion, hide, or otherwise provide incorrect unclassified or
    classified information about unidentified anomalous phenomena [UAP] or related activities. <span class="source">NDAA FY23 Sec.
    6802(j)(1)(B); 50 U.S. Code § 3373(j)(1)(B)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contrary to Congressional direction, AARO completely omits entire agencies – NORAD, NSA, DIA (prior to 2009), CBP,
  etc. – agencies with known investigations or activities relating to UAP, and also omits any discussion of <q>any
    efforts to <b>obfuscate</b>, [or]… <b>hide</b> … <b>unclassified</b> or <b>classified</b> information about
    unidentified anomalous phenomena [UAP] or related activities.</q> AARO omits these agencies even when there are
  <b><i>unclassified</i></b> documents available on those agencies’ records and investigations of UAP (for example, see
  the approximate <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/document/foia-record/unidentified-aerial-phenomenon">100 pages of CBP
    Customs & Border Protection agency internal memos of Records on UAP</a>, plus 10 videos, released in
  <time>2023-08</time>, but unmentioned by AARO; Also see McMillan, Hanks, Plain, <a
