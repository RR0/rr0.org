<p>In the past, extreme and excessive secrecy has been displayed in efforts to <q>hide … unclassified or classified</q>
  UAP-related information, illustrated by the <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> predecessor’s <a
    href="https://documents2.theblackvault.com/documents/navy/DON-NAVY-2022-000883.pdf">UAP Security Classification
    Guide</a>, first distributed internally on <time>2020-04-16</time> (see graphic below) which is itself heavily
  redacted, removing most indications of the type of UAP report content requiring classification. This is a binding
  secrecy regulation – don’t be fooled by the word <q>guide</q>, it is absolutely mandatory. The secrecy regulation
  specifically states that only a general statement of an increase in UAP sightings can be released to the public, and
  <q>without [releasing] any further information regarding <b>when</b> [or] <b>where</b></q> a UAP <q><b>sighting</b>
    [has] been reported</q> as that is classified. Additionally, the <q><b>times</b> and <b>places</b></q> of UAP
  detections are classified and are required to be “unspecified” and can’t be released; it is <b><i>not</i></b> “U”
  (Unclassified) <span class="source">p. 6, subparagraphs. 4.1b-c</span>.</p>
<p>The internal Pentagon talking points on the UAP subject are a gag order that specifically forbids DoD officials from
  even revealing to the media and the public the fact that <q>virtually everything</q> about UAP is unreleasable, citing
  the above UAP Security Classification regulation (produced by <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s
  predecessor, the <a href="/org/us/dod/navy/uaptf">UAP Task Force</a>). Specifically, it states: <q>Except for its
    existence, and the mission/purpose, <b>virtually everything else</b> about the <a href="/org/us/dod/navy/uaptf">UAPTF
      [UAP Task Force]</a> is <b>classified</b>, per the signed Security Classification Guide.</q></p>
<p>Similar UAP security regulations no doubt are applied throughout the US Government. There is not one single item of
  government information about a UAP sighting that is not classified according to this secrecy regulation. Why is that?
  How can the US Government be transparent about UAP sighting incidents if nothing will be released? (See <span
    class="people">John
  Greenewald</span> of The Black Vault, in "<a href="https://twitter.com/blackvaultcom/status/1774439830086398050">What’s
    NOT
    in <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s recent “Historical Record” UAP Report</a>"? from his X/Twitter
  post on <time>2024-03-31</time>).</p>
<p>How can this be, when DoD itself confirmed, prior to the creation of this (excessive) classification guide, that the
  three famous Navy UAP videos I provided the New York Times and Washington Post were unclassified, and their release
  would not damage national security? In fact, by bringing a major intelligence failure occurring in US airspace to the
  attention of policymakers, the public release of those videos clearly advanced national security. The bureaucratic
  fiasco of this classification guide occurred despite a broad consensus in government, including among our military and
  intelligence officials and members of Congress, that <a
    href="https://www.govexec.com/management/2023/01/national-intelligence-director-over-classification-undermines-democracy/382346/">over-classification
    is a major problem</a> that needs to be addressed. As Avril Haines, the <a href="/org/us/ic/DNI.html">Director of
    National Intelligence (DNI)</a> said in a letter to Congress in <time>2022</time>, <q>Over-classification of
    government secrets both undermines national security by blocking the intelligence community’s ability to share
    critical information and erodes the basic trust that our citizens have in their government.</q></p>

<p>Air Force intelligence agency <q>efforts to … manipulate public opinion</q> on UAP since the 1950s are what caused
  the harsh stigma attached to the entire UFO subject in society. But this powerful anti-UAP stigma is not investigated
  or historically documented by <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> – or even mentioned – contrary to its
  legal obligation (more on this below). In addition to the AF-instigated <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/projet/Robertson">Robertson
    Panel</a> of <time>1953</time>, and all that followed after it, there are even admissions by a retired USAF OSI
  officer of allegedly spying on civilian UFO researchers and spreading disinformation on behalf of the Air Force.</p>
<p>The unclassified version of the <a href="../../../02/HistoricalRecordReport-vol1_AARO">historical AARO Report
  (AAROR)</a> was released on <time>2024-03-08</time>. But prior to that, <a
  href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> quietly released the report 2 days in advance to several friendly media
  outlets to cultivate favorable media coverage. These outlets, including the New York Times and Washington Post,
  faithfully carried the government’s message forward, apparently without consulting any of the scholars and researchers
  who could have helped them understand the report’s numerous errors, omissions, and shortcomings to provide a more
  balanced assessment. More objective reporting would have uncovered numerous major problems and serious errors in the
  <a href="../../../02/HistoricalRecordReport-vol1_AARO">AARO Report</a>.</p>
<p>What follows are only a select few of the many issues and questions raised by the <a
  href="../../../02/HistoricalRecordReport-vol1_AARO">AARO Historical Report</a>.</p>
