<p>In the past, extreme and excessive secrecy has been displayed in efforts to “hide … unclassified or classified”
  UAP-related information, illustrated by the AARO predecessor’s UAP Security Classification Guide, first distributed
  internally on April 16, 2020 (see graphic below) which is itself heavily redacted, removing most indications of the
  type of UAP report content requiring classification. This is a binding secrecy regulation – don’t be fooled by the
  word “guide,” it is absolutely mandatory. The secrecy regulation specifically states that only a general statement of
  an increase in UAP sightings can be released to the public, and “without [releasing] any further information regarding
  when [or] where” a UAP “sighting [has] been reported” as that is classified. Additionally, the “times and places” of
  UAP detections are classified and are required to be “unspecified” and can’t be released; it is not “U” (Unclassified)
  (p. 6, subparagraphs. 4.1b-c).</p>
<p>The internal Pentagon talking points on the UAP subject are a gag order that specifically forbids DoD officials from
  even revealing to the media and the public the fact that “virtually everything” about UAP is unreleasable, citing the
  above UAP Security Classification regulation (produced by AARO’s predecessor, the UAP Task Force). Specifically, it
  states: “Except for its existence, and the mission/purpose, virtually everything else about the UAPTF [UAP Task Force]
  is classified, per the signed Security Classification Guide.”</p>
<p>Similar UAP security regulations no doubt are applied throughout the US Government. There is not one single item of
  government information about a UAP sighting that is not classified according to this secrecy regulation. Why is that?
  How can the US Government be transparent about UAP sighting incidents if nothing will be released? (See John
  Greenewald of The Black Vault, in “What’s NOT in AARO’s recent “Historical Record” UAP Report?” from his X/Twitter
  post on March 31, 2024).</p>
<p>How can this be, when DoD itself confirmed, prior to the creation of this (excessive) classification guide, that the
  three famous Navy UAP videos I provided the New York Times and Washington Post were unclassified, and their release
  would not damage national security? In fact, by bringing a major intelligence failure occurring in US airspace to the
  attention of policymakers, the public release of those videos clearly advanced national security. The bureaucratic
  fiasco of this classification guide occurred despite a broad consensus in government, including among our military and
  intelligence officials and members of Congress, that over-classification is a major problem that needs to be
  addressed. As Avril Haines, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) said in a letter to Congress in 2022,
  “Over-classification of government secrets both undermines national security by blocking the intelligence community’s
  ability to share critical information and erodes the basic trust that our citizens have in their government.”</p>
<p>Air Force intelligence agency “efforts to … manipulate public opinion” on UAP since the 1950s are what caused the
  harsh stigma attached to the entire UFO subject in society. But this powerful anti-UAP stigma is not investigated or
  historically documented by AARO – or even mentioned – contrary to its legal obligation (more on this below). In
  addition to the AF-instigated Robertson Panel of 1953, and all that followed after it, there are even admissions by a
  retired USAF OSI officer of allegedly spying on civilian UFO researchers and spreading disinformation on behalf of the
  Air Force.</p>
<p>The unclassified version of the historical AARO Report (AAROR) was released on March 8, 2024. But prior to that, AARO
  quietly released the report 2 days in advance to several friendly media outlets to cultivate favorable media coverage.
  These outlets, including the New York Times and Washington Post, faithfully carried the government’s message forward,
  apparently without consulting any of the scholars and researchers who could have helped them understand the report’s
  numerous errors, omissions, and shortcomings to provide a more balanced assessment. More objective reporting would
  have uncovered numerous major problems and serious errors in the AARO Report.</p>
<p>What follows are only a select few of the many issues and questions raised by the AARO Historical Report.</p>
