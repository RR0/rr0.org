<p>The AARO report (AAROR) is pervaded by hundreds of unfortunate errors and absurdities involving the history, science,
  and facts presented in its 63 pages, with dozens–or more–errors on some pages (see graphic below of 14 errors alone
  just on the first page of the Table of Contents).</p>
<p>The report is replete with so many mistakes and misunderstandings that, page for page, it appears to be the greatest
  single repository of UAP errors, arguably surpassing even the Air Force’s Project Blue Book (BB). Call AARO the New
  Blue Book. Speaking of which, the report utterly fails to convey any of the fundamental flaws or national
  controversies that dogged Project Blue Book, including the admission by its own chief scientist that Blue Book was a
  deeply flawed Air Force public relations effort to dispel public and Congressional concerns, rather than an objective
  inquiry.</p>
<p>To begin with, AARO asserts the Kenneth Arnold sighting that launched the whole UAP era occurred on June 23, 1947
  (AAROR, p. 14).</p>
<p>Simple Googling would have gotten the correct June 24 date and the correct shape (it wasn’t actually “circular,” and
  neither was the Flying Flapjack which they call the “Flying Pancake” to erroneously emphasize its circularity even
  more). Arnold insisted the press’s label “flying saucers” for his sighting was a misnomer. Significantly, it is the
  important watershed event that launched the entire modern age of UAP. It’s not a typo in a minor detail that can just
  be brushed off.</p>
<p>There are unbelievable statements and insinuations in the AARO report such as the peculiar claim that the Manhattan
  Project that built the first atomic bomb somehow caused “sightings” and “erroneous UAP reporting” (AAROR pp. 4, 39-40)
  and did so even after it terminated on December 31, 1946 (a date they omit because it would not explain the sightings
  that began the modern UAP era in June 1947). That is a bit like saying trailer parks cause tornadoes. Since the
  Manhattan Project did not launch special aerial vehicles of any kind that could be “misidentified” as UAP, did the
  Project’s buildings fly up in the air and cause “sightings” and “erroneous UAP reporting”? This incredible claim is
  not explained by AARO.</p>
<p>Indeed, the truth is precisely the opposite of what AARO suggests. Not only is there no evidence of outside civilians
  mistaking the Manhattan Project and successor operations for UAP, but we know that personnel working inside the US
  nuclear weapons program were sighting UAP, reporting them, and thereafter collecting hundreds of their own authentic
  UAP reports. The senior AFOSI (Air Force Office of Special Investigations) officer responsible for Los Alamos
  Scientific Laboratory compiled a detailed catalog of 209 recent “Unknown Aerial Phenomena” sightings and instrument
  tracking incidents in the Los Alamos area and surrounding regions (see sample p. 38 below). He sent the catalog with a
  classified memo to his superior, the agency director in Washington DC, General Joseph P. Carroll, on May 25, 1950,
  stating that security officials agreed:</p>
<p>“… the frequency of unexplained aerial phenomenon in the New Mexico area was such that an organized plan of reporting
  these observations should be undertaken…”</p>
<p>Other documents explain this “organized plan” included instrumented UFO / UAP tracking stations and networks that
  were set up by scientists and security officials in the Los Alamos Lab, Sandia Lab, Kirtland AFB, and Holloman
  AFB–White Sands areas, and put on base-wide alert, consisting of missile-tracking telescopic cameras, radars, nuclear
  radiation detectors, radio communication networks, aircraft for interception, etc. Yet, no AARO discussion of
  this.</p>
<p>“The observers of these phenomena include scientists, Special Agents of the Office of Special Investigations (IG),
  USAF, airline pilots, military pilots, Los Alamos Security Inspectors, military personnel, and many other persons of
  various occupations whose reliability is not questioned.”</p>
<p>Many of the UAPs reported by scientists and military personnel were described as either “green fireball phenomena” or
  flying “disks” (or “variation”). AARO has completely misrepresented the situation: The Manhattan Project and
  subsequent nuclear weapons activities were not causing spurious UAP sightings by civilians awed by “new technologies”
  they did not understand – the government scientists and military personnel themselves were actually seeing UAP and
  recording hundreds of UAP in authentic and well-documented reports.</p>
<p>These sightings officially reported by US Government personnel were consistent with what the external “unknowing”
  civilians (as AARO calls them) were reporting at the time – sometimes the government personnel and civilians sighted
  the same UAP at the same time, confirming each other.</p>
<p>Seemingly AARO is confusing secrecy-bred lurid rumors of aliens with a careful sighting of a UAP, up in the air, at
  an exact date, time, and location, having unexplainable motions and appearance, and backed up with scientifically
  valuable directional data involving speed, size, altitude, sensor data, radar tracking, etc. Yet AARO suggests that
  many of these documented sightings are just rumors or mistaken reports based on unwitting civilian observations of
  “new technologies” in classified US military activities.</p>
<p>AARO claims the first US satellite, Explorer 1 in 1958, and even the Apollo moon landings (pp. 41-42) caused UAP
  sighting misidentifications and were “formerly classified and sensitive … national security programs” (AAROR, pp.
  39-40) – which they were not, and Apollo was just civilian NASA. AARO insinuates that the Apollo missions were
  “classified and sensitive”, and yet, apart from a limited number of contingency missions later revealed to have had
  classified components, the vast majority of NASA’s objectives with the missions were fully known to the public, with
  the moon landing broadcast to the entire planet on live television.</p>
<p>AARO states (pp. 10-11, 36):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>AARO assesses that some portion of [UAP] sightings since the 1940s have represented misidentification of
    never-before-seen experimental and operational space, rocket, and air systems… From the 1940s to the 1960s
    especially, the United States witnessed a boom in experimental technologies… Many of these technologies fit the
    description of a stereotypical Unidentified Flying Object (UFO). It is understandable how observers unfamiliar with
    these programs could mistake sightings of these new technologies as something extraordinary, even other-worldly.</p>
  <p>AARO assesses that the incidents of UAP sightings reported to USG organizations … most likely are the result of a
    range of cultural, political, and technological factors. AARO bases this conclusion on the aggregate findings of all
    USG investigations to date [and] the misinterpretation of all reported named sensitive programs…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What “new technology” let alone “many” was ever flown that “fit the description of a stereotypical … UFO” (e.g., a
  flying saucer)? Yet just before “naming” the Manhattan Project and Apollo as supposed “examples,” AARO reiterates the
  unsubstantiated point, claiming that many:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>… UAP sightings … were the result of misidentifications … of new technologies that [civilian] observers would have
    understandably reported as UFOs…. [O]bservers unknowingly … witnessed … and report[ed] as UFOs … classified and
    sensitive programs that involved … rocket launches … which AARO assess [sic] most likely were the cause of many UAP
    reports. AARO assesses that this common and understandable occurrence—the misidentification of new technologies for
    UAP— is present today [and] are reported as UAP <span class="source">AAROR, p. 39</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subsequently, AARO lists the Apollo program as one of 28 alleged examples (pp. 40, 42).</p>
<p>But no such UAP or “stereotypical UFO” sightings of a “misidentified” Apollo are known or cited by AARO and frankly,
  it is baffling to suggest anyone on Earth could see the Apollo moon landings with their eyes from 240,000 miles away
  or Apollo anywhere along the flight trajectory. AARO makes a point of stating that there were in the Apollo program
  “12 astronauts walking on the moon” without explaining how that is relevant or giving a single UAP sighting they seem
  to insinuate was caused by that. Are there any actual, serious UAP sightings misidentifying Apollo launches to the
  moon as UAP?</p>
<p>Scientific errors by AARO thus abound in its secret-project-inflated report, including those pointed out above
  regarding the miraculous feats of human vision sighting Apollo moon landings and Explorer 1 from outer space – besides
  insinuating apparent errors of logic and physics and injecting a non-issue of misleading irrelevancies (non-secret
  “secret” projects that did not and could not actually cause UAP sightings).</p>
