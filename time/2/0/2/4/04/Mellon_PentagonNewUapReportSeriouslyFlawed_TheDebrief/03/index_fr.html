<p>Le <a href="../../../02/HistoricalRecordReport-vol1_AARO/index.html">rapport de l'AARO (AAROR)</a> est constellé de
  <b><i>centaines</i></b> d'absurdités et erreurs malheureuses liées à l'histoire, la science et les faits présentés
  dans ses 63 pages, avec des douzaines -ou plus- sur certaines pages (voir le graphique ci-dessous de 14 erreurs
  uniquement sur la première page de la Table des Matières).</p>
<p>Le rapport est rempli de tellement d'erreurs et mauvaises compréhensions que, page pour page, il semble être le plus
  grand répertoire d'erreurs sur les PANs, surpassant probablement même le <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Projet Blue Book</a> (BB) de l'Air Force. Appelez l'<a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> le Nouveau Blue Book. Speaking of which, the report utterly fails to
  convey any of the fundamental flaws or national controversies that dogged <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project Blue Book</a>, including the admission by its own chief
  scientist that <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> was a deeply flawed Air Force public
  relations effort to dispel public and Congressional concerns, rather than an objective inquiry.</p>
<p>To begin with, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> asserts the <a
  href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MontRainier">Kenneth Arnold sighting</a> that launched the whole UAP era
  occurred on <time>1947-06-23</time> <span class="source">AAROR, p. 14</span>.</p>
<p>Simple Googling would have gotten the correct June 24 date and the correct shape (it wasn’t actually <q>circular</q>,
  and neither was the Flying Flapjack which they call the “Flying Pancake” to erroneously emphasize its circularity even
  more). Arnold insisted the press’s label “flying saucers” for his sighting was a misnomer. Significantly, it is the
  important watershed event that launched the entire modern age of UAP. It’s not a typo in a minor detail that can just
  be brushed off.</p>

<p>There are unbelievable statements and insinuations in the <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> report such
  as the peculiar claim that the Manhattan Project that built the first atomic bomb somehow caused <q>sightings</q> and
  <q>erroneous UAP reporting</q> <span class="source">AAROR pp. 4, 39-40</span> and did so even after it terminated on
  <time>1946-12-31</time> (a date they omit because it would not explain the sightings that began the modern UAP era in
  June 1947). That is a bit like saying trailer parks cause tornadoes. Since the Manhattan Project did not launch
  special aerial vehicles of any kind that could be “misidentified” as UAP, did the Project’s buildings fly up in the
  air and cause “sightings” and “erroneous UAP reporting”? This incredible claim is not explained by <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, the truth is precisely the opposite of what AARO suggests. Not only is there no evidence of outside civilians
  mistaking the Manhattan Project and successor operations for UAP, but we know that personnel working inside the US
  nuclear weapons program were sighting UAP, reporting them, and thereafter collecting hundreds of their own authentic
  UAP reports. The senior AFOSI (Air Force Office of Special Investigations) officer responsible for Los Alamos
  Scientific Laboratory compiled a detailed catalog of 209 recent “Unknown Aerial Phenomena” sightings and instrument
  tracking incidents in the Los Alamos area and surrounding regions (see sample p. 38 below). He sent the catalog with a
  classified memo to his superior, the agency director in Washington DC, General Joseph P. Carroll, on May 25, 1950,
  stating that security officials agreed:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>… the frequency of unexplained aerial phenomenon in the New Mexico area was such that an organized plan of
    reporting these observations should be undertaken…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other documents explain this “organized plan” included instrumented UFO / UAP tracking stations and networks that
  were set up by scientists and security officials in the Los Alamos Lab, Sandia Lab, Kirtland AFB, and Holloman
  AFB–White Sands areas, and put on base-wide alert, consisting of missile-tracking telescopic cameras, radars, nuclear
  radiation detectors, radio communication networks, aircraft for interception, etc. Yet, no AARO discussion of
  this.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The observers of these phenomena include scientists, Special Agents of the Office of Special Investigations (IG),
    USAF, airline pilots, military pilots, Los Alamos Security Inspectors, military personnel, and many other persons of
    various occupations whose reliability is not questioned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of the UAPs reported by scientists and military personnel were described as either “green fireball phenomena” or
  flying “disks” (or “variation”). <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> has completely misrepresented the
  situation: The Manhattan Project and subsequent nuclear weapons activities were not causing spurious UAP sightings by
  civilians awed by “new technologies” they did not understand – the government scientists and military personnel
  themselves were actually seeing UAP and recording hundreds of UAP in authentic and well-documented reports.</p>
<p>These sightings officially reported by US Government personnel were consistent with what the external “unknowing”
  civilians (as <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> calls them) were reporting at the time – sometimes the
  government personnel and civilians sighted the same UAP at the same time, confirming each other.</p>

<p>Seemingly <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> is confusing secrecy-bred lurid rumors of aliens with a
  careful sighting of a UAP, up in the air, at an exact date, time, and location, having unexplainable motions and
  appearance, and backed up with scientifically valuable directional data involving speed, size, altitude, sensor data,
  radar tracking, etc. Yet AARO suggests that many of these documented sightings are just rumors or mistaken reports
  based on unwitting civilian observations of “new technologies” in classified US military activities.</p>
<p>AARO claims the first US satellite, Explorer 1 in <time>1958</time>, and even the Apollo moon landings (pp. 41-42)
  caused UAP sighting misidentifications and were <q>formerly <b><i>classified</i></b> and <b><i>sensitive</i></b> …
    national security programs</q> <span class="source">AAROR, pp.
  39-40</span> – which they were <b><i>not</i></b>, and <a href="/org/us/nasa/projet/apollo">Apollo</a> was just
  civilian <a href="/org/us/nasa">NASA</a>. AARO insinuates that the <a href="/org/us/nasa/projet/apollo">Apollo</a>
  missions were <q>classified and sensitive</q>, and yet, apart from a limited number of contingency missions later
  revealed to have had classified components, the vast majority of <a href="/org/us/nasa">NASA</a>’s objectives with the
  missions were fully known to the public, with the moon landing broadcast to the entire planet on live television.</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> states <span class="source">pp. 10-11, 36</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>AARO assesses that some portion of <b>[UAP] sightings since the 1940s</b> have represented <b>misidentification</b>
    of <b>never-before-seen</b> experimental and operational <b>space, rocket, and air</b> systems… From the 1940s to
    the 1960s especially, the United States witnessed a boom in experimental technologies… <b>Many</b> of these
    technologies <b>fit the description of a stereotypical Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)</b>. It is <b>understandable
      how observers unfamiliar with these programs</b> could <b>mistake sightings</b> of these new technologies as <b>something
      extraordinary, even other-worldly</b>.</p>
  <p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> assesses that the incidents of UAP sightings reported to USG
    organizations … most likely are the result of a range of cultural, political, and technological factors. AARO bases
    this conclusion on the aggregate findings of all USG investigations to date [and] the <b>misinterpretation</b> of
    all reported <b>named sensitive programs</b>…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What <q>new technology</q> let alone <q>many</q> was ever flown that <q>fit the description of a stereotypical …
  UFO</q> (e.g., a flying saucer)? Yet just before “naming” the Manhattan Project and Apollo as supposed <q>examples</q>,
  <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> reiterates the unsubstantiated point, claiming that many:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>… <b>UAP sightings</b> … were the result of <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise"><b>misidentifications</b></a>
    … of new technologies that [civilian] <b>observers would have understandably reported as UFOs</b>…. [O]bservers <b>unknowingly</b>
    … witnessed … and report[ed] as <b>UFOs … classified and sensitive programs</b> that involved … <b>rocket
      launches</b> … which AARO assess [sic] most likely were the <b>cause of many UAP reports</b>. AARO assesses that
    this common and understandable occurrence—the <a
      href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise"><b>misidentifications</b></a> of new technologies for UAP— is present
    today [and] are <b>reported as UAP</b> <span class="source">AAROR, p. 39</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subsequently, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> lists the <a
  href="/org/us/nasa/projet/apollo">Apollo</a> program as one of 28 alleged examples (pp. 40, 42).</p>
<p>But no such UAP or “stereotypical UFO” sightings of a “misidentified” Apollo are known or cited by AARO and frankly,
  it is baffling to suggest anyone on Earth could see the Apollo moon landings with their eyes from 240,000 miles away
  or Apollo anywhere along the flight trajectory. AARO makes a point of stating that there were in the Apollo program
  “<b>12 astronauts walking on the moon</b>” without explaining how that is relevant or giving a single UAP sighting
  they seem to insinuate was caused by that. Are there any actual, serious UAP sightings misidentifying Apollo launches
  to the moon as UAP?</p>
<p>Scientific errors by <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> thus abound in its secret-project-inflated
  report, including those pointed out above regarding the miraculous feats of human vision sighting Apollo moon landings
  and Explorer 1 from outer space – besides insinuating apparent errors of logic and physics and injecting a non-issue
  of misleading irrelevancies (non-secret “secret” projects that did not and could not actually cause UAP sightings).
