<p>AARO may have “partnered” with the National Archives in retrieving old Air Force Project Blue Book files but AARO
  seems to think there are only 65,778 pages of Blue Book files (within some 7,000 larger digital files), instead of the
  actual total of some 130,000 pages.</p>
<p>Is AARO aware there are 130,000 pages of Air Force UAP files on microfilm at the National Archives (and some
  additional files that were never microfilmed)?</p>
<p>All that anyone has to do is check the Fold3 Ancestry.com website, available on the Internet since 2007, to find its
  total Blue Book page count of 129,658 pages (round off to 130,000) that Fold3’s predecessor digitized from Blue Book
  microfilm at NARA (see Fold3 internet screenshot below). (Page count includes about 6,000 AFOSI pages, some
  duplicative of the files and released with Blue Book.) And again it is documented that many records and files are
  missing from Blue Book, many with exact file numbers that determined investigators such as Jan Aldrich have documented
  over the years.</p>
Fold3
<p>Did AARO somehow miss half of Blue Book’s files–some 64,000 pages–in its supposedly “thorough”, “complete”, and
  “accurate” history <span class="source">AAROR, p. 12</span>? Did someone lose 64,000 pages of Blue Book UFO files? Did
  AARO investigate where these apparently missing Blue Book files disappeared or how the accounting error arose if it is
  just that?</p>
<p>Even aside from missing half of Blue Book’s files, which therefore could not be reviewed for history, AARO’s review
  of Air Force Blue Book history is so cursory that AARO seems to merely rehash old Blue Book press releases <span
    class="source">AAROR,
  pp. 18-19</span>.</p>
<p>AARO claims it established 6 Lines of Effort (“LOEs” they call them) to prepare a “complete” and “accurate” history
  of the UAP “record” of government investigations (just not of UAP sightings as Congress also wanted): (1) open source,
  (2) classified, (3) personal interviewing, (4) National Archives, (5) private companies, and (6) intelligence/nat sec
  agencies <span class="source">AAROR, pp. 22-13</span>.</p>
<p>But obviously, AARO’s Six Lines of Effort were unmindful of 64,000 missing pages of Blue Book UFO files that only
  they at AARO were missing – while the rest of the world has, and has had, access to the pages through the Fold3
  website since 2007 or by going to the microfilms at the National Archives or buying copies (all available since 1976).
  Additionally, as will be explained further below, AARO seems completely unaware of the existence of numerous important
  US government UAP investigation programs, activities, sightings, and radar/sensor-tracking incidents.</p>
