<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> may have “partnered” with the National Archives in retrieving old Air
  Force <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Project Blue Book</a> files but <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> seems to think there are only 65,778 pages of Blue Book files (within
  some 7,000 larger digital files), instead of the actual total of some 130,000 pages.</p>
<p>Is <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> aware there are 130,000 pages of Air Force UAP files on microfilm
  at the National Archives (and some additional files that were never microfilmed)?</p>
<p>All that anyone has to do is check the Fold3 Ancestry.com website, available on the Internet since <time>2007</time>,
  to find its total Blue Book page count of 129,658 pages (round off to 130,000) that Fold3’s predecessor digitized from
  <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> microfilm at <a href="/org/us/NARA.html">NARA</a> (see
  Fold3 internet screenshot below). (Page count includes about 6,000 <a href="/org/us/dod/af/AFOSI.html">AFOSI</a>
  pages, some duplicative of the files and released with <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>.)
  And again it is documented that many records and files are missing from <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>, many with exact file numbers that determined
  investigators such as <span class="people">Jan Aldrich</span> have documented over the years.</p>
<figure class="right side"><img src="Fold3.webp"></figure>
<p>Did <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> somehow miss half of Blue Book’s files–some 64,000 pages–in its
  supposedly “thorough”, “complete”, and “accurate” history <span class="source">AAROR, p. 12</span>? Did someone lose
  64,000 pages of <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> UFO files? Did AARO investigate where
  these apparently missing <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> files disappeared or how the
  accounting error arose if it is just that?</p>
<p>Even aside from missing half of Blue Book’s files, which <b><i>therefore could not be reviewed for history</i></b>,
  AARO’s review of Air Force <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> history is so cursory that <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> seems to merely rehash old Blue Book press releases <span
    class="source">AAROR, pp. 18-19</span>.</p>
<p>AARO claims it established 6 Lines of Effort (“LOEs” they call them) to prepare a <q><b>complete</b></q> and <q><b>accurate</b></q>
  history of the UAP “record” of government <b><i>investigations</i></b> (just not of UAP <b><i>sightings</i></b> as
  Congress also wanted): (1) open source, (2) classified, (3) personal interviewing, (4) National Archives, (5) private
  companies, and (6) intelligence/nat sec agencies <span class="source">AAROR, pp. 22-13</span>.</p>
<p>But obviously, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s Six Lines of Effort were unmindful of 64,000 missing
  pages of Blue Book UFO files that only they at <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> were missing – while
  the rest of the world has, and has had, access to the pages through the Fold3 website since <time>2007</time> or by
  going to the microfilms at the National Archives or buying copies (all available since <time>1976</time>).
  Additionally, as will be explained further below, AARO seems completely unaware of the existence of numerous important
  US government UAP investigation programs, activities, sightings, and radar/sensor-tracking incidents.</p>
