<p>Il n'y a <b><em>pas une seule</em></b> observation connue de l'avion de reconnaissance <a
  href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> rapportée comme <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">PAN</a>. Rien dans
  les archives de <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>, et personne ne peut même citer une
  <b>date</b> pour un tel prétendu <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> observé et rapporté comme <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">PAN</a>, sans parler de la notion invraisemblable que les <a
    href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a>s soient à l'origine de <q>plus de la <b><em>moitié</em></b></q> de tous
  les signalements de PANs : Under the <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> Aquatone “secret project” entry,
  <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> claims <q>More than half of the UFO reports investigated in the 1950s
    and 1960s were assessed to be U.S. reconnaissance flights</q> and <q>that UFO <b>reports</b> would spike when the <a
    href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> was in flight</q> <span class="source">AAROR, p. 41</span>.</p>
<p>Are we to believe over 5,000 of the 10,000 UFO reports then in Air Force <a
  href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> files were <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a>s?
  That should be easy to find in the <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> files if that was
  the case. (Were there ever that many <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a>s anyway, flying say, daily,
  instead of just one every few months? <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> historical flight schedules have
  been released, nothing supports <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s claims.)</p>
<p>If so, they should be able to come up with at least <b><em>one</em></b> <a
  href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> “UFO” misidentification out of the purported 5,000+ <a
  href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> “UFO” reports, one sighting by date. The earliest unfounded AF-planted
  rumor of a <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> “UFO” can be documented in 1964 (see below) but in all this
  time since they can’t at least find <b><em>one</em></b> <a
    href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> “UFO”? (An undated hearsay claim that <a
    href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a>s could sometimes be seen at sunset is not a “misidentification” – no one
  said it was an alien spaceship or UFO or the like – and it is <b><em>not a UAP report</em></b> that was made by
  anybody to any official agency, not even to Project <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> which has nothing on file about that.)</p>
<p>In fact, it is on record that Air Force Project <b><a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>
  Chief</b> Capt. (later Lt Col) <span class="people" title="Hector V. Quintanilla">Hector Quintanilla</span> first
  planted the whole <strong>false</strong> notion of a <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> <b><i>“UFO”
    sighting</i></b> on <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>’s chief scientific consultant Dr. J. Allen Hynek and
  his then-grad student assistant <span class="people">Jacques Vallee</span> on <time>1964-01-16</time>, when he visited
  Chicago and briefed them (see <span class="people">Vallee</span>’s published diaries for <time>1957/1969</time>, p.
  101). <span class="people">Quintanilla</span> claimed a <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> was sighted and
  <q>It was reported as a UFO</q> in <b><time>1951</time></b>, purportedly observed as the <a
    href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> was <q>on its way to the Soviet Union</q> – when in fact the <a
    href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> had not even been <b><i>invented</i></b> yet in <time>1951</time> let
  alone flown yet (invented and designed in <time>1953</time>, first flown in <time>1955</time>, none flown to the
  Soviet Union until <time>1956</time>, as anyone can look up).</p>
<p>In tracing the origins of this phony story, it was later in <time>1964</time> when the Air Force <a
  href="/org/us/dod/af/sc/FTD.html">Foreign Technology Division (FTD)</a>, which ran Project <a
  href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>, planted this bogus <a
  href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> spy plane “UFO” nonsense on the <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> (where
  one <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> reconnaissance official, James Cunningham, admitted <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/sc/FTD.html">FTD</a>/<a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> was in frequent contact with them). Air Force FTD
  apparently tried to suggest to the CIA that the secret <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> flights
  accounted for many UAP sightings and, because of the need for secrecy, the public could not be told the <a
    href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> explanation. CIA may have run with it because it boosted the importance
  and prestige of their <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> in the aftermath of the humiliating CIA Bay of
  Pigs disaster – and by about this time, the mind-boggling story was embellished that <q>more than half</q> of all UAP
  reports were due to the <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a>, not even weather <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/ballon">balloons</a>, <a
    href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/venus">Venus</a>, or <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/feufollet">swamp
    gas</a>, <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>’s usual attempted explanations?</p>
<p>(Knowing how <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> and its chief operated back then, from
  civilian researchers combing through 130,000 pages of <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>
  files and studying badly botched cases, it is very possible that on one date <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> happened to receive, say, five supposed “UFO” reports
  of which, say, three they thought <b><i>might be</i></b> of a giant Skyhook balloon, possibly from a classified
  high-altitude reconnaissance <b><i>project</i></b> of some sort. Then someone heard this but got their wires crossed
  and told someone else down the line of the classic hearsay chain that they thought it was three sightings of a
  reconnaissance spy “project,” maybe “like” a <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> spy plane, thus confusing
  balloons with aircraft, and from there the myth was born. Over “half” – or three out of the five “UFO” reports <b><i>that
    day</i></b> – would have been a balloon; maybe a spy balloon, maybe not, involving perhaps nothing more than a
  sighting of an ordinary large weather or research balloon. But the “half” statistic for one day would be misheard and
  massively embellished as half of all 10,000 UAP reports for the decade and beyond. This is sheer speculation but based
  on the very real, typically careless way <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> operated. We may never know the full story.)</p>
