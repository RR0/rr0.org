<p>Air Force Project Blue Book’s dirty little secret was that Insufficient Data often really just meant Insufficient
  Investigation which, if admitted, of course would reflect badly on Blue Book’s performance. Thus the usual tendency in
  Blue Book’s self-serving strategy was to blame the witness for any failings in investigating their own sighting – as
  if the witness is expected to be a top-notch PhD scientist. When the typically non-PhD witness failed to provide
  unequivocal PhD-level data, Blue Book would often triumphantly dismiss the case and claim it as one of their purported
  “successes.”</p>
<p>Civilian witnesses rarely even claim what they saw was a “UFO” or use the term “UFO,” much less an “alien spacecraft”
  (most will not even have heard the new term UAP). Most witnesses simply felt a civic duty to notify authorities about
  a “light” or “object” that was puzzling to them (as Blue Book consultant Hynek would say). That is the objective
  scientific approach which witnesses weren’t given credit for – reporting what they saw, not presuming to make
  PhD-level scientific interpretations or judgments of what it was. Military witnesses especially would grasp that the
  matter might have possible national security or scientific implications. It was inappropriate for the Air Force to
  insult the intelligence and goodwill of these citizens by dismissing their reports with improbable explanations that
  often made the witness look foolish. This high-handed and dismissive approach naturally had the effect of reinforcing
  the stigma and deterring others from coming forward.</p>
<p>The Air Force’s longtime scientific consultant on UAP, Astronomer Dr. J. Allen Hynek, taught that the “UFO” label not
  be given to a report until after a scientific investigation determines that it has no conventional IFO (Identified
  Flying Object) or other explanation. But because there is no recognized term for the initial report, the “UFO” label
  (and now “UAP”) is applied right at the outset for simplicity, and a seemingly redundant qualifier has to be added for
  cases that pass the Hynek Scientific UFO Screening process to be a “real” UFO, such as the redundant “Unidentified
  UFO” (Unidentified Unidentified-Flying-Object) or “UFO Unknown.” The process is not followed logically or consistently
  and the Hynek Screening is treated almost as an afterthought if at all. These issues are not discussed in the AARO
  report. Most civilian research groups’ UAP reports appear to be “Insufficient Data” mainly because they do not have
  the resources to investigate them all and so no Hynek Screening is applied.</p>
<p>AARO’s historical account barely mentions the leading role Dr. Hynek played in researching UAP for the Air Force and
  attempting to implement a meaningful investigative methodology. In the lone paragraph in the section on “Perceived
  Deception,” Dr. Hynek is referred to merely as an investigator, not as the Air Force’s chief scientific consultant on
  UAP. Also, the first sentence of the paragraph only refers to public suspicions of “recovered alien craft” and
  “extraterrestrial beings,” not the government’s overall handling of the UAP issue. It then merely mentions that the
  Air Force expected him to serve as a “debunker” in a sentence that also briefly mentions that Captain Ruppelt said he
  was expected to “explain away every report” and align press stories with the Air Force’s public position. Yet in its
  discussion of Project Blue Book, AARO simply states that the Air Force “determined” that there was “there was no
  threat to national security, no evidence of extraterrestrial vehicles and “..no evidence submitted to, or discovered
  by, the USAF that sightings represented technological developments or principles beyond the range of present day
  scientific knowledge.” These conclusions are boldly stated as though there was nothing irregular or controversial
  about these conclusions. The same is true of AAROs account of the highly controversial Condon report (further details
  below).</p>
<p>Among other things, Hynek blew the whistle on the Air Force and its Project Blue Book for the “insufficient data”
  trick, forthrightly insisting that insufficient data cases, including the sneaky “possible/probable” IFO categories,
  are neither IFO nor proper UFO cases and must be excluded from statistical scorecards as they are insufficient in data
  (The Hynek UFO Report, 1977, p. 259). The same principle applies to modern UAP cases (“UAP” merely being the new label
  for UFO). Among other things, AARO should be required to clarify the distinction between Insufficient Data reports and
  “Insufficient Investigation” (more on Insufficient Data in sections below).</p>
<p>AARO also doesn’t seem to know about Hynek’s classic subdivision of UFO cases into Close Encounters (of three kinds
  or more), Daylight Discs, Nocturnal Lights, and Radar-Visual cases. AARO’s “complete” history of UAP investigations by
  the US government seems incomplete without it. There was even a Spielberg movie involving Hynek’s work, called Close
  Encounters of the Third Kind.</p>
<p>AARO also makes no mention of probably the greatest scientific investigator of UAP of all time, atmospheric physicist
  Dr James E. McDonald of the University of Arizona. McDonald’s name, along with Hynek’s, is all over the Blue Book
  records that AARO brags about “completely” reviewing (though AARO seems to have overlooked half of Blue Book’s
  records).</p>
<p>The prestigious author and scientist Dr. Jacques Vallee was a colleague of Dr. Hynek’s who lived through this period
  and could have helped AARO enormously, but he was not contacted. Nor was he contacted for comment by the New York
  Times, Washington Post, or other outlets after AARO’s historical report was released. AARO also does not seem to
  follow Dr. Hynek’s and Dr. Vallee’s UAP scientific methodology established in the 1960s.</p>
