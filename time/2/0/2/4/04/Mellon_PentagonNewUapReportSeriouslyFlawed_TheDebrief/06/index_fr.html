<p>Air Force Project <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>’s dirty little secret was that
  Insufficient Data often really just meant <b><em>Insufficient Investigation</em></b> which, if admitted, of course
  would reflect badly on Blue Book’s performance. Thus the usual tendency in Blue Book’s self-serving strategy was to
  <b><em>blame the witness</em></b> for any failings in investigating their own sighting – as if the witness is expected
  to be a top-notch PhD scientist. When the typically non-PhD witness failed to provide unequivocal PhD-level data, <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> would often triumphantly dismiss the case and claim it
  as one of their purported “successes.”</p>
<p>Civilian witnesses rarely even claim what they saw was a “UFO” or use the term “UFO,” much less an “alien spacecraft”
  (most will not even have heard the new term UAP). Most witnesses simply felt a civic duty to notify authorities about
  a “light” or “object” that was puzzling to them (as <a href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> consultant <span
    class="people" title="Josef Allen Hynek">Hynek</span> would say). That is the objective scientific approach which
  witnesses weren’t given credit for – reporting what they saw, not presuming to make PhD-level scientific
  interpretations or judgments of what it was. Military witnesses especially would grasp that the matter might have
  possible national security or scientific implications. It was inappropriate for the Air Force to insult the
  intelligence and goodwill of these citizens by dismissing their reports with improbable explanations that often made
  the witness look foolish. This high-handed and dismissive approach naturally had the effect of reinforcing the stigma
  and deterring others from coming forward.</p>
<p>The Air Force’s longtime scientific consultant on UAP, Astronomer Dr. <span class="people">J. Allen Hynek</span>,
  taught that the “UFO” label not be given to a report until <b><em>after a scientific investigation</em></b> determines
  that it has no conventional IFO (Identified Flying Object) or other explanation. But because there is no recognized
  term for the initial report, the “UFO” label (and now “UAP”) is applied right at the outset for simplicity, and a
  seemingly redundant qualifier has to be added for cases that pass the <span class="people">Hynek</span> Scientific UFO
  Screening process to be a “real” UFO, such as the redundant “Unidentified UFO” (Unidentified
  Unidentified-Flying-Object) or “UFO Unknown.” The process is not followed logically or consistently and the <span
    class="people">Hynek</span> Screening is treated almost as an afterthought if at all. These issues are not discussed
  in the <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> report. Most civilian research groups’ UAP reports appear to be
  “Insufficient Data” mainly because they do not have the resources to investigate them all and so no <span
    class="people">Hynek</span> Screening is applied.</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s historical account barely mentions the leading role Dr. <span
  class="people">Hynek</span> played in researching UAP for the Air Force and attempting to implement a meaningful
  investigative methodology. In the lone paragraph in the section on “Perceived Deception,” Dr. <span class="people">Hynek</span>
  is referred to merely as an investigator, not as the Air Force’s chief scientific consultant on UAP. Also, the first
  sentence of the paragraph only refers to public suspicions of “recovered alien craft” and “extraterrestrial beings,”
  not the government’s overall handling of the UAP issue. It then merely mentions that the Air Force expected him to
  serve as a “debunker” in a sentence that also briefly mentions that Captain <span class="people"
    title="Edward J. Ruppelt">Ruppelt</span> said he was expected to <q>explain away every report</q> and align press
  stories with the Air Force’s public position. Yet in its discussion of Project <a
    href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a>, <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> simply states that the Air Force “determined” that there was “<q>there
    was no threat to national security, no evidence of extraterrestrial vehicles</q> and <q>..no evidence submitted to,
    or discovered by, the USAF that sightings represented technological developments or principles beyond the range of
    present day scientific knowledge.</q> These conclusions are boldly stated as though there was nothing irregular or
  controversial about these conclusions. The same is true of AAROs account of the highly controversial Condon report
  (further details below).</p>
<p>Among other things, <span class="people">Hynek</span> blew the whistle on the Air Force and its Project <a
  href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> for the “insufficient data” trick, forthrightly insisting that
  insufficient data cases, including the sneaky “possible/probable” IFO categories, are neither IFO nor proper UFO cases
  and must be excluded from statistical scorecards as they are <b><em>insufficient in data</em></b> <span
    class="source">The Hynek UFO Report, 1977, p. 259</span>. The same principle applies to modern UAP cases (“UAP”
  merely being the new label for UFO). Among other things, <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> should be required to clarify the distinction between Insufficient Data
  reports and “Insufficient Investigation” (more on Insufficient Data in sections below).</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> also doesn’t seem to know about <span class="people">Hynek</span>’s
  <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/classification/hynek">classic subdivision of UFO</a> cases into <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/classification/hynek/rr">Close Encounters</a> (of three kinds or more), <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/classification/hynek/dd">Daylight Discs</a>, <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/classification/hynek/ln">Nocturnal Lights</a>, and <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/classification/hynek/rv">Radar-Visual</a> cases. <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s “complete” history of UAP investigations by the US government seems
  incomplete without it. There was even a Spielberg movie involving Hynek’s work, called Close Encounters of the Third
  Kind.</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> also makes no mention of probably the greatest scientific
  investigator of UAP of all time, atmospheric physicist Dr James E. McDonald of the University of Arizona. McDonald’s
  name, along with Hynek’s, is all over the <a
    href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a> records that <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> brags about
  “completely” reviewing (though <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> seems to have overlooked half of <a
    href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/u2">U-2</a>’s records).</p>
<p>The prestigious author and scientist Dr. <span class="people">Jacques Vallee</span> was a colleague of Dr. Hynek’s
  who lived through this period and could have helped <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> enormously, but he
  was not contacted. Nor was he contacted for comment by the New York Times, Washington Post, or other outlets after <a
    href="../../../02/HistoricalRecordReport-vol1_AARO">AARO’s historical report</a> was released. <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> also does not seem to follow Dr. Hynek’s and Dr. <span class="people">Vallee</span>’s
  UAP scientific methodology established in the 1960s.</p>
