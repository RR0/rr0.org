<title>Alleged "40-year gap” in official investigations of UAP is due to AARO’S failure to properly document their
  history from 1969-2009 – not even a mention of the pivotal 2004 Nimitz case</title>

<p>The allegedly “complete”, “thorough”, and “accurate” AARO historical report (p. 12) wrongly claims there is “about a
  40-year gap in UAP investigation programs since the termination of Project BLUE BOOK in 1969 [sic]”– in other words a
  40-year alleged “gap” from 1969 to 2009 (p. 10). (Actually, Blue Book terminated in January 1970, not 1969, another
  historical error by AARO.)</p>
<p>In reality, the only “40-year gap” is in AARO’s failure to record the history, not a 40-year gap in the existence of
  US Government investigations and reports of UAP from 1969 to 2009. Somehow AARO managed to slip around the 2004 USS
  Nimitz incidents, and others that are widespread public knowledge and were investigated by the military (hence AARO
  can’t use the “it’s classified” excuse to withhold).</p>
<p>AARO certainly knows about the 2004 Nimitz UAP incidents, which were the primary events that led to the current sea
  change in attitude to UFOs and UAP, leading to the establishment of AARO itself. AARO just inexplicably and
  unbelievably chooses not to mention the Nimitz anywhere in its Historical Report.</p>
<p>There are numerous USG investigations of UAP easily documented in declassified records, and many published during
  that purported “40-year gap.” These are only a few representative examples – one can hardly match the AARO manpower of
  40+ personnel and multi-million-dollar budget to do the research AARO should have done in the first place.</p>
<p>During the Fall 1973 UAP wave, there were several US military investigations of UAP. These included those conducted
  by the Navy and Coast Guard involving an underwater UFO or USO (Unidentified Submarine or Submerged Object) near the
  location of the highly publicized alleged UFO abduction case a month earlier at Pascagoula, Mississippi. Coast Guard
  personnel sighted the underwater UAP and Navy oceanographer Dr. and Lt Cdr (later RADM) Craig Dorman investigated.
  (UPI dispatch, Nov. 8, 1973, etc.) This is close to an important recent UAP sighting that occurred over the Gulf of
  Mexico, which came to Congress’ attention only as a result of a “protected disclosure.” Even then, all but one member
  of Congress visiting the base for the express purpose of a briefing on this case was denied access to the aircraft’s
  sensor data.</p>
<p>In October-November 1975 there was a wave of Northern Tier UAP incidents at restricted areas of military bases at
  Loring AFB, Maine, Malmstrom AFB and Wurtsmith AFB, Michigan, Minot AFB, North Dakota, etc., which were investigated
  by the Air Force and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), as documented in declassified and
  FOIA-released electronic teletype messages (so the “it’s classified” excuse again can’t be used). Entire open-source
  books have been written about this (e.g., the Fawcett & Greenwood classic, Clear Intent, 1984).</p>
<p>A key intelligence focal point of investigations on the Northern Tier incident messages was the teletype address
  “AFINZ,” which turned out to be the Aerospace Intelligence Division of the Air Force Intelligence Service at the
  Pentagon (not Dayton, Ohio, by the way).</p>
<p>Likewise, NORAD Intelligence and NORAD J3 Aerospace Operations Division and predecessors have been involved with
  directing UAP investigations throughout the years in the alleged “40-year gap” and from before, back to the
  1950s-1960s Blue Book years, and right up to the present (see “NORAD” in Clark, UFO Encyclopedia, 2018, pp.
  801-824).</p>
<p>Also, a former Director of USAF Intelligence informed me that in the 1980’s the Air Force undertook a classified UAP
  collection program in the vicinity of Area 51 in an attempt to ascertain the origin of UAP violating the famous base’s
  restricted airspace. How come that program was not uncovered by AARO? How many other secret USAF programs related to
  UAP were not uncovered? Where are those UAP reports and how many others are there from other locations?</p>
<p>There is also no mention by AARO of the successor to Air Force Project Blue Book’s parent organization FTD (Foreign
  Technology Division), now called NASIC, National Air & Space Intelligence Center. Since NASIC is the Defense Dept.’s
  primary and central agency for intelligence on air and space threats, NASIC obviously must be involved with UAP today
  and its UFO / UAP history should be traceable back to FTD / Blue Book in the 1960s.</p>
<p>But AARO does not breathe a word about either the Foreign Technology Division FTD or NASIC in its “complete” and
  “thorough” history of UAP investigations (even though AAROR mentions the subject of “foreign technology” and “foreign
  technological threats”, pp. 15, 27).</p>
<p>In 1976 US-equipped Iranian jets chased UAP over Iran, with one UAP reportedly disabling the onboard radar, avionics,
  and the air-to-air intercept missile of an F-4. This is a famous case, with declassified official US DIA documentation
  released (so again the “it’s classified” excuse can’t be used), so it seems incomprehensible that AARO would not know
  about it.</p>
<p>In fact, AARO seems to be unaware of what it wrote in its own report because the “40-year gap” in government UAP
  investigations from 1969 to 2009 it claimed on Page 10 seems to be contradicted on Page 30, by AARO’s own admission
  that a nuclear weapons depot UAP case occurred in 1977 (apparently at Loring AFB, Maine) and obviously would have been
  investigated, and is currently taken seriously by AARO.</p>
<p>AARO also contradicts itself on the purported “40-year gap” in UAP investigations on Pages 21-22 where it reports
  that the famous Roswell incident was under various Air Force, GAO, Congressional, White House, and other
  investigations from 1992 to 2001 right in the middle of the alleged “gap” of 1969-2009.</p>
<p>(The claim on AAROR Page 40 that the Roswell incident, as “assessed” by AARO, was due to crash debris of a lost
  Project Mogul intelligence balloon appears to be another significant factual error by AARO since the alleged Mogul
  balloon launch on June 4, 1947, had been canceled according to Mogul project scientist records and the balloon
  equipment cannibalized for a later launch that never got lost but was followed and recovered.)</p>
<p>In 1980 the USAF nuclear weapons storage depot at RAF Bentwaters, England, was probed by a UAP with laser-like beams
  according to documents and the deputy base commander Col. Charles Halt, who was a personal eyewitness and led the
  field investigation team. Entire books have been openly published on the highly publicized so-called Rendlesham Forest
  case including by Col Halt himself. But AARO seems mystifyingly oblivious to the 1980 incidents, instead pushing its
  narrative of a purported “40-year gap” in UAP investigations from 1969 to 2009.</p>
