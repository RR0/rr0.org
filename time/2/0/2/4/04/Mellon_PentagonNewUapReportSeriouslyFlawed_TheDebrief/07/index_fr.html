<title>Le supposé "trou de 40 ans” dans les enquêtes officielles sur les PANs est dû à l'incapacité de l'AARO à
  correctement documenter leur histoire de 1969 à 2009 – sans même mentionner le cas charnière du Nimitz de 2004</title>

<p>The allegedly “complete”, “thorough”, and “accurate” <a href="../../../02/HistoricalRecordReport-vol1_AARO">AARO
  historical report</a> <span class="source">p. 12</span> wrongly claims there is <q>about a <b>40-year gap in UAP
  investigation programs</b> since the termination of Project <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">BLUE
  BOOK</a> in 1969 [sic]</q>– in other words a 40-year alleged “gap” from <time>1969/2009</time> (p. 10). (Actually, <a
  href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> terminated in <time>1970-01</time>, not <time>1969
  </time>, another historical error by <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>.)</p>
<p>In reality, the only “40-year gap” is in <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s failure to record the
  history, not a 40-year gap in the existence of US Government investigations and reports of UAP from
  <time>1969/2009</time>. Somehow <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> managed to slip around the 2004 USS
  Nimitz incidents, and others that are widespread public knowledge and were investigated by the military (hence <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> can’t use the “it’s classified” excuse to withhold).</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> certainly knows about the <time>2004</time> <a
  href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Nimitz">Nimitz UAP incidents</a>, which were the primary events that led to
  the current sea change in attitude to UFOs and UAP, leading to the establishment of <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> itself. <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> just
  inexplicably and unbelievably chooses not to mention the Nimitz anywhere in its Historical Report.</p>
<p>There are numerous USG investigations of UAP easily documented in declassified records, and many published during
  that purported “40-year gap.” These are only a few representative examples – one can hardly match the <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> manpower of 40+ personnel and multi-million-dollar budget to do the
  research <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> should have done in the first place.</p>
<p>During the Fall <time>1973</time> UAP wave, there were several US military investigations of UAP. These included
  those conducted by the Navy and Coast Guard involving an <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/OANI.html">underwater UFO or USO
    (Unidentified Submarine or Submerged Object)</a> near the location of the highly publicized alleged <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Pascagoula">UFO abduction case a month earlier at Pascagoula,
    Mississippi</a>. Coast Guard personnel sighted the underwater UAP and Navy oceanographer Dr. and Lt Cdr (later RADM)
  Craig Dorman investigated. <span class="source">UPI dispatch, Nov. 8, 1973, etc.</span> This is close to an important
  recent UAP sighting that occurred over the Gulf of Mexico, which came to Congress’ attention only as a result of a
  “protected disclosure.” Even then, all but one member of Congress visiting the base for the express purpose of a
  briefing on this case was denied access to the aircraft’s sensor data.</p>
<p>In <time>1975-10/1975-11</time> there was a wave of Northern Tier UAP incidents at restricted areas of military bases
  at Loring AFB, Maine, <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/Malmstrom">Malmstrom AFB</a> and Wurtsmith AFB, Michigan, <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Minot">Minot AFB</a>, North Dakota, etc., which were investigated by the
  Air Force and the <a href="/org/NORAD.html">North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)</a>, as documented in
  declassified and <a href="/org/FOIA.html">FOIA</a>-released electronic teletype messages (so the “it’s classified”
  excuse again can’t be used). Entire open-source books have been written about this <span
    class="source">e.g., the Fawcett & Greenwood classic, Clear Intent, 1984</span>.</p>
<p>A key intelligence focal point of investigations on the Northern Tier incident messages was the teletype address
  “AFINZ,” which turned out to be the Aerospace Intelligence Division of the Air Force Intelligence Service at the
  Pentagon (not Dayton, Ohio, by the way).</p>
<p>Likewise, <a href="/org/NORAD.html">NORAD</a> Intelligence and <a href="/org/NORAD.html">NORAD</a> J3 Aerospace
  Operations Division and predecessors have been involved with directing UAP investigations throughout the years in the
  alleged “40-year gap” and from before, back to the 1950s-1960s <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue
    Book</a> years, and right up to the present <span class="source">see “NORAD” in Clark, UFO Encyclopedia, 2018, pp. 801-824</span>.
</p>
<p>Also, a former Director of USAF Intelligence informed me that in the 1980’s the Air Force undertook a classified UAP
  collection program in the vicinity of <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/Area51">Area 51</a> in an attempt to ascertain the
  origin of UAP violating the famous base’s restricted airspace. How come that program was not uncovered by <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>? How many other secret USAF programs related to UAP were not uncovered?
  Where are those UAP reports and how many others are there from other locations?</p>
<p>There is also no mention by <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> of the successor to Air Force Project <a
  href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>’s parent organization <a
  href="/org/us/dod/af/sc/FTD.html">FTD (Foreign Technology Division)</a>, now called <a
  href="/org/us/dod/af/sc/NASIC.html">NASIC, National Air & Space Intelligence Center</a>. Since <a
  href="/org/us/dod/af/sc/NASIC.html">NASIC</a> is the Defense Dept.’s primary and central agency for intelligence on
  air and space threats, <a href="/org/us/dod/af/sc/NASIC.html">NASIC</a> obviously must be involved with UAP today and
  its UFO / UAP history should be traceable back to FTD / <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> in the 1960s.</p>
<p>But <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> does not breathe a word about either the <a
  href="/org/us/dod/af/sc/FTD.html">Foreign Technology Division FTD</a> or <a
  href="/org/us/dod/af/sc/NASIC.html">NASIC</a> in its “complete” and “thorough” history of UAP investigations <span
  class="source">even though <a href="../../../02/HistoricalRecordReport-vol1_AARO">AAROR</a> mentions the subject of “foreign technology” and
  “foreign technological threats”, pp. 15, 27</span>.</p>
<p>In <time>1976</time> <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Teheran">US-equipped Iranian jets chased UAP over
  Iran, with one UAP reportedly disabling the onboard radar, avionics, and the air-to-air intercept missile of an
  F-4</a>. This is a famous case, with declassified official US <a href="/org/us/dod/dia">DIA</a> documentation released
  (so again the “it’s classified” excuse can’t be used), so it seems incomprehensible that <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> would not know about it.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> seems to be unaware of what it wrote in its own report
  because the “40-year gap” in government UAP investigations from <time>1969/2009</time> it claimed on Page 10 seems to
  be contradicted on Page 30, by <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s own admission that a nuclear weapons
  depot UAP case occurred in <time>1977</time> (apparently at Loring AFB, Maine) and obviously would have been
  investigated, and is currently taken seriously by <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> also contradicts itself on the purported “40-year gap” in UAP
  investigations on Pages 21-22 where it reports that the famous Roswell incident was under various Air Force, <a
    href="/org/us/GAO.html">GAO</a>, Congressional, White House, and other investigations from <time>1992/2001</time>
  right in the middle of the alleged “gap” of <time>1969/2009</time>.</p>
<p>(The claim on <a href="../../../02/HistoricalRecordReport-vol1_AARO">AAROR</a> Page 40 that the <a
  href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Roswell">Roswell incident</a>, as “assessed” by <a
  href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>, was due to crash debris of a lost <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/Mogul">Project
  Mogul</a> intelligence balloon appears to be another significant factual error by <a
  href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> since the alleged <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/Mogul">Mogul</a> balloon
  launch on <time>1947-06-04</time>, had been canceled according to <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/Mogul">Mogul</a> project
  scientist records and the balloon equipment cannibalized for a later launch that never got lost but was followed and
  recovered.)</p>
<p>In <time>1980</time> the USAF nuclear weapons storage depot <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Bentwaters">at
  RAF Bentwaters, England, was probed by a UAP with laser-like beams</a> according to documents and the deputy base
  commander Col. <span class="people" title="Charles I. Halt">Charles Halt</span>, who was a personal eyewitness and led
  the field investigation team. Entire books have been openly published on the highly publicized so-called Rendlesham
  Forest case including by Col <span class="people">Halt</span> himself. But <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> seems mystifyingly oblivious to the <time>1980</time> incidents,
  instead pushing its narrative of a purported “40-year gap” in UAP investigations from <time>1969/2009</time>.</p>
