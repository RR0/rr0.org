<p>AARO tries to dismiss much of the UAP phenomenon with an implausibly expansive secret-project laundry list, including
  some projects like the Apollo moon landings, which were never secret in the first place.</p>
<p>As noted above, AARO claims that many “UAP sightings were the result of misidentifications of new technologies that
  observers would have understandably reported as UFOs. Observers unknowingly witnessed and reported as UFOs classified
  and sensitive programs that AARO assesses most likely were the cause of many UAP reports” (smoothed quote correcting
  AARO grammar errors etc.: See AAROR, p. 39).</p>
<p>Then AARO lists the Apollo program as one of 28 alleged examples (pp. 40-45). (See previous comments on Apollo.)</p>
<p>In none of these 28 supposed secret classified programs does AARO cite a single UAP report by date or location (the
  claims regarding early U-2 spy planes are unsupported by evidence, see above).</p>
<p>Besides the surprising and unsubstantiated AARO claim that the first US satellite in 1958, the open and public
  Explorer 1, somehow caused UAP sightings, there are the bizarre listings of purported “UAP sighting
  misidentifications” of secret spy satellites belonging to these programs:</p>
<ul><li>CIA TK/CORONA</li>
  <li>Navy TATTLETALE / GRAB</li>
  <li>Navy POPPY</li>
  <li>NRO’s GAMBIT</li>
  <li>NRO’s HEXAGON</li></ul>
<p>but again AARO does not cite an example of a single UAP sighting reported by people misidentifying any of these spy
  satellites as UAP. So why are they even listed?</p>
<p>Similarly, AARO lists as causing UAP sightings the various stealth and drone aircraft of:</p>
<ul><li>HAVE BLUE / F-117</li>
  <li>B-2 Bomber</li>
  <li>GNAT 750 drones</li>
  <li>Predator drones</li>
  <li>Reaper drones</li></ul>
<p>Yet again, AARO fails to cite an example of a single UAP sighting reported by people misidentifying any of these
  aircraft and drones as UAP. There are surely some valid examples, but to assert that these programs were a primary
  source of UAP sightings is unwarranted. Civilian UAP sightings come from all areas of the US, rural, suburban, and
  urban, not just in the vicinity of US military ranges and bases.</p>
<p>The remaining “secret” projects on AARO’s list are too tedious to go over and include the highly publicized – not
  “classified and sensitive” – Mercury and Gemini programs that put the first US astronauts into space, and like the
  Apollo moon landings never caused reported UAP sightings of their space capsules.</p>
<p>AARO makes a point of ostentatiously exposing and knocking down easy strawman claims throughout the report, such as
  going back to the Blue Book era on the sensational alleged “Navy jet” (no one saw this jet) shooting off a one-pound
  “metal piece” (no such metal) of a UFO (no one saw) over the Washington, DC, area in July 1952. (AAROR, pp. 20, 26;
  the one-pound magnesium orthosilicate stone actually found was a rare type of aubrite-enstatite magnesium meteorite,
  although AARO did not do the research to figure that out.)</p>
<p>Another easy strawman that AARO revels in demolishing is the infamous and long discredited “MJ-12” documents
  evidently hoaxed by Air Force’s own Office of Special Investigations personnel in the 1980s and 1990s (that Air Force
  role not mentioned by AARO of course) which appears to be an unlawful covert effort to manipulate US citizens and US
  public opinion.</p>
<p>Without mentioning the MJ-12 reference in the so-called “1961 Special National Intelligence Estimate” (one of several
  MJ-12 docs), which would have been a clear tipoff, AARO goes through a showy display of ticking off point after point
  how badly the document was faked:</p>
<p>AARO found that “the document lacked IC [Intelligence Community] tradecraft standards” and had “significant
  inconsistencies with SNIE’s … of the [1961] time period,” including “incorrect formatting, inconsistent branding, lack
  of a dissemination block and coordination language, loose narrative style, convoluted logic, imprecise and casual
  language, and … [strangely] superficial treatment of globally significant [1961] issues” had it really been written in
  1961 instead of being faked in the 1990s. (See AAROR, p. 31, plus added MJ-12 hoax background here not mentioned by
  AARO.) Does this suggest poor USAF OSI tradecraft?</p>
