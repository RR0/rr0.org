<p>The AAROR’s representation of CIA involvement seems strained and contrived. Because this is one of only two official
  government conclusions of extraterrestrial origin of UFOs that AARO claims to find (and then dispute and reject), they
  go to some effort to try to invent something to explain away and wiggle out from CIA Office of Scientific Intelligence
  director Dr. H. Marshall Chadwell’s obvious and logically deducible extraterrestrial conclusion, given to CIA Director
  Gen. Walter B. Smith by classified memo on December 2, 1952 (see quote farther down, right out of AAROR, p. 17).</p>
<p>A third governmental extraterrestrial conclusion completely overlooked by AARO – by Air Force Intelligence, namely
  the intelligent UFO motions study by Major Dewey Fournet and presented to the CIA Robertson Panel – was missed by AARO
  despite its widespread reporting in declassified CIA documents and published UAP literature (see “Robertson Panel,” in
  Clark, UFO Encyclopedia, 2018, p. 1015).</p>
<p>AARO can only speculate that it is just “possible” Chadwell meant only “Soviet” (a 6-letter word Chadwell could
  easily have written if he meant that and easy for Chadwell’s secretary Mary Jane Carder to have typed). But Soviet
  threats were the CIA’s job to track, so why leave that word out? “Possible” means it does not rise to the level of
  “probable” or “certain” and therefore the opposite alternative (ET) of the “possible” (Soviet) is what is very
  probably true.</p>
<p>In other words, even AARO has to tacitly admit that it is likely CIA scientist Chadwell did mean
  extraterrestrial.</p>
<p>In case there is any doubt, Chadwell and his deputy Ralph Clark both confirmed in published interviews many years ago
  that they, the CIA OSI, did briefly conclude that UFOs were extraterrestrial but that the Robertson Panel effectively
  changed Chadwell’s conclusions. They did not know the Air Force planted explained IFO not Best Unexplained UFO cases
  on the CIA Panel so they naturally would find them explained and thus not even close to being considered
  extraterrestrial (see Clark, UFO Encyclopedia, 2018, p. 1013a.)</p>
<p>As quoted by AARO (p. 17), Dr. Chadwell told the CIA Director he was convinced that “something was going on that must
  have immediate attention,” and that “sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds
  in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural
  phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles.” Clearly, these were not classified US aircraft programs.</p>
<p>AARO’s handling of the CIA Special Study Group of (August) 1952 is perhaps the most error-ridden in the entire AARO
  Report (pp. 16-17), as it appears just about everything is completely wrong, even the dates and the names of CIA
  personnel and Group members, and omission of bombshell facts. AAROR implies that the Group continued from summer until
  December 1952 when in fact it was in operation less than one month in order to brief the CIA Director on August 20,
  1952.</p>
<p>This was so that the CIA Director in turn could brief the President on UAP on August 22, 1952, a fact of stunning
  importance. It was the President who ordered the CIA investigation of the Air Force mishandling of UAP in the first
  place on July 28 after two weekends of worldwide bad publicity showing the Air Force unable to control the skies from
  invading UAP flying over Washington, DC, Air Force jets unable to stop the UAP — a highly relevant and dramatic fact
  utterly omitted by AARO. (See “Robertson Panel,” UFO Encyclopedia, 2018.)</p>
<p>AARO is utterly wrong not only about the date of the CIA Special Group but even gets the names of all the CIA
  personnel wrong. Omitting all mention of the President and the CIA Director, AARO insinuates the Group was created
  solely on the initiative of the CIA Deputy Director for Intelligence (DDI) Robert Amory Jr. but got the name wrong
  since in 1952 the DDI was Loftus E. Becker. Contrary to AARO, this Special Group on UAP was not formed and tasked
  under the CIA Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI) Physics & Electronics Division but under the OSI Operations
  Staff. That P&E Division’s USAF Maj. A. Ray Gordon was not the “lead” or any part of the Group.</p>
<p>The Robertson Panel Minutes clearly identify the Group as consisting of “Strong, Eng, Durant” (not Maj. Gordon) two
  of whom have been interviewed by researchers over the years and who confirmed the obvious facts also found of course
  in declassified CIA documents AARO missed — the Group was formed within the OSI Operations Staff headed by Brig.Gen.

<p>Somehow AARO managed to entirely miss the CIA Special Group’s finding that the Air Force UAP intelligence effort at
  Project Blue Book was a complete failure. The Group’s expert in the intelligence process, Ransom L. Eng, as part of
  the Group, personally visited Blue Book and its parent organization ATIC at Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio. Eng
  found that the Air Force’s Project Blue Book UAP effort failed all 4 stages of the intelligence process — Failed at
  Intelligence Collection, Failed at Analysis, Failed at Production, Failed at Dissemination.</p>
<p>The Special Study Group and Eng told CIA Director Walter B. Smith, Gen., USA, on August 20, 1952, at a CIA-wide
  briefing, that the “entire Air Force” had a “world-wide reporting system and [jet] interception program” against UAP
  but which generates a “flood of reports on unidentified flying objects” that comes to an inadequate “small group” with
  “low level of support … on a minimal basis” of only 5 personnel at Blue Book who clearly could not deal with the huge
  volume of UAP reports. The UAP reports were made from a 10-question report form that was “inadequate even for the
  limited case-history approach.” That’s the Intelligence Collection failure.</p>
<p>Then Eng said the all-important Analysis phase was of “extremely limited scope” where the Air Force used a laborious
  one-by-one “individual case” or “case history” system of handling, using no computer punch cards or “other standard
  method of processing data” to speed the process of explaining and identifying the Explained (or IFO) cases and the
  Unexplained cases. But once that was done, Eng pointed out the Air Force did no trend studies, no pattern analysis nor
  any other of “a number accepted research techniques … in any effort to gain a sound understanding of these
  phenomena.”</p>
<p>But Eng noted ominously that Blue Book had “laboriously” plotted the Unexplained UAP cases by hand on a map and the
  “plots show a high incidence of reported [UAP] cases near atomic installations and Strategic Air Command [SAC] bases”
  but BB tried to downplay it. The Air Force failed to mention to the CIA Group that the new incoming Air Force Director
  of Intelligence Maj. Gen. John Samford himself was shown the Unexplained UAP map in December 1951 displaying UAP
  concentrated around nuclear bases and SAC bases. Gen. Samford was so disturbed he ordered a major investigation of the
  mapped UAP nuclear/SAC concentrations using computers at the AF’s Battelle Memorial Institute contractor codenamed
  Project Stork (which AARO botched as to its name, wrongly calling it “Project BEAR”). Here was a potential national
  security threat from UAP and the Air Force was misleading the CIA about it.</p>
<p>Eng concluded that the Air Force failed the Analysis phase of the intelligence process by failing to carry out the
  essential “well planned and properly guided research program” to solve the mystery of what the UAPs were and help
  prevent any national threat.</p>
<p>Eng and the Special Group thus urged the establishment by the CIA of a major ongoing, permanent scientific UAP
  research program conducted by MIT at its Project Lincoln radar air defense laboratory, which the CIA continued to work
  towards — until the AF derailed CIA with the now-infamous Robertson Panel. The AF forced the rush-to-judgment, hurried
  merely 4-day Panel of scientists on the CIA OSI in the weeks leading up to January 1953, which OSI repeatedly tried to
  stop, stall, and postpone, but got overruled via AF pressure on the CIA Director. The AF even manipulated the evidence
  by falsely submitting Explained IFO cases dressed up as Best Unexplained cases so they would fall apart in front of
  the Panel. None of this salient history was mentioned by AARO (see “Robertson Panel,” UFO Encyclopedia, 2018).</p>
