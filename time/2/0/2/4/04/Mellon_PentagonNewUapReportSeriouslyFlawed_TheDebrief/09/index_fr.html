<p>The <a href="../../../02/HistoricalRecordReport-vol1_AARO">AAROR</a>’s representation of <a
  href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> involvement seems strained and contrived. Because this is one of only two official
  government conclusions of extraterrestrial origin of UFOs that <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> claims
  to find (and then dispute and reject), they go to some effort to try to invent something to explain away and wiggle
  out from CIA <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/osi">Office of Scientific Intelligence</a> director Dr. <span class="people">H. Marshall Chadwell</span>’s
  obvious and logically deducible extraterrestrial conclusion, given to <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> Director Gen.
  <span class="people" title="Walter Bedell Smith">Walter B. Smith</span> by classified memo on <time>1952-12-02</time>
  <q>see quote farther down, right out of AAROR, p. 17</q>.</p>
<p>A third governmental extraterrestrial conclusion completely overlooked by <a
  href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> – by Air Force Intelligence, namely the intelligent UFO motions study by
  Major Dewey Fournet and presented to the CIA <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/projet/Robertson">Robertson Panel</a> – was
  missed by <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> despite its widespread reporting in declassified CIA
  documents and published UAP literature <span class="source">see “Robertson Panel,” in
  Clark, UFO Encyclopedia, 2018, p. 1015</span>.</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> can only speculate that it is just “<b>possible</b>” <span
  class="people">Chadwell</span> meant only “Soviet” (a 6-letter word Chadwell could easily have written if he meant
  that and easy for <span class="people">Chadwell</span>’s secretary Mary Jane Carder to have typed). But Soviet threats
  were the CIA’s job to track, so why leave that word out? “Possible” means it does not rise to the level of “probable”
  or “certain” and therefore the opposite alternative (ET) of the “possible” (Soviet) is what is very probably true.</p>
<p>In other words, even <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> has to tacitly admit that it is likely CIA
  scientist <span class="people">Chadwell</span> <em>did</em> mean extraterrestrial.</p>
<p>In case there is any doubt, <span class="people">Chadwell</span> and his deputy Ralph Clark both confirmed in
  published interviews many years ago that they, the <b>CIA <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/osi">OSI</a></b>, did briefly <b>conclude
    that UFOs were extraterrestrial</b> but that the Robertson Panel effectively changed Chadwell’s conclusions. They
  did not know the Air Force planted explained <a href="/">IFO</a> not Best Unexplained UFO cases on the CIA Panel so
  they naturally would find them explained and thus not even close to being considered extraterrestrial <span
    class="source">see Clark, <i lang="en">UFO Encyclopedia</i>, 2018, p. 1013a</span>.</p>
<p>As quoted by <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> <span class="source">p. 17</span>, Dr. <span
  class="people">Chadwell</span> told the CIA Director he was convinced that <q>something was going on that must have
  immediate attention,</q> and that <q>sightings of <b>unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high
  speeds</b> in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such nature that they are <b>not attributable to
  natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles.</b></q> Clearly, these were not classified US aircraft programs.
</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s handling of the CIA Special Study Group of <time>1952-08</time> is
  perhaps the most error-ridden in the entire <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Report <span
    class="source">pp. 16-17</span>, as it appears just about everything is completely wrong, even the dates and the
  names of CIA personnel and Group members, and omission of bombshell facts. <a
    href="../../../02/HistoricalRecordReport-vol1_AARO">AAROR</a> implies that the Group continued from summer until
  <time>1952-12</time> when in fact it was in operation less than one month in order to brief the CIA Director on <time>1952-08-20</time>.
</p>
<p>This was so that the <b>CIA Director in turn could brief the President on UAP on <time>1952-08-22</time>, a fact of
  stunning importance.</b> It was the <b>President</b> who <b>ordered the CIA investigation of the Air Force</b>
  mishandling of UAP in the first place on July 28 after two weekends of worldwide bad publicity showing the Air Force
  unable to control the skies from <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Washington">invading UAP flying over
    Washington</a>, DC, Air Force jets unable to stop the UAP — a highly relevant and dramatic fact utterly omitted by
  <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> <span
    class="source">See “Robertson Panel,” <i lang="en">UFO Encyclopedia</i>, 2018</span>.</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> is utterly wrong not only about the date of the CIA Special Group but
  even gets the names of all the CIA personnel wrong. Omitting all mention of the President and the CIA Director, <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> insinuates the Group was created solely on the initiative of the CIA
  Deputy Director for Intelligence (DDI) Robert Amory Jr. but got the name wrong since in <time>1952</time> the DDI was
  Loftus E. Becker. Contrary to <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>, this Special Group on UAP was not
  formed and tasked under the CIA <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/osi">Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI)</a> Physics &
  Electronics Division but under the OSI Operations Staff. That P&E Division’s USAF Maj. A. Ray Gordon was
  <b><em>not</em></b> the “lead” or any part of the Group.</p>
<p>The <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/projet/Robertson">Robertson Panel</a> Minutes clearly identify the Group as consisting of
  “Strong, Eng, Durant” (not Maj. Gordon) two of whom have been interviewed by researchers over the years and who
  confirmed the obvious facts also found of course in declassified CIA documents <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>
  missed — the Group was formed within the OSI Operations Staff headed by Brig.Gen. Philip G. Strong, USMCR.</p>
<p>Somehow <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> managed to entirely miss the CIA Special Group’s finding that
  the Air Force UAP intelligence effort at Project <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>¬ was
  a complete failure. The Group’s expert in the intelligence process, Ransom L. Eng, as part of the Group, personally
  visited <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>¬ and its parent organization ATIC at
  Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio. Eng found that the <b>Air Force’s Project <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>¬ UAP effort failed all 4 stages</b> of the intelligence
  process — <b>Failed at Intelligence Collection, Failed at Analysis, Failed at Production, Failed at Dissemination.</b>
</p>
<p>The Special Study Group and Eng told CIA Director <span class="people">Walter B. Smith</span>, Gen., USA, on <time>1952-08-20</time>,
  at a CIA-wide briefing, that the <q>entire Air Force</q> had a <b>“world-wide reporting system and [jet] interception
    program” against UAP</b> but which generates a <q>flood of reports on unidentified flying objects</q> that comes to
  an inadequate <q>small group</q> with <q>low level of support … on a minimal basis</q> of only 5 personnel at <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> who clearly could not deal with the huge volume of UAP
  reports. The UAP reports were made from a 10-question report form that was <q><b>inadequate</b> even for the limited
    case-history approach.</q> That’s the Intelligence Collection failure.</p>
<p>Then Eng said the all-important Analysis phase was of <q>extremely limited scope</q> where the Air Force used a
  laborious one-by-one “individual case” or “case history” system of handling, using no computer punch cards or <q>other
    standard method of processing data</q> to speed the process of explaining and identifying the Explained (or IFO)
  cases and the Unexplained cases. But once that was done, Eng pointed out the Air Force did no trend studies, no
  pattern analysis nor any other of <q>a number accepted research techniques … in any effort to gain a sound
    understanding of these phenomena.</q></p>
<p>But Eng noted ominously that <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> had “laboriously”
  plotted the <b>Unexplained UAP</b> cases by hand on a map and the <q>plots show a high incidence of reported [UAP]
    cases <b>near atomic installations and Strategic Air Command [SAC] bases</b></q> but <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">BB</a> tried to downplay it. The Air Force failed to mention to the
  CIA Group that the new incoming Air Force Director of Intelligence Maj. Gen. <span
    class="people" title="John A. Samford">John Samford</span> himself was shown the Unexplained UAP map in <time>1951-12</time>
  displaying UAP concentrated around nuclear bases and SAC bases. Gen. <span class="people">Samford</span> was so
  disturbed he ordered a major investigation of the mapped UAP nuclear/SAC concentrations using computers at the AF’s
  Battelle Memorial Institute contractor codenamed <a href="/org/us/bmi/projet/Stork.html">Project Stork</a> (which <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> botched as to its name, wrongly calling it “<a
    href="/org/us/bmi/projet/Stork.html#Bear">Project BEAR</a>”). Here was a potential national security threat from UAP
  and the Air Force was misleading the CIA about it.</p>
<p>Eng concluded that the Air Force failed the Analysis phase of the intelligence process by failing to carry out the
  essential <q>well planned and properly guided research program</q> to solve the mystery of what the UAPs were and help
  prevent any national threat.</p>
<p>Eng and the Special Group thus urged the establishment by the <b>CIA of a major ongoing, permanent scientific UAP
  research program conducted by MIT</b> at its Project Lincoln radar air defense laboratory, which the CIA continued to
  work towards — until the AF derailed CIA with the now-infamous <a href="/org/us/ic/cia/projet/Robertson">Robertson
    Panel</a>. The AF forced the rush-to-judgment, hurried merely 4-day Panel of scientists on the CIA OSI in the weeks
  leading up to <time>1953-01</time>, which OSI repeatedly tried to stop, stall, and postpone, but got overruled via AF
  pressure on the CIA Director. The AF even manipulated the evidence by falsely submitting Explained IFO cases dressed
  up as Best Unexplained cases so they would fall apart in front of the Panel. None of this salient history was
  mentioned by <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> <span
