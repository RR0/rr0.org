<p>It appears that the latest AARO figures for unexplained UAP cases work out to 62%, as of August 30, 2022, since the
  current AARO historical report of February 2024 gives no figures.</p>
<p>AARO’s 2022 Annual Report reported 510 total UAP cases, of which 171 of the 366 new post-Task Force cases were
  “uncharacterized and unattributed” (p. 5). This seems to be a brand new name for “unidentified” (see the UAP Reporting
  Directive May 2023 para. 3.B.6) though the Annual Report tries to suggest it is a more preliminary “initial” category
  than either “positively resolved” or “unidentified.” Unfortunately, it does not define these terms in the AARO
  Report.</p>
<p>However, AARO’s UAP Reporting Directive of May 2023 belies their effort to minimize this new “unattributed” category
  label, by defining in paragraph 3.B.6 that “UAP ATTRIBUTION is the assessed natural or artificial source of the
  phenomenon and includes solar, weather, tidal events; US government, scientific, industry, and private activities; and
  foreign (allied or adversary) government, scientific, industry, and private activities.” That seems to indicate that
  “attribution” is not some “initial” cursory impression but a thorough “assessment,” hence like the identification
  process that would lead to “identified” or “unidentified.”</p>
<p>The AARO Annual Report seems to conveniently fail to mention that when these new 171 unidentified UAP reports are
  added to the previous UAP Task Force’s 143 unidentified, the grand total of 314 unidentified out of 510 represents a
  formidable 62% unexplained/unidentified.</p>
<p>AARO makes no mention at all of this statistic of 62% unexplained. The reader would be required to know the AARO
  predecessor’s UAP Task Force stats, add the numbers, and do the calculations of percentage – which almost no one will
  even realize needs to be done.</p>
<p>AARO admits its January 2023 Annual report (for 2022) had revealed that “some” of the (171) unidentified UAP
  “demonstrated unusual flight characteristics or performance capabilities.” (AAROR p. 26, omits the “171” number given
  in the AARO Jan 2023 report, p. 5, and neither report says how many were “some.”)</p>
<p>This is the core element of any basic definition of a truly Unexplained UFO or UAP: unusual flight
  characteristics/performance along with unconventional shape (the definition can be traced as far back as Air Force UFO
  reporting directives in 1948-49). AARO does not single this out for much attention nor give exact statistics.</p>
<p>The 2024 AARO report avoids all mention of its predecessor UAP Task Force’s remarkable pro-UAP statistics of 99.3%
  Unidentified, including at least 56% involving multiple sensor systems which would eliminate sensor errors and
  conventional IFO explanations (stats all omitted in AAROR p. 24).</p>
<p>No AARO mention is made of either the 99.3% unidentified or the succeeding 62% unidentified number, the latest exact
  percentage (by calculation) deducible from exact AARO case numbers (see next section trying to numerically pin down
  AARO’s subsequent vague “majority” wording). The total caseload percentage of unexplained does not seem to be dropping
  much further if at all, given that AARO continues in 2023 and 2024 to repeatedly use the same vague “majority” term
  for the explained case fraction, conveniently without numbers. Presumably, if it had dropped significantly AARO would
  likely have highlighted this or at least set the record straight.</p>
