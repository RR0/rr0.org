<p>Il semble que les derniers chiffres de l'<a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> sur les cas inexpliqués de
  PANs work out to 62%, as of <time>2022-08-30</time>, since the current <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>
  historical report of <time>2024-02</time> gives no figures.</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s 2022 Annual Report reported 510 total UAP cases, of which 171 of
  the 366 <b><i>new</i></b> post-Task Force cases were <q>uncharacterized and unattributed</q> <span
    class="source">p. 5</span>. This seems to be a brand new name for “unidentified” <span class="source">see the UAP Reporting Directive May 2023 para. 3.B.6</span>
  though the Annual Report tries to suggest it is a more preliminary “initial” category than either “positively
  resolved” or “unidentified.” Unfortunately, it does not define these terms in the <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Report.</p>
<p>However, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s UAP Reporting Directive of <time>2023-05</time> belies
  their effort to minimize this new “unattributed” category label, by defining in paragraph 3.B.6 that <q>UAP
    ATTRIBUTION is the <b>assessed</b> natural or artificial source of the phenomenon and includes solar, weather, tidal
    events; US government, scientific, industry, and private activities; and foreign (allied or adversary) government,
    scientific, industry, and private activities.</q> That seems to indicate that “attribution” is not some “initial”
  cursory impression but a thorough “assessment,” hence like the identification process that would lead to “identified”
  or “unidentified.”
</p>
<p>The <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Annual Report seems to conveniently fail to mention that when
  these new 171 unidentified UAP reports are added to the previous UAP Task Force’s 143 unidentified, the grand total of
  <b>314 unidentified</b> out of 510 represents a formidable <b>62% unexplained</b>/unidentified.</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> makes no mention at all of this statistic of 62% unexplained. The
  reader would be required to know the <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> predecessor’s UAP Task Force
  stats, add the numbers, and do the calculations of percentage – which almost no one will even realize needs to be
  done.</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> admits its <time>2023-01</time> Annual report (for 2022) had revealed
  that “some” of the (171) unidentified UAP <b><q>demonstrated unusual flight characteristics or performance
    capabilities</q></b> <span class="source">AAROR p. 26, omits the “171” number given in the neither report says how
    many were “some.”</span></p>
<p>This is the core element of any basic definition of a truly Unexplained UFO or UAP: unusual flight
  characteristics/performance along with unconventional shape (the definition can be traced as far back as Air Force UFO
  reporting directives in <time>1948/1949</time>). <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> does not single this
  out for much attention nor give exact statistics.</p>
<p>The <time>2024</time> <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> report avoids all mention of its predecessor <a
  href="/org/us/dod/navy/uaptf">UAP Task Force</a>’s remarkable pro-UAP statistics of 99.3% Unidentified, including at
  least 56% involving multiple sensor systems which would eliminate sensor errors and conventional IFO explanations
  <span class="source">stats all omitted in AAROR p. 24</span>.</p>
<p>No <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> mention is made of either the 99.3% unidentified or the succeeding
  62% unidentified number, the latest exact percentage (by calculation) deducible from exact <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> case numbers (see next section trying to numerically pin down <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s subsequent vague “majority” wording). The total caseload percentage
  of unexplained does not seem to be dropping much further if at all, given that <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>
  continues in 2023 and 2024 to repeatedly use the same vague “majority” term for the explained case fraction,
  conveniently without numbers. Presumably, if it had dropped significantly <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> would likely have highlighted this or at least set the record straight.
