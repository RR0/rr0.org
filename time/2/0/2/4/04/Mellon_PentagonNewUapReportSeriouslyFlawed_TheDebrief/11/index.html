  to ca. 600 cumulative total reports)!</title>

<p>As mentioned above, AARO’s predecessor UAP Task Force had a total of 143 Unexplained UAP cases as of March 2021. This
  was more than doubled to a cumulative total of 314 unexplained in the first AARO Annual Report as of August 2022. Now
  it appears that the number may nearly double again to about 600 unexplained in 2024 (see table below). Unfortunately,
  due to a lack of clarity or transparency, we are forced to analyze and disentangle AARO’s obfuscated UAP statistics in
  order to deduce this.</p>
UAP report
<p>Interestingly, the October 2023 AARO “Consolidated Annual Report” (or “AARO Cons” for short) to Congress on UAP,
  makes the Blue Book-style prediction that:</p>
<p>“Based on the ability to resolve cases to date, with an increase in the quality of data secured, the unidentified and
  purported anomalous nature of most UAP will likely resolve to ordinary phenomena and significantly reduce the amount
  of UAP case submissions [i.e., apparently discourage making of UAP reports].”</p>
<p>But each year or so, the total cumulative number of unidentified anomalous UAP reports increased from 143 to 314 to
  600. That suggests that each year or so the added new reports with supposedly better “quality of data” were more
  unexplainable not more resolved with the better data. A later obscure statement in the AARO Cons report admits that
  AARO has not been able to explain away its UAP case backlog (the excuse being a “lack of data,” but perhaps really a
  lack of investigation?) hence the new cases with better data are not helping AARO, they’re still highly unexplainable
  (AARO Cons., Oct. 2023, p. 8).</p>
<p>Once again, history repeats itself. During Project Blue Book the Air Force repeatedly suggested that the primary
  problem in identifying and explaining UAP was lack of quality data, when often the reverse was true. When Blue Book
  sorted UAP cases into categories based on the quality of data, its ability to find conventional explanations steadily
  decreased as the quality of the witnesses and data increased (see table below from data in Blue Book Special Report
  14).</p>
UAP report
<p>Because there is no mention in the 2024 AARO report of even its alleged current 2024 caseload of 1,200 UAP cases – a
  number shared by AARO Acting Director Tim Phillips with CNN on March 6, 2024 – the next most recent stats with any
  kind of hint at an explained/unexplained breakdown we can find are in the previous AARO Annual Reports: the October
  2023 AARO Report and the belated 2022 Annual UAP Report to Congress of January 2023 (a confusing array of dates and
  reports).</p>
<p>The January 2023 report gives the breakdown of only the new cases, with the numbers if one adds them up, 195-to-171
  explained-to-unexplained or 53-47% (of the new, not of the total caseload), calling it “more than half,” language that
  subsequent AARO reports have blurred into the more vague single word “majority.” Both the October 2023 and 2024 AARO
  reports thus have similar language stating that an apparently bare “majority” of the UAP reports were explained, and
  some of the remaining “anomalous.”</p>
<p>Then the 2024 AARO report in effect adopts the bare “majority” language as the current UAP status, implying a roughly
  51-49% type breakdown (possibly even the same 53-47% ratio as the previous new cases, in view of the vagueness). By
  implication, AARO seems to broadly apply the older reports’ fuzzy breakdown to the final UAP 2024 situational wrap-up
  in this current 2024 AARO report. AARO thus admits in subdued non-numerical language the surprising fact that nearly
  half of its UAP caseload is still unexplained today or does not “have an ordinary explanation” – thus seeming to
  undermine its position. (AAROR pp. 25-26; similar statement in AARO Cons., Oct 2023, p. 8) It would be helpful in the
  future if AARO would clarify the data and present the actual numbers.</p>
<p>Presumably, the current 2024 numbers are close to this implied 51-49% split of Explained-Unexplained, or AARO would
  have said differently and given us the exact figures in the AARO report. (The AARO official website does not help, it
  gives UAP Reporting Trends from cases 1996 to November 20, 2023, including percentages of shapes (“morphology”) of UAP
  but for some reason gives no numbers of total cases or percentages of cases resolved or explained – much more
  important numbers insofar as rating AARO’s mission performance and assessing the level of UAP activity being
  encountered by DoD and the IC.)</p>
<p>In any case, if applied to the current UAP total then there may be close to 600 Unexplained in the 1,200 UAP reports
  total in March 2024 (and this does not account for AARO sweeping away Insufficient Data cases as if fully explained as
  Blue Book did in the past, which might push the 600 Unexplained still higher depending on the definition of
  Insufficient Data being applied consistently). If so, then this represents almost a doubling of the 314 unexplained
  cases from August 2022 (a figure AARO also omits). And that 314 unexplained was a more-than doubling from the previous
  143 unexplained.</p>
<p>If the stats were much better than this from AARO’s viewpoint, they would likely have said so. AARO had plenty of
  room – and months of time remaining before the report was due to Congress – to provide explicit numbers in its
  historical report.</p>
<p>Why are we forced to resort to guessing games on nuances of AARO’s language? Why doesn’t AARO release the statistics
  openly and transparently?</p>
<p>In still another revealing statistical admission worded in non-numerical language, AARO admits, as mentioned above,
  that “A small percentage of cases have potentially anomalous characteristics or concerning characteristics.” (AAROR p.
  26)</p>
<p>What exactly is that “small percentage” numerically, what exactly do they mean by “small” and are they understating
  and minimizing it in various ways? What is a “concerning” characteristic? A national security threat? A danger to air
  safety?</p>
<p>Is this “small percentage” the same category for which AARO then-Director Kirkpatrick gave CNN some UAP stats in
  October 2023 not found in the formal AARO Cons Annual Report just then released? Kirkpatrick said that 2-4% of the
  cases are “truly anomalous and require further investigation” (he had also previously given that same ambiguous figure
  to the media). Why the uncertainty of 2% or 4%? That is a double-factor uncertainty. Is there a “moderately” anomalous
  category below “truly anomalous” at AARO and what percentage of Unexplained or Total UAP cases might fall into that
  category?</p>
<p>The AARO 2022 Annual Report uses an interesting new term, “unknown morphologies” (= unknown shapes?), and says such
  “interesting signatures” are found “only in a very small percentage” of cases – as if stressing the “very small”
  number makes it better, as in old Air Force Project Blue Book debunker fashion that it was just a little ways to go to
  be completely explained away (AARO Jan 2023, p.8). How can a shape be “unknown”? Either one sees a shape or not.</p>
<p>It all adds up to a profound mystery that AARO seems to be deliberately obscuring if not obfuscating.</p>
