  to ca. 600 cumulative total reports)!</title>

<p>As mentioned above, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s predecessor UAP Task Force had a total of 143
  Unexplained UAP cases as of <time>2021-03</time>. This was more than doubled to a cumulative total of 314 unexplained
  in the first <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Annual Report as of <time>2022-08</time>. Now it appears
  that the number may nearly double again to about 600 unexplained in <time>2024</time> (see table below).
  Unfortunately, due to a lack of clarity or transparency, we are forced to analyze and disentangle <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s obfuscated UAP statistics in order to deduce this.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the October 2023 <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> “Consolidated Annual Report” (or “<a
  href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Cons” for short) to Congress on UAP, makes the <a
  href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>-style prediction that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Based on the ability to resolve cases to date, with an increase in the quality of data secured, the unidentified
    and purported anomalous nature of <b>most UAP will likely resolve to ordinary phenomena and significantly reduce the
      amount of UAP case submissions [i.e., apparently discourage making of UAP reports].</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But each year or so, the total cumulative number of unidentified anomalous UAP reports increased from 143 to 314 to
  600. That suggests that each year or so the added new reports with supposedly better “quality of data” were more
  unexplainable not more resolved with the better data. A later obscure statement in the <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Cons report admits that <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>
  has not been able to explain away its UAP case backlog (the excuse being a <q>lack of data</q>, but perhaps really a
  lack of investigation?) hence the new cases with better data are not helping <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>, they’re still highly unexplainable (<a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Cons., Oct. 2023, p. 8).</p>
<p>Once again, history repeats itself. During Project <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>
  the Air Force repeatedly suggested that the primary problem in identifying and explaining UAP was lack of quality
  data, when often the reverse was true. When <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> sorted UAP
  cases into categories based on the quality of data, its ability to find conventional explanations steadily decreased
  as the quality of the witnesses and data increased <span class="source">see table below from data in <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> Special Report 14</span>.</p>
<figure class="right side">

<p>Because there is no mention in the <time>2024</time> <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> report of even
  its alleged current <time>2024</time> caseload of 1,200 UAP cases – a number shared by <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Acting Director Tim Phillips with CNN on <time>2024-03-06</time> – the
  next most recent stats with any kind of hint at an explained/unexplained breakdown we can find are in the previous <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Annual Reports: the <time>2023-10</time> <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Report and the belated <time>2022</time> Annual UAP Report to Congress
  of <time>2023-01</time> (a confusing array of dates and reports).</p>
<p>The <time>2023-01</time> report gives the breakdown of only the <b><em>new</em></b> cases, with the numbers if one
  adds them up, 195-to-171 explained-to-unexplained or 53-47% (of the new, not of the total caseload), calling it <q>more
    than half</q>, language that subsequent <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> reports have blurred into
  the more vague single word “majority.” Both the <time>2023-10</time> and <time>2024</time> <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> reports thus have similar language stating that an apparently bare
  “majority” of the UAP reports were explained, and some of the remaining “anomalous.”</p>
<p>Then the 2024 <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> report in effect adopts the bare “majority” language as
  the current UAP status, implying a roughly 51-49% type breakdown (possibly even the same 53-47% ratio as the previous
  new cases, in view of the vagueness). By implication, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> seems to broadly
  apply the older reports’ fuzzy breakdown to the final UAP <time>2024</time> situational wrap-up in this current 2024
  <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> report. <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> thus admits in
  subdued non-numerical language the surprising fact that <b><em>nearly half</em></b> of its UAP caseload is still
  <b><em>unexplained today</em></b> or does not “have an ordinary explanation” – thus seeming to undermine its position
  <span class="source">AAROR pp. 25-26; similar statement in <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Cons.,
    Oct 2023, p. 8</span>. It would be helpful in the future if <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> would
  clarify the data and present the actual numbers.</p>
<p>Presumably, the current 2024 numbers are close to this implied 51-49% split of Explained-Unexplained, or <a
  href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> would have said differently and given us the exact figures in the <a
  href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> report. (The <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> official
  website does not help, it gives UAP Reporting Trends from cases <time>1996</time> to <time>2023-11-20</time>,
  including percentages of shapes (“morphology”) of UAP but for some reason gives no numbers of total cases or
  percentages of cases resolved or explained – much more important numbers insofar as rating <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s mission performance and assessing the level of UAP activity being
  encountered by DoD and the IC.)</p>
<p>In any case, if applied to the current UAP total then there may be close to <b>600 Unexplained</b> in the 1,200 UAP
  reports total in <time>2024-03</time> (and this does not account for <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>
  sweeping away Insufficient Data cases as if fully explained as <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook"><a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a></a>¬ did in the past, which might push the 600
  Unexplained still higher depending on the definition of Insufficient Data being applied consistently). If so, then
  this represents almost a <b><em>doubling of the 314 unexplained cases</em></b> from August 2022 (a figure <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> also omits). And that 314 unexplained was a more-than doubling from the
  previous 143 unexplained.</p>
<p>If the stats were much better than this from <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s viewpoint, they would
  likely have said so. <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> had plenty of room – and months of time remaining
  before the report was due to Congress – to provide explicit numbers in its historical report.</p>
<p><b><em>Why are we forced to resort to guessing games on nuances of <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s
  language? Why doesn’t <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> release the statistics openly and transparently?</em></b>
</p>
<p>In still another revealing statistical admission worded in non-numerical language, <a
  href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> admits, as mentioned above, that <q>A <b>small percentage</b> of cases
  have potentially <b>anomalous</b> characteristics or <b>concerning</b> characteristics.</q> <q>AAROR p. 26</q></p>
<p>What exactly is that “small percentage” numerically, what exactly do they mean by “small” and are they understating
  and minimizing it in various ways? What is a “concerning” characteristic? A national security threat? A danger to air
  safety?</p>
<p>Is this “small percentage” the same category for which <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> then-Director
  <span class="people" title="Sean Kirkpatrick">Kirkpatrick</span> <a
    href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/18/politics/us-ufo-reports-pentagon/index.html">gave CNN some UAP stats in October
    2023</a> not found in the formal <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Cons Annual Report just then
  released? Kirkpatrick said that 2-4% of the cases are <q>truly anomalous and require further investigation</q> (he had
  also previously given that same ambiguous figure to the media). Why the uncertainty of 2% or 4%? That is a
  double-factor uncertainty. Is there a “moderately” anomalous category below “truly anomalous” at <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> and what percentage of Unexplained or Total UAP cases might fall into
  that category?</p>
<p>The <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> 2022 Annual Report uses an interesting new term, <q>unknown
  morphologies</q> (= unknown shapes?), and says such <q>interesting signatures</q> are found <q>only in a very small
  percentage</q> of cases – as if stressing the “very small” number makes it better, as in old Air Force Project <a
  href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> debunker fashion that it was just a little ways to go to
  be completely explained away (<a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Jan 2023, p.8). How can a shape be
  “unknown”? Either one sees a shape or not.</p>
<p>It all adds up to a profound mystery that <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> seems to be deliberately
  obscuring if not obfuscating.</p>
