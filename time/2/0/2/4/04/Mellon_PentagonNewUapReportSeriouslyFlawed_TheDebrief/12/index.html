<title>AARO is playing the same games with data as old UFO Project Blue Book – Flooding its files with insufficient data
  cases</title>

<p>It appears that AARO has adopted the old Air Force Project Blue Book’s strategy of flooding their case files with
  Insufficient Data cases wrongly claimed to be explained. But if there are insufficient data to explain a UFO case or
  cases, then they are by definition unexplained. However, as Hynek taught, these don’t rate as “officially” Unexplained
  either, because that requires fully Sufficient Data and must go through IFO screening investigation. “Insufficient
  Data” does not identify an object or its cause, it says there is not enough data to do so. This AARO policy of
  caseload dilution with Insufficient Data reverses its predecessor UAP Task Force’s smart approach of selecting higher
  quality “focused” UAP cases with an emphasis on multi-sensor incidents (80 of the initial 144 UAPTF cases or 56%)
  which yielded only one IFO out of 144.</p>
<p>And unlike Blue Book, AARO does not even bother to give a breakdown of the status of the current 1,200 UAP cases on
  file that AARO’s new Acting Director Tim Phillips told the media about but strangely are not mentioned in AARO’s
  Historical Report. Perhaps AARO doesn’t want anyone to focus on numbers – specific numbers involving the alleged
  “assessed” UAP identifications instead of vague generalities.</p>
<p>Where are the UAP cases with data so that scientists can independently verify AARO’s conclusions, which is the core
  of the scientific process?</p>
<p>If the government favors transparency as it claims, why is it that not even redacted UAP case files are being
  released? Why is it that after the Navy Go Fast, FLIR, and Gimbal videos were confirmed to be unclassified other
  videos of precisely the same kind, obtained over US training ranges, are still being withheld? I know this to be the
  case because I’ve seen one of the unreleased videos and raised this issue directly with DoD. I initially got a polite
  reply and an assurance the matter would be reviewed, but months have passed and I’ve heard nothing further.
  Unsurprisingly, nothing further has occurred. And why is it that Customs and Border Patrol official IR videos can be
  released without damage to national security, but not similar DoD videos? I’m confident that with over 1,000 new cases
  there must be others like “Gimbal”, “Flir” and “Go Fast” that have not been released.</p>
<p>AARO appears to be the “New Blue Book,” trying to “get rid” of UAP just like the old Air Force Project Blue Book in
  its heyday of the 1960s strived to “get rid” of UFOs by every trick in the (blue) book (Hynek UFO Report, ch. 3). In
  sum, with great irony, AARO seems to repeat some of the same methodological errors and mistakes that undermined the
  credibility of the historical UAP investigation it is reporting. These appear to include:</p>
<ul><li>misuse or obfuscation of objective statistics;</li>
  <li>mislabeling or treating Insufficient Data cases as fully solved (when by definition “insufficient” means
    insufficient data to positively solve);</li>
  <li>floating bogus stories of UFO witness mistakes to distract from the real issues;</li>
  <li>flooding case files with poor data + insufficient data + Identified “IFO” cases to drown out and conceal the
    genuine Unexplained UFO cases, etc.</li></ul>
<p>AARO’s methodology for UAP case handling is murky (confusing and inconsistent use of language, undefined terminology,
  etc), making it necessary to piece together hints from across multiple AARO reports, rather than just the latest
  63-page report. No copies of formal AARO Analytic Division UAP case handling procedure and methodology documents have
  been released either; perhaps because there aren’t any.</p>
