<p>It appears that <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> has adopted the old Air Force Project <a
  href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>¬’s strategy of flooding their case files with
  Insufficient Data cases wrongly claimed to be explained. But if there are <b><i>insufficient data to explain</i></b> a
  UFO case or cases, then they are by definition <b><i>unexplained</i></b>. However, as Hynek taught, these don’t rate
  as “officially” Unexplained either, because that requires fully Sufficient Data and must go through IFO screening
  investigation. “Insufficient Data” does not identify an object or its cause, it says there is not enough data to do
  so. This <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> policy of caseload dilution with Insufficient Data reverses its
  predecessor UAP Task Force’s smart approach of selecting higher quality “focused” UAP cases with an emphasis on
  multi-sensor incidents (80 of the initial 144 UAPTF cases or 56%) which yielded only one IFO out of 144.
</p>
<p>And unlike <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>¬, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>
  does not even bother to give a breakdown of the status of the current 1,200 UAP cases on file that <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s new Acting Director Tim Phillips <a
    href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3702219/media-engagement-with-acting-aaro-director-tim-phillips-on-the-historical-recor/">told
    the media about</a> but strangely are not mentioned in <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s Historical
  Report. Perhaps <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> doesn’t want anyone to focus on numbers – specific numbers involving
  the alleged “assessed” UAP identifications instead of vague generalities.</p>
<p>Where are the UAP cases with data so that scientists can independently verify <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s
  conclusions, which is the core of the scientific process?</p>
<p>If the government favors transparency as it claims, why is it that not even redacted UAP case files are being
  released? Why is it that after the Navy Go Fast, FLIR, and Gimbal videos were confirmed to be unclassified other
  videos of precisely the same kind, obtained over US training ranges, are still being withheld? I know this to be the
  case because I’ve seen one of the unreleased videos and raised this issue directly with DoD. I initially got a polite
  reply and an assurance the matter would be reviewed, but months have passed and I’ve heard nothing further.
  Unsurprisingly, nothing further has occurred. And why is it that <a
    href="https://www.cbp.gov/document/foia-record/unidentified-aerial-phenomenon">Customs and Border Patrol official IR
    videos</a> can be released without damage to national security, but not similar DoD videos? I’m confident that with
  over 1,000 new cases there must be others like “Gimbal”, “Flir” and “Go Fast” that have not been released.</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> appears to be the “New <a
  href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>¬,” trying to “get rid” of UAP just like the old Air Force
  Project <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>¬ in its heyday of the 1960s strived to “get
  rid” of UFOs by every trick in the (blue) book <span class="source">Hynek UFO Report, ch. 3</span>. In sum, with great
  irony, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> seems to repeat some of the same methodological errors and
  mistakes that undermined the credibility of the historical UAP investigation it is reporting. These appear to include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>misuse or obfuscation of objective statistics;</li>
  <li>mislabeling or treating Insufficient Data cases as fully solved (when by definition “insufficient” means
    insufficient data to positively solve);</li>
  <li>floating bogus stories of UFO witness mistakes to distract from the real issues;</li>
  <li>flooding case files with poor data + insufficient data + Identified “IFO” cases to drown out and conceal the
    genuine Unexplained UFO cases, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s methodology for UAP case handling is murky (confusing and
  inconsistent use of language, undefined terminology, etc), making it necessary to piece together hints from across
  multiple <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> reports, rather than just the latest 63-page report. No
  copies of formal <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Analytic Division UAP case handling procedure and
  methodology documents have been released either; perhaps because there aren’t any.</p>
