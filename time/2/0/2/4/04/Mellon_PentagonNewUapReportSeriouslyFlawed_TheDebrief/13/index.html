<title>“Insufficient data" does not mean "Identified" – It means insufficient to identify a UAP positively</title>

<p>How often is “insufficient data” actually a result of insufficient investigation? Sweeping investigatory failures
  under the carpet was a routine practice of <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s forerunner, the USAF
  Project <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> of the 1950s-60s. <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>¬’s standard trick as exposed by its own chief
  scientific consultant, Dr. <span class="people" title="Josef Allen Hynek">J. Allen Hynek</span>, was to make it appear
  the Air Force had disposed of 90-95% of its UFO caseload not with actual data, but by flooding its case files with 60%
  or more Insufficient Data cases and casually applying convenient but implausible and unsupported explanations. The Air
  Force has released or leaked to the press bogus UFO “explanations” such as stars that were not visible, moon-as-UFO
  when the moon had not even risen yet, the pilot was “possibly drunk,” etc. <span class="source">See Clark, “Debunking,” UFO Encyclopedia, 2018, pp.
    379-400</span>.</p>
<p>This happened time and time again, often leaving witnesses embarrassed or understandably angry. So much so that in
  one case in <time>1966</time>, Rep. <span class="people">Gerald Ford</span> blasted the Air Force and sought
  Congressional hearings after <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Hillsdale">sightings by police of fast
    high-flying objects in the Dexter, Michigan</a>, area were dismissed by the Air Force as “<a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/meprise/feufollet">swamp gas</a>.” A mismatch between proffered Air Force
  explanations and the data submitted by witnesses was a recurring issue.</p>
<p>It appears that some 60% of <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>’s cases were in reality
  Insufficient Data (not just <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a>’s understated 20%
  category labeled “Insufficient Data”) – because there was simply not enough info to go beyond guessing at “possible”
  or “probable” explanations to achieve certainty. The remaining 40% of Sufficient Data cases broke down into
  approximately 10%—30%, identified—unidentified. The unidentified were therefore a surprising 70-75% Unexplained
  Unknowns in the total Sufficient Data cases (30/40 = 75%, all numbers here are rounded).</p>
<p>As indicated above, <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> went further and tried to
  conceal this statistical shell game by carving out a much smaller 20% category they called “Insufficient Data” – a
  misdirect that obscured the fact that <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> did not <b><em>sufficiently
    investigate</em></b> the other 40% of the total cases and that the total Insufficient Data should have been stated
  as about 60%. These Possible/Probables were treated as fully explained IFOs instead of as Insufficient-Data <span
    class="source">See Hynek UFO Report, 1977, p. 259, etc.</span>.</p>
