<title>“Insufficient data" does not mean "Identified" – It means insufficient to identify a UAP positively</title>

<p>How often is “insufficient data” actually a result of insufficient investigation? Sweeping investigatory failures
  under the carpet was a routine practice of AARO’s forerunner, the USAF Project Blue Book of the 1950s-60s. Blue Book’s
  standard trick as exposed by its own chief scientific consultant, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, was to make it appear the Air
  Force had disposed of 90-95% of its UFO caseload not with actual data, but by flooding its case files with 60% or more
  Insufficient Data cases and casually applying convenient but implausible and unsupported explanations. The Air Force
  has released or leaked to the press bogus UFO “explanations” such as stars that were not visible, moon-as-UFO when the
  moon had not even risen yet, the pilot was “possibly drunk,” etc (See Clark, “Debunking,” UFO Encyclopedia, 2018, pp.
  379-400).</p>
<p>This happened time and time again, often leaving witnesses embarrassed or understandably angry. So much so that in
  one case in 1966, Rep. Gerald Ford blasted the Air Force and sought Congressional hearings after sightings by police
  of fast high-flying objects in the Dexter, Michigan, area were dismissed by the Air Force as “swamp gas.” A mismatch
  between proffered Air Force explanations and the data submitted by witnesses was a recurring issue.</p>
<p>It appears that some 60% of Blue Book’s cases were in reality Insufficient Data (not just Blue Book’s understated 20%
  category labeled “Insufficient Data”) – because there was simply not enough info to go beyond guessing at “possible”
  or “probable” explanations to achieve certainty. The remaining 40% of Sufficient Data cases broke down into
  approximately 10%—30%, identified—unidentified. The unidentified were therefore a surprising 70-75% Unexplained
  Unknowns in the total Sufficient Data cases (30/40 = 75%, all numbers here are rounded).</p>
<p>As indicated above, Blue Book went further and tried to conceal this statistical shell game by carving out a much
  smaller 20% category they called “Insufficient Data” – a misdirect that obscured the fact that Blue Book did not
  sufficiently investigate the other 40% of the total cases and that the total Insufficient Data should have been stated
  as about 60%. These Possible/Probables were treated as fully explained IFOs instead of as Insufficient-Data. (See
  Hynek UFO Report, 1977, p. 259, etc.)</p>
