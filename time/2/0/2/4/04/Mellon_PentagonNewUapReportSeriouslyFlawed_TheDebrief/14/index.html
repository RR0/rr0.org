<p>AARO tries to brush aside sensor tracking of UAP on the flimsy grounds of sensor “aberrations” and “artifacts” (AAROR
  p. 12; media reports call them “glitches”; previous AARO reports call them sensor “errors”). This is untenable if
  multiple sensors track the same UAP, like infrared and radar such as in the ATFLIR sensor pod videos by the Navy
  F/A-18s that most everyone concerned with the UAP issue has seen by now (probably at least 50 million video views to
  date).</p>

<p>In fact, AARO seems to ignore its own data showing they have reduced the problem of “Ambiguous Sensor Contact” with
  UAP in its caseload from 23% to 9% from April to November 2023 – it’s on AARO’s website but not mentioned in AARO’s
  report. (The earlier AARO annual report did show a 5% Ambiguous Sensor Contact figure as of Aug. 2022 based mostly on
  the Navy UAP Task Force’s work, before the April 2023 worsening increase under AARO to 23%.)</p>
<p>That 9% “Ambiguous Sensor Contact” figure means the other 91% of AARO’s current case files of sensor trackings of UAP
  are good data and are not “ambiguous.” This would appear to undermine attempts at downplaying or dismissing sensor
  trackings of UAP as must be due to some sort of speculative sensor “artifacts.” Cases involving multiple sensors can
  overcome sensor error so that any sensor that has an error is corrected by the other sensors that do not. Sensors
  operating at different frequencies on different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum will not all be fooled by
  electronic spoofing at the same time.</p>
<p>AARO withholds its multiple-sensor case numbers – unlike its predecessor UAP Task Force that reported it had 56% of
  all cases as multiple-sensor cases including two or more sensors tracking the same UAP at the same time by “radar,
  infrared, electro-optical, weapon seekers, and visual observation” (UAPTF June 2021, pp. 3-4). No wonder UAPTF had
  99.3% Unexplained cases – good data and no terrestrial explanations.</p>
<p>AARO then complains about the lack of data regarding “speed, altitude, and size of reported UAP” (AAROR, p. 27), even
  though many of its cases have measurement data from multiple sensors (e.g., radar-infrared-optical F/A-18 cases). The
  complaint harkens back to Air Force Project Blue Book’s similarly unsupported complaint over the alleged lack of
  measured “speed, altitude, size” data on UFOs (The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, the ex-Blue Book Chief
  Ruppelt’s 1956 book, pp. 116-7, 149, 201, 212, 224, etc.). Meanwhile, Blue Book buried any mention of tracking data
  resident in Blue Book files from missile tracking cameras, radar-visual cases, and from an Army UAP tracking network
  specially set up around the top secret “Site B” nuclear weapons stockpile depot at Killeen Base, Camp Hood, Texas (see
  section, below, with sample chart illustrating some of the Army UAP tracking).</p>
<p>In AARO’s boasted “thorough” and “complete” reporting of past UAP investigations (AAROR p. 12), there is no mention
  of the existence of the AF’s special AF-Army-Navy/Marine multiple-sensor UFO tracking networks set up at multiple
  sites in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War in 1968-70. Declassified military histories reveal over 500 “UFO”
  trackings on radar, optical, laser-ranging, nightscope, telescope, and infrared sensor systems, with 99% Unexplained
  (Declassified military histories: “Sensor Networks to Track UFOs in the Vietnam War,” UFO Encyclopedia, 2018, pp.
  1050-1054).</p>
<p>AARO’s highly selective treatment of the Condon Report also from the AF’s UFO contract study at the University of
  Colorado, managed to studiously avoid the widely reported criticism that the Condon Report’s negative conclusions were
  contradicted by the embarrassing unmentioned fact that 34% of its own UAP cases remained Unexplained after
  investigation – as numerous scientists have pointed out in criticism of the Condon Report’s anti-UFO conclusions.
  (Someone in effect slipped up and put an easy list of the “Sightings, Unexplained” in the back Index of the published
  Condon Report, in 1969, where about 26 such Unexplained cases are listed, in addition to listing another 4 radar
  cases, 1 airglow photometer case, 3 numbered cases missed, and an uncertain number–about two–of the 14 unexplained
  Prairie Network-confirmed cases not overlapping with the preceding, totaling some 36 out of a grand total of about
  106, or about 34%. Different tallies of the obfuscated Condon Report case numbers come up with slightly different
  numbers. See for example: W. Smith, Journal of UFO Studies, CUFOS, 1996). AARO fails to mention that 14 of the Condon
  study’s Unexplained UFO cases were backed up by photos taken by the astronomical meteor-tracking cameras of the
  Smithsonian’s Prairie Network system, an unprecedented scientific development.</p>
<p>There is also no mention of Dr. Condon’s obvious, non-scientific bias, which may have been the reason he was selected
  by the Air Force to chair the eponymous Commission. In late January 1967, while the Condon Committee’s investigation
  was ongoing, Dr. Condon tipped his hand, telling an audience at a lecture that UFOs are “nonsense” but “I’m not
  supposed to reach that conclusion for another year.” Once again, serious issues well-known to any UAP researcher are
  not included in the AARO report.</p>
<p>Likewise, AARO seems unaware of the new Over the Horizon – Forward Scatter (OTH-FS) radars turned over to NORAD for
  operational duty in March 1968 which immediately began tracking UAP. This was revealed in the House Science &
  Astronautics UFO Symposium hearings on July 29, 1968, and published, but despite being open source history it never
  made it into AARO’s “complete” and “thorough” history (“NORAD” in Clark, UFO Encyclopedia, 2018, p. 811b).</p>
