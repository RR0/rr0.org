<p>L'<a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> tente de mettre de côté la détection par capteurs de PANs on the
  flimsy grounds of sensor “aberrations” and “artifacts” <span
    class="source">AAROR p. 12; media reports call them “glitches”; previous <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> reports call them sensor
  “errors”</span>. This is untenable if multiple sensors track the same UAP, like infrared and radar such as in the
  ATFLIR sensor pod videos by the Navy F/A-18s that most everyone concerned with the UAP issue has seen by now (probably
  at least 50 million video views to date).</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> seems to ignore its own data showing they have reduced the
  problem of “Ambiguous Sensor Contact” with UAP in its caseload from 23% to 9% from <time>2023-04/2023-11</time> – it’s
  on <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s website but not mentioned in <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s report. (The earlier <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>
  annual report did show a 5% Ambiguous Sensor Contact figure as of Aug. 2022 based mostly on the Navy UAP Task Force’s
  work, before the <time>2023-04</time> worsening increase under <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> to
  23%.)</p>
<p>That 9% “Ambiguous Sensor Contact” figure means the other 91% of <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s
  current case files of <b>sensor trackings of UAP are good data</b> and are not “ambiguous.” This would appear to
  undermine attempts at downplaying or dismissing sensor trackings of UAP as must be due to some sort of speculative
  sensor “artifacts.” Cases involving <b><i>multiple sensors</i></b> can overcome sensor error so that any sensor that
  has an error is corrected by the other sensors that do not. Sensors operating at different frequencies on different
  bands of the electromagnetic spectrum will not all be fooled by electronic spoofing at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> withholds its multiple-sensor case numbers – unlike its predecessor
  UAP Task Force that reported it had 56% of all cases as multiple-sensor cases including two or more sensors tracking
  the same UAP at the same time by “<b>radar, infrared, electro-optical, weapon seekers</b>, and visual observation”
  (UAPTF June 2021, pp. 3-4). No wonder UAPTF had 99.3% Unexplained cases – good data and no terrestrial explanations.
</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> then complains about the lack of data regarding “speed, altitude, and
  size of reported UAP” <span class="source">AAROR, p. 27</span>, even though many of its cases have measurement data
  from <b><i>multiple sensors</i></b> (e.g., radar-infrared-optical F/A-18 cases). The complaint harkens back to Air
  Force Project Blue Book’s similarly unsupported complaint over the alleged lack of measured “speed, altitude, size”
  data on UFOs <span class="source">The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, the ex-Blue Book Chief Ruppelt’s 1956 book, pp. 116-7, 149,
  201, 212, 224, etc</span>. Meanwhile, Blue Book buried any mention of tracking data resident in Blue Book files from
  missile tracking cameras, radar-visual cases, and from an Army UAP tracking network specially set up around the top
  secret “Site B” nuclear weapons stockpile depot at Killeen Base, Camp Hood, Texas (see section, below, with sample
  chart illustrating some of the Army UAP tracking).</p>
<p>In <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s boasted “thorough” and “complete” reporting of past UAP
  investigations (<a href="../../../02/HistoricalRecordReport-vol1_AARO">AAROR</a> p. 12), there is no mention of the
  existence of the AF’s special AF-Army-Navy/Marine multiple-sensor UFO tracking networks set up at multiple sites in
  South Vietnam during the Vietnam War in <time>1968/1970</time>. Declassified military histories reveal over <b>500
    “UFO” trackings on radar, optical, laser-ranging, nightscope, telescope, and infrared</b> sensor systems, with 99%
  Unexplained <span class="source">Declassified military histories: “Sensor Networks to Track UFOs in the Vietnam War,” UFO
    Encyclopedia, 2018, pp. 1050-1054</span>.</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s highly selective treatment of the <a
  href="/time/1/9/6/8/CondonReport">Condon Report</a> also from the AF’s UFO contract study at the University of
  Colorado, managed to studiously avoid the widely reported criticism that the <a href="/time/1/9/6/8/CondonReport">Condon
    Report</a>’s negative conclusions were contradicted by the embarrassing unmentioned fact that 34% of its own UAP
  cases remained Unexplained after investigation – as numerous scientists have pointed out in criticism of the Condon
  Report’s anti-UFO conclusions. (Someone in effect slipped up and put an easy list of the “Sightings, Unexplained” in
  the back Index of the published <a href="/time/1/9/6/8/CondonReport">Condon Report</a>, in <time>1969</time>, where
  about 26 such Unexplained cases are listed, in addition to listing another 4 radar cases, 1 airglow photometer case, 3
  numbered cases missed, and an uncertain number–about two–of the 14 unexplained Prairie Network-confirmed cases not
  overlapping with the preceding, totaling some 36 out of a grand total of about 106, or about 34%. Different tallies of
  the obfuscated <a href="/time/1/9/6/8/CondonReport">Condon Report</a> case numbers come up with slightly different
  numbers. See for example: <span class="source">W. Smith, Journal of UFO Studies, CUFOS, 1996</span>). <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> fails to mention that 14 of the <span class="people"
    title="Edward U. Condon">Condon</span> study’s Unexplained UFO cases were backed up by photos taken by the
  astronomical meteor-tracking cameras of the Smithsonian’s Prairie Network system, an unprecedented scientific
  development.</p>
<p>There is also no mention of Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span>’s obvious, non-scientific bias, which may have
  been the reason he was selected by the Air Force to chair the eponymous Commission. In late <time>1967-01</time>,
  while the Condon Committee’s investigation was ongoing, Dr. <span class="people">Condon</span> tipped his hand,
  telling an audience at a lecture that UFOs are “nonsense” but <q>I’m not supposed to reach that conclusion for another
    year.</q> Once again, serious issues well-known to any UAP researcher are not included in the <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> report.</p>
<p>Likewise, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> seems unaware of the new Over the Horizon – Forward Scatter
  (OTH-FS) radars turned over to NORAD for operational duty in <time>1968-03</time> which immediately began tracking
  UAP. This was revealed in the House Science & Astronautics UFO Symposium hearings on <time>1968-07-29</time>, and
  published, but despite being open source history it never made it into <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s
  “complete” and “thorough” history <span class="source">“NORAD” in Clark, UFO Encyclopedia, 2018, p. 811b</span>.</p>
