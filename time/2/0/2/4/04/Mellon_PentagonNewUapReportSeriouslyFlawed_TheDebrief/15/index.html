<p>No mention is made by AARO that many scientists, including government scientists, astronomers, physicists, and others
  have personally seen UFOs, some obtaining instrument data and photos. AARO never mentions unclassified instrument
  tracking of UAP in the Blue Book files and other Air Force declassified records (AARO can’t claim that released sensor
  data is “classified”).</p>
<p>No mention that 14 Unexplained UFO cases in the hostile Air Force University of Colorado “scientific study of UFOs”
  were photographed and confirmed by the Smithsonian Prairie Network scientific meteor-tracking cameras (another 6
  caught on meteor cameras were IFOs). The Colorado study tried to bury it in its infamous Condon Report, but it’s
  identifiable if one looks at and studies the summary data table with skewed and misleading definitions.</p>
<p>It appears AARO didn’t look. Another scientist UAP instrument detection by airglow scanning photometer is also an
  Unexplained UFO in the Condon Report, which concealed the fact that an embarrassing 34% of its cases ended up
  Unexplained (as mentioned above).</p>
<p>The Air Force set up UAP tracking networks in South Vietnam with multiple sensor systems during the war in 1968-70,
  as revealed in many declassified military histories (mentioned before). But AARO seems ignorant of it.</p>
UAP report
<p>Army UAP Tracking Network Record AARO Missed Finding in the Blue Book Files, March 6-8, 1949 (Site B Nuclear Weapons
  Stockpile, Killeen Base, Camp Hood, Texas). Later cases included triangulations of speed, size, and altitude data on
  UAP.</p>
