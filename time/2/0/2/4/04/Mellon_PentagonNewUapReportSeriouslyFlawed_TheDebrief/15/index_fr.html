<p>L'<a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> ne mentionne nulle part que de nombreux <a
  href="/people/scientifiques.html">scientifiques</a>, dont des government scientists, astronomers, physicists, and
  others have personally seen UFOs, some obtaining instrument data and photos. <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>
  never mentions unclassified instrument tracking of UAP in the <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> files and other Air Force declassified records (<a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> can’t claim that released sensor data is “classified”).</p>
<p>No mention that 14 Unexplained UFO cases in the hostile <a href="/time/1/9/6/8/CondonReport">Air Force University of
  Colorado “scientific study of UFOs”</a> were photographed and confirmed by the Smithsonian Prairie Network scientific
  meteor-tracking cameras (another 6 caught on meteor cameras were IFOs). The Colorado study tried to bury it in its
  infamous <a href="/time/1/9/6/8/CondonReport">Condon Report</a>, but it’s identifiable if one looks at and studies the
  summary data table with skewed and misleading definitions.</p>

  <figcaption>Army UAP Tracking Network Record <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Missed Finding in the <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> Files, March 6-8, 1949 (Site B Nuclear Weapons
    Stockpile, Killeen Base, Camp Hood, Texas). Later cases included triangulations of speed, size, and altitude data on
    UAP.

<p>It appears <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> didn’t look. Another scientist UAP instrument detection by
  airglow scanning photometer is also an Unexplained UFO in the <a href="/time/1/9/6/8/CondonReport">Condon Report</a>,
  which concealed the fact that an embarrassing 34% of its cases ended up Unexplained (as mentioned above).</p>
<p>The Air Force set up UAP tracking networks in South Vietnam with multiple sensor systems during the war in 1968-70,
  as revealed in many declassified military histories (mentioned before). But <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>
  seems ignorant of it.</p>
