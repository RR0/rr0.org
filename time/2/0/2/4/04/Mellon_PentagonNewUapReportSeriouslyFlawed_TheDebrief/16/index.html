<title>Does AARO admit some “non-empirical” evidence of extraterrestrials?</title>

<p>AARO’s two key conclusions, as presented at the top of its report’s Executive Summary, state:</p>
<blockquote><p>AARO found no evidence that any USG investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel
  has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology.</p>
  …
  <p>AARO has found no empirical evidence for claims that the USG and private companies have been reverse-engineering
    extraterrestrial technology.</p>
  (AAROR Exec Summary p. 7, underlining added.)
</blockquote>
<p>If there is not a blanket AARO denial saying “no evidence” of extraterrestrial UAP sightings, but only a more
  limited, qualified denial stating “no empirical evidence” (physical evidence) of reverse-engineering extraterrestrial
  tech, then what non-empirical evidence does AARO have? Empirical means physical evidence and reality of objects and
  events, not human records of such, which records are presumably non-empirical evidence.</p>
<p>Is this an innocent ambiguity or an inadvertent admission that AARO has non-empirical evidence, such as documentary
  records or witness testimony, of reverse-engineering efforts on recovered extraterrestrial technology?</p>
<p>Interestingly, AARO claims to have “conducted approximately 30 interviews” of “approximately 30 people” (pp. 6, 11),
  and quite specifically “As of September 17, 2023, AARO interviewed approximately 30 individuals” who claimed knowledge
  of hidden government extraterrestrial technology and evidence (AAROR, p. 28). Don’t they know exactly how many people
  they interviewed, was it 30 or not?</p>
<p>AARO is quick to stress that “It is important to note that none of the interviewees had firsthand knowledge of these
  programs” (p. 9).</p>
<p>But this seems to be contradicted later when AARO explains that “Priority is given to those interviewees who claimed
  first-hand knowledge… Interviewees relaying second or third-hand knowledge are lower in priority, but AARO has and
  will continue to schedule interviews with them, nonetheless.” (AAROR, p. 28) AARO thus makes it seem they are
  reluctant to “continue to schedule interviews” with “secondhand or thirdhand” witnesses because they are so occupied
  with high-priority firsthand witnesses.</p>
