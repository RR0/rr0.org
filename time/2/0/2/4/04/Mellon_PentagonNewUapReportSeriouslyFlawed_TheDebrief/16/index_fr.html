<p>Les deux conclusions-clés de l'<a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>, telles que presentées en haut de la
  synthèse de son rapport, indiquent :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>L'<b><i><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> n'a trouvé aucune preuve que any USG investigation,
    academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented
    extraterrestrial technology.</i></b>
  </p>
  …
  <p><b><i><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> has found no empirical evidence for claims that the USG and
    private companies have been reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology.</i></b></p>
  (<a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>R Exec Summary p. 7, underlining added.)
</blockquote>
<p>If there is not a blanket <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> denial saying “no evidence” of
  extraterrestrial UAP sightings, but only a more limited, qualified denial stating “no <b><i>empirical</i></b>
  evidence” (physical evidence) of reverse-engineering extraterrestrial tech, then what <b><i>non</i></b>-empirical
  <b><i>evidence</i></b> does <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> have? Empirical means physical evidence and reality of objects and
  events, not human records of such, which records are presumably non-empirical evidence.</p>
<p>Is this an innocent ambiguity or an inadvertent admission that <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> <b>has
  <em>non</em></b>-empirical evidence, such as <b>documentary records or witness testimony</b>, of reverse-engineering
  efforts on recovered extraterrestrial technology?</p>
<p>Interestingly, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> claims to have “conducted approximately 30 interviews”
  of “approximately 30 people” <span class="source">pp. 6, 11</span>, and quite specifically <q>As of
    <time>2023-09-17</time>, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> interviewed approximately 30
    individuals</q> who claimed knowledge of hidden government extraterrestrial technology and evidence <span
    class="source">AAROR, p. 28</span>. Don’t they know exactly how many people they interviewed, was it 30 or not?</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> is quick to stress that <q>It is important to note that <b>none</b>
  of the <b>interviewees</b> had <b>firsthand</b> knowledge of these programs</q> <span class="source">p. 9</span>.</p>
<p>But this seems to be contradicted later when <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> explains that <q><b>Priority</b>
  is given to those interviewees who <b>claimed first-hand</b> knowledge… Interviewees relaying second or third-hand
  knowledge are lower in priority, but <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> has and will continue to schedule
  interviews with them, nonetheless.</q> <span class="source">AAROR, p. 28</span> <a
  href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> thus makes it seem they are reluctant to “continue to schedule
  interviews” with “secondhand or thirdhand” witnesses because they are so occupied with high-priority firsthand
  witnesses.</p>
