<p>AARO also fails to define what evidence is required to establish extraterrestrial intelligence visiting Earth. Would
  multiple sensors tracking an object from high altitude or space that stops and starts with accelerations of >1000 g’s
  be at least a starting definition of evidence for non-human or extraterrestrial intelligence? (See Robert Powell/SCU
  critique of AAROR.) Likewise, AARO complains more broadly that it needs “Sufficient Data” in UAP cases, then never
  explains exactly what is considered “sufficient” (AARO Cons Report Oct 2023, p. 8).</p>
<p>Does it require direct communication with extraterrestrial intelligence to satisfy AARO’s unstated but seemingly
  shifting definition of “evidence” (see below)? What if the ETs simply refuse to communicate; do we just pretend to
  ignore them until they do? Is that a responsible operational defense posture or intelligence collection and analysis
  policy?</p>
<p>What radio signals have been received from UAP in the reports AARO has collected? AARO’s briefing slides to Congress
  and on its website state that it has cases of UAP-transmitted radio signals in the 1-3 and 8-12 GHz frequency bands
  (completely separate and different from UAP radar beams at 1-8 GHz, also listed). This has been briefed to Congress
  and listed in AARO Reporting Trends slides of “Typically-Reported UAP Characteristics” – but is never mentioned in the
  AARO Report.</p>
<p>Are these UAP Radio Signals a communication? What analysis of these signals has been undertaken? Has Congress been
  informed of the findings? The AARO Report also ignores a long history back to 1950 of UAP transmitting radio signals
  and radar beams and even replying to IFF (Identification, Friend or Foe) interrogation signals transmitted to the UAP
  by ground-based US radar stations (see “UFO IFF” and “NORAD National Alert” articles in Clark’s UFO Encyclopedia,
  2018, pp. 814-824, 1155-6).</p>
<p>Does extraterrestrial evidence require beyond-terrestrial technological capabilities (the “extra” in
  “extraterrestrial”)? Does sensor data suffice or must physical samples be obtained? What about AARO’s October 2023
  Consolidated Annual UAP Report which mentions “some cases” of UAP with “high-speed travel and unusual maneuverability”
  (p.2), and “very small percentage” with “high-speed travel and unusual morphologies” (p. 8), none of which are
  mentioned in AARO’s current historical report (unless it’s in the classified version).</p>
<p>The earlier UAP Task Force reported that 15% of its reports were of “unusual UAP movement patterns or flight
  characteristics” including “demonstrating UAP acceleration or a degree of signature management” (the latter meaning
  the UAP’s apparent use of electromagnetic signature reduction as a means of “camouflage” for purposes of lowering
  detectability, effectively a form of stealth) in mid-flight. Taken together, these terms evidently convey, at minimum,
  the UAP’s ability to “remain stationary in winds aloft, move against the wind, maneuver abruptly, or move at
  considerable speed, without discernable means of propulsion” (UAPTF June 2021, p. 5).</p>
<p>In October 2023 the AARO then-director Sean Kirkpatrick told CNN that about 2% to 4% of his cases were “truly
  anomalous” – possibly referring to his just-released report’s reference to “unknown morphologies” (meaning “unknown
  shapes”) and “interesting signatures” not otherwise defined in the report.</p>
UAP report
<p>These are tantalizing and provocative admissions by AARO and its predecessor, but what do they mean in terms of
  meeting AARO’s unspoken requirements for “evidence”?</p>
<p>AARO’s report displays a constant shifting of ill-defined goalposts for what it deems to be “evidence,” etc. First,
  there is plain “evidence” then “empirical evidence,” then there is “convincing evidence” (is “empirical evidence” not
  quite “convincing”?). AARO refers to “verifiable information” as if to contrast it with “empirical evidence” (AAROR,
  p. 35) thus raising the question, is “empirical evidence” not empirically “verifiable information” by itself? And AARO
  speaks of “actionable data” as conveniently undefined and not distinguished from other types of data or “evidence.”
  And beyond that, there are “actionable, researchable data.”</p>
<p>The common denominator in these shifting vague pseudo-definitions of what is required for UAP evidence is that they
  seem intended to ensure genuine anomalies are minimized in favor of prosaic explanations, no matter how
  implausible.</p>
