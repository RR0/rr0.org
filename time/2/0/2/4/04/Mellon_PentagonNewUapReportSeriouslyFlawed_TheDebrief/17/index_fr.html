<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> also fails to define what evidence is required to establish
  extraterrestrial intelligence visiting Earth. Would multiple sensors tracking an object from high altitude or space
  that stops and starts with accelerations of >1000 g’s be at least a starting definition of evidence for non-human or
  extraterrestrial intelligence? <span class="source">See Robert Powell/SCU critique of AAROR.</span> Likewise, <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> complains more broadly that it needs “Sufficient Data” in UAP cases,
  then never explains exactly what is considered “sufficient” <span
    class="source">AARO Cons Report Oct 2023, p. 8</span>.</p>
<p>Does it require direct communication with extraterrestrial intelligence to satisfy <a
  href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s unstated but seemingly shifting definition of “evidence” (see below)?
  What if the ETs simply <b><i>refuse</i></b> to communicate; do we just pretend to ignore them until they do? Is that a
  responsible operational defense posture or intelligence collection and analysis policy?</p>
<p>What <b>radio signals</b> have been received from UAP in the reports <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>
  has collected? <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s briefing slides to Congress and on its website state
  that it has cases of UAP-transmitted radio signals in the 1-3 and 8-12 GHz frequency bands (completely separate and
  different from UAP <b><i>radar</i></b> beams at 1-8 GHz, also listed). This has been briefed to Congress and listed in
  <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Reporting Trends slides of “Typically-Reported UAP Characteristics” –
  but is never mentioned in the <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Report.</p>
<p>Are these UAP Radio Signals a <b>communication</b>? What analysis of these signals has been undertaken? Has Congress
  been informed of the findings? The <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> Report also ignores a long history
  back to 1950 of UAP transmitting radio signals and radar beams and even replying to IFF (Identification, Friend or
  Foe) interrogation signals transmitted to the UAP by ground-based US radar stations <span class="source">see “UFO IFF” and “NORAD National
  Alert” articles in Clark’s UFO Encyclopedia, 2018, pp. 814-824, 1155-6</span>.</p>
<p>Does extraterrestrial evidence require beyond-terrestrial technological capabilities (the “extra” in
  “extraterrestrial”)? Does sensor data suffice or must physical samples be obtained? What about <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s <time>2023-10</time> Consolidated Annual UAP Report which mentions
  “some cases” of UAP with <q><b>high-speed travel and unusual maneuverability</b></q> <span class="source">p.2</span>,
  and <q>very small percentage</q> with <q>high-speed travel and unusual morphologies</q> <span
    class="source">p. 8</span>, none of which are mentioned in <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s current
  historical report (unless it’s in the classified version).</p>
<p>The earlier UAP Task Force reported that 15% of its reports were of <q>unusual UAP movement patterns or flight
  characteristics</q> including <q>demonstrating UAP acceleration or a degree of signature management</q> (the latter
  meaning the UAP’s apparent use of electromagnetic signature reduction as a means of “camouflage” for purposes of
  lowering detectability, effectively a form of stealth) in mid-flight. Taken together, these terms evidently convey, at
  minimum, the UAP’s ability to <q>remain stationary in winds aloft, move against the wind, maneuver abruptly, or move
    at considerable speed, without discernable means of propulsion</q> <span class="source">UAPTF June 2021, p. 5</span>.
</p>
<p>In <time>2023-10</time> the <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> then-director <span class="people">Sean Kirkpatrick</span>
  told CNN that about 2% to 4% of his cases were <q><b>truly anomalous</b></q> – possibly referring to his just-released
  report’s reference to “unknown morphologies” (meaning “unknown shapes”) and “interesting signatures” not otherwise
  defined in the report.

<p>These are tantalizing and provocative admissions by <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> and its
  predecessor, but what do they mean in terms of meeting <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s unspoken
  requirements for “evidence”?</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s report displays a constant shifting of ill-defined goalposts for
  what it deems to be “evidence,” etc. First, there is plain “evidence” then “empirical evidence,” then there is
  “convincing evidence” (is “empirical evidence” not quite “convincing”?). <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> refers to “verifiable information” as if to contrast it with “empirical
  evidence” <span class="source">AAROR, p. 35</span> thus raising the question, is “empirical evidence” not empirically
  “verifiable information” by itself? And <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> speaks of “actionable data” as
  conveniently undefined and not distinguished from other types of data or “evidence.” And beyond that, there are
  “actionable, researchable data.”</p>
<p>The common denominator in these shifting vague pseudo-definitions of what is required for UAP evidence is that they
  seem intended to ensure genuine anomalies are minimized in favor of prosaic explanations, no matter how
  implausible.</p>
