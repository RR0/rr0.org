<title>Nothing by AARO on the Government “stigma” put on the UAP subject; No discussion, no history, despite its
  critical importance</title>

<p>AARO does not even mention the word “stigma” anywhere in this report, except buried in a passing reference to the UAP
  Task Force helping “destigmatize” reporting of UAP though not the subject of UAP (AAROR, p. 24).</p>
<p>This is despite the historical importance of the “stigma” deliberately attached to the UFO subject by the US
  government – principally by the Air Force – that is widely cited by the media and witnesses testifying before
  Congress. The critical importance of stigma and the problems it has created in hampering and crippling UAP research
  and investigation are undeniable.</p>
<p>As AARO’s predecessor UAP Task Force stated in its “Preliminary Report to Congress” submitted in June of 2021 (p.
  4):</p>
<blockquote><p>“Narratives from aviators in the operational community and analysts from the military and IC describe
  disparagement associated with observing UAP, reporting it, or attempting to discuss it with colleagues…. [T]hese
  stigmas have … reputational risk [that] may keep many observers silent, complicating scientific pursuit of the [UAP]
  topic.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The “stigma” attached to the UFO topic as applied by the government appears to have included abuses that AARO was
  legally required to investigate in its Historical Report – but did not. Specifically, the Historical Report was
  required to:</p>
<blockquote><p>“(ii) include a compilation and itemization of the key historical record of the involvement of the
  intelligence community with unidentified anomalous phenomena [UAP], including— …</p>
  <p>“(III) any efforts to obfuscate, manipulate public opinion, hide, or otherwise provide incorrect unclassified or
    classified information about unidentified anomalous phenomena [UAP] or related activities.” [NDAA FY23 Sec.
    6802(j)(1)(B); 50 U.S. Code § 3373(j)(1)(B)]</p></blockquote>
<p>As mentioned above, AARO failed to compile, itemize, and report on US intelligence agency abuses of UAP witnesses and
  others. The one tiny item dismissive of vague public perceptions of the Air Force’s UFO “debunker” abuse (AAROR, p.
  38) does not document its long history as was required by law in NDAA FY23 and 50 U.S. Code § 3373 cited above.</p>
<p>AARO made no effort to compile the history of the Intelligence Community’s efforts to “obfuscate” or “hide” UAP
  information through excessive secrecy, as noted before.</p>
<p>Air Force Intelligence “efforts to … obfuscate [and] manipulate public opinion” on UFOs since the 1950s are primarily
  what caused the harsh stigma attached to the entire UFO subject in society. But this anti-UFO stigma is not
  investigated or historically documented by AARO – or even mentioned – contrary to its legal obligation.</p>
<p>This is despite the public admission by former USAF OSI officer Richard Doty that his official assignments included
  spying on US civilian UAP researchers and breaking into a private home, spreading disinformation about UAP,
  misinforming two US Senators, and spreading fake UFO documents including some so-called “MJ-12” documents that turned
  out to be a hoax (Doty radio interview Feb. 27, 2005; see Rojas, “Open Letter,” posting May 6, 2014, OpenMinds). Much
  more evidence could be cited of similar stigma-inducing covert government actions besides the public debunking and
  shaming of innocent UAP witnesses and civilian investigators (see “Debunking and Debunkery,” Clark, UFO Encyclopedia,
  2018, pp. 379-400).</p>
