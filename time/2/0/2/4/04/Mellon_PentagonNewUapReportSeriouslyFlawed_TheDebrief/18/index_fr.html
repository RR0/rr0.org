  historique, malgré son importance capitale</title>

<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> does not even mention the word “stigma” anywhere in this report,
  except buried in a passing reference to the UAP Task Force helping “destigmatize” reporting of UAP though not the
  subject of UAP <span class="source">AAROR, p. 24</span>.</p>
<p>This is despite the historical importance of the “stigma” deliberately attached to the UFO subject by the US
  government – principally by the Air Force – that is widely cited by the media and witnesses testifying before
  Congress. The critical importance of stigma and the problems it has created in hampering and crippling UAP research
  and investigation are undeniable.</p>
<p>As <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s predecessor UAP Task Force stated in its “Preliminary Report to
  Congress” submitted in <time>2021-06</time> (p. 4):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Narratives from aviators in the operational community and analysts from the military and IC describe <b>disparagement</b>
    associated with observing UAP, reporting it, or attempting to discuss it with colleagues…. [T]hese <b>stigmas</b>
    have … reputational risk [that] may <b>keep many observers silent, complicating scientific pursuit</b> of the [UAP]
    topic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “stigma” attached to the UFO topic as applied by the government appears to have included abuses that <a
  href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> was legally required to investigate in its Historical Report – but did
  not. Specifically, the Historical Report was required to:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(ii) include a compilation and itemization of the key historical record of the <b>involvement of the intelligence
    community</b> with unidentified anomalous phenomena [UAP], including— …</p>
  <p>(III) <b>any efforts to obfuscate, manipulate public opinion, hide, or otherwise provide incorrect unclassified or
    classified information</b> about unidentified anomalous phenomena [UAP] or related activities <span class="source">NDAA FY23 Sec.
    6802(j)(1)(B); 50 U.S. Code § 3373(j)(1)(B)]</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned above, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> failed to compile, itemize, and report on US
  intelligence agency abuses of UAP witnesses and others. The one tiny item dismissive of vague public perceptions of
  the Air Force’s UFO “debunker” abuse (<a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>R, p. 38) does not document its
  long history as was required by law in NDAA FY23 and 50 U.S. Code § 3373 cited above.</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> made no effort to compile the history of the Intelligence Community’s
  efforts to “obfuscate” or “hide” UAP information through excessive secrecy, as noted before.</p>
<p>Air Force Intelligence “efforts to … obfuscate [and] manipulate public opinion” on UFOs since the 1950s are primarily
  what caused the harsh <b><i>stigma</i></b> attached to the entire UFO subject in society. But this anti-UFO stigma is
  not investigated or historically documented by <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> – or even mentioned –
  contrary to its legal obligation.</p>
<p>This is despite the public admission by former USAF OSI officer <span class="people" title="Richard C. Doty">Richard
  Doty</span> that his official assignments included spying on US civilian UAP researchers and breaking into a private
  home, spreading disinformation about UAP, misinforming two US Senators, and spreading fake UFO documents including
  some so-called <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/MJDocs">“MJ-12” documents</a> that turned out to be a hoax
  <span class="source">Doty radio interview Feb. 27, 2005; see Rojas, “<a
    href="https://openminds.tv/open-letter-u-s-air-force-allegations-ufo-disinformation/27071">Open Letter</a>,” posting
  May 6, 2014, OpenMinds</span>. Much more evidence could be cited of similar stigma-inducing covert government actions
  besides the public debunking and shaming of innocent UAP witnesses and civilian investigators <span class="source">see “Debunking and
  Debunkery,” Clark, UFO Encyclopedia, 2018, pp. 379-400</span>.</p>
