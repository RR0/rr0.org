<p>The AARO report states that it asked DoD and IC organizations to review their files for any NDAs related to UAP and
  none were reported (AAROR, pp. 7, 30). Had AARO actually reviewed AFOSI NDAs themselves, rather than delegating the
  task, they might have reached a different conclusion.</p>
<p>For example, I was informed by a former member of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Investigation Program (AATIP /
  AAWSAP) that when he requested the opportunity to interview the two F-16 pilots involved in the famous Stephenville,
  TX, 2008 UAP case, both pilots replied that they could not discuss the matter because they had signed USAF NDAs. It
  ought to be possible to run this to the ground either by contacting the pilots or searching AFOSI records.</p>
<p>In another instance, a former USAF Air Traffic controller told me she and her colleagues signed OSI NDAs after
  reporting a black triangular UAP hovering over a nuclear weapons storage facility at Barksdale AFB. Subsequently,
  AFOSI officers asked them to sign NDAs, explaining that they had seen a highly classified US weapons system they were
  not cleared for (the secret weapons program ruse again). The witnesses assumed that was a cover story, as they could
  not imagine a test aircraft being sent to hover over a nuclear weapons storage facility, but they felt compelled to
  sign the NDAs for fear of retaliation if they did not. This case also suggests that in searching for pertinent USAF
  NDAs, it may be necessary to review NDAs of the type alleging uncleared military personnel had been exposed to US
  advanced technology programs outside their clearance level or access authorization and not merely search for some sort
  of “UAP NDA.”</p>
<p>In the Bentwaters, Rendlesham Forest, UK, case in December 1980-January 1981, there are indications that secondary
  witnesses and civilian investigators were pressured to sign secrecy agreements (see Col. Charles Halt’s 2016 book, pp,
  400, 439).</p>
