<p>The <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> report states that it asked DoD and IC organizations to review
  their files for any NDAs related to UAP and none were reported <span class="source">AAROR, pp. 7, 30</span>. Had <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> actually reviewed AFOSI NDAs themselves, rather than delegating the
  task, they might have reached a different conclusion.</p>
<p>For example, I was informed by a former member of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Investigation Program (<a
  href="/org/us/dod/dia/projet/aatip">AATIP</a> / <a href="/org/us/dod/dia/dwo/projet/aawsa/index.html">AAWSA</a>P) that
  when he requested the opportunity to interview the two F-16 pilots involved in the famous <a
    href="https://www.explorescu.org/post/stephenville-lights-a-comprehensive-radar-and-witness-report-study">Stephenville,
    TX, 2008 UAP case</a>, both pilots replied that they could not discuss the matter because they had signed USAF NDAs.
  It ought to be possible to run this to the ground either by contacting the pilots or searching <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/AFOSI.html">AFOSI</a> records.</p>
<p>In another instance, a former USAF Air Traffic controller told me she and her colleagues signed OSI NDAs after
  reporting a black triangular UAP hovering over a nuclear weapons storage facility at Barksdale AFB. Subsequently, <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/AFOSI.html">AFOSI</a> officers asked them to sign NDAs, explaining that they had seen a highly
  classified US weapons system they were not cleared for (the secret weapons program ruse again). The witnesses assumed
  that was a cover story, as they could not imagine a test aircraft being sent to hover over a nuclear weapons storage
  facility, but they felt compelled to sign the NDAs for fear of retaliation if they did not. This case also suggests
  that in searching for pertinent USAF NDAs, it may be necessary to review NDAs of the type alleging uncleared military
  personnel had been exposed to US advanced technology programs outside their clearance level or access authorization
  and not merely search for some sort of “UAP NDA.”</p>
<p>In the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/Bentwaters">Bentwaters, Rendlesham Forest, UK, case</a> in <time>1980-12/1981-01</time>,
  there are indications that secondary witnesses and civilian investigators were pressured to sign secrecy agreements
  <span class="source">see Col. Charles Halt’s 2016 book, pp, 400, 439</span>.</p>
