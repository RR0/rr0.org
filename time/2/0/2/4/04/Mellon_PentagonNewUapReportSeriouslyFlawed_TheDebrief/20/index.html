<p>Why is AARO, a component of the Intelligence Community and the Department of Defense (DoD), suddenly changing the
  rules of the game and importing purely academic, scientific standards for the interpretation of intelligence data? Is
  it because this allows the government to ignore important and valid but inconvenient information?</p>
<p>AARO claims its “methodology applies both the scientific method and intelligence analysis tradecraft” (AAROR, p. 6).
  But it seems the scientific methodology is set off against the intelligence methodology to discredit any observation
  of UAP that exceeds present-day scientific understanding, on the tacit grounds that observations by military personnel
  on this issue, and seemingly this issue alone, are not credible. Meanwhile, the intelligence tradecraft that would
  investigate a foreign adversary’s possible futuristic development of science seems to be shunted aside. Thus AARO uses
  a limited academic form of today’s science to deny as “not credible” the observed and measured UAP performance that
  may represent an advanced technology, possibly extraterrestrial, although we know 21st century science will inevitably
  be followed by a 31st century science. Neither the law enforcement nor intelligence communities have the luxury of
  limiting themselves to dismissing human reporting in favor of purely scientific standards of evidence.</p>
<p>It sometimes feels as though AARO is approaching the old unscientific Air Force Project Blue Book policy, long ago
  exposed by Blue Book scientific consultant Dr. Hynek, of declaring “It Can’t Be: Therefore it Isn’t” when dealing with
  tough unexplainable UFO cases (The Hynek UFO Report, 1977, ch. 3).</p>
<p>Hence, AARO’s Dr. Kirkpatrick claims there is no “credible” information of craft demonstrating capabilities that defy
  our current scientific understanding: “AARO has found no credible evidence thus far of extraterrestrial activity,
  off-world technology, or objects that defy the known laws of physics” (DoD News Briefing, Apr. 19, 2023). This,
  despite the testimony of Navy squadron Cmdr. Dave Fravor and his colleagues were involved in the Nimitz incident,
  backed by dramatic radar-infrared-electro-optical data recordings. AARO does not even mention the Nimitz case or its
  investigation anywhere in its “complete”, “thorough”, and “accurate” Historical UAP Report.</p>
<p>Cmdr. Fravor and his wingman and their crew all saw and reported the same wingless white “Tic Tac” shaped craft in
  conditions of ideal visibility and their accounts of its mind-boggling capabilities were corroborated by radar
  operators serving on two different platforms</p>
<p>Later that day another F/A-18 witnessed and filmed the UAP, yet it seems as if AARO is denying this undeniable event,
  suggesting it did not even happen just because it exceeds today’s academic scientific understanding. Multiple accounts
  by all three pilots and their weapons systems operators, and multiple radar operators and technicians agree that craft
  they observed demonstrated almost-instantaneous high g acceleration; achieved hypersonic speed without a sonic boom;
  showed no evidence of friction or plasma or obvious propulsion, despite the extreme velocities it achieved (estimated
  peak 90,000 mph in 12 miles going from 0 to 90,000 mph to 0, all in 0.78 seconds, at 5,000 g’s acceleration). The
  estimated 47-foot wingless white “Tic Tac” shaped craft also thus seemed to survive g forces far greater than any
  aircraft, rocket, or missile of that size built by man. The tough Navy squadron commander of the Black Aces could not
  find a terrestrial explanation for what he and his colleagues observed and he has made that clear in sworn testimony
  to Congress. Is this not relevant?</p>
<p>What aspect of this case should be thrown out as “not credible” and why? Why are we even bothering to ask pilots to
  report UAP if we do not deem them credible? Why is this case not viewed as compelling, albeit not absolutely
  conclusive, evidence of the presence in Earth’s atmosphere of vehicles that are so far advanced we cannot understand
  or replicate their performance? What evidence would AARO accept – and is AARO going to employ an unspoken rule of
  today’s academic science that does not see a science of tomorrow, and therefore arbitrarily says it must not have
  happened, because we don’t understand what was reported?</p>
<p>Aside from not liking the implications, is there any reason to doubt the fully consistent account of so many
  accomplished aviators and sailors operating with high-tech sensors? Our military could not function as effectively as
  it does if its personnel were not competent and reliable. When assessing the UAP issue, senior policymakers deserve
  candid views of intelligence and military personnel, not views limited by unrealistically high scientific standards
  imported from Academia. After all, AARO is a joint IC/DoD operation, not a science project.</p>
