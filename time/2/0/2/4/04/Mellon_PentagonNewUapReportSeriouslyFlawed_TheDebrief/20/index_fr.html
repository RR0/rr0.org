<p>Why is <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>, a component of the Intelligence Community and the Department
  of Defense (DoD), suddenly changing the rules of the game and importing purely academic, scientific standards for the
  interpretation of intelligence data? Is it because this allows the government to ignore important and valid but
  inconvenient information?</p>
<p><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> claims its “methodology applies both the scientific method and
  intelligence analysis tradecraft” (<a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>R, p. 6). But it seems the
  scientific methodology is set off against the intelligence methodology to discredit any observation of UAP that
  exceeds present-day scientific understanding, on the tacit grounds that observations by military personnel on this
  issue, and seemingly this issue alone, are not credible. Meanwhile, the intelligence tradecraft that would investigate
  a foreign adversary’s possible futuristic development of science seems to be shunted aside. Thus <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> uses a limited academic form of today’s science to deny as “not
  credible” the observed and measured UAP performance that may represent an advanced technology, possibly
  extraterrestrial, although we know 21st century science will inevitably be followed by a 31st century science. Neither
  the law enforcement nor intelligence communities have the luxury of limiting themselves to dismissing human reporting
  in favor of purely scientific standards of evidence.</p>
<p>It sometimes feels as though <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> is approaching the old unscientific Air
  Force Project <a href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> policy, long ago exposed by <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/amc/atic/projet/bluebook">Blue Book</a> scientific consultant Dr. <span class="people"
    title="Josef Allen Hynek">Hynek</span>, of declaring <q>It Can’t Be: Therefore it Isn’t</q> when dealing with tough
  unexplainable UFO cases <span class="source">The Hynek UFO Report, 1977, ch. 3</span>.</p>
<p>Hence, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s Dr. <span class="people" title="Sean Kirkpatrick">
  Kirkpatrick</span> <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Author/71410/david-vergun/">claims</a> there is no “credible”
  information of craft demonstrating capabilities that defy our current scientific understanding: <q><a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> has found <b>no credible evidence</b> thus far of extraterrestrial
    activity, off-world technology, or <b>objects that defy the known laws of physics</b></q> <span
    class="source"><a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Author/71410/david-vergun/">DoD News Briefing</a>, Apr. 19, 2023</span>.
  This, despite the testimony of Navy squadron Cmdr. <span
    class="people" title="David Fravor">Dave Fravor</span> and his colleagues were involved in the Nimitz incident,
  backed by dramatic radar-infrared-electro-optical data recordings. <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>
  does not even mention the Nimitz case or its investigation anywhere in its “complete”, “thorough”, and “accurate”
  Historical UAP Report.</p>
<p>Cmdr. Fravor and his wingman and their crew all saw and reported the same wingless white “Tic Tac” shaped craft in
  conditions of ideal visibility and their accounts of its mind-boggling capabilities were corroborated by radar
  operators serving on two different platforms</p>
<p>Later that day another F/A-18 witnessed and filmed the UAP, yet it seems as if <a
  href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> is denying this undeniable event, suggesting it did not even happen just
  because it exceeds today’s academic scientific understanding. Multiple accounts by all three pilots and their weapons
  systems operators, and multiple radar operators and technicians agree that craft they observed demonstrated
  almost-instantaneous high g acceleration; achieved hypersonic speed without a sonic boom; showed no evidence of
  friction or plasma or obvious propulsion, despite the extreme velocities it achieved (estimated peak 90,000 mph in 12
  miles going from 0 to 90,000 mph to 0, all in 0.78 seconds, at 5,000 g’s acceleration). The estimated 47-foot wingless
  white “Tic Tac” shaped craft also thus seemed to survive g forces far greater than any aircraft, rocket, or missile of
  that size built by man. The tough Navy squadron commander of the Black Aces could not find a terrestrial explanation
  for what he and his colleagues observed and he has made that clear in sworn testimony to Congress. Is this not
  relevant?</p>
<p>What aspect of this case should be thrown out as “not credible” and why? Why are we even bothering to ask pilots to
  report UAP if we do not deem them credible? Why is this case not viewed as compelling, albeit not absolutely
  conclusive, evidence of the presence in Earth’s atmosphere of vehicles that are so far advanced we cannot understand
  or replicate their performance? What evidence <b><i>would</i></b> <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>
  accept – and is <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> going to employ an unspoken rule of today’s academic
  science that does not see a science of tomorrow, and therefore arbitrarily says it must not have happened, because we
  don’t understand what was reported?</p>
<p>Aside from not liking the implications, is there any reason to doubt the fully consistent account of so many
  accomplished aviators and sailors operating with high-tech sensors? Our military could not function as effectively as
  it does if its personnel were not competent and reliable. When assessing the UAP issue, senior policymakers deserve
  candid views of intelligence and military personnel, not views limited by unrealistically high scientific standards
  imported from Academia. After all, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> is a joint IC/DoD operation, not a
  science project.</p>
