<p>As documented above, AARO has not complied with statutory orders from Congress for a detailed history of UAP
  sightings as recorded in USG’s historical records, instead providing a limited history of flawed US Government
  investigations of UAP.</p>
<p>There was no examination of the impact of “stigma” on the UFO subject, witnesses, and persons interested in it,</p>
aggressively implemented by the Air Force and supported by the AF-instigated CIA Robertson Panel, despite the legal requirement for AARO to document the history of intelligence agency manipulation of public opinion and other abuses.
<p>Yet, as AARO itself acknowledged in its first report to Congress the “stigma” surrounding this topic has been a
  central problem in terms of getting government personnel or scientists to report or study UAP. (AARO Jan. 2023, p. 2)
  To summarize:</p>
<ul><li>The AARO report is beset with basic errors of fact and science (for instance, despite AARO insinuations, Apollo
  moon landings cannot be seen by the naked eye from Earth, Manhattan Project buildings cannot fly in the air as UFOs,
  etc.).</li>
  <li>The report makes unsupported claims about secret government projects causing civilian UAP sightings while ignoring
    the military’s own sightings of UAP that the military knew were not our own.</li>
  <li>AARO never defines what evidence they would accept for extraterrestrial visitation or even UAP existence, to help
    avoid repeating past failures of UAP investigations. It seems AARO’s unstated definition of “evidence” is a fluid
    goalpost.</li>
  <li>There are massive gaps in AARO’s review of important US government documents, records, and programs, and patterns
    of excessive UAP secrecy. The report focuses on prior government UAP investigations without even acknowledging they
    were more of an effort to delegitimize the topic than investigate it.</li>
  <li>The powerful effects of the stigma that resulted are never discussed, despite universal recognition of the primary
    role stigma has played in preventing objective government or scientific UAP research. By failing to do so, this AARO
    report is more likely to reinforce this dangerous and dysfunctional stigma rather than mitigate it.</li></ul>
<p>As skeptic journalist Tyler Rogoway said, and bears repeating (emphasis added): “The gross inaction and the stigma
  surrounding Unexplained Aerial Phenomena as a whole has led to what appears to be the paralyzation of the systems
  designed to protect us and our most critical military technologies, pointing to a massive failure in U.S. military
  intelligence.”</p>
<p>Finally, AARO has unaccountably imported the limited approaches to evidence used in academia that are not an
  appropriate basis for intelligence assessments of national security issues. Why ask pilots to report UAP if we are
  going to then discard these reports because they do not meet some strict but narrow-visioned academic and scientific
  standards? Why is it that the human mind and intellect can contribute to intelligence assessments of any other topic
  but UAP?</p>
<p>What about future scientific developments and the scientifically unpredictable intentions of foreign adversaries? In
  sum, this limited approach to analysis, uniquely applied to the subject of UAP within the Intelligence Community,
  deprives policymakers of judgments based on information that is important, valid and compelling, even if it is not at
  present scientifically conclusive.</p>
<p>I hope this report will help Congress, the press, and the public understand just how far short AARO’s historical UAP
  report is from being “thorough”, “accurate” and “complete.” I also hope AARO will find some of these observations
  helpful in preparing Volume 2. There is no reason this taxpayer-funded organization cannot be more clear, transparent,
  and accurate regarding its UAP analysis and reporting.</p>
<p>Acknowledgments: This article was only possible due to the diligent research and extraordinary contributions of quite
  a few UAP experts and researchers, who shall remain nameless here but who freely contributed their time and expertise.
  Their astute analysis and expertise form the backbone of this article. It took substantial effort on their part, but I
  know they will be satisfied if this helps Congress and the public understand how much work remains to be done to
  create a “complete” and “accurate” history of UAP and the US government.</p>
