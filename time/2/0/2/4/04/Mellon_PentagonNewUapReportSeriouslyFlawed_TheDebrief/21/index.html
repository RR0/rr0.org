<p>Comme documenté ci-avant, l'<a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> n'a pas respecté les ordonnances
  statutaires du Congrès pour fournir un historique détaillé des observations de PANs, tel que répertorié dans les
  archives historiques du gouvernement américain, fournissant au lieu de cela un historique limité d'enquêtes
  gouvernementales américaines erronnées sur les PANs.</p>
<p>There was no examination of the impact of “stigma” on the UFO subject, witnesses, and persons interested in it,</p>
aggressively implemented by the Air Force and supported by the AF-instigated CIA <a
  href="org/us/ic/cia/projet/Robertson">Robertson Panel</a>, despite the legal requirement for
<a
  href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> to document the history of intelligence agency manipulation of public opinion and other abuses.
<p>Yet, as <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> itself acknowledged in its first report to Congress the
  “stigma” surrounding this topic has been a central problem in terms of getting government personnel or scientists to
  report or study UAP <span class="source">AARO Jan. 2023, p. 2</span> To summarize:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> report is beset with basic errors of fact and science (for
    instance, despite <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> insinuations, Apollo moon landings cannot be seen
    by the naked eye from Earth, Manhattan Project buildings cannot fly in the air as UFOs, etc.).</li>
  <li>The report makes unsupported claims about secret government projects causing civilian UAP sightings while ignoring
    the military’s own sightings of UAP that the military knew were not our own.</li>
  <li><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> never defines what evidence they would accept for extraterrestrial
    visitation or even UAP existence, to help avoid repeating past failures of UAP investigations. It seems <a
      href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s unstated definition of “evidence” is a fluid goalpost.</li>
  <li>There are massive gaps in <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s review of important US government
    documents, records, and programs, and patterns of excessive UAP secrecy. The report focuses on prior government UAP
    investigations without even acknowledging they were more of an effort to delegitimize the topic than investigate it.
  </li>
  <li>The powerful effects of the stigma that resulted are never discussed, despite universal recognition of the primary
    role stigma has played in preventing objective government or scientific UAP research. By failing to do so, this <a
      href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> report is more likely to reinforce this dangerous and dysfunctional
    stigma rather than mitigate it.</li></ul>
<p>As skeptic journalist Tyler Rogoway said, and bears repeating (emphasis added): <q>The gross inaction and the <b>stigma</b>
  surrounding Unexplained Aerial Phenomena as a whole has led to what appears to be the paralyzation of the systems
  designed to protect us and our most critical military technologies, pointing to a massive failure in U.S. military
  intelligence.</q></p>
<p>Finally, <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> has unaccountably imported the limited approaches to
  evidence used in academia that are not an appropriate basis for intelligence assessments of national security issues.
  Why ask pilots to report UAP if we are going to then discard these reports because they do not meet some strict but
  narrow-visioned academic and scientific standards? Why is it that the human mind and intellect can contribute to
  intelligence assessments of any other topic but UAP?</p>
<p>What about future scientific developments and the scientifically unpredictable intentions of foreign adversaries? In
  sum, this limited approach to analysis, uniquely applied to the subject of UAP within the Intelligence Community,
  deprives policymakers of judgments based on information that is important, valid and compelling, even if it is not at
  present scientifically conclusive.</p>
<p>I hope this report will help Congress, the press, and the public understand just how far short <a
  href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s historical UAP report is from being “thorough”, “accurate” and
  “complete.” I also hope <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> will find some of these observations helpful
  in preparing Volume 2. There is no reason this taxpayer-funded organization cannot be more clear, transparent, and
  accurate regarding its UAP analysis and reporting.</p>
<p><b>Acknowledgments</b>: This article was only possible due to the diligent research and extraordinary contributions
  of quite a few UAP experts and researchers, who shall remain nameless here but who freely contributed their time and
  expertise. Their astute analysis and expertise form the backbone of this article. It took substantial effort on their
  part, but I know they will be satisfied if this helps Congress and the public understand how much work remains to be
  done to create a “complete” and “accurate” history of UAP and the US government.</p>
