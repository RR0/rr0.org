<p>For centuries, people worldwide have observed aerial phenomena that seemed “anomalous” in some way, some of which
  crucially we today – even with our more advanced technologies and scientific understanding – might still regard as
  extraordinary (Vallée, 2008; Lomas & Case, 2023). During the 20th Century these attracted the label Unidentified
  Flying Object (UFO), and more recently Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), with the latter now expanding even further
  by changing the “A” to simply denote anomalous (given that some UAP are not only airborne, but capable of travelling
  underwater, a capacity which is central to the hypothesis considered here). However, although there have been many
  sightings over the years – with the Mutual UFO Network receiving over 200,000 reports since 1969 (Mellon, 2022) –
  these have generally not been taken seriously by authorities, at least in public. However, there was a dramatic shift
  in 2017, when footage of three US military encounters with UAP was published online, bringing the topic to wider
  attention, not only in the US but across the globe (Cooper et al., 2017). (Although UAP are a worldwide phenomenon
  (Lomas, 2023b)1, the dynamics of this topic are mostly driven by developments in the US, which of all nations has seen
  the most UAP-related activity, both in terms of sightings and the attention paid to them.) The military angle was
  especially significant, as it involves observers who excel in occupations that require the highest skill and training
  in visual perception and processing, and whose testimony is often triangulated with other information sources (e.g.,
  radar). As a result, the Department of Defense (2020) confirmed the footage was genuine, and soon after established a
  UAP Task Force to investigate such incidents, now known as the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).</p>
<p>It has subsequently published three main reports (Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 2021, 2023a,
  2023b), and even though these had a very limited scope (mainly events since 2019 and focusing on US airspace and
  waters), the number of cases under consideration is over 800. At a presentation in May 2023 by Dr Kirkpatrick,
  then-director of AARO (having since left the post), he argued that the majority probably did have conventional
  explanations, and currently remained unidentified only through lack of good data that would allow conclusive
  identification. However, around two to five percent of the 800 – roughly 15-40 – were “possibly really anomalous”
  (cited in Wendling, 2023). To that point, its most recent report noted that “many reports from military witnesses do
  present safety of flight concerns, and there are some cases where reported UAP have potentially exhibited one or more
  concerning performance characteristics such as high-speed travel or unusual maneuverability.” Furthermore, it suggests
  these cannot be attributed to the US (“AARO has de-conflicted these cases with potential US programs”) or other
  nations (“none of these UAP reports have been positively attributed to foreign activities”).</p>
<p>Moreover, many critics suspect that AARO may be deliberately downplaying the topic and concealing or at least
  obfuscating the extraordinary nature of many UAP-related events2. Indeed, if so, this would follow a pattern set by
  its predecessors like Project Blue Book, which overall have served to minimise the significance of UAP and even to
  deny their reality at all. This prerogative was admitted as such by Rear Admiral Hillenkoetter, first Director of the
  CIA, from 1947 to 1950, who is quoted by The New York Times (1960) as saying “Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air
  Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFO’s. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led
  to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense”3. Crucially though, as Hillenkoetter admits, authorities have
  privately long had concerns about UAP, and indeed appear to still do: in August 2023, for instance, General Mark
  Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military “can explain a lot of it [UAP], but there is some
  that’s really kind of weird and unexplainable” (cited in Wolfgang, 2023).</p>
<p>Moreover, in June 2023 explosive “whistleblowing” claims were made publicly by David Grusch – a veteran of the
  National Reconnaissance Office and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency4 – who alleged that the US government and
  private aerospace companies had for decades maintained a secret “crash retrieval” and “reverse engineering” program
  (Kean & Blumenthal, 2023). At the time of writing there is no way to know the validity of his claims. However,
  although they may seem extraordinary, myriad contextual factors mean they cannot be summarily dismissed. For a start,
  it is significant that he has testified to these claims under oath to Congress (i.e., under penalty of perjury),
  including in a televised hearing of the US House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs on
  July 26, 2023, as well as other sessions behind closed-doors. It is also noteworthy that the Intelligence Community
  Inspector General (ICIG) deemed his complaint “credible and urgent.” Likewise, on January 12, 2024, 16 of the 47
  members of the House Oversight Committee (34%) met the ICIG for a secure briefing in relation to Grusch, after which
  many made remarks indicating his allegations may indeed be genuine; Rep. Moskowitz (2024) for example posted on X,
  “Based on what we heard many of Grusch claims have merit!”, while Rep. Burchett (2024) said, “I think everybody left
  there thinking and knowing that Grusch is legit”.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more significantly, other figures with the relevant expertise and security clearances have publicly
  vouched for his claims. For example, Retired Army Colonel Karl Nell – who served alongside Grusch in the UAP Task
  Force – said “His assertion concerning the existence of a terrestrial arms race occurring sub-rosa over the past 80
  years focused on reverse engineering technologies of unknown origin is fundamentally correct” (von Rennenkampff,
  2023). Indeed, at a public talk in May 2024, Nell was even more unequivocal, stating, “So, non-human intelligence
  exists, non-human intelligence has been interacting with humanity. This interaction is not new, and it's been ongoing,
  and unelected people in the government are aware of that” (Sharp, 2024). Asked how confident he was with the
  statement, he responded, “There’s zero doubt.” Similarly, Retired Admiral Tim Gallaudet (2024b), former head of the
  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – the federal agency tasked with monitoring oceanic and atmospheric
  conditions – said in a recent interview: “I am totally convinced that we're experiencing a non-human, higher
  intelligence. I am completely convinced because I know the people who were in the government programs, the Legacy
  programs, that oversaw both the crash retrieval and just the analysis of UAP data. And I'm very confident in these
  people - former intelligence, former DoD - and we are working as a team, behind the scenes, to advance disclosure.”
  Moreover, when asked, “Is there a chance some of that we're seeing is adversarial?,” i.e., involving other nation
  states, Gallaudet (2024c) said, “No, I don't think so. I've been read in to all the threats. I had a high clearance,
  Top Secret - Special Compartmented Information (TS-SCI), and I know that our adversaries don't have technologies like
  these.” Furthermore, in addition to Gallaudet and Nell, numerous other significant figures have gone on public record
  either supporting Grusch’s allegations or making similar claims5. Additionally, a substantial number of other credible
  figures have followed Grusch in making their own whistleblowing complaints behind closed doors, with Shellenberger et
  al. (2023) reporting in September that over the past several months “at least 30 other whistleblowers working for the
  federal government or government contractors have given testimony” to the Office of the ICGC, the Defense Department
  Inspector General, or to Congress, while a further 30-50 have offered similar testimony to AARO.</p>
<p>Moreover, these allegations seem to have been taken seriously by the intelligence, military, and political
  communities. In July 2023, Chuck Schumer, Majority Leader of the Senate, introduced bipartisan proposals for an
  Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act (U.S.C. S.2226, 2023). As reported in The New York Times, this would
  create “a commission with broad authority to declassify government documents about U.F.O.s and extraterrestrial
  matters, in an attempt to force the government to share all that it knows about unidentified phenomena” (Barnes,
  2023). Explaining his motives, Schumer wrote, “The American public has a right to learn about technologies of unknown
  origins, non-human intelligence, and unexplainable phenomena” (Bolton, 2023). Indeed, many political figures seem not
  only convinced that UAP are genuinely extraordinary, but that Grusch’s allegations of a crash retrieval program are
  credible, or at the very least deserve to be taken seriously and investigated genuinely (von Rennenkampff, 2024b)6.
  However, the proposals faced resistance from select House Representatives, and only minimal aspects of the Act were
  passed into law in December 2023 within the National Defense Authorization Act for the fiscal year. Even so, the
  provisions that were retained still contained some striking legislation and language, not least in referring
  explicitly to “non-human intelligence” in relation to UAP7. Moreover, in May Congressman Robert Garcia (2024) filed an
  updated version of the UAP Disclosure Act as “a possible amendment to be considered on the floor of the House of
  Representatives during action on the Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA, H.R. 8070), which is
  expected around mid-June” (Johnson, 2024). Its official description is as follows: "Enacts the remaining pieces of the
  Schumer-Rounds Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act that passed the Senate [in July 2023], but were
  eliminated from the final FY24 NDAA. Creates an Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Records Review Board, with exercise
  of eminent domain over UAP-related material controlled by private persons or entities, modeled on the President John
  F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992."</p>
<p>Evidently, political complications aside, authorities are perplexed and moreover concerned about UAP, which are a
  real empirical mystery that science is surely obligated to investigate, as indeed is already happening in some
  quarters. In that regard, scholars are beginning to formulate hypotheses about what UAP may be, with most attention
  focused on two classes of explanation: a conventional terrestrial origin (e.g., human technology), and more radically,
  an extraterrestrial origin (i.e., advanced civilizations from elsewhere). Indeed, revolutionary as the latter would
  be, recent scholarship does suggest it is plausible (Lomas, 2024). However, such are the strange nature of some UAP
  that people are also contemplating other possibilities. To that point, the linguistic nuance around this topic is
  intriguing, particularly the emphasis on “non-human intelligence” in the proposed Disclosure Act, where it appeared 22
  times and was defined as “any sentient intelligent non-human lifeform regardless of nature or ultimate origin that may
  be presumed responsible for unidentified anomalous phenomena or of which the Federal Government has become aware”
  (p.6). This wording implies the two classes of explanation above are not the only possible ones8.</p>
<p>In fact, key figures have made this very point, including Grusch. Interviewed by Ross Coulthart on News Nation
  (2023), when asked if the government had been “concealing the existence on this planet of alien life,” he pointedly
  clarified, “I would couch it as “non-human intelligence”… [because] I don’t necessarily want to denote origin. I don’t
  think we have all the data to say, “Oh, they’re coming from a certain location.”” Moreover, in another interview,
  Grusch (2023) made some intriguing comments about the NHI involved with the alleged crash retrieval program being
  “actually not that much more advanced than you and I,” saying, “If I was a betting man, some of these NHI, they’re
  similarly as advanced as us but they just made … asymmetric evolution or whatever. They went a different path. Where
  we made nuclear weapons and stuff, they ended up making this civil propulsion kind of equivalent discovery where
  they’re able to do this now.” Thus, seemingly, the nature of UAP and their associated NHI is an open question, and the
  two options above are not the only explanations. As such, there is an emerging debate around other possibilities,
  which can be grouped together under the label “ultraterrestrial” hypotheses. This is a broad category of conjecture
  involving the idea that UAP may represent the activities of NHIs already present in the Earth’s environment in some
  sense, hence ultra-terrestrial, which Puthoff (2022) defines as “sequestered terrestrial cultures… existing alongside
  us in distinct stealth.” In that respect, Puthoff offers a taxonomy of such hypotheses, including “extradimensional,
  crypto-terrestrial, demonic/djinn, proto/ancient human, [and] time-travelers, etc., or some combination or mutation of
  any or all of these” (p. 20001).</p>
<p>Admittedly, these are extraordinary hypotheses that scientists may struggle to seriously consider. Many find an
  extraterrestrial hypothesis for UAP incredible enough, as evidenced by dismissive reactions to Grusch’s allegations by
  outspoken figures such as Neil DeGrasse Tyson (2023). Given that epistemological context, ultraterrestrial hypotheses
  may be a stretch too far for some people. Indeed, many who have broached this possibility themselves seem wary of even
  considering it, being aware how far outside conventional scientific discourse such ideas are. However, it is the
  mission of science to investigate all aspects of physical existence, regardless of the extent to which they push at
  the circumscribing boundaries of our notions of conventional reality. Indeed, such is the deeply strange nature of UAP
  that people seem compelled, even against their own objections, to consider these alternatives. Consider Garry Nolan,
  an immunologist with an endowed chair at Stanford, who has for the past decade been involved in UAP research (Nolan et
  al., 2022). In an interview with Nolan on Spotlight (2022), Coulthart posed a similar question to the one he asked
  Grusch, and received a comparably ambiguous answer: “You believe, on the evidence, that there is a non-human
  intelligence, of advanced technology, on this planet?” Nolan replied: “Advanced capabilities. No, I don’t know whether
  it’s a technology per se, because I’m leaving open the idea that it’s some form of consciousness that is non-material.
  And I know, say to my colleagues out there, this sounds absolutely crazy. But if you’ve seen the things that I’ve
  seen, you would only be able to come to a similar conclusion.” Thus, some data relating to UAP are seemingly so
  extraordinary that people are forced to think “outside the box” and consider possible ultraterrestrial
  explanations.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are many potential hypotheses, especially when one makes fine-grained distinctions between different
  versions of explanations. Consider for example a presentation given by Colonel Karl Nell (2023) – cited above as
  corroborating Grusch’s allegations – at a conference convened in November by the newly-launched Sol foundation (which
  “brings together experts from academia and government to address the philosophical, policy, and scientific problems
  raised by the likely presence on the Earth of UAP”). His presentation included a detailed taxonomy of possible UAP
  explanations, involving 72 different hypotheses organized into 14 categories9. These include 20 that he categorizes as
  “ultraterrestrial” – which he defined as “any sentient lifeform regardless of ultimate origin that has resided on
  Earth or in its environs – under/land, under/sea, aero/space – for significant duration in a semi-permanent (albeit
  covert) status excluding humans from modern day civilization and their known antecedents” – with four of these being
  cryptoterrestrial specifically, as discussed in the conclusion. However, we would argue that his definition of
  ultraterrestrial, and the 20 hypotheses he selects for this, better fit the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis specifically.
  Then, many of his other hypothesis could be construed within an ultraterrestrial hypothesis more broadly, along the
  lines of the more expansive definition offered by Puthoff above.</p>
<p>Within the broad ultraterrestrial category, one theory – or collection of theories, if differentiated in a
  fine-grained way – is the interdimensional hypothesis (of which Nell offers 14 different variations, though he only
  positions some of these as ultraterrestrial). This suggests UAP may involve beings from dimensions that coexist
  alongside the four dimensions of spacetime humans usually perceive (Lomas, 2023a). Indeed, following the briefing on
  Grusch that members of Congress received from the ICIG on January 12, Rep. Luna said, “I think it’s important to
  listen to the specific words that Grusch uses. Grusch never said ‘extraterrestrial’ or ‘alien.’ He said
  ‘inter-dimensional’” (Clifford, 2024). On a similar theme, Ron James – Director of Media Relations for UFO research
  group MUFON – claims he has been informed by intelligence insiders of “a very large contingent” of biblically-minded
  people within the Pentagon who have sought to shut down investigations into UAP based on the fear that these may
  actually involve “demons” coming from “hell” (Moran, 2023b).</p>
<p>Another hypothesis which could – depending on how it is construed – be regarded as ultraterrestrial is
  time-travellers, which is now being given serious consideration, most notably by Masters (2019, 2022, who calls this
  the “extratempestrial” explanation. One might also note that time-traveling NHIs or future humans could also be an
  aspect of the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis (i.e., the two hypotheses may overlap). Consider Puthoff’s claim that there
  could be an “ancient occult group, isolated pre-Diluvial high-tech society… existing alongside us in distinct
  stealth.” Unless this advanced technology had been developed by an early civilization on Earth whose traces have since
  disappeared (which is a remote possibility, as we consider below), or likewise gifted to the group by extraterrestrial
  visitors (which is likewise an explanation that does have some viability; Lomas & Case, 2024), one of the only other
  means by which it could have been acquired would be it being brought back through time by those who benefited from its
  development over preceding eons. Indeed, regarding the time-travel hypothesis generally, Coulthart (2021) said his
  sources in the intelligence community were specifically worrying about this explanation, linking it to concerns that
  future humans may have around our development of nuclear weapons, among other potentially calamitous future events.
  Thus, in the broad class of ultraterrestrial hypotheses, various possibilities are receiving serious consideration.
  Most relevantly here, these include the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis.</p>
