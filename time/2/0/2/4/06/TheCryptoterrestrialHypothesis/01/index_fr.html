<p>For centuries, people worldwide have observed aerial phenomena that seemed “anomalous” in some way, some of which
  crucially we today – even with our more advanced technologies and scientific understanding – might still regard as
  extraordinary <span class="source"><span class="people">Vallée, Jacques</span> (2008). Dimensions: A Casebook of Alien Contact. Anomalist Books.</span>;

  attracted the label <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/UFO.html">Unidentified Flying Object (UFO)</a>, and more recently <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP)</a>, with the latter now expanding even
  further by changing the “A” to simply denote anomalous (given that some UAP are not only airborne, but capable of
  travelling underwater, a capacity which is central to the hypothesis considered here). However, although there have
  been many sightings over the years – with the Mutual UFO Network receiving over 200,000 reports since
  <time>1969</time> <span class="source"><span class="people">Mellon, Chris</span> (2022, September 1). <a

  – these have generally not been taken seriously by authorities, at least in public. However, there was a dramatic
  shift in <time>2017</time>, when footage of three US military encounters with UAP was published online, bringing the
  topic to wider attention, not only in the US but across the globe <span

    class="note">The introduction – and to an extent the article more broadly – focuses mainly on a North American context, for various reasons, including: (a) limiting its scope to a manageable amount; (b) of all world regions, this has had the most UAP activity, both in terms of sightings and attention paid to them; and (c) this is the authors’ own context and area of expertise. However, it should be emphasized that, contrary to some misconceptions, this is a genuinely worldwide phenomenon (Lomas, 2023b). For the US Congressional UAP hearing on 26 July 2023, for example, the journalist George Knapp submitted testimony regarding UAP investigations conducted by the USSR during the Cold War, and stated that during a 10-year period, “thousands” of case files were accumulated, including 45 incidents in which “Russian warplanes engaged with UFOs, chased them, even shot at them” (Eberhart, 2023). Or take Latin America, of which The Washington Post reports that at least four countries – Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, and Peru — have dedicated government programs that for decades have assessed UAP (McCoy, 2023), while others like Brazil similarly have an extensive history of sightings, with Vernet (2023) reporting that its Air Force has investigated 674 events just between 1954 and 2005 (i.e., omitting more recent cases). Even nations like China, which have historically been more secretive on this topic, have admitted tracking the phenomenon, with an article in the South China Morning Post acknowledging that “China military uses AI to track rapidly increasing UFOs” (Chen, 2021). That said, not all countries have approached the issue in identical ways; it appears for example that authorities in Latin America have generally been more open compared to counterparts elsewhere (McCoy, 2023). Nevertheless, there are indications that many trends observed in the US, discussed here, pertain to other countries.</span>,
  the dynamics of this topic are mostly driven by developments in the US, which of all nations has seen the most
  UAP-related activity, both in terms of sightings and the attention paid to them.) The military angle was especially
  significant, as it involves observers who excel in occupations that require the highest skill and training in visual
  perception and processing, and whose testimony is often triangulated with other information sources (e.g., radar). As
  a result, the Department of Defense <span class="source">Department of Defense (2020, April 27). Statement by the Department of Defense on the Release of Historical Navy
    Videos. Department of Defense.</span> confirmed the footage was genuine, and soon after established a UAP Task Force
  to investigate such incidents, now known as the <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">All-domain Anomaly Resolution
    Office (AARO)</a>.</p>
<p>It has subsequently published three main reports <span class="source"><a href="/org/us/ic/DNI.html">Office of the Director of National Intelligence</a>. (2021, June 25). Preliminary
    assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (Unclassified). Office of the Director of National Intelligence.</span>

    National Intelligence.</span>, and even though these had a very limited scope (mainly events since <time>2019</time>
  and focusing on US airspace and waters), the number of cases under consideration is over 800. At a presentation in
  <time>2023-05</time> by Dr <span class="people" title="Sean Kirkpatrick">Kirkpatrick</span>, then-director of <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> (having since left the post), he argued that the majority probably did
  have conventional explanations, and currently remained unidentified only through lack of good data that would allow
  conclusive identification. However, around two to five percent of the 800 – roughly 15-40 – were “possibly really
  anomalous” (cited in Wendling, 2023). To that point, its most recent report noted that “many reports from military
  witnesses do present safety of flight concerns, and there are some cases where reported UAP have potentially exhibited
  one or more concerning performance characteristics such as high-speed travel or unusual maneuverability.” Furthermore,
  it suggests these cannot be attributed to the US (<q><a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> has de-conflicted
    these cases with potential US programs</q>) or other nations (“none of these UAP reports have been positively
  attributed to foreign activities”).</p>
<p>Moreover, many critics suspect that <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> may be deliberately downplaying
  the topic and concealing or at least obfuscating the extraordinary nature of many UAP-related events <span
    class="note">Critics of AARO have accused it of deliberately downplaying the extraordinary nature of some evidence, per comparable
previous investigations. Boswell (2022) reports a source in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence saying, “They're patting themselves on the back that they've resolved over half of them… But we don't give a crap about the ones they've resolved. Yeah, there's balloons up there, and balloons are sometimes mistaken for UAP. But there are s***loads of classified videos that are pretty profound and pretty clear. They don't want to talk about this stuff, because they really, really don't know what the hell they are.” Indeed, AARO, and the Department of Defense (DoD) more generally, were rebuked by the DoD Inspector General (2024) in a critical classified report in August 2023 (of which an unclassified version was released in January 2024). Among the complaints was the charge that “the DoD has not used a coordinated approach to detect, report, collect, analyze, and identify UAP,” and consequently, “lacks assurance that national security and flight safety threats to the United States from UAP have been identified and mitigated.” Going further, in an article in The Hill, von Rennenkampft (2024a) explicitly accuses the Pentagon of lying about specific UAP cases, citing in particular an incident over the Gulf of Mexico in January 2023. In the Congressional UAP hearing, Rep. Matt Gaetz divulged that it had involved four objects that moved in a “very clear formation [with] equidistant” separation,” with these details not only obtained from the pilot but picked up by radar. However, in late April, AARO published a case resolution report that concluded with “moderate” confidence that the UAP observed by a military pilot was a balloon, likely “a large commercial lighting balloon.” As von Rennenkampft argues, this “so-called explanation insults the intelligence of any reader who takes a few moments to review the details of the incident,” and hence “serves as a microcosm of the many absurd and implausible explanations that the government has offered up over the years for countless UFO incidents.”  As such, in the eyes of many critics, AARO has become discredited as a genuine attempt to engage with the issue, instead seeming to serve – as per its predecessors – to downplay and denigrate the topic. In March 2024, for example, AARO (2024) released a Historical Record Report, purporting to cover more than 70 years of US records relating to UAP, and stated that it had “found no evidence that any USG investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology.” In response though, observers were scathing at what they regarded as a yet another official attempt to obfuscate the subject; indeed, Lue Elizondo (2024), former director of a UAP investigative program at the Pentagon, publicly called it “intentionally dishonest, inaccurate, and dangerously misleading.” Moreover, it has been revealed that skepticism and mistrust regarding AARO has led to figures with relevant information (e.g., whistleblowers) refusing to engage with them, with Senator Gillibrand recently divulging that two knowledgeable individuals with whom she has met “refused to meet with” Kirkpatrick or his office, as discussed in a recent article by von Rennenkampft (2024b). Indeed, commenting on this article, Elizondo (2024) said, “I encourage everyone to read this article carefully. It succinctly illustrates the distrust of AARO’s former leadership. I was told some time ago that senior elements in AARO were trying to have Dave [Grusch] prosecuted for going public. And the Pentagon wonders why people don’t trust them? Trust works both ways!”</span>.
  Indeed, if so, this would follow a pattern set by its predecessors like Project Blue Book, which overall have served
  to minimise the significance of UAP and even to deny their reality at all. This prerogative was admitted as such by
  Rear Admiral <span class="people" title="Roscoe Henry Hillenkoetter">Hillenkoetter</span>, first Director of the <a
    href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a>, from <time>1947/1950</time>, who is quoted by <i lang="en">The New York Times</i>
  (1960) as saying <q>Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFO’s. But
    through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense</q>
  <span class="note">Over the decades various investigative efforts have been marshalled by the US to examine UAP, most notably Project Blue Book, which ran from 1952 to 1969. However, as per the admission by Rear Admiral Hillenkoetter quoted in the main text, critics have accused these of attempting to downplay or obscure the topic by minimizing or ignoring the potentially extraordinary nature of some UAP. A 1955 Blue Book report, for example, “prepared by a panel of scientists both in and out of the Air Force,” examined 2199 cases. Of the 213 in the “excellent” category (i.e., the most credible and of the highest quality), while the majority were judged as having prosaic explanations – including astronomical phenomena (52), an aircraft (41), a balloon (25), or other / insufficient information (24) – one third (71) were classified “unknown.” However, despite this large percentage, the overall conclusion was that it was “highly improbable” that the UAP studied “represent observations of technological developments outside the range of present-day scientific knowledge.” Significantly, this attitude of downplaying the topic and overlooking the extraordinary nature of some UAP seems to persist today, pervading the efforts of AARO, as noted in endnote 2.</span>.
  Crucially though, as <span class="people">Hillenkoetter</span> admits, authorities have privately long had concerns
  about UAP, and indeed appear to still do: in <time>2023-08</time>, for instance, General <span class="people">Mark Milley</span>,
  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military <q>can explain a lot of it [UAP], but there is some that’s
    really kind of weird and unexplainable</q> <span class="source">Wolfgang, B. (2023, August 6). <a

    for answers</a>. The Washington Times</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, in <time>2023-06</time> explosive “whistleblowing” claims were made publicly by <span class="people">David Grusch</span>
  – a veteran of the National Reconnaissance Office and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency <span class="note">In terms of understanding the significance of Grusch’s allegations, it is important to appreciate the apparent nature of his role, authority, and security clearances within the institutions in which he has served. In that respect, one such account was provided by an alleged member of the US intelligence community in a detailed post on a private UAP discussion group on Facebook that was shared on X, with the poster’s permission, by a prominent UAP commentator (Murgia, 2024). Without being able to vouch for its veracity, commentators did suggest it is plausible. As such, it is worth including some excerpts from the post here – focusing mainly on aspects that address questions of Grusch’s credibility – since it potentially offers valuable context to the nature of Grusch’s claims.   I'm a former member of the US intelligence community. Here's why I think aliens are real. Let's talk about David Grusch. He's the guy who testified before Congress last year. Once upon a time, David Grusch was a GS-15 (Colonel equivalent) at the National Reconaissance Office (NRO). The NRO is a DOD agency. They basically manage all the US's satellites. Grusch was the intel chief in the NRO's Operations Center. That means he was the top intelligence person in the Operations Center. The
operations center is where they monitor what's actually happening in space with the satellites. In addition, he was also the agency's lead for Special Access Programs (SAP). You might hear of SAPs as being above Top Secret. That's kind of true, kind of not. Point is, you have to have the right clearance and the need to know to get access to any classified information. As NRO's lead for SAPs, he was read into every single SAP that NRO was connected to. NRO is DOD's main space based intelligence agency. He knew everything it was possible to know at NRO. He also coordinated NRO's contribution to the President's Daily Brief. This means, when it comes to intelligence coming from NRO, Grusch knew everything the President knew. He was also NRO's representative to DOD's UAP Task Force for two years. If ANYONE in DOD had access to classified government programs about UAPs and aliens - it was this dude … To me, Grusch has as much credibility in this area as it's possible to have. But don't take MY word for it. When Grusch brought his concerns about the gov't coverup to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (IGIC), they didn't laugh him out of their office. Grusch was able to show the IGIC everything. EVERYTHING. All the true classified evidence for crashed craft, alien bodies, everything. No matter what SAP this information belonged to, the IGIC is cleared to access it. Upon examining all that evidence - and there was MOUNTAINS of it - the IGIC said that Grusch's claims were "credible" and "urgent". He did NOT say that Grusch was correct. In legal terms, this is an indictment not a conviction. This is a little like a judge refusing to throw a case out but insisting that the case has merit. Except it's actually MORE than that. The IGIC doesn't adjudicate these cases. That's not their job. Their job is to say, "Hey, this case has merit, and it should be investigated. This person isn't making this up." For the IGIC to say that this is credible is about the biggest bombshell you and I are likely to see any time soon. This is an incredibly experienced and powerful member of the intelligence community saying, "Yep, this is legit." To add that it's "urgent" means not only that this needs to be investigated, but that it needs to begin immediately… It's PAINFULLY obvious that Grusch is telling the truth. It couldn't possibly BE more obvious. There couldn't BE a more credible witness… I don't know how much or of what kind of evidence you want, but this is about as good as it gets until all this stuff is actually declassified.
</span> – who alleged that the US government and private aerospace companies had for decades maintained a secret “crash
  retrieval” and “reverse engineering” program <span class="source"><span class="people">Kean, Leslie</span> & Blumenthal, R. (2023, June 5). <a

    retrieved craft of non-human origin</a>. The Debrief</span>. At the time of writing there is no way to know the
  validity of his claims. However, although they may seem extraordinary, myriad contextual factors mean they cannot be
  summarily dismissed. For a start, it is significant that he has testified to these claims under oath to Congress
  (i.e., under penalty of perjury), including in a televised hearing of the US House Subcommittee on National Security,
  the Border, and Foreign Affairs on <time>2023-07-26</time>, as well as other sessions behind closed-doors. It is also
  noteworthy that the <abbr title="Intelligence Community Inspector General">ICIG</abbr> deemed his complaint <q>credible
    and urgent</q>. Likewise, on <time>2024-01-12</time>, 16 of the 47 members of the House Oversight Committee (34%)
  met the ICIG for a secure briefing in relation to <span class="people">Grusch</span>, after which many made remarks
  indicating his allegations may indeed be genuine; Rep. <span class="people" title="Jared Moskowitz">Moskowitz</span>

    class="people" title="Tim Burchett">Burchett</span> (2024) said, <q>I think everybody left there thinking and
    knowing that Grusch is legit.</q></p>
<p>Perhaps even more significantly, other figures with the relevant expertise and security clearances have publicly
  vouched for his claims. For example, Retired Army Colonel Karl Nell – who served alongside Grusch in the UAP Task
  Force – said <q>His assertion concerning the existence of a terrestrial arms race occurring sub-rosa over the past 80
    years focused on reverse engineering technologies of unknown origin is fundamentally correct</q> <span

    Atmospheric Administration</a> – the federal agency tasked with monitoring oceanic and atmospheric conditions – said
  in a recent interview: <q>I am totally convinced that we're experiencing a non-human, higher intelligence. I am
    completely convinced because I know the people who were in the government programs, the Legacy programs, that
    oversaw both the crash retrieval and just the analysis of UAP data. And I'm very confident in these people - former
    intelligence, former DoD - and we are working as a team, behind the scenes, to advance disclosure.</q> Moreover,
  when asked, <q>Is there a chance some of that we're seeing is adversarial?</q>, i.e., involving other nation states,

    had a high clearance, Top Secret - Special Compartmented Information (TS-SCI), and I know that our adversaries don't
    have technologies like these.</q> Furthermore, in addition to <span class="people">Gallaudet</span> and <span
    class="people">Nell</span>, numerous other significant figures have gone on public record either supporting Grusch’s
  allegations or making similar claims <span class="note">Besides the prominent people who have corroborated Grusch’s allegations – such as Tim Gallaudet and Karl Nell, as noted in the text – other significant figures have made comparable claims (without necessarily vouching for Grusch specifically). In 2023 James Lacatski, for instance, a rocket scientist and former Defense Intelligence Agency intelligence officer who led a secret US program investigating UAP from 2008-2010 – the Advanced Aerospace System Weapons Application Program – published a book that states “the United States was in possession of a craft of unknown origin” (Lacatski et al., 2023). Curiously, the book was cleared for release by the Pentagon; queried about this by Jeremy Corbell (2023), who asked, “You told us, because you were allowed to tell us, that our government has a UFO in its possession and had been able to access the inside of it, right?”, Lacatski replied, “Yes, I was allowed to tell you.” Another notable revelation was posted on X by Christopher Mellon (2024), former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, who is closely connected to the UAP topic; sharing a screenshot of text communication with someone seemingly involved with UAP crash retrievals, the exchange indicated that a UAP had been recovered from a relatively famous 1953 “UFO crash” near Kingman, Arizona.</span>.
  Additionally, a substantial number of other credible figures have followed Grusch in making their own whistleblowing
  complaints behind closed doors, with Shellenberger et al. <span class="source">Shellenberger, M., Mohar, A., & Smith, P. (2023, September 25). <a

</p>
<p>Moreover, these allegations seem to have been taken seriously by the intelligence, military, and political
  communities. In <time>2023-07</time>, Chuck Schumer, Majority Leader of the Senate, introduced bipartisan proposals
  for an Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act <span class="source">U.S.C. S.2226. (2023). 118th Congress (2023-2024). <a

    senators believe the US secretly recovered UFOs</a>. The Hill</span> <span class="note">In an article titled, “Top senators believe the US secretly recovered UFOs”, von Rennenkampff (2024b) notes that “Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and the late Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) were not alone in their focus on UFOs. The Democratic heavyweights received critical support and encouragement from a bipartisan group of high-profile senators over the years, including former fighter pilot and famed astronaut John Glenn (D-Ohio); Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), who observed a UFO as a  World War II pilot; Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), then-chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense; 2008 GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.); Senate Intelligence Vice Chairman Marco Rubio (R-Fla.); Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.).” The article further outlines political efforts to uncover the details of alleged UAP crash retrieval programs: “In late 2011, for example, the top scientist at the Department of Homeland Security met with Lieberman, then chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Reid to discuss the establishment of an ultra-secret UFO program. As outlined in remarkable detail in newly released documents, the intent of the proposed program was to “gain access to and inventory” UFOs secretly under “investigation in National Laboratories, government organizations and/or contractors.””</span>.
  However, the proposals faced resistance from select House Representatives, and only minimal aspects of the Act were
  passed into law in <time>2023-12</time> within the National Defense Authorization Act for the fiscal year. Even so,
  the provisions that were retained still contained some striking legislation and language, not least in referring
  explicitly to “non-human intelligence” in relation to UAP <span class="note">As noted in the main text, the provisions in the proposed UAP Disclosure Act were significantly weakened when only minimal aspects were passed into law in December 2023 within the National Defense Authorization Act for the fiscal year 2024 (of which it was a proposed amendment). Notably, resistance reportedly came from House Representatives with close ties to the very aerospace companies rumoured to have engaged in UAP reverse engineering efforts, and hence who would be affected by, and moreover motivated to oppose, the
 original legislation <span class="source">Sharp, 2023</span>. As Schumer (2023) himself posted on X, <q>It is an outrage that the House didn't work with us on our UAP proposal for a review board [one of the most consequential aspects of the proposed legislation]. This means declassification of UAP records will be up to the same entities who have blocked and obfuscated their disclosure for decades. We will keep working to change the status quo</q>. Crucially, it seems highly unlikely the Senate Majority Leader would make such public remarks, and especially propose such remarkable legislation, absent highly credible corroborating evidence or testimony. Furthermore, even in its stripped-back state, the NDAA still contains some remarkable UAP-related provisions and language, including requiring federal agencies to release “all records that most un-ambiguously and definitively pertain to unidentified anomalous phenomena, technologies of unknown origin, and non-human intelligence” (HR.2670, Sections 1841-1843; see Johnson, 2023).

<p>Evidently, political complications aside, authorities are perplexed and moreover concerned about UAP, which are a
  real empirical mystery that science is surely obligated to investigate, as indeed is already happening in some
  quarters. In that regard, scholars are beginning to formulate hypotheses about what UAP may be, with most attention
  focused on two classes of explanation: a conventional terrestrial origin (e.g., human technology), and more radically,
  an extraterrestrial origin (i.e., advanced civilizations from elsewhere). Indeed, revolutionary as the latter would
  be, recent scholarship does suggest it is plausible <span class="source">Lomas, T. (2024). The extraterrestrial hypothesis: A case for scientific openness to an interstellar explanation
    for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. Philosophy and Cosmology, 32</span>. However, such are the strange nature of
  some UAP that people are also contemplating other possibilities. To that point, the linguistic nuance around this
  topic is intriguing, particularly the emphasis on “non-human intelligence” in the proposed Disclosure Act, where it
  appeared 22 times and was defined as <q>any sentient intelligent non-human lifeform regardless of nature or ultimate
    origin that may be presumed responsible for unidentified anomalous phenomena or of which the Federal Government has
    become aware</q> (p.6). This wording implies the two classes of explanation above are not the only possible ones
  <span class="note">It may be worth noting that if UAP occupants turn out to be our interdimensional and/or
    extratempestrial human descendants, then using the term “Non-Human Intelligence” (NHI) provides agencies like AARO plausible deniability when claiming there is no evidence of NHI activity, technology, crash-retrieval programs, etc.</span>.
</p>
<p>In fact, key figures have made this very point, including <span class="people">Grusch</span>. Interviewed by <span
  class="people">Ross
  Coulthart</span> on <i lang="en">News Nation</i> <span class="source">News Nation. (2023, June 11). <a
  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdoKJI-vFQY">Coulthart: UFO whistleblower
    wants people to see evidence.</a> News Nation.</span>, when asked if the government had been <q>concealing the
  existence on this planet of alien life,</q> he pointedly clarified, <q>I would couch it as “non-human intelligence</q>…
  [because] <q>I don’t necessarily want to denote origin. I don’t think we have all the data to say, “Oh, they’re coming
    from a certain location.”</q> Moreover, in another interview, <span class="people">Grusch</span> <span
    class="source"><span class="people">Grusch, David</span> (2023, September 10). <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRO5jOa06Qw">UFO whistleblower Dave Grusch tells me everything</a>. American
    Alchemy.</span> made some intriguing comments about the NHI involved with the alleged crash retrieval program being
  <q>actually not that much more advanced than you and I,</q> saying, <q>If I was a betting man, some of these NHI,
    they’re similarly as advanced as us, but they just made … asymmetric evolution or whatever. They went a different
    path. Where we made nuclear weapons and stuff, they ended up making this civil propulsion kind of equivalent
    discovery where they’re able to do this now.</q> Thus, seemingly, the nature of UAP and their associated NHI is an
  open question, and the two options above are not the only explanations. As such, there is an emerging debate around
  other possibilities, which can be grouped together under the label “ultraterrestrial” hypotheses. This is a broad
  category of conjecture involving the idea that UAP may represent the activities of NHIs already present in the Earth’s
  environment in some sense, hence ultra-terrestrial, which <span class="people" title="Hal Puthoff">Puthoff</span>
  (2022) defines as <q>sequestered terrestrial cultures… existing alongside us in distinct stealth.</q> In that respect,
  <span class="people">Puthoff</span> offers a taxonomy of such hypotheses, including <q>extradimensional,
    crypto-terrestrial, demonic/<a href="/croyance/Djinns.html">djinn</a>, proto/ancient human, [and] time-travelers,
    etc., or some combination or mutation of any or all of these</q> (p. 20001).
</p>
<p>Admittedly, these are extraordinary hypotheses that scientists may struggle to seriously consider. Many find an
  extraterrestrial hypothesis for UAP incredible enough, as evidenced by dismissive reactions to Grusch’s allegations by
  outspoken figures such as <span class="people">Neil DeGrasse Tyson</span> <span class="source">Tyson, Neil DeGrasse (2023). <a
    href="https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/1685348601927495680">Sometimes I wonder
    whether alien space vessels...</a> Twitter</span>. Given that epistemological context, ultraterrestrial hypotheses
  may be a stretch too far for some people. Indeed, many who have broached this possibility themselves seem wary of even
  considering it, being aware how far outside conventional scientific discourse such ideas are. However, it is the
  mission of science to investigate all aspects of physical existence, regardless of the extent to which they push at
  the circumscribing boundaries of our notions of conventional reality. Indeed, such is the deeply strange nature of UAP
  that people seem compelled, even against their own objections, to consider these alternatives. Consider Garry Nolan,
  an immunologist with an endowed chair at Stanford, who has for the past decade been involved in UAP research <span
    class="source"><span class="people">Nolan, Garry</span> (2022, March 8). <a

    class="people"
    title="Ross Coulthart">Coulthart</span> & Zabel.</span>, <span class="people">Coulthart</span> posed a similar
  question to the one he asked Grusch, and received a comparably ambiguous answer: <q>You believe, on the evidence, that
    there is a non-human intelligence, of advanced technology, on this planet?</q> <span class="people">Nolan</span>
  replied: <q>Advanced capabilities. No, I don’t know whether it’s a technology per se, because I’m leaving open the
    idea that it’s some form of consciousness that is non-material. And I know, say to my colleagues out there, this
    sounds absolutely crazy. But if you’ve seen the things that I’ve seen, you would only be able to come to a similar
    conclusion.</q> Thus, some data relating to UAP are seemingly so extraordinary that people are forced to think
  “outside the box” and consider possible ultraterrestrial explanations.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are many potential hypotheses, especially when one makes fine-grained distinctions between different
  versions of explanations. Consider for example a presentation given by Colonel <span class="people">Karl Nell</span>
  <span class="source">Nell, Karl (2023, November 18). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1QCFtod6i8">The Schumer Amendment and

  at a conference convened in November by the newly-launched Sol foundation (which “brings together experts from
  academia and government to address the philosophical, policy, and scientific problems raised by the likely presence on
  the Earth of UAP”). His presentation included a detailed taxonomy of possible UAP explanations, involving 72 different
  hypotheses organized into 14 categories <span class="note">Karl Nell’s (2023) classificatory taxonomy has three overarching categories (physical, psychosocial, and meta-physical) with myriad sub-categories, as follows:  1.

</span>. These include 20 that he categorizes as “ultraterrestrial” – which he defined as <q>any sentient lifeform
    regardless of ultimate origin that has resided on Earth or in its environs – under/land, under/sea, aero/space – for
    significant duration in a semi-permanent (albeit covert) status excluding humans from modern day civilization and
    their known antecedents</q> – with four of these being cryptoterrestrial specifically, as discussed in the
  conclusion. However, we would argue that his definition of ultraterrestrial, and the 20 hypotheses he selects for
  this, better fit the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis specifically. Then, many of his other hypothesis could be construed
  within an ultraterrestrial hypothesis more broadly, along the lines of the more expansive definition offered by
  Puthoff above.
</p>
<p>Within the broad ultraterrestrial category, one theory – or collection of theories, if differentiated in a
  fine-grained way – is the interdimensional hypothesis (of which Nell offers 14 different variations, though he only
  positions some of these as ultraterrestrial). This suggests UAP may involve beings from dimensions that coexist
  alongside the four dimensions of spacetime humans usually perceive <span class="source">Lomas, T. (2023). The ultraterrestrial hypothesis: A case for scientific openness to an “interdimensional”
    explanation for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 55(1), 43–98.</span>. Indeed,
  following the briefing on Grusch that members of Congress received from the ICIG on January 12, Rep. Luna said, “I
  think it’s important to listen to the specific words that Grusch uses. <span class="people">Grusch</span> never said
  ‘extraterrestrial’ or ‘alien.’ He said ‘inter-dimensional’” <span class="source">Clifford, J. (2024, January 12). <a

  group MUFON – claims he has been informed by intelligence insiders of <q>a very large contingent</q> of
  biblically-minded people within the Pentagon who have sought to shut down investigations into UAP based on the fear
  that these may actually involve “demons” coming from “hell” <span class="source">Moran, M. (2023b, September 29). <a

<p>Another hypothesis which could – depending on how it is construed – be regarded as ultraterrestrial is
  time-travellers, which is now being given serious consideration, most notably by Masters <span class="source">Masters, M. (2019). Identified Flying Objects: A Multidisciplinary Scientific Approach to the UFO Phenomenon.</span>
  <span class="source">Masters, M. (2022). The Extratempestrial Model. Full Circle Press.</span>, who calls this the
  “extratempestrial” explanation. One might also note that time-traveling NHIs or future humans could also be an aspect
  of the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis (i.e., the two hypotheses may overlap). Consider Puthoff’s claim that there could
  be an <q>ancient occult group, isolated pre-Diluvial high-tech society… existing alongside us in distinct stealth.</q>
  Unless this advanced technology had been developed by an early civilization on Earth whose traces have since
  disappeared (which is a remote possibility, as we consider below), or likewise gifted to the group by extraterrestrial
  visitors (which is likewise an explanation that does have some viability; <span
    class="source">Lomas & Case, 2024</span>, one of the only other means by which it could have been acquired would be
  it being brought back through time by those who benefited from its development over preceding eons. Indeed, regarding
  the time-travel hypothesis generally, Coulthart (2021) said his sources in the intelligence community were
  specifically worrying about this explanation, linking it to concerns that future humans may have around our
  development of nuclear weapons, among other potentially calamitous future events. Thus, in the broad class of
  ultraterrestrial hypotheses, various possibilities are receiving serious consideration. Most relevantly here, these
  include the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis.</p>
