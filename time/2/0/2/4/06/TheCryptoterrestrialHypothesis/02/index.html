<p>In essence, as per all ultraterrestrial hypotheses, the CTH suggests the NHI responsible for UAP may already be
  present in Earth’s environment in some sense, as opposed to having an extraterrestrial explanation. However, rather
  than existing in other “dimensions” (per the interdimensional hypothesis), or other “times” (per the extratempestrial
  hypothesis), they are present in a relatively more conventional sense (i.e., within current standard spacetime
  dimensions) but are nevertheless “hidden” in some way (e.g., living underground). As with other ultraterrestrial
  hypotheses, we should state outright that we consider this unlikely. Crucially though, we do not regard it as
  impossible. Indeed, emerging observations seem to suggest it may well have some validity. It could also help to assign
  some probability weightings. For instance, before the past few years, we personally would have rated the possibility
  of a CTH having some basis in truth as low as 1%. Now, in light of recent data discussed shortly, we would put it at
  around 10%. This still of course means we view the CTH as nine times more unlikely as likely. From the other direction
  though, we also consider it 10 times more likely than we did before, with our “priors” having significantly shifted.
  Thus, not only should the CTH not be summarily ruled out, we argue it should be explicitly given due consideration.
  Epistemologically, the rationale is similar to Nolan’s remark about “leaving open the idea that it’s some form of
  consciousness that is non-material”; even if the CTH also “sounds absolutely crazy,” people are seemingly becoming
  compelled to take it seriously. Indeed, going further, we concur with Puthoff (2022) that a CTH should be actively
  investigated; rather than passively and reactively waiting for relevant data to make itself apparent, he suggests “it
  would behoove us to set aside our tentativeness about any given hypothesis, place it on the table as almost certainly
  true, and “go for it””, doing so “by incorporating elements of a more forensic “gumshoe” style, as in criminalistics
  and intelligence work.”</p>
<p>The starting point for taking the CTH seriously is perplexity over two interrelated empirical mysteries. First, it is
  increasingly apparent that UAP are not only aerial but can also move underwater in ways that – per their airborne
  counterparts – defy explanation. The importance and indeed urgency of paying attention to such phenomena has been
  outlined in a White Paper by Retired Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet (2024a) – cited above as corroborating Grusch’s claims
  – who argues that an extensive body of accounts and data show “Unidentified Submersible Objects” (USOs) acting in ways
  that surpass human technology, and even challenge scientific understanding of what is possible underwater. For
  example, reporting on interviews with Navy Submariners who had “direct or indirect encounters with underwater UAPs,”
  McGregor (2023) summarises the situation by saying, “These objects have been observed to behave in ways that defy our
  current understanding of physics, much like their aerial counterparts. They are said to move at incredible speeds, and
  are capable of sudden and rapid acceleration, deceleration, and direction changes, all without any visible means of
  propulsion or control”10. In one case from 1987 divulged by Knuth (2024), for example, a New Zealand frigate was
  reportedly followed by a USO 150ft wide and 800ft long calculated to have a top speed of 2980 mph (having closed a
  distance of 20km in 30 seconds). Moreover, some UAP seem capable of moving through air and water with comparable ease
  (and perhaps even other mediums/substances, such as rock), with these transmedium capabilities being one reason the
  UAP acronym was expanded from “aerial” to the broader anomalous. Indeed, in an article in The Daily Mail (Waugh, 2024)
  – titled, “Forget UFOs, alien hunters say we should be focusing on Unidentified Submerged Objects (USOs)” – former
  Russian Navy officer turned UAP researcher Vladimir Azhazha is quoted as saying, "Fifty percent of UFO encounters are
  connected with oceans. Fifteen more - with lakes. So, UFOs tend to stick to the water.”</p>
<p>To that point, USOs seem to be of increasing concern to relevant authorities; for example, in May 2024, Rep. Anna
  Paulina Luna, co-chair of the Congressional UAP Caucus, was asked by reporter Matt Laslo (2024) whether she had any
  updates on a planned UAP hearing in the House of Representatives, and replied “We’re working on doing something with
  USO.” Similarly, the proposed UAP Disclosure Act (U.S.C., S. 2226, 2023) would have required authorities to release
  information regarding “damaged or intact ocean-surface and undersea craft associated with unidentified anomalous
  phenomena” (p.8). Thus, there is increasing recognition of an underwater dimension to the phenomenon. As Nolan (2022)
  stated in an interview, when asked if “whatever this is is coming from outside our atmosphere or … from beneath our
  oceans,” he replied “Both,” adding with respect to undersea activity that “sonar images show these things moving at
  speeds a dozen times faster than our fastest submarines.” Although subsurface observations of these craft do not
  necessarily mean they reside underwater, such accounts should be considered in light of the CTH possibility. Moreover,
  some sightings do involve objects that appear to be coming from the water, as opposed to merely moving through it.
  Indeed, arguably the most famous UAP event of recent years – a series of encounters in November 2004 centred on the
  USS Nimitz nuclear aircraft carrier – seemed to involve one such object11. A less well known but perhaps even more
  striking case was divulged by Lue Elizondo (2021a) – a former intelligence officer closely linked to US investigations
  into UAP – involving a military encounter in the Caribbean in which a circular object “about the size of a small
  island” rose up from the deep on two separate occasions12. </p>
<p>The second related empirical mystery is that some UAP sightings involve craft and other phenomena (e.g., “orbs”)
  appearing to enter/exit potential underground access points, like volcanoes. The Popocatepetl volcano in central
  Mexico, for example, is considered a “hotspot” for such observations (Carter, 2023), with numerous such events
  captured on camera in 2023, which some UAP observers suggested was a “smoking gun” regarding NHI activity on Earth
  (Donald, 2023). Various hypotheses have been touted about these observations. In the latter article, one observer is
  quoted as suggesting the volcano functions as an inter-dimensional “portal” (an “intergalactic gateway between two
  locations in space-time”). However, other people speculate that some UAP might not only be drawn to such locales
  (e.g., as a portal, or for purposes such as hiding or gathering energy), but might come from underground (i.e., with
  the NHI responsible residing in a subterranean way). Similarly, there are rumours of underwater bases in areas notable
  for reports of UAP entering/exiting the water, as discussed below. Together, these two empirical mysteries have led
  some to contemplate a CTH. Discussing Grusch’s allegations, Rep. Mike Gallagher (2023) noted that one potential
  explanation for UAP is “an ancient civilization that’s just been hiding here, for all this time, and is suddenly
  showing itself right now,” with numerous seemingly well-informed individuals making similar comments13.</p>
<p>Indeed, the notion of cryptoterrestrials has a long pedigree. For a start, it has often been imagined that mysteries
  may be concealed within the Earth, such as deep caverns, as memorably captured in literature by Jules Verne (1864).
  Then, building on this possibility, people have speculated these realms could potentially host ancient civilizations –
  whether human or some other species – which chose to conceal themselves there. Among the earliest modern proponents of
  this idea is the writer Richard Shaver. According to Ray Palmer (1975), editor of Amazing Stories magazine, Shaver
  argued in a 10,000-word manifesto that advanced prehistoric races had built cities inside Earth but fled to another
  planet due to concerns about radiation damage from the Sun, leaving a cohort of offspring who remained underground.
  Palmer revised the manuscript and published it as “I Remember Lemuria!” in the March 1945 issue of Amazing Stories, a
  tale which became the foundation for a genre of science fiction on this theme. Although many people condemned Shaver’s
  narrative as a “hoax” (Dash, 2000), he and Palmer continued to maintain its veracity. Furthermore, over the years, UAP
  scholars have begun to contemplate similar ideas in relation to the burgeoning UAP observations, most notably John
  Keel (1983), who – without believing Shaver per se – was persuaded of the notion of cryptoterrestrials living
  underground.</p>
<p>Indeed, in an article titled “Secret UFO bases across the U.S.”, Keel (1968) suggested that the idea of such entities
  being responsible for UAP was more reasonable than the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) which was gaining some
  momentum at that time. Given that UAP have “been consistently active in the same areas for many years,” he argues “it
  is quite reasonable to speculate that these objects originate in some unknown manner from these areas, rather than
  traversing great spatial distances to make brief random and apparently pointless “visits.” In short, many of the
  thousands of observed “flying saucers” and “spook lights” are more apt to be a part of the Earth's environment than
  extraterrestrial craft flying in from some distant point” (p.9). In that sense, a CTH avoids issues like the
  difficulties of interstellar travel. Moreover, it would also explain why UAP appear to take a particular interest in
  Earth, and furthermore seem concerned about nuclear weapons (see e.g., Hastings, 2015, Hanks, 2023), since these would
  be a danger to cryptoterrestrials themselves. He further argues this hypothesis is a better fit for people’s purported
  experiences of NHI over the decades (Kelley-Romano, 2006), which most often involve entities with surprisingly similar
  physiognomy to humans, which one might not necessarily expect given the myriad of evolutionary pathways intelligent
  life might take in the cosmos (Sagan, 1978; Tipler, 1980; Vakoch, 2014; Masters, 2019; 2022). However, if NHIs were
  cryptoterrestrial, their species may well be related to Homo sapiens in some way – as discussed below – which would
  more easily account for their resemblance. That said, given the widespread terrestrial evolutionary convergence even
  across distantly related lineages (as in sharks and dolphins, or hedgehogs and echidnas), it is also possible that
  extraterrestrial NHI might well look at least something like Homo sapiens (cf. Conway Morris, 2003, 2015; McGhee,
  2019).</p>
<p>In any case, although the CTH has remained somewhat niche and undertheorized, it has nevertheless been taken
  seriously by some observers. Most notably, these include Mac Tonnies (2011) in his book The Cryptoterrestrials: A
  Meditation on Indigenous Humanoids and the Aliens Among Us, and more recently Kastrup (2024), who as noted above
  called this the “most realistic scenario” for UAP. Similarly, claims relating to the CTH can be found included within
  various UAP-related texts; in his book The NASA Conspiracies, for example, Redfern (2011) includes an interview with
  someone seemingly associated with the Gemini program who claimed there was a small band of individuals who represent
  the last vestiges of an ancient advanced, isolated civilization – responsible for the legends of Atlantis and similar
  stories – forced by circumstances to retreat into remote sequestered locales for survival. Indeed, comparable
  testimony continues to emerge that lends further support to the CTH. An example is the apparent testimony of Dr
  Shirley Wright, Albert Einstein’s assistant in 1947. Speaking in 1993 – in recordings which only became public in 2021
  – Wright claimed she and Einstein had helped investigate the famous Roswell UAP crash (Verma, 2023c). Incredibly, she
  said this was not only a genuine UAP, but that biological entities had survived the crash and were subjected to
  questioning. Most relevantly here, she suggested these were actually “just humans, but an advanced form,” and as Verma
  summarizes it, that many of their “species” actually “reside underground on our planet.” On that point, former CIA
  officer John Ramirez claimed that the authorities conducted biological tests and “were able to sequence something in
  those bodies that look like a genome and from there they checked the human genome and saw the correlations” (Verma,
  2022d).</p>
<p>Given such stories, together with the general strangeness of the UAP topic, there is increasing openness to the CTH,
  as seen above with the comments of Rep. Gallagher. To reiterate, this hypothesis carries a very low probability
  weighting, and even people open to it remain sceptical. However, such scepticism is entirely appropriate, and does not
  negate the point of this paper, namely taking seriously the CTH as a possible explanation for UAP. We are not arguing
  that UAP do have a cryptoterrestrial explanation, but simply that they could, and the judicious approach is to
  consider all valid theories until the evidence decisively demonstrates they should be rejected. We therefore suggest
  scientists should keep an open mind and investigate the CTH as a genuinely viable theory. To that end, we offer
  various speculative strands of thought that could provide a tentative foundation and evidence for such a theory. For
  context, we begin by considering the limits to current historical and geological knowledge.</p>
