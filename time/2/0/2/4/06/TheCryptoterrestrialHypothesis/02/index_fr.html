<p>In essence, as per all ultraterrestrial hypotheses, the CTH suggests the NHI responsible for UAP may already be
  present in Earth’s environment in some sense, as opposed to having an extraterrestrial explanation. However, rather
  than existing in other “dimensions” (per the interdimensional hypothesis), or other “times” (per the extratempestrial
  hypothesis), they are present in a relatively more conventional sense (i.e., within current standard spacetime
  dimensions) but are nevertheless “hidden” in some way (e.g., living underground). As with other ultraterrestrial
  hypotheses, we should state outright that we consider this unlikely. Crucially though, we do not regard it as
  impossible. Indeed, emerging observations seem to suggest it may well have some validity. It could also help to assign
  some probability weightings. For instance, before the past few years, we personally would have rated the possibility
  of a CTH having some basis in truth as low as 1%. Now, in light of recent data discussed shortly, we would put it at
  around 10%. This still of course means we view the CTH as nine times more unlikely as likely. From the other direction
  though, we also consider it 10 times more likely than we did before, with our “priors” having significantly shifted.
  Thus, not only should the CTH not be summarily ruled out, we argue it should be explicitly given due consideration.
  Epistemologically, the rationale is similar to <span class="people" title="Garry Nolan">Nolan</span>’s remark about
  <q>leaving open the idea that it’s some form of consciousness that is non-material</q>; even if the CTH also <q>sounds
    absolutely crazy,</q> people are seemingly becoming compelled to take it seriously. Indeed, going further, we concur
  with <span class="people" title="Hal Puthoff">Puthoff</span> (2022) that a CTH should be actively investigated; rather
  than passively and reactively waiting for relevant data to make itself apparent, he suggests <q>it would behoove us to
    set aside our tentativeness about any given hypothesis, place it on the table as almost certainly true, and “go for
    it”</q>, doing so <q>by incorporating elements of a more forensic “gumshoe” style, as in criminalistics and
    intelligence work.</q></p>
<p>The starting point for taking the CTH seriously is perplexity over two interrelated empirical mysteries. First, it is
  increasingly apparent that UAP are not only aerial but can also move underwater in ways that – per their airborne
  counterparts – defy explanation. The importance and indeed urgency of paying attention to such phenomena has been
  outlined in a White Paper by Retired Rear Admiral <span class="people">Tim Gallaudet</span> <span class="source"><span
    class="people">Gallaudet, Tim</span> (2024a). <a
    href="https://thesolfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sol_WhitePaper_Vol1N1.pdf">Beneath the Surface: We May
    Learn More about UAP by Looking in the Ocean.</a> The White Papers of the Sol Foundation, 1(1), 1–29.</span> – cited
  above as corroborating <span class="people">Grusch</span>’s claims – who argues that an extensive body of accounts and
  data show <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/OANI.html">“Unidentified Submersible Objects” (USOs)</a> acting in ways that
  surpass human technology, and even challenge scientific understanding of what is possible underwater. For example,
  reporting on interviews with Navy Submariners who had <q>direct or indirect encounters with underwater UAPs</q>,
  McGregor (2023) summarises the situation by saying, <q>These objects have been observed to behave in ways that defy
    our current understanding of physics, much like their aerial counterparts. They are said to move at incredible
    speeds, and are capable of sudden and rapid acceleration, deceleration, and direction changes, all without any
    visible means of propulsion or control</q> <span class="note">Regarding the capabilities of underwater UAP, one was even reported as travelling faster than the speed of sound underwater – which at 1500 meters/second is more than four times the speed of sound in air (about 340 meters/second) – and had a close encounter with a nuclear submarine (Verma, 2023e). Moreover, such sightings have a long history. A report in Nature by Pringle (1879), for instance, offers an account by Capt. Evans, Navy
hydrographer, who described seeing “luminous waves or pulsations under the water, moving at great speed and passing under the ship from the south-south-west. On looking towards the East, the appearance was of a revolving wheel … whose spokes were illuminated.” Many similar reports have accumulated over the decades (e.g., Railway and Marine News, 1912).
</span>. In one case from <time>1987</time> divulged by Knuth <span class="source">Knuth, K. (2024, February 12). <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlYwktOj75A">Kevin Knuth on The Physics of UAP.</a> The Sol Foundation.</span>,
  for example, a New Zealand frigate was reportedly followed by a USO 150ft wide and 800ft long calculated to have a top
  speed of 2980 mph (having closed a distance of 20km in 30 seconds). Moreover, some UAP seem capable of moving through
  air and water with comparable ease (and perhaps even other mediums/substances, such as rock), with these transmedium
  capabilities being one reason the UAP acronym was expanded from “aerial” to the broader anomalous. Indeed, in an
  article in The Daily Mail <span class="source">Waugh, R. (2024, March 16). <a
    href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-13191835/Forget-UFOs-alien-hunters-say-focusing-Unidentified-Submerged-Objects-USOs.html">Forget
    UFOs, alien hunters say we should be focusing on Unidentified Submerged Objects (USOs).</a> The Daily Mail.</span> –
  titled, “Forget UFOs, alien hunters say we should be focusing on Unidentified Submerged Objects (USOs)” – former
  Russian Navy officer turned UAP researcher Vladimir Azhazha is quoted as saying, <q>Fifty percent of UFO encounters
    are connected with oceans. Fifteen more - with lakes. So, UFOs tend to stick to the water.</q></p>
<p>To that point, USOs seem to be of increasing concern to relevant authorities; for example, in <time>2024-05</time>,
  Rep. <span class="people">Anna Paulina Luna</span>, co-chair of the Congressional UAP Caucus, was asked by reporter
  <span class="people">Matt Laslo</span> (2024) whether she had any updates on a planned UAP hearing in the House of
  Representatives, and replied <q>We’re working on doing something with USO.</q> Similarly, the proposed UAP Disclosure
  Act <span class="source">U.S.C. S.2226. (2023). 118th Congress (2023-2024). <a
    href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/uap_amendment.pdf">The Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena

  information regarding <q>damaged or intact ocean-surface and undersea craft associated with unidentified anomalous
    phenomena</q> (p.8). Thus, there is increasing recognition of an underwater dimension to the phenomenon. As <span
    class="people">Nolan</span> <span class="source"><span class="people">Nolan, Garry</span> (2022, March 8). <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3sszdf_93w">Dr
    Garry P Nolan UAP UFO Tucker Carlson full interview</a>. Tucker Carlson Today.</span> stated in an interview, when
  asked if <q>whatever this is is coming from outside our atmosphere or … from beneath our oceans,</q> he replied <q>Both,</q>
  adding with respect to undersea activity that <q>sonar images show these things moving at speeds a dozen times faster
    than our fastest submarines.</q> Although subsurface observations of these craft do not necessarily mean they reside
  underwater, such accounts should be considered in light of the CTH possibility. Moreover, some sightings do involve
  objects that appear to be coming from the water, as opposed to merely moving through it. Indeed, arguably the most
  famous UAP event of recent years – a series of encounters in <time>2004-11</time> centred on the USS Nimitz nuclear
  aircraft carrier – seemed to involve one such object <span class="note">Arguably the most intriguing and well-studied UAP case of recent years is a series of encounters in November 2004 involving the US Navy’s Carrier Strike Group Eleven, particularly the USS Nimitz nuclear aircraft carrier, which have been subjected to detailed analysis (e.g., Knuth et al., 2019). Essentially, situated off the Californian Coast, over a two-week period the group encountered as many as 100 UAPs. This culminated in a dramatic sequence of interactions on November 14th, which began when two F/A-18F Super Hornets on a training exercise engaged at close quarters a white airborne UAP, shaped like a cylindrical butane tank (or “Tic-Tac”), moving erratically back and forth, involving instantaneous changes in direction without changing speed, despite lacking apparent flight surfaces or means of propulsion, which eventually suddenly accelerated as if “shot out of a rifle” and was out of sight in a split second. Subsequently, F/A-18Fs with infrared recording technologies went to investigate, and managed to film one of the UAP (albeit from a considerable distance), a segment of which was released to the public in 2017. Most relevantly here, when the two F/A-18F Super Hornets engaged with the Tic-Tac, as described by Corbell (2022), the UAP was observed moving over a “round disturbance in the water … but underneath that ‘whitewater’ was an object … that appeared from the altitude to be cross-shaped … like a ‘T' … and this object was ‘doing something,’ so in the words that we said to me [by a source] … [the Tic-Tac] appeared to be “docking” with whatever was there just below the surface."</span>.
  A less well known but perhaps even more striking case was divulged by <span class="people" title="Luis Elizondo">Lue Elizondo</span>
  <span class="source"><span class="people">Elizondo, Luis</span> (2021a, June 30). <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YSrVhCS-rc">EPS 13: Terry Virts with Lue Elizondo (former director - Advanced
    Aerospace Threat Identification)</a>. Astro Terry: Down to Earth.</span> – a former intelligence officer closely
  linked to US investigations into UAP – involving a military encounter in the Caribbean in which a circular object
  “about the size of a small island” rose up from the deep on two separate occasions <span class="note">Elizondo’s full account runs as follows: “It’s pretty incredible … I'm not gonna go into too much detail… The person [who told Elizondo] is kind of very cagey about this. But you have a helicopter going out of a Caribbean island on a regular basis because the navy likes to test fire some of its cruise missile technology and whatnot, and what will happen is that after the cruise missile runs out of fuel, it kind of … splashes into the ocean. It will sink, and then at a certain time it … rises up and we go and fetch it and we analyze it for telemetry… Long story short, helicopter crew goes out to recover one of these things. As they are recovering it … they're pulling up and something what was described round and circular, about the size of a small island, a black dark color, starts rising to the surface. It doesn't break the water, but it starts rising to the surface. They thought, ‘wow, that's really really peculiar.’ Well, the next month goes around and they go out to retrieve … another missile that was test-fired, and this time we've got a frogman hanging down from the rope about to latch on to the missile, and this thing starts coming out of the water again. And if you know about the Puerto Rican trench out there, you're talking about water that's 22,000 feet deep. It's the second deepest part of the ocean. The thing starts rising up, and the thing is starting to come to the surface. The frogman is literally trying to climb the rope; they're doing an emergency ascent. Everybody is absolutely ‘panic at the disco’ freaking out, you know, ‘what the hell is that, what's going on.’ And as they start to pull up, it sucks the missile underwater and then disappears, never to be seen again … Incidents like that just kind of make the hair stand up on the back your neck.”</span>.
</p>
<p>The second related empirical mystery is that some UAP sightings involve craft and other phenomena (e.g., “orbs”)
  appearing to enter/exit potential underground access points, like volcanoes. The <span
    class="place">Popocatepetl</span> volcano in central Mexico, for example, is considered a “hotspot” for such
  observations (Carter, 2023), with numerous such events captured on camera in <time>2023</time>, which some UAP
  observers suggested was a “smoking gun” regarding NHI activity on Earth <span class="source">Donald, P. (2023, September 2). <a
    href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/unexplained-moment-multiple-ufos-shoot-30834508">Unexplained moment
    multiple UFOs shoot out from volcano “portal” in shocking footage.</a> The Mirror</span>. Various hypotheses have
  been touted about these observations. In the latter article, one observer is quoted as suggesting the volcano
  functions as an interdimensional “portal” (an “intergalactic gateway between two locations in space-time”). However,
  other people speculate that some UAP might not only be drawn to such locales (e.g., as a portal, or for purposes such
  as hiding or gathering energy), but might come from underground (i.e., with the NHI responsible residing in a
  subterranean way). Similarly, there are rumours of underwater bases in areas notable for reports of UAP
  entering/exiting the water, as discussed below. Together, these two empirical mysteries have led some to contemplate a
  CTH. Discussing Grusch’s allegations, Rep. Mike Gallagher <span class="source">Gallagher, M. (2023, June 27). <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSN9Jr2c-1A">Rep. Mike Gallagher interview</a>. The Pat McAfee Show.</span>
  noted that one potential explanation for UAP is <q>an ancient civilization that’s just been hiding here, for all this
    time, and is suddenly showing itself right now,</q> with numerous seemingly well-informed individuals making similar
  comments <span class="note">Former CIA officer Jim Semivan, for example, said “There’s an entity out there! There’s some kind of non-human intelligence that’s living with us on this F**KING planet” (cited in Verma, 2023a). Indeed, John Ramirez – who served at the CIA Directorate of Science and Technology, Directorate of Intelligence, and ODNI National Counterproliferation Center between 1984 and 2009 – suggested these ultraterrestrial NHI could even be “walking among us” unrecognized as integrated members of modern human society, even if – according to his speculation – they actually have “reptilian” origins, as discussed in the main text (Verma, 2023b). To that point, retired Army sergeant Clifford Stone – who claims to have worked as part of an elite military unit from 1968 to 1990 tasked with recovering crashed UAP – has claimed that authorities are aware of 57 different NHI species, many of whom “look very much like you and myself, that could walk among us and you wouldn't even notice the difference” (cited in Lewis-Kraus, 2021).
</span>.</p>
<p>Indeed, the notion of cryptoterrestrials has a long pedigree. For a start, it has often been imagined that mysteries
  may be concealed within the Earth, such as deep caverns, as memorably captured in literature by Jules Verne (1864).
  Then, building on this possibility, people have speculated these realms could potentially host ancient civilizations –
  whether human or some other species – which chose to conceal themselves there. Among the earliest modern proponents of
  this idea is the writer <span class="people">Richard Shaver</span>. According to <span
    class="people">Ray Palmer</span> <span class="source">
    <span class="people">Palmer, Ray</span> (1975). The Secret World. Amherst Press</span>, editor of Amazing Stories
  magazine, Shaver argued in a 10,000-word manifesto that advanced prehistoric races had built cities inside Earth but
  fled to another planet due to concerns about radiation damage from the Sun, leaving a cohort of offspring who remained
  underground. Palmer revised the manuscript and published it as “I Remember Lemuria!” in the <time>1945-03</time> issue
  of Amazing Stories, a tale which became the foundation for a genre of science fiction on this theme. Although many
  people condemned Shaver’s narrative as a “hoax” <span class="note">Dash, M. (2000). Borderlands: The Ultimate Exploration of the Unknown. Overlook Press.</span>,
  he and Palmer continued to maintain its veracity. Furthermore, over the years, UAP scholars have begun to contemplate
  similar ideas in relation to the burgeoning UAP observations, most notably <span class="people">John Keel</span> <span
    class="source"><span
    class="people">Keel, John</span> (1983). The Man Who Invented Flying Saucers. Fortean Times.</span>, who – without
  believing Shaver per se – was persuaded of the notion of cryptoterrestrials living underground.</p>
<p>Indeed, in an article titled “Secret UFO bases across the U.S.”, <span class="people">Keel</span> <span
  class="source"><span class="people">Keel, John</span> (1968, April). <a
  href="https://files.afu.se/Downloads/Magazines/0%20-%20Articles/United%20States/SAGA/1968%2004%2000_SAGA%20-%20John%20Keel%20-%20Secret%20UFO%20Bases%20Across%20the%20US.pdf">Secret
    UFO bases across the U.S.</a> Saga Magazine.</span> suggested that the idea of such entities being responsible for
  UAP was more reasonable than the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses/intelligence/HET">extraterrestrial
    hypothesis (ETH)</a> which was gaining some momentum at that time. Given that UAP have <q>been consistently active
    in the same areas for many years,</q> he argues <q>it is quite reasonable to speculate that these objects originate
    in some unknown manner from these areas, rather than traversing great spatial distances to make brief random and
    apparently pointless “visits.” In short, many of the thousands of observed “flying saucers” and “spook lights” are
    more apt to be a part of the Earth's environment than extraterrestrial craft flying in from some distant point</q>
  (p.9). In that sense, a CTH avoids issues like the difficulties of interstellar travel. Moreover, it would also
  explain why UAP appear to take a particular interest in Earth, and furthermore seem concerned about nuclear weapons

  further argues this hypothesis is a better fit for people’s purported experiences of NHI over the decades <span

  which most often involve entities with surprisingly similar physiognomy to humans, which one might not necessarily
  expect given the myriad of evolutionary pathways intelligent life might take in the cosmos <span class="source"><span

    class="source">Masters, M. (2022). The Extratempestrial Model. Full Circle Press</span>. However, if NHIs were
  cryptoterrestrial, their species may well be related to Homo sapiens in some way – as discussed below – which would
  more easily account for their resemblance. That said, given the widespread terrestrial evolutionary convergence even
  across distantly related lineages (as in sharks and dolphins, or hedgehogs and echidnas), it is also possible that
  extraterrestrial NHI might well look at least something like Homo sapiens <span class="source">Conway Morris, S. (2003). Life’s Solution: Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe. Cambridge University

    MIT Press.</span></p>
<p>In any case, although the CTH has remained somewhat niche and undertheorized, it has nevertheless been taken
  seriously by some observers. Most notably, these include Mac Tonnies <span class="source">Tonnies, M. (2011). The cryptoterrestrials: A meditation on indigenous humanoids and the aliens among us .
    Anomalist Books.</span> in his book The Cryptoterrestrials: A Meditation on Indigenous Humanoids and the Aliens
  Among Us, and more recently Kastrup (2024), who as noted above called this the <q>most realistic scenario</q> for UAP.
  Similarly, claims relating to the CTH can be found included within various UAP-related texts; in his book The <a
    href="/org/us/nasa">NASA</a> Conspiracies, for example, Redfern <span class="source">Redfern, N. (2011). NASA Conspiracies. Career Press. Reuters. (2012, August 8). <a

    nearly a decade in Russia’s Kazan</a>. Reuters.</span> includes an interview with someone seemingly associated with
  the Gemini program who claimed there was a small band of individuals who represent the last vestiges of an ancient
  advanced, isolated civilization – responsible for the legends of Atlantis and similar stories – forced by
  circumstances to retreat into remote sequestered locales for survival. Indeed, comparable testimony continues to
  emerge that lends further support to the CTH. An example is the apparent testimony of Dr Shirley Wright, <span
    class="people">Albert Einstein</span>’s assistant in <time>1947</time>. Speaking in <time>1993</time> – in
  recordings which only became public in <time>2021</time> – Wright claimed she and <span class="people">Einstein</span>
  had helped investigate the famous Roswell UAP crash <span class="source">Verma, V. (2023c, June 2). <a
    href="https://www.howandwhys.com/this-us-scientist-saw-roswell-alien-survivor-who-revealed-they-live-underground/">This US scientist saw Roswell alien survivor who revealed they live underground</a>. How
    and Why’s</span>. Incredibly, she said this was not only a genuine UAP, but that biological entities had survived
  the crash and were subjected to questioning. Most relevantly here, she suggested these were actually <q>just humans,
    but an advanced form,</q> and as Verma summarizes it, that many of their “species” actually <q>reside underground on
    our planet.</q> On that point, former <a href="/org/us/ic/cia">CIA</a> officer John Ramirez claimed that the
  authorities conducted biological tests and “were able to sequence something in those bodies that look like a genome
  and from there they checked the human genome and saw the correlations” <span class="source">Verma, V. (2023d, September 22). <a

<p>Given such stories, together with the general strangeness of the UAP topic, there is increasing openness to the CTH,
  as seen above with the comments of Rep. Gallagher. To reiterate, this hypothesis carries a very low probability
  weighting, and even people open to it remain sceptical. However, such scepticism is entirely appropriate, and does not
  negate the point of this paper, namely taking seriously the CTH as a possible explanation for UAP. We are not arguing
  that UAP do have a cryptoterrestrial explanation, but simply that they could, and the judicious approach is to
  consider all valid theories until the evidence decisively demonstrates they should be rejected. We therefore suggest
  scientists should keep an open mind and investigate the CTH as a genuinely viable theory. To that end, we offer
  various speculative strands of thought that could provide a tentative foundation and evidence for such a theory. For
  context, we begin by considering the limits to current historical and geological knowledge.</p>
