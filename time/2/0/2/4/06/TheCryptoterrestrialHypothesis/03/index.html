<p>If the CTH is viable, this would require – if viewed through the lens of certain CTHs, such as a possible “breakaway
  civilization” in our hominin past – re-thinking human and planetary history as we currently understand it. As such,
  the first strand of our argument in taking the CTH seriously is to appreciate how relatively fragile and contingent
  this understanding is, built upon evidence that happened to have withstood the ravages of time and moreover was
  stumbled upon by people who recognized its significance and preserved it. That is not to imply that we lack knowledge
  about our past; far from it. Over recent centuries, the field of palaeoanthropology has accrued a plethora of
  carefully preserved and analysed hominin skeletal and fossil remains, including fully intact bones and teeth from
  thousands of different specimens. Even so, new discoveries have the potential to prompt a re-calibration of timelines,
  potentially leading to revisions of our family tree (though by now this usually involves additions or revisions to
  what we know, rather than an entirely radical reconceptualization of it)14. However, scientists can only work with the
  evidence that has been preserved, and it is possible that aspects of biological evolution on this planet have been
  entirely lost to time. For example, Robert Martin of Chicago's Field Museum suggests we have “fossil evidence for only
  about 5 percent of all extinct primates” – with his estimation of the number of extinct primate species being up to
  9,000, while fewer than 500 have been identified from the fossil record – meaning that the task facing paleontologists
  in trying to get an accurate picture of primate evolution is like “trying to reconstruct a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle
  using just 50 pieces” (cited in Wong, 2002). Indeed, this uncertainty and contingency even applies to relatively
  modern human history, the conventional narratives of which have been challenged by archaeological discoveries.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, for instance, British and Indian archaeologists discovered the remains of an ancient civilization along
  the Indus River at the sites of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. This site was contemporary with other early urban centres
  along the Nile, the Tigris and Euphrates, and the Yangtze, but had been lost to history for nearly four thousand
  years, and its script and the language it encodes remain undeciphered (Keay, 2010). Likewise, much has been made of a
  settlement in Turkey called Göbekli Tepe – discovered by Klaus Schmidt in 1994 – described by the BBC as “an immense
  mystery older than Stonehenge” (Curry, 2021). There Schmidt found more than 20 circular stone enclosures, the largest
  20m across, featuring a circle of stone with two 5.5m tall pillars at its centre, engraved with “eerie, stylised human
  figures with folded hands and fox-pelt belts.” Significantly, the structures are at least 11,000 years old, making
  them humanity's oldest known monumental structures, possibly being a site of worship, hence it being called the
  “world’s first temple” (Ananthaswamy, 2013). Even more crucially, the discovery pushes back our understanding of when
  humans were capable of – and interested in – creating these kinds of elaborate monuments and practices by at least
  several thousand years, hence Curry describing the site as “reshaping previous ideas on the story of civilisation.”
  Similarly striking was the discovery in 2007 of a “Stonehenge-like structure” in Lake Michigan that is thought to be
  at least 10,000 years old – a figure partially derived from analyses of the rock used, but also from a potential
  carving on one stone in the outer circle resembling a Mastodon, a large proboscidean mammal that roamed across North
  America during the Pleistocene epoch, which ended 11,700 years ago. Yet even these discoveries may have now been
  superseded by claims by Natawidjaja et al. (2023) that the Gunung Padang site in Java features human megalithic
  constructions dating to between 25,000 and 14,000 BCE – although their analysis has been fiercely disputed by other
  archaeologists, and indeed pressure from such scholars even led the journal to retract the article (as discussed in
  endnote 20). Nevertheless, the point remains that even our relative history is somewhat shrouded in mystery, given the
  possibility for finds like Göbekli Tepe – the analysis and dating of which is generally not disputed – to be
  undiscovered and/or unappreciated for their significance.</p>
<p>Then, if such uncertainty is possible with events as recent as 11,000 years ago, this is a blink of an eye in
  planetary terms, given that Earth is 4.5 billion years old (Jain, 2014). As McPhee (1998) noted, “Geologists will
  sometimes use the calendar year as a unit to represent the time scale,” and in that respect, the Precambrian – from
  the Earth’s initial formation 4.5 billion years ago until the Cambrian Explosion ca. 500 million years ago – “runs
  from New Year’s Day until well after Halloween. Dinosaurs appear in the middle of December and are gone the day after
  Christmas. The last ice sheet melts on December 31st at one minute before midnight, and the Roman empire lasts five
  seconds” (p.89). Indeed, the entirety of recorded human history takes place within the year’s last 30 seconds. In
  world-historical terms, Mammoths and Smilodons were with us a few deep breaths ago, and Charlemagne’s afterimage is
  still fading from our collective retinas. Moreover, given how easily even relatively recent evidence can be destroyed,
  lost, or remain undiscovered, our understanding of the far more distant past – apart from brute geological facts such
  as the age of mountains – is nearly totally blank15.</p>
<p>Schmidt and Frank (2019) therefore suggest that, given the poor resolution of the geological record, particularly
  extending millions of years into the past, intelligent or even industrialized species might have long pre-dated human
  existence on Earth but vanished without leaving a discernible paleontological trace (or, at least, traces that have
  been discovered by humans). They term this possibility the “Silurian hypothesis,” named after a 1970 episode of the
  British science fiction TV series Doctor Who, in which “a long-buried race of intelligent reptiles [called]
  ‘Silurians’ are awakened by an experimental nuclear reactor.” There are of course caveats to the plausibility of such
  a hypothesis: the more recent, advanced, and/or expansive such a civilization was, the more likely it is that they
  would have left behind discoverable remains. Nevertheless, as Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb (2022) puts it, “Planets
  like Mars or Earth could have given multiple births to technological civilizations that were a billion years apart and
  hence were not aware of each other. Like stable parents, the planets recovered from the environmental impact of these
  civilizations over time.” Similarly, Kastrup (2024) notes the viability of the Silurian hypotheses, suggesting there
  has been “plenty of time and opportunity for other non-human species to have arisen on Earth, developed to a level of
  technology far beyond ours … and then to have effectively vanished due to one or more of the myriad possible
  civilisation-ending cataclysms.”</p>
<p>Moreover, as we continue to explore space – whether distant constellations though inventions like the James Webb
  Telescope, or nearer to home through initiatives like NASA’s Curiosity Rover – new evidence may emerge that could
  challenge our assumptions about places like Mars. Joseph and Schild (2023) for instance, published “a sample of
  official NASA Mars photographs of what appears to be the wreckage and debris from extraterrestrial spacecraft,
  partially buried bones, the body of a “humanoid” stretched out on a “cushion;” the head of a “humanoid” still wearing
  a metal device on the front of its “face” adjacent to a cratered debris field, two “humanoid” skulls including one
  that is atop what may be a raised elongated burial mound, UAPs/UFOs photographed in the skies of Mars and a
  silver-saucer shaped structure upon the ground” (p.54). Of course, caution is needed in interpreting such data,
  particularly given the human cognitive habit of “pareidolia”: the tendency to perceive a specific, often meaningful,
  image in a random or ambiguous visual pattern. This is the prevailing scientific interpretation of the famous “Face on
  Mars,” a mile-wide likeness from the Cydonia region obtained by NASA’s Viking 1 in 1976 (Martinez-Conde & Macknik,
  2012). However, we must also be wary of simply assuming any apparently anomalous object is pareidolia, as doing so
  would equally be a cognitive bias that hinders us from studying evidence with due openness and objectivity. Indeed,
  some observers have argued that when analysed in context, there are other anomalies in the vicinity of the Cydonia
  Face that tip the balance towards the plausibility of it actually being an artificial construction (Corlotto,
  1997)16.</p>
<p>The general point is that if another intelligent species had inhabited Earth (or Mars) long before Homo sapiens, it
  is possible that we could have no idea. Of course, for these considerations to be relevant to the CTH, such a species
  would need to still be present on Earth and existing in stealth – whether a branch of Homo sapiens, a different
  hominin subspecies, an even earlier precursor, or something else entirely. As we discuss below, while this notion may
  sound unlikely on first hearing, many observers are persuaded that it is at least conceivable, not least because whole
  swathes of our planet remain virtually unexplored and uncharted; this of course includes the vast regions underwater,
  but even includes areas above ground. There has been recent speculation for instance about an “Alaskan Triangle,” a
  sparsely populated area between Anchorage and Juneau in the south to Utqiagvik on the northern coast that is a
  prominent “hotspot” for UAP, as well as other oddities, such as over 20,000 unexplained disappearances in the area
  since the 1970s (Moran, 2023a).</p>
<p>Moreover, our epistemological humility ought to extend to biology too, as argued by Davies et al. (2009) in a paper
  on the potential for Earth to host a “shadow biosphere” (or “shadow biome”) involving forms of “weird life … whose
  biochemistry is so nonstandard that it would not be detected by life-detection tools targeted at standard terran
  biochemistry.” This kind of idea has sometimes been known as the “paraphysical” hypothesis, which essentially denotes
  forms of life that are physical but are usually undetected and unknown to us17. Here one might note that although
  Davies et al. were generally referring to a shadow biome on a molecular level, there has recently been speculation
  with regard to larger life forms, as seen for example in relation to a strange airborne “jellyfish” UAP reported by
  Corbell (2024)18. Of course, this point about the limits of our knowledge provides no particular argument for the CTH
  (and moreover, our anthropological knowledge of the historic and prehistoric hominin past is relatively substantial).
  Crucially though, it means we must have epistemological humility and realise neither can we dismiss it just because it
  contradicts the standard narrative of history. Furthermore, some traces of earlier civilizations possibly are still
  evident, as we see next.</p>
