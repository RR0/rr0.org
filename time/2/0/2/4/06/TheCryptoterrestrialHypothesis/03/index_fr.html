<p>Si l'HCT est viable, elle demanderait – si on la voit à travers certaines HCTs, comme une possible “civilisation de
  rupture” dans notre passé hominidé – de re-penser l'histoire humaine et planétaire telle que nous la comprenons
  aujourd'hui. As such, the first strand of our argument pour prendre l'HCT au sérieux est d'apprécier à quel point
  cette compréhension est relativement fragile et contingente, construite sur evidence that happened to have withstood
  the ravages of time and moreover was stumbled upon by people who recognized its significance and preserved it. Cela ne
  veut pas dire que nous manquons de connaissances sur notre passé ; loin de là. Au cours des derniers siècles, le
  domaine de la paléoanthropologie has accrued a plethora of carefully preserved and analysed hominin skeletal and
  fossil remains, including fully intact bones and teeth from thousands of different specimens. Even so, new discoveries
  have the potential to prompt a re-calibration of timelines, potentially leading to revisions of our family tree
  (though by now this usually involves additions or revisions to what we know, rather than an entirely radical
  reconceptualization of it) <span class="note">Comme
    le disent Hublin et al. (2018), les <q>lieu et moment exacts d'émergence de l'homo-sapiens restent obscurs parce
      que les éléments fossiles sont limitées et l'âge chronologique de nombreux spécimens-clés reste incertain
      .</q> As such, any new discovery has the potential to re-calibrate theories and timelines. Many revisions are
    relatively subtle or minor. However, sometimes they are more substantial. Consider that until recently, it was generally held that our genus Homo first emerged around 2.3 million years ago in Africa, and our species Homo sapiens around 200,000 years ago in East Africa (Wood, 2017). However, a recent discovery in Ethiopia shifted the origin of Homo back an incredible half a million years to 2.8 million years ago (Villmoare et al., 2015), while a find in Morocco shifted Homo sapiens back to 300,000 years ago in North Africa (Hublin et al., 2018). Yet still more recently the find of a new fossil ape at an 8.7-million-year-old site in Turkey is challenging the long-accepted idea of our origins being in Africa at all, instead suggesting the ancestors of African apes and humans may have evolved in Europe before migrating to Africa some nine to seven million years ago (Sevim-Erol et al., 2023).
Similarly, new discoveries are prompting re-evaluations of other hominid species; par example, Berger et al. (2023)
    claim an ancient branch of humans, Homo nalendi, displayed sophisticated behaviours – including symbolic art and burying their dead – some 300,000 years ago, nearly a quarter of a million years before Homo sapiens (although their findings have been contested; McKie, 2023a). Moreover, much about the dynamics of these eras of evolution remain unknown. For example, analysing the genomic sequences of people today, Hu et al. (2023) suggest our human ancestors went through a “severe population bottleneck” between around 930,000 and 813,000 years ago – hypothesized to have been driven by climatic changes at the transition between the Early and Middle Pleistocene periods – in which the number of Homo sapiens went down from around 100,000 to as few as 1,280 breeding individuals, with this bottleneck lasting for about 117,000 years, bringing our species close to extinction. Given such contingencies and gaps in our knowledge, scholars are well aware how precarious is our knowledge of human evolution, and how little we should take as final and definitive.   Furthermore, this sense of uncertainty and contingency even extends into relatively modern human history. The standard narrative is that only around 10,000 BCE did early humans transition from existing as scattered groups of hunter-gatherers into instead developing permanent settlements anchored around a reliable agricultural food supply in the “Neolithic Revolution” (Weisdorf, 2005). Out of such settlements gradually emerged relatively modern societies, characterized by large communities comprising numerous tribes, the creation of monumental architecture, and innovations in metallurgy and writing. The earliest examples are usually thought to have emerged around 4,000 BCE in Mesopotamia – a region roughly encompassing what is now eastern Syria, southeastern Turkey, and most of Iraq – often called the “cradle” of civilization, including the empires of Assyria, Akkad, and Babylon (Algaze, 2009). From this area, for example, hails the world’s oldest surviving work of literature, The Epic of Gilgamesh, dated to around 2,100 BCE (George, 2002). Comparable developments were also taking place around the world; China for example can also lay claim to being one of the oldest known civilizations, developing advanced craftmanship techniques (e.g., a “rotary machine” for carving jade) around 3,500 BCE (Wang & Shi, 2020), and its founding Xia Dynasty emerging circa 2,070 BCE (San, 2014). However, this standard narrative of our cultural evolution has been challenged by discoveries like Göbekli Tepe</span>.
  However, scientists can only work with the evidence that has been preserved, and it is possible that aspects of
  biological evolution on this planet have been entirely lost to time. Par exemple, Robert Martin du Musée de Terrain de
  Chicago suggère que nous n'avons des <q>preuves fossiles que pour environ 5 % de l'ensemble des espèces éteintes de
    primates</q> – avec son estimation du nombre d'espéces éteintes de primates allant jusqu'à 9000, alors que moins de
  500 ont été identifiées à travers des fossiles répertoriés – cela veut dire que la tâche à laquelle font face les
  paléontologues d'essayer d'obtenir une vision précise de l'évolution des primates est comparable à <q>essayer de
    reconstituer un puzzle de 1000 pièces avec juste 50 pièces</q> <span class="source">Wong, K. (2002,
    April 18). <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/study-suggests-primates-a">Study
    suggests primates and dinosaurs shared the Earth.</a> Scientific American</span>. De fait, cette incertitude et
  contingency even applies to relatively modern human history, the conventional narratives of which have been challenged
  by archaeological discoveries.</p>
<p>Dans les années 1920s, par exemple, des archéologues britanniques et indiens ont découvert les restes d'une
  civilisation ancienne le long de la rivière de l'Indus sur les sites de Harappa et Mohenjo-daro. This site was
  contemporary with other early urban centres along the Nile, the Tigris and Euphrates, and the Yangtze, but had been
  lost to history for nearly four thousand years, and its script and the language it encodes remain undeciphered <span
    class="source">Keay, J. (2010). India: A History. Harper</span>. Likewise, much has been made of a settlement in
  Turkey called Göbekli Tepe – discovered by <span class="people">Klaus Schmidt</span> in <time>1994</time> – described
  by the BBC as <q>an immense mystery older than Stonehenge</q> <span class="source">Curry, A. (2021, August 21). <a
    href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20210815-an-immense-mystery-older-than-stonehenge">An immense mystery older than Stonehenge</a>. The BBC</span>.
  There Schmidt found more than 20 circular stone enclosures, the largest 20m across, featuring a circle of stone with
  two 5.5m tall pillars at its centre, engraved with <q>eerie, stylised human figures with folded hands and fox-pelt
    belts.</q> Significantly, the structures are at least 11,000 years old, making them humanity's oldest known
  monumental structures, possibly being a site of worship, hence it being called the <q>world’s first temple</q> <span
    class="source">Ananthaswamy, A. (2013). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0262-4079(13)62021-7">World’s oldest temple built to worship the dog star</a>. New Scientist, 219(2930), 14.</span>.
  Even more crucially, the discovery pushes back our understanding of when humans were capable of – and interested in –
  creating these kinds of elaborate monuments and practices by at least several thousand years, hence Curry describing
  the site as <q>reshaping previous ideas on the story of civilization.</q> Similarly striking was the discovery in
  <time>2007</time> of a <q>Stonehenge-like structure</q> in Lake Michigan that is thought to be at least 10,000 years
  old – a figure partially derived from analyses of the rock used, but also from a potential carving on one stone in the
  outer circle resembling a Mastodon, a large proboscidean mammal that roamed across North America during the
  Pleistocene epoch, which ended 11,700 years ago. Yet even these discoveries may have now been superseded by claims by
  Natawidjaja et al. <span class="source">Natawidjaja, D. H., Bachtiar, A., Nurhandoko, B. E. B., Akbar, A., Purajatnika, P., Daryono, M. R., Wardhana, D.
    D., Subandriyo, A. S., Krisyunianto, A., Tagyuddin, Ontowiryo, B., & Maulana, Y. (2023). RETRACTED: <a

      pyramid in West Java, Indonesia</a>. Archaeological Prospection</span> that the Gunung Padang site in Java
  features human megalithic constructions dating to between 25,000 and 14,000 BCE – although their analysis has been
  fiercely disputed by other archaeologists, and indeed pressure from such scholars even led the journal to retract the
  article (as discussed in endnote 20). Nevertheless, the point remains that even our relative history is somewhat
  shrouded in mystery, given the possibility for finds like Göbekli Tepe – the analysis and dating of which is generally
  not disputed – to be undiscovered and/or unappreciated for their significance.</p>
<p>Then, if such uncertainty is possible with events as recent as 11,000 years ago, this is a blink of an eye in
  planetary terms, given that Earth is 4.5 billion years old <span class="source">Jain, S. (2014). <a
    href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-81-322-1539-4_4">Earth as a Planet</a> (pp. 57–75)</span>. As McPhee (1998) noted,
  <q>Geologists will sometimes use the calendar year as a unit to represent the time scale,</q> and in that respect, the
  Precambrian – from the Earth’s initial formation 4.5 billion years ago until the Cambrian Explosion ca. 500 million
  years ago – <q>runs from New Year’s Day until well after Halloween. Dinosaurs appear in the middle of December and are
    gone the day after Christmas. The last ice sheet melts on December 31st at one minute before midnight, and the Roman
    empire lasts five seconds</q> (p.89). Indeed, the entirety of recorded human history takes place within the year’s
  last 30 seconds. In world-historical terms, Mammoths and Smilodons were with us a few deep breaths ago, and
  Charlemagne’s afterimage is still fading from our collective retinas. Moreover, given how easily even relatively
  recent evidence can be destroyed, lost, or remain undiscovered, our understanding of the far more distant past – apart
  from brute geological facts such as the age of mountains – is nearly totally blank <span class="note">Our relative lack of understanding of our planet’s history was emphasized by Elizondo (2021) in an interview which included discussion of the HCT. As he put it, “How much of our own history do we really know? You know, we can go back 5,000 years, pretty easily; 8,000 years, things start to get a little murky, right? And anything much beyond that we really have no clue.” He further discussed how dynamic Earth’s environment is, noting “every time we have an ice age every roughly 10-15,000 years, the entire topography of Earth changes, the climate changes, animals change.” Moreover, knowledge is hampered by how easily evidence is lost to time, especially given how impermeable materials can be: “It's really hard to make anything that last more than a few 1,000 years… The pyramids… [are] 5,000 years old, and they don't look so great, and probably … you might have a little hill of sand in 100,000 years, but that's going to be about it… Even mountains in millions of years become deserts, right? Time moves on. Then you have the subduction zones of Earth that eventually, if you wait long enough, the surface of the planet all gets recycled anyways. So, it’s all going to get sucked down into the mantle and get spit out the other end as new land, so nothing is indelible on this planet.” Kastrup (2024) makes a similar point: “Any sign of abandoned urban and industrial infrastructure is unlikely to survive a period of only a few million years, due to weather erosion. Synthesized chemicals, alloys and other compounds, technological artefacts, as well as terrain signatures such as mining holes, are ultimately unlikely to survive the constant recycling of the Earth’s crust through plate tectonics. What is now the Earth’s crust will eventually sink into the molten asthenosphere and mantel beneath, where it will be reforged, just to eventually re-emerge through volcanic activity as a brand-new crust. As a rough estimate, if we assume an average plate movement of a few centimeters per year, it could take only tens of millions of years for large swathes of the Earth's crust—especially the ocean crust but, to a more limited degree, also the continental crust—to be recycled in this manner. No conspicuous remnants of an ancient, technological, nonhuman civilization would likely survive all this.”</span>.

  suggest that, given the poor resolution of the geological record, particularly extending millions of years into the
  past, intelligent or even industrialized species might have long pre-dated human existence on Earth but vanished
  without leaving a discernible paleontological trace (or, at least, traces that have been discovered by humans). They

    multiple births to technological civilizations that were a billion years apart and hence were not aware of each
    other. Like stable parents, the planets recovered from the environmental impact of these civilizations over

    beyond ours … and then to have effectively vanished due to one or more of the myriad possible civilisation-ending
    cataclysms.</q></p>
<p>Moreover, as we continue to explore space – whether distant constellations though inventions like the James Webb
  Telescope, or nearer to home through initiatives like <a href="/org/us/nasa">NASA</a>’s Curiosity Rover – new evidence
  may emerge that could challenge our assumptions about places like <a

    of what appears to be the wreckage and debris from extraterrestrial spacecraft, partially buried bones, the body of
    a “humanoid” stretched out on a “cushion;” the head of a “humanoid” still wearing a metal device on the front of its
    “face” adjacent to a cratered debris field, two “humanoid” skulls including one that is atop what may be a raised
    elongated burial mound, UAPs/UFOs photographed in the skies of Mars and a silver-saucer shaped structure upon the
    ground</q> (p.54). Of course, caution is needed in interpreting such data, particularly given the human cognitive
  habit of “pareidolia”: the tendency to perceive a specific, often meaningful, image in a random or ambiguous visual
  pattern. This is the prevailing scientific interpretation of the famous “Face on Mars,” a mile-wide likeness from the
  Cydonia region obtained by NASA’s Viking 1 in 1976 <span class="source">Martinez-Conde, S., & Macknik, S. L. (2012). A faithful resemblance. Scientific American Mind. Scientific
    American, 23(4), 19–21</span>. However, we must also be wary of simply assuming any apparently anomalous object is
  pareidolia, as doing so would equally be a cognitive bias that hinders us from studying evidence with due openness and
  objectivity. Indeed, some observers have argued that when analysed in context, there are other anomalies in the
  vicinity of the Cydonia Face that tip the balance towards the plausibility of it actually being an artificial
  construction (Corlotto, 1997) <span class="note">There are essentially two competing hypotheses regarding the Cydonia “Face.” Either it is, (a), a naturally occurring feature of the geography that just happens to resemble a face, or (b) an artificial construction designed by an NHI to look like a face. Although (a) has tended to be the prevailing, widely-accepted explanation, some observers have pointed to other apparent anomalies in the vicinity that argue against it and tip the balance of probability towards (b) (Hoagland, 1992; Corlotto, 1997). For a start, the “platform” on which the Face is situated seems to have a high degree of architectural symmetry, with four equally proportioned sides at right angles to each other. Equally intriguingly, various large objects are situated relatively nearby (10-20 km southwest) that seem similarly, (1) unusual, (2) of comparable size, and (3) arranged in an organized pattern, and which have been collectively dubbed the “City.” Taking the Face itself in isolation, arguably hypothesis (a)
is more reasonable. However, when these other contextual factors are included in the calculation, some people suggest that (b) starts to become more plausible</span>.
</p>
<p>The general point is that if another intelligent species had inhabited Earth (or Mars) long before Homo sapiens, it
  is possible that we could have no idea. Of course, for these considerations to be relevant to the HCT, such a species
  would need to still be present on Earth and existing in stealth – whether a branch of Homo sapiens, a different
  hominin subspecies, an even earlier precursor, or something else entirely. As we discuss below, while this notion may
  sound unlikely on first hearing, many observers are persuaded that it is at least conceivable, not least because whole
  swathes of our planet remain virtually unexplored and uncharted; this of course includes the vast regions underwater,
  but even includes areas above ground. There has been recent speculation for instance about an “Alaskan Triangle,” a
  sparsely populated area between Anchorage and Juneau in the south to Utqiagvik on the northern coast that is a
  prominent “hotspot” for UAP, as well as other oddities, such as over 20,000 unexplained disappearances in the area
  since the 1970s <span class="source">Moran, M. (2023a, September 23). <a

    Triangle” where 20,000 people have vanished and UFOs appear.</a> Daily Star</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, our epistemological humility ought to extend to biology too, as argued by Davies et al. (2009) in a paper
  on the potential for Earth to host a “shadow biosphere” (or “shadow biome”) involving forms of <q>weird life … whose
    biochemistry is so nonstandard that it would not be detected by life-detection tools targeted at standard terran
    biochemistry.</q> This kind of idea has sometimes been known as the “paraphysical” hypothesis, which essentially
  denotes forms of life that are physical but are usually undetected and unknown to us <span class="note">An early and eloquent exposition of the paraphysical hypothesis was provided by RAF Air Marshal Sir Victor, Goddard, KCB, СВЕ, МА, а very high-ranking member of the British government, in a public lecture in May 1969 (see @SpinDubTracks, 2024). As one can see, at points this hypothesis intersects and overlaps with the interdimensional hypothesis (i.e., entities residing in other dimensions). However, one might well imagine paraphysical entities that are not interdimensional, but are “simply” normally invisible to us for some reason. That while it may be that some operators of UFO are normally the paraphysical denizens of a planet other than Earth, there is no logical need for this to be so. For, if the materiality of UFO is paraphysical (and consequently normally invisible), UFO could more plausibly be creations of an invisible world coincident with the space of our physical Earth planet than creations in the paraphysical realms of any other physical planet in the solar system... Given that real UFO are paraphysical, capable of reflecting light like ghosts; and given also that (according to many observers) they remain visible as they change position at ultrahigh speeds from one point to another, it follows that those that remain visible in transition do not dematerialize for that swift transition, and therefore, their mass must be of a diaphanous (very diffuse) nature, and their substance relatively etheric... The observed validity of this supports the paraphysical assertion and makes the likelihood of UFO being Earth-created greater than the likelihood of their creation on another planet... The astral world of illusion, which (on psychical evidence) is greatly inhabited by illusion-prone spirits, is well known for its multifarious imaginative activities and exhortations. Seemingly some of its denizens are eager to exemplify principalities and powers. Others pronounce upon morality, spirituality, Deity, etc. All of these astral exponents who invoke human consciousness may be sincere, but many of their theses may be framed to propagate some special phantasm, perhaps of an earlier incarnation, or to indulge an inveterate and continuing technological urge toward materialistic progress, or simply to astonish and disturb the gullible for the devil of it.
</span>. Here one might note that although Davies et al. were generally referring to a shadow biome on a molecular
  level, there has recently been speculation with regard to larger life forms, as seen for example in relation to a
  strange airborne “jellyfish” UAP reported by <span class="people" title="Jeremy Corbell">Corbell</span> <span

    follows:  Today we release the RAW footage of a military filmed UAP incursion within a United States joint operations base. This UAP of unknown origin displayed transmedium capability - and has been officially designated by the United States intelligence agencies as a UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena). This designation is currently maintained. THE “JELLYFISH” UAP RAW footage received / Video #1 DATE / TIME - October 2018 (night) LOCATION - This footage was taken at a United States joint operations base in Iraq. IMAGING TYPE - Thermographic / Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR). EVENT DESCRIPTION - An incursion by an object of unknown origin was filmed at a United States joint operations base in Iraq. The object was designated UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena), and was tracked for a durational period. The object moved through a sensitive military installation - and eventually traversed over a body of water, where it actuated a controlled descent - submerging into the water. After an observational period of about seventeen minutes - the UAP reemerged from the body of water and shot-off at an extreme rate of speed - beyond the optical scope of the observation platform. The origin, intent and capability of the Anomalous Aerial Vehicle remains unknown. Official designation remains UAP. ADDITIONAL DETAILS REPORTED BY DIRECT EYEWITNESSES & THOSE FAMILIAR WITH THE FULL RAW FOOTAGE • The UAP displayed transmedium capability - The UAP was filmed entering the water with a controlled descent. The UAP emerged from the water about seventeen minutes later and orientated into a sudden and rapid directional flight - beyond the optical range of the platform monitoring it. • The UAP displayed low observability - The UAP was not visible with Night Vision (IR) and appeared to jam the targeting capability of the optical platform. • The UAP displayed positive lift - without the normally associated aerodynamic means for lift and thrust. The signatures typically associated with the propulsion maneuvers observed - were absent. FULL VIDEO : https://youtu.be/7bns_WhNAQM.  Interestingly, sightings resembling an airborne “jellyfish” seem to date back decades. A report from the Halifax Evening News in July 1954, for example, reported that an air stewardess on a flight from New York to London saw “a formation of strange machines flying parallel to the airliner for more than 80 miles,” involving “six small, black objects and one larger machine, a “flying jellyfish,” which appeared to change shape constantly” (see Infini, 2024). Indeed, going further back, representations of jellyfish-like UAP can seemingly even be found on historic works of art, such as the 17th Century Svetishoveil Cathedral Fresco depicting the crucifixion of Christ (Open-Minded Approach, 2024)</span>.
  Of course, this point about the limits of our knowledge provides no particular argument for the HCT (and moreover, our
  anthropological knowledge of the historic and prehistoric hominin past is relatively substantial). Crucially though,
  it means we must have epistemological humility and realise neither can we dismiss it just because it contradicts the
  standard narrative of history. Furthermore, some traces of earlier civilizations possibly are still evident, as we see
  next.</p>
