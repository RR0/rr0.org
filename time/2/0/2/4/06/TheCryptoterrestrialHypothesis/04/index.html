<p>All cultures have their myths and legends. There are of course many ways to interpret such tales, ranging from works
  of playful imagination to vehicles for conveying ethical teachings. However, there is an increasing appreciation that
  even if myths do involve such functions, they may also sometimes, perhaps even often, actually be attempts by
  pre-literate societies at memorialising, interpreting, and communicating real historical events (Simala, 2015). This
  hermeneutic framework gains further credibility when bolstered by observations of a particular narrative recurring
  among different cultures. A preeminent example is a great flood, found across many geographically dispersed
  traditions, including Sumerian (Jacobsen, 1994), ancient Israelite (Davidson, 2004), Greek (Apollodorus, 1921) Indian
  (Britannica, 2023), and Cheyenne (Seger, 1934). Similarly, albeit less immediately dramatic, Nunn and Cook (2022) show
  that many coastal cultures have mythologized stories of land becoming separated from mainlands by submergence. They
  point out that “science has traditionally underestimated the capacity of oral (pre-literate) cultures to acquire,
  encode and sustain their observations of memorable events with a high degree of replication fidelity.” Thus, rather
  than being merely imaginative creations, such myths may instead have arisen from “eyewitness accounts of these
  transformative processes,” so should be engaged with as potential historical testimony. Thus, it is increasingly
  thought that flood myths may depict events from around 20,000 to 12,000 years ago, “when sea level in the aftermath of
  the Last Glaciation (last ice age) was rising and transforming coastal landscapes and their human uses in exactly the
  ways these stories describe” (p.29)19. Teller et al. (2000) for example, analysed the “rapid postglacial flooding of
  the floor of the Persian Gulf” from 12,000 to 6,000 years ago, finding the sea transgressed more than 1000 kilometres,
  with waters sometimes flooding this floor by more than a kilometre per year, and so suggest flood myths in the region
  – from the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh to the biblical Noah – are genuine records of these events. </p>
<p>Even more relevantly here, across world cultures are not only myths of flooding and rising seas, but of land – and
  moreover civilizations – being lost to these events, disappearing beneath the waters. Most famous is Atlantis, an
  island featured in Plato's works Timaeus and Critias. While some scholars suggest it is merely fictional, created for
  allegorical purposes (Tarrant, 2007), there are ongoing attempts to identify it as an actual location, such as a
  highly advanced Bronze Age culture in Crete and its surrounding islands that was devastated by the eruption of the
  Santorini/Thera volcano, 120 km north of Crete, around 1,600 BCE (Downey & Tarling, 1984). Moreover, efforts to trace
  legendary lost civilizations have been encouraged by underwater findings that may – though many claims are disputed –
  be extant traces. For example, in 1986 a diver found apparent submerged stone structures in waters off Yonaguni Jima
  in Japan, the largest being described as “a complicated, monolithic, stepped pyramid” that rises from a depth of 25
  meters (Ryall, 2007). Sceptics dismiss these as merely natural formations, arguing their straight edges result from
  the “natural stratigraphy of sandstones” (Joshua, 2020). Others however, like marine geologist Masaaki Kimura (2004),
  believe these to be the ruins of a “Japanese Atlantis” – perhaps a city around 5,000 years old that was sunk by an
  earthquake around two millennia ago, or even more radically, one created during the last ice age, when sea levels in
  the area were 40 meters lower than today. Indeed, the Joe Rogan (2024) podcast recently hosted a lively debate about
  the claim that it might represent an ancient undiscovered civilization20. While conventional narratives of history
  would find that possibility unlikely, discoveries like Göbekli Tepe are perhaps now making people reconsider.</p>
<p>Easter Island has likewise become a focus of speculation about lost civilizations. Alessio (2016) writes, “As a
  result of its remote island location in the Pacific, and with so many questions about its mysterious stone ruins,
  myriad caves, and as yet undeciphered script, it is not surprising that people have fantasized about this isolated and
  small pocket of land” (p.51), including linking it to “a technologically advanced and ancient civilization known as Mu
  [or Lemuria], a hypothetical ‘Lost World,’ which purportedly had created a globe-spanning empire” before being
  swallowed by the ocean, and whose survivors “formed the nucleus of the world’s first civilizations”21. Of course, if
  global in scope, common artifacts and features would be easily identifiable to terrestrial and underwater
  archaeologists. However, such a speculative thesis about a lost, global empire goes far beyond what the CTH requires
  vis-à-vis the possibility of a “lost” human civilization being responsible for some UAP, which “only” needs, (a) a
  civilization, of whatever size, to have existed at some point, and (b) its members retreating and surviving
  underground. To that point, there are many rumoured examples of lost civilizations – and similarly, if not
  “civilizations” per se, then areas of land that supported human populations22 – with those noted above just a handful
  among many. Moreover, besides apparently strange examples like Easter Island – in which scholars struggle to account
  for the level of societal complexity and technical sophistication in such a remote place – there are other potential
  sources of evidence for such civilizations.</p>
<p>One intriguing line of enquiry concerns “out of place artifacts” (Freer, 1993): objects that seem to be incompatible
  with our knowledge of the era with which they are linked, especially if they evince technological mastery that exceeds
  assumptions of what people in that era were capable of, which thus challenge conventional historical chronology23.
  That said, caution is warranted in interpreting artifacts that seem “too advanced for the time,” considering these
  claims largely stem from a lack of understanding about the capacities of earlier groups. Such assertions can also have
  racist undertones, implying past people in those places were incapable of such feats, while the achievements of
  Europeans are rarely if ever similarly questioned (Masters, 2021). However, such insinuations are not inevitable; a
  more benign and even celebratory perspective is to suggest these objects challenge conventional chronology by making
  it more accurate, bringing a deepening appreciation of the expertise of people in earlier ages who had more knowledge
  and abilities than they are credited with today.</p>
<p>Most relevantly here, while many such objects seem a millennium or more out of place, other findings might be even
  more historically anomalous. At the Kalambo Falls in Zambia, for example, researchers in 2019 discovered an example of
  wood craftmanship and technology – involving two pieces of wood fashioned to “interlock” together – that is dated to
  around 500,000 years ago, well before the emergence of Homo sapiens (Barham et al., 2023). Going even further back,
  workers at a coal mine in Ukraine found what appeared to be a fossilized imprint of a wheel in the sandstone roof of a
  tunnel they had excavated 900 meters below the surface, which is potentially dated as being 300 million years old
  (Archaeology News Network, 2022). Similarly, a Russian team found what appeared to be a 2cm “screw” embedded within a
  rock that was estimated to be 300 million years old (though skeptics have argued it could be the fossilised imprint of
  an ancient sea creature called a crinoid) (Griffiths, 2015). Or consider a photo shared by Roemmele (2023) of what
  appears to be a “petrified book” encased in rock in Western Australia, which some interpreted as possibly being 350
  million years old.</p>
<p>Such findings are evidently relevant to a CTH. Indeed, Coulthart (2023a) suggests the intelligence community has
  taken a great interest in such objects, such as Egyptian relics dated to 5,500 years ago that display “mastery of
  technology, involving the shaping of stone, that is far beyond the … known technology of that era,” as indicated in
  endnote 23. More generally, he said the CIA has “spent a lot of time investigating ancient civilizations” seeking
  answers to “who were the people who crafted these buildings?” As he noted, “We still don’t know. There are fundamental
  mysteries in human civilization that we haven’t answered.” In that respect, the possibilities discussed here of
  advanced pre/historic civilizations lend some support to a CTH. However, this would not merely require such a
  civilization to have existed in the past, but to have continued to do so. In that respect, there are also many such
  myths, and even potential evidence, as we explore next.</p>
