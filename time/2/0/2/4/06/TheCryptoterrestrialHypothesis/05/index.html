<p>Just as recent centuries have seen a proliferation of legends about lost civilizations, so have flourished myths
  about their people retreating underground and continuing to prosper. Before considering these, it is worth noting that
  the idea of subterranean living is not outlandish. Indeed, many historical underground cities have been found, most
  famously Derinkuyu in Turkey <span class="source">Jacobs, F. (2022). <a
    href="https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/derinkuyu-underground-city/">Derinkuyu: Mysterious
    underground city in Turkey found in man’s basement</a>. Big Think</span> <span class="note">Derinkuyu is carved out of the soft volcanic rock of the region, harnessing its naturally occurring caverns and tunnels. It extends down 85 meters and across 18 levels, and incredibly is estimated to have housed as many as 20,000 people, plus livestock and food stores (Ulusay & Aydan, 2018). Even more remarkably, this is just one of some 36 underground cities in the Cappadocia region in central Turkey, with others perhaps yet to be discovered. As to their origins, archaeologists speculate these could have been started as long ago as 2,000 BCE by the Hittites who dominated the region at the time, but were undoubtedly extended by the many groups who have since occupied the area, such as the Phrygians around 700 BCE (Sari & Özsoy, 2010). While these cities may have served many purposes, they are thought to have above all been sources of refuge and protection, including from persecution by rival groups as well as from natural elements (Erdem, 2008).
</span>. Relatedly, recent decades have seen the construction of numerous underground complexes, most notably military
  bases, with an estimated 10,000 worldwide <span class="source">Richelson, J. T. (2013, September 13). <a

  Cheyenne Mountain Complex – a Space Force installation in Colorado, which used to host the <a href="/org/NORAD.html">North
    American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)</a> – was built under 2,000 feet of granite on five acres as a protective
  “underground city” to shield occupants from threats , including an electromagnetic pulse and even a 30-megaton nuclear
  explosion as close as 1.2 miles away <span class="source">McKee, S. (2019, April 12). <a

    Gazette</span>. The affordance of such protection is a consideration when reflecting on why advanced civilizations
  in earlier epochs may have opted for a subterranean existence. Moreover, while places like the Cheyenne Mountain
  Complex are remarkably deep, they are still relatively close to the surface, and it is possible to go much farther
  down, with the deepest point humans have so far been underground being 4,000m (Ashanti's Mponeng gold mine in South
  Africa), while the farthest humans have dug is the Kola Superdeep Borehole in Russia, 7.6 miles deep (Piesing, 2019).
</p>
<p>It is thought humans could not live much deeper than the Mponeng gold mine due to heat . However, above that level it
  may be possible to survive for years: in Russia a 70-member sect lived in a bunker for nearly a decade, including 20
  children, many of whom had never seen sunlight <span class="source">Reuters. (2022, December 15). <a

    Check-No evidence of human remains dubbed ‘Mona Lisa’ found on the moon</a>. Reuters</span>. In such conditions, the
  main issue would be sunlight deprivation, which could increase susceptibility to myriad diseases, particularly through
  deficiency of vitamin D, though even this can be remedied by diet <span
    class="source">Palmer, B. (2012, August 12). <a
    href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2012/08/underground-russian-cult-uncovered-can-you-live-without-sunlight.html">Underground and under the weather</a>. Slate</span>.
  Moreover, it should be emphasized that the internal structure of Earth is still mostly a mystery, with discoveries
  constantly prompting re-appraisals; for instance, it was recently found that the mantle transition zone (255 to 410
  miles underground) acts as a large reservoir of water <span class="source">Schmandt, B., Jacobsen, S. D., Becker, T. W., Liu, Z., & Dueker, K. G. (2014). <a
    href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1253358">Dehydration melting at the top of the lower mantle</a>. Science,
    344(6189), 1265–1268</span>. We should also note that, vis-à-vis the CTH, the constraints mentioned here – from diet
  to inability to withstand heat – only apply to Homo sapiens as we are today. It is possible that, over a long period
  of time, another hominid species, or even a branch of Homo sapiens, could have adapted to live underground (though if
  so, their evolution would have been markedly different from our own, resulting in numerous divergent physiological
  characteristics). Indeed, adjacent to this topic is a fascinating line of enquiry known as cryptozoology: the study of
  species whose existence is not supported by strong empirical evidence but rather “hypothesized via indirect and
  uncertain information” <span class="source">Rossi, L. (2016). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-22246-2_26">A Review of Cryptozoology: Towards a Scientific Approach to the Study of “Hidden Animals.” In
    Problematic Wildlife</a> (pp. 573–588). Springer International Publishing</span>. As with the UAP topic, it has been
  derided as “pseudoscience” <span class="source">Schembri, E. (2011). <a
    href="https://doi.org/10.21083/surg.v5i1.1341">Cryptozoology as a Pseudoscience: Beasts in
    Transition</a>. SURG Journal, 5(1), 5–10</span>. However, also as per UAP studies, scholars like Rossi argue there
  is no a prior reason for this denigration, and it is possible to put the paradigm on a solid scientific footing.</p>
<p>A paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences, for instance, estimated roughly 20% of living
  mammal species remain undescribed, with the bulk of that predicted “hidden diversity” likely found among rodents and
  bats, two families with strong preferences for subterranean dens and nesting sites (Parsons et al., 2022). Among the
  most notorious candidates for hidden mammalian diversity is the <a href="/science/crypto/zoo/enquete/dossier/Bigfoot">“Sasquatch”
    or “Bigfoot,”</a> a large hairy primate purported to inhabit forests in North America (with similar legends of
  comparable creatures also found in other countries). Indeed, this was mentioned in relation to the <q>Alaska
    triangle</q> above, in which cryptozoologist Cliff Barackman is reported as saying <q>anything, of any size,</q>
  could be hiding in the wilderness: “With so much fantastic habitat and so few people to compete with, Sasquatches
  basically have the run of Alaska” <span class="source">Moran, M. (2023a, September 23). <a

    Triangle” where 20,000 people have vanished and UFOs appear.</a> Daily Star</span>. While disregarded by sceptics as
  “mythical,” the likelihood of its existence has been attested to by no less a figure as Jane Goodall, the world’s
  foremost primatologist <span class="source">Murgia, Joe (2023a, October 12). <a
    href="https://twitter.com/TheUfoJoe/status/1712485167791829339">If you study
    close encounters with UFOs, you’ll know Bigfoot shows up in many cases ...</a>. Twitter</span> <span
    class="note">Jane Goodall has been asked about Sasquatch (or “Bigfoot”) in many interviews (see Murgia, 2023a, for a compilation), and indeed says “everybody talks to me” about the subject. In one interview with Yahoo News she said, “I’m a romantic. I would like Bigfoot to exist. I’ve met people who swear they’ve seen bigfoot. And I think the interesting thing is that in every single continent there is an equivalent of Bigfoot or Sasquatch. There’s the Yeti. There’s the Yarri in Australia. There’s the Chinese wild man. And on and on and on. And I’ve had stories from people who … you have to believe them. So, there’s something. I don’t know what it is. I’m always open-minded.” Similarly, in an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, she recounted a story in which she was “in the midst of Ecuador, with jungle all around, and a few little isolated communities. And hunters used to go from community to community. So, I asked my translator, I said, ‘When you meet one of these hunters,’ all I said [to ask] was, ‘Have you seen a monkey without a tail?’ And five of them came back and said, ‘Oh yeah, there are monkeys without tails. They walk upright and they’re six foot high.” Asked by Kimmel what these could be, she said, “Maybe, you know, remnant Neanderthals or something.” In a third interview, she was even more definitive, saying emphatically, “I’m sure they exist. I’ve talked to so many Native Americans who all described the same sounds. Two who’ve seen them. I’ve probably got about, oh, thirty books [about similar creatures] that have come from different parts of the world.”</span>.
  Indeed, Bindernagel and Meldrum <span class="source">Bindernagel, J., & Meldrum, J. (2012). Misunderstandings arising from treating the sasquatch as a subject of
    cryptozoology. The Relict Hominoid Inquiry, 2, 81–102</span> argue that dismissals of its possibility <q>has more to
    do with unawareness of evidence for its existence as a North American mammal than the absence of such evidence</q> –
  with such evidence actually being quite solid and genuine – and that reasons for resistance is the topic <q>challenges
    prevailing knowledge</q> (p.81). Even more relevantly here, some UAP cases involve apparent NHIs that resemble such
  creatures; in Brazil, a farmer reported encountering a craft that had crashed on his property, out of which two
  “animals” appeared, one of which was a stereotypical “<a href="/science/crypto/ufo/observation/etre/gris">Grey</a>”
  alien humanoid, but the other was “hairy, like a sloth” <span class="source">Correrio. (2022, January 1). <a
    href="https://www.correio24horas.com.br/entre/ha-27-anos-queda-de-ovni-em-feira-teria-mobilizado-ate-o-exercito-relembre-0122">Há
    27 anos, queda de ovni em Feira teria mobilizado até o Exército; relembre</a> [27 years ago, a UFO crash in Feira
    would have even mobilized the Army; remember]. Correrio</span>. That said, there are also reasons to be sceptical
  about the potential existence of such creatures. For instance, one often-overlooked counterargument regarding the
  existence of a self-sustaining population of Sasquatch is that nearly all primate species are intelligent, social, and
  curious animals. Because this mythical creature is classified as a member of the primate order of mammals, and
  considering its bipedal form of locomotion would be a member of the hominin clade specifically – which is the most
  intelligent and curious of all primates – one would expect to see Sasquatches frequently peering into villages and
  rummaging through trash cans; however, such instances are rarely if ever reported. On the other hand though, it is
  also possible that Sasquatches could be an anomalously solitary form of primate, hence their general elusiveness.</p>
<p>Another prominent arena of intrigue within cryptozoology involves seemingly anomalous skeletal remains that purport
  to subvert our understanding of evolutionary development. This includes speculation, for instance, suggesting that
  such biologics may be extraterrestrial in nature, although so far, they have generally been ascertained to be more
  prosaic in origin, or at least their analysis has proved inconclusive. One case is the Chilean Atacama skeleton – the
  15 cm remains of a human fetus with an unusually shaped skull reminiscent of classic depictions of aliens – which
  Nolan and Butte <span class="source"><span class="people">Nolan, Garry</span>, & Butte, A. (2018). <a

    Atacama skeleton</a>. Genome Research, 28(5), 607–608</span> concluded was merely a human girl <q>with many DNA
    mutations, not anything more exotic.</q> Another prominent example emerged as this article was being written – and
  which is still being studied and debated – centring on two tiny, mummified bodies, with elongated heads and three
  fingers on each hand and foot, allegedly found in Peru in <time>2017</time>. These were dramatically and
  controversially presented before the Mexican Congress in a UAP hearing in <time>2023-09</time> by self-proclaimed
  “ufologist” Jaime Maussan, who claimed they were extraterrestrial in origin. However, while tests on these specimens
  are still underway, on balance most observers seem sceptical that they are genuine <span class="source">Norton, T. (2023, September 15). <a
    href="https://www.newsweek.com/alien-bodies-mexico-debunked-ufo-jaime-maussan-nasa-1827093">Have “alien” bodies shown in Mexico already been debunked? What to know.</a>
    Newsweek</span>, including us, for reasons we elucidate in an endnote <span class="note">The immediate reaction to the “Nasca mummies” presented by Maussan was overwhelmingly sceptical, with an article in Newsweek immediately after, titled “Have 'alien' bodies shown in Mexico already been debunked?” (Norton, 2023), exemplifying the general tone. Based on the assessment of multiple radiographs and images from CT scans carried out by the third author of the current article, who holds a PhD in biological anthropology with a specialization in hominin evolutionary and comparative anatomy, among the most glaring suggestions of their inauthenticity are: (1) a lack of bilateral symmetry within each individual specimen; (2) no consistency in skeletal morphology across the various specimens presented, indicating a lack of synapomorphies and therefore no shared evolutionary relationship, which, in addition to a clear observable trend toward a more sophisticated manner in which the bones are organized, is highly suggestive of a change over time in how they were fabricated; (3) that some of the bones used in their construction were taken from adolescents, as indicated by unfused epiphyses on the long bones, while other epiphyses within the same specimen are fully fused, indicating they were taken from different individuals of different ages and combined to make a new entity; (4) that some of the bones used were cut off at the ends, others were taken from the arms and used as legs and vice versa, while animal bones were used in place of human bones in certain specimens; (5) a glaring lack of functional articulation points, to the extent that – in a “form follows function” basic biomechanics capacity – none of these diminutive creatures would have been capable of moving any of their body parts and would therefor lack mobility for even simple tasks; (6) metal, stick, glue, and other inorganic objects used to hold the bones in place; see for example the type specimen (NA-01) dubbed “Josephina,” who has an acknowledged metal plate stretching mediolaterally and inferior to the clavicle, connecting the left and right side near the anterior surface of the two scapulae, which was considered to have been “implanted…to stabilize her broken and healed clavicle” (Miles, 2022), while the more parsimonious explanation is that the metal piece was inserted to keep the left and right sides of the body from detaching during and after construction. Additionally, other inorganic connectors can be seen in the wrist and hand morphology of certain specimens, which themselves are a mess of various carpals, metacarpals, phalanges, and occasionally metatarsals, which are often turned in the opposite direction, and as with many of the long bones, lack any sensical articulation points; (7) despite possessing a mouth (with no dentition and highly erratic and disjointed masticatory anatomy), if these creatures were to consume any food (or breath for that matter), there is no oesophagus or trachea connecting the mouth to the rest of the body, which would prohibit basic functions like eating and breathing; and (8) on the whole, these specimens lack clear provenience, especially considering that “two figurines turned up in the Lima airport offices of courier DHL in a cardboard box, and were made to look like mummified bodies dressed in traditional Andean attire,” which, according to Flavio Estrada, and archaeologist with Peru’s Institute for Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences, “They’re not extraterrestrials. They’re dolls made from animal bones from this planet joined together with modern synthetic glue… it’s totally a made-up story” (Aquino, 2024). This remains the general consensus among scientists: “The opinion of academics, archaeologists, and scientists is unanimous: Part of these mummies are modified pre-Hispanic human bodies, while the rest, especially the smaller ones—like those presented this week in the Mexican Congress—are bodies assembled with animal and human bones” (Lagos, 2023). That said, we ought to acknowledge that numerous other similar specimens have allegedly been discovered, as discussed on a recent episode of That UFO Podcast (2024). As such, extending the spirit of openness that we have sought to bring to this paper more generally, we cannot necessarily assume that our scepticism regarding the specimens associated with Maussan would necessarily apply to other cases. That said, based on our analysis of this particular case, we are generally sceptical of the entire “mummies” phenomenon – at least until further evidence emerges</span>.
  Somewhat relatedly, there is a long history of tales, and potentially even suggestive evidence, of the skeletal
  remains and other traces of species of humanoid “giants” <span class="note">Many cultures have legends of races of giants that were once supposed to have roamed the Earth, with such myths reflected in place names associated with these beings, like Giant’s Causeway in Ireland, or Asthipura (“Town of Bones”) in India, thought to contain remains of the great warriors – which include giants – of the epic battle of Mahabharata (Mayor, 2007). Perhaps most interesting vis-à-vis this notion of “giants” is that people claim to have actually found evidence of such. Some consists of apparent fossilized traces of huge humanoid beings, such as giant footprint about 1.2 m long in granite near Mpuluzi in South Africa (Doyle & Wieland, 2012). Another source of intrigue are forms of architecture that seem too large to have been designed for humans, such as a recently unearthed and previously-unknown “biblical-era” layer of the Philistine city of Gath in Israel, which dates to the 11th Century BCE when – especially pertinently – according to Samuel I 17, the future King David slew the giant Goliath. (Borschel, 2019). Finally, there have long been reports of large skeletons, with over 1,000 accounts of seven-foot and taller skeletons found in ancient burial sites over a two-hundred-year period in North America alone (Newman, 2022)</span>;
  here again there are probably good reasons for scepticism, though as with other aspects of this topic we would not
  simply want to dismiss such ideas out of hand.</p>
<p>Of particular relevance here are claims of an intelligent cryptozoological species thriving underground. Across
  cultures are legends for instance of anthropomorphic reptilian races, such as the Nagas, a semi-divine species of
  half-human, half-serpent beings thought to reside in Patala (a netherworld), venerated in Hinduism and Buddhism <span
    class="source">Vogel, J. P. (1995). Indian serpent-lore: or, The Nāgas in Hindu legend and art. Asian Educational Services</span>.
  Moreover, palaeontologists have even speculated whether such creatures could possibly have evolved from known
  zoological origins; Russell and Séguin <span class="source">Russell, D. A., & Séguin, R. (1982). Reconstruction of the small Cretaceous theropod Stenonychosaurus inequalis
    and a hypothetical dinosauroid. Syllogeus, 37, 1–43</span> analysed the morphological trends among dinosaurs towards
  larger brains and upright posture in relation to a species called a troodon, and suggested that had it survived the
  mass extinction event 65 million years ago, it would likely have evolved into an upright reptilian-like figure they
  dubbed a “dinosauroid.” Crucially, some people argue it could actually have survived the extinction and continued to
  develop by retreating below ground <span class="source">Redfern, N. (2007). Memoirs of a Monster Hunter: A Five-Year Journey in Search of the Unknown. Weiser</span>,
  though it is unclear how viable this theory is. Even so, it is intriguing that “reptilians” have long been associated
  with the UAP topic, with speculation that some such species does indeed represent an NHI that may be responsible for
  some UAP <span class="source">Kasten, K. (2017). Alien World Order: The Reptilian Plan to Divide and Conquer the Human Race. Bear &
    Company</span>. As mentioned in endnote 13, for example, John Ramirez has claimed that such entities are “walking
  among us” disguised convincingly as regular humans <span class="source">Verma, V. (2023b, May 30). <a
    href="https://www.howandwhys.com/ex-cia-officer-encountered-with-reptilian-alien-says-reptilian-race-walking-among-us/">Ex-CIA
    officer encountered with reptilian alien; Says reptilian race walking among us</a>. How and Why’s</span>. Indeed, he
  speculates authorities are aware of these NHIs, pointing for example to the National Reconnaissance Office – which he
  calls <q>the actual secret space program of the US intelligence community</q> – using lizards on their logos, and
  suggests such entities are <q>crawling all over the Earth.</q> Another possibility, overlapping with the
  extraterrestrial hypothesis, is that an NHI could have arrived on Earth from elsewhere at some point and subsequently
  taken up residence underground or underwater, or otherwise concealed itself nearby (e.g., on the moon) <span
    class="note">The possibility of an extraterrestrial civilization visiting Earth and taking up subterranean residence before the emergence of Homo sapiens is one possible explanation for a CTH. That said, their arrival would not necessarily have to pre-date humans. Ever since Erich von Däniken’s (1968) hugely popular book Chariots of the Gods? Unsolved Mysteries of the Past, there has been a rich seam of speculation that extraterrestrial entities may have interacted with and even guided humans (with Däniken arguing that technologies and religions of many ancient civilizations were given to them by these visitors, who were interpreted and welcomed as gods). Indeed, an even more radical possibility is that we Homo sapiens have an extraterrestrial origin (Lomas & Case, 2024), whether: life in general being seeded from elsewhere, known as panspermia, as famously suggested by the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, Francis Crick (Crick & Orgel, 1973); or Homo sapiens specifically, as articulated by for instance by ecologist Ellis Silver (2022); or whether we did originate here but have somehow had our evolution and DNA manipulated by extraterrestrials, possible via interbreeding, as argued by Fenton and Fenton (2020). Indeed, even figures who represent a more “mainstream” perspective on evolution are open to such ideas; Richard Dawkins for example was interviewed in 2008 and said, “It could be that at some earlier time, somewhere in the Universe, a civilization evolved, by probably some kind of Darwinian means, to a very, very high-level of technology, and designed a form of life that they seeded onto, perhaps this planet. Now, that is a possibility and an intriguing possibility. And I suppose it's possible that you might find evidence for that if you look at the details of our chemistry and molecular biology. You might find a signature of some sort of designer, and that designer could well be a higher intelligence from elsewhere in the Universe” (cited by Murgia, 2023b). Even more relevantly, people have explicitly connected these ideas to the UAP topic. <span
    class="people">Coulthart</span> (2023b) says he has “a hunch from tips that have been dropped to me [by sources in the intelligence community] that our origins are probably because of those NHIs … and that a lot of our pre-history is better explained if you take into account the idea that there has been an NHI presence on this planet for much of human evolution and history.” Making a similar point, Kastrup (2023) predicted that “within the next 20 years (perhaps sooner), we will witness three tightly inter-related, gigantic revolutions in our understanding of reality,” including “the official recognition of the presence and role of non-human intelligence (NHI) throughout our history” (with the other two being firstly the “rejection of physicalism and embracement of idealism as the only plausible metaphysics,” and secondly “a new understanding of the nature of time that will revolutionise the ontological status of past and future, as well as our understanding of the meaning of birth and death”)</span>.
</p>
<p>Then, as to the central question of whether any intelligent species – Homo sapiens or otherwise – has actually gone
  underground in the past, there is no direct or generally accepted evidence. However, not only are there many such
  legends, a surprisingly extensive body of reports exists alleging encounters with such beings. In terms of legends,
  many cultures have myths about realms under the earth, ranging from “underworld” places associated with death and the
  afterlife, such as Sheol in Hebrew teachings <span class="source">Sanders, S. (2009). The first tour of hell: From neo-Assyrian propaganda to early Jewish revelation. Journal of
    Ancient Near Eastern Religions, 9(2), 151–169</span>, to fabled kingdoms inhabited by godlike figures, such as
  Shambhala in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition <span class="source">Maclellan, A. (2011). The lost world of Agharti: The mystery of vril power. Souvenir Press</span>.
  Moreover, people persuaded of the reality of these places have embarked on quests to find them. Numerous locations
  have been proposed for entrances to Shambhala for instance, with explorers from the Soviet Union in particular making
  considerable efforts to find it. These include a mission by the Soviet Foreign Commissariat to search Tibet in <time>1924</time>
  <span class="source">Znamenski, A. (2012). Red Shambhala: Magic, prophecy, and geopolitics in the heart of Asia. Quest Books.</span>,
  and an expedition from <time>1924/1928</time> by prominent theosophists Nicholas and Helena Roerich, covering vast
  areas of Central Asia, including Belukha Mountain in the Altai Mountains (along the border of Russia and Kazakhstan),
  which in the region is commonly believed to host such an entrance <span class="source">McCannon, J. (2002). <a

    Nicholas Roerich</a>. Sibirica, 2(2)</span>. However, such efforts to locate these realms have seemingly proved
  fruitless, and their supposed inhabitants elusive.</p>
<p>That said, certain locales have attracted considerable interest as potential places to which an advanced civilization
  may have retreated, and moreover have even accrued reports of engagement with their members. Among the most well-known
  is Mount Shasta, a currently dormant volcano in the Cascade Range in California. Long revered as sacred by indigenous
  tribes of the region <span class="source">Hall, B. L., & Hall, M. J. (2004). Shasta Nation. Arcadia Publishing</span>,
  more recently it has also become a magnet for “non-indigenous spiritual pilgrims” <span class="source">Huntsinger, L., & Fernández‐giménez, M. (2000). <a
    href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1931-0846.2000.tb00353.x">Spiritual Pilgrims at Mount Shasta, California</a>. Geographical
    Review, 90(4), 536–558</span>. One contributing factor to the latter are stories emerging in the early 20th century
  linking it to the myth of Lemuria (see endnote 21), suggesting that before this legendary civilization disappeared
  beneath the ocean, some survivors trekked over land to the American continent and eventually took refuge inside the
  mountain <span class="note">The first author to connect Mount Shasta to Lemuria was apparently Frederick Spencer Oliver (1899), who presented himself as an amanuensis for a “spirit” named Phylos the Thibetan. His book made claims of a tunnel to a secret city inside Mount Shasta, which hosted a “mystic brotherhood” of escapees from Lemuria. Similarly, Beckley (1993) includes a narrative given by a woman who claims to be a princess, called Sharula, from Telos, a subterranean city beneath the mountain with a population of some 1.5 million, apparently constructed about 14,000 years ago at the collapse of Lemuria around the end of the Ice Age. Likewise, Hamilton (1986) gives an account of this same person, suggesting Telos was built inside an “artificial dome-shaped cavern in the Earth a mile or so beneath Mount Shasta.” Other texts offer further details about this realm and its supposed inhabitants. Cerve (1931) wrote of “odd-looking persons” who were “tall, graceful, and agile … with larger heads, much larger foreheads” who would visit local towns and “trade nuggets and gold dust for some modern commodities.” Likewise, Lanser (1932) said “The Lemurians have been seen on various occasions; they have been encountered in the Shasta forest, but only for a brief glimpse, for they possess the uncanny secret knowledge of the Tibetan masters and, if they desire, can blend themselves into their surroundings and vanish. At times they came into the neighboring towns--tall, barefoot, noble-looking men.” Moreover, Maurice Doreal (no date) even suggested he himself had been invited into the underground realm in 1931 by two inhabitants who had attended his lecture. He claimed they came to a space “about two miles in height and about twenty miles long and fifteen miles wide and it was as light as a bright summer day, because suspended, almost in the center of that great cavern of space was a giant glowing mass of light” (p.14). Somewhat similarly, in Beckley’s (1993) account, Sharula claimed
  Telos has “perpetual light through a process of energizing stones to create full spectrum lighting,” whereby the inhabitants can “process them with the forces that make small suns” (p.122)</span>.
  Of course, these stories are most likely nothing more than imaginative fictions or embellished rumours. Sceptics would
  surely point to the appeal of occult philosophies during that era, viewing these narratives perhaps as literary
  attempts to capitalize on these trends. However, Mt. Shasta continues to be notorious for unusual activity, which
  helps explain its growing appeal to spiritual pilgrims. Relatedly, the mountain is also infamous for numerous
  mysterious disappearances, in which people have gone missing without a trace <span class="source">Srivastava, A. (2021, October 28). <a

  Then, to return to our central UAP theme, Wallenstein <span class="source">Wallenstein, B. D. (2012). Mount Shasta Sightings. Universal Template. Wang, M. ., & Shi, G. (2020). The evolution
    of Chinese jade carving craftsmanship. Gems & Gemology, 56(1), 30–53</span> notes the mountain is one of the most
  prominent UAP hotspots in the US: www.ufosightingsusa.com (2023) records 25 officially reported sightings from 1995 to
  2020, and there even seems to be recent photographic evidence of UAP emerging out of its peak, including one described
  as a <q>large light</q> with a cigar-shaped object directly below it, which suddenly took off and disappeared from
  sight <span class="source">Kettley, S. (2019, April 28). <a

<p>To that point, in our final section below we return to our main theme, and the reason people are contemplating a CTH,
  namely UAP activity suggestive of NHI actually having some durable concealed presence on Earth. First though, our
  discussion would be lacking if we did not touch upon an area of speculation that is even stranger than the material
  above, bringing us even further into unusual ontological territory, but which is nevertheless a prominent theme across
  cultures worldwide, and even more relevantly is a long-standing topic within the UAP arena. This concerns what might
  be called “magical” cryptoterrestrials.</p>
