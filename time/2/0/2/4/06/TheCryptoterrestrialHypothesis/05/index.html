<p>Just as recent centuries have seen a proliferation of legends about lost civilizations, so have flourished myths
  about their people retreating underground and continuing to prosper. Before considering these, it is worth noting that
  the idea of subterranean living is not outlandish. Indeed, many historical underground cities have been found, most
  famously Derinkuyu in Turkey (Jacobs, 2022)24. Relatedly, recent decades have seen the construction of numerous
  underground complexes, most notably military bases, with an estimated 10,000 worldwide (Richelson, 2013). For example,
  the Cheyenne Mountain Complex – a Space Force installation in Colorado, which used to host the North American
  Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) – was built under 2,000 feet of granite on five acres as a protective “underground
  city” to shield occupants from threats , including an electromagnetic pulse and even a 30-megaton nuclear explosion as
  close as 1.2 miles away (McKee, 2019). The affordance of such protection is a consideration when reflecting on why
  advanced civilizations in earlier epochs may have opted for a subterranean existence. Moreover, while places like the
  Cheyenne Mountain Complex are remarkably deep, they are still relatively close to the surface, and it is possible to
  go much farther down, with the deepest point humans have so far been underground being 4,000m (Ashanti's Mponeng gold
  mine in South Africa), while the farthest humans have dug is the Kola Superdeep Borehole in Russia, 7.6 miles deep
  (Piesing, 2019).</p>
<p>It is thought humans could not live much deeper than the Mponeng gold mine due to heat . However, above that level it
  may be possible to survive for years: in Russia a 70-member sect lived in a bunker for nearly a decade, including 20
  children, many of whom had never seen sunlight (Reuters, 2012). In such conditions, the main issue would be sunlight
  deprivation, which could increase susceptibility to myriad diseases, particularly through deficiency of vitamin D,
  though even this can be remedied by diet (Palmer, 2012). Moreover, it should be emphasized that the internal structure
  of Earth is still mostly a mystery, with discoveries constantly prompting re-appraisals; for instance, it was recently
  found that the mantle transition zone (255 to 410 miles underground) acts as a large reservoir of water (Schmandt et
  al., 2014). We should also note that, vis-à-vis the CTH, the constraints mentioned here – from diet to inability to
  withstand heat – only apply to Homo sapiens as we are today. It is possible that, over a long period of time, another
  hominid species, or even a branch of Homo sapiens, could have adapted to live underground (though if so, their
  evolution would have been markedly different from our own, resulting in numerous divergent physiological
  characteristics). Indeed, adjacent to this topic is a fascinating line of enquiry known as cryptozoology: the study of
  species whose existence is not supported by strong empirical evidence but rather “hypothesized via indirect and
  uncertain information” (Rossi, 2016, p.573). As with the UAP topic, it has been derided as “pseudoscience” (Schembri,
  2011). However, also as per UAP studies, scholars like Rossi argue there is no a prior reason for this denigration,
  and it is possible to put the paradigm on a solid scientific footing.</p>
<p>A paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences, for instance, estimated roughly 20% of living
  mammal species remain undescribed, with the bulk of that predicted “hidden diversity” likely found among rodents and
  bats, two families with strong preferences for subterranean dens and nesting sites (Parsons et al., 2022). Among the
  most notorious candidates for hidden mammalian diversity is the “Sasquatch” or “Bigfoot,” a large hairy primate
  purported to inhabit forests in North America (with similar legends of comparable creatures also found in other
  countries). Indeed, this was mentioned in relation to the “Alaska triangle” above, in which cryptozoologist Cliff
  Barackman is reported as saying “anything, of any size,” could be hiding in the wilderness: “With so much fantastic
  habitat and so few people to compete with, Sasquatches basically have the run of Alaska” (Moran, 2023a). While
  disregarded by sceptics as “mythical,” the likelihood of its existence has been attested to by no less a figure as
  Jane Goodall, the world’s foremost primatologist (Murgia, 2023a)25. Indeed, Bindernagel and Meldrum (2012) argue that
  dismissals of its possibility “has more to do with unawareness of evidence for its existence as a North American
  mammal than the absence of such evidence” – with such evidence actually being quite solid and genuine – and that
  reasons for resistance is the topic “challenges prevailing knowledge” (p.81). Even more relevantly here, some UAP
  cases involve apparent NHIs that resemble such creatures; in Brazil, a farmer reported encountering a craft that had
  crashed on his property, out of which two “animals” appeared, one of which was a stereotypical “Grey” alien humanoid,
  but the other was “hairy, like a sloth” (Correrio, 2022). That said, there are also reasons to be sceptical about the
  potential existence of such creatures. For instance, one often-overlooked counterargument regarding the existence of a
  self-sustaining population of Sasquatch is that nearly all primate species are intelligent, social, and curious
  animals. Because this mythical creature is classified as a member of the primate order of mammals, and considering its
  bipedal form of locomotion would be a member of the hominin clade specifically – which is the most intelligent and
  curious of all primates – one would expect to see Sasquatches frequently peering into villages and rummaging through
  trash cans; however, such instances are rarely if ever reported. On the other hand though, it is also possible that
  Sasquatches could be an anomalously solitary form of primate, hence their general elusiveness.</p>
<p>Another prominent arena of intrigue within cryptozoology involves seemingly anomalous skeletal remains that purport
  to subvert our understanding of evolutionary development. This includes speculation, for instance, suggesting that
  such biologics may be extraterrestrial in nature, although so far, they have generally been ascertained to be more
  prosaic in origin, or at least their analysis has proved inconclusive. One case is the Chilean Atacama skeleton – the
  15 cm remains of a human fetus with an unusually shaped skull reminiscent of classic depictions of aliens – which
  Nolan and Butte (2018) concluded was merely a human girl “with many DNA mutations, not anything more exotic.” Another
  prominent example emerged as this article was being written – and which is still being studied and debated – centring
  on two tiny, mummified bodies, with elongated heads and three fingers on each hand and foot, allegedly found in Peru
  in 2017. These were dramatically and controversially presented before the Mexican Congress in a UAP hearing in
  September 2023 by self-proclaimed “ufologist” Jaime Maussan, who claimed they were extraterrestrial in origin.
  However, while tests on these specimens are still underway, on balance most observers seem sceptical that they are
  genuine (Norton, 2023), including us, for reasons we elucidate in an endnote26. Somewhat relatedly, there is a long
  history of tales, and potentially even suggestive evidence, of the skeletal remains and other traces of species of
  humanoid “giants”27; here again there are probably good reasons for scepticism, though as with other aspects of this
  topic we would not simply want to dismiss such ideas out of hand.</p>
<p>Of particular relevance here are claims of an intelligent cryptozoological species thriving underground. Across
  cultures are legends for instance of anthropomorphic reptilian races, such as the Nagas, a semi-divine species of
  half-human, half-serpent beings thought to reside in Patala (a netherworld), venerated in Hinduism and Buddhism
  (Vogel, 1995). Moreover, palaeontologists have even speculated whether such creatures could possibly have evolved from
  known zoological origins; Russell and Séguin (1982) analysed the morphological trends among dinosaurs towards larger
  brains and upright posture in relation to a species called a troodon, and suggested that had it survived the mass
  extinction event 65 million years ago, it would likely have evolved into an upright reptilian-like figure they dubbed
  a “dinosauroid.” Crucially, some people argue it could actually have survived the extinction and continued to develop
  by retreating below ground (Redfern, 2007), though it is unclear how viable this theory is. Even so, it is intriguing
  that “reptilians” have long been associated with the UAP topic, with speculation that some such species does indeed
  represent an NHI that may be responsible for some UAP (Kasten, 2017). As mentioned in endnote 13, for example, John
  Ramirez has claimed that such entities are “walking among us” disguised convincingly as regular humans (Verma, 2023b).
  Indeed, he speculates authorities are aware of these NHIs, pointing for example to the National Reconnaissance Office
  – which he calls “the actual secret space program of the US intelligence community” – using lizards on their logos,
  and suggests such entities are “crawling all over the Earth.” Another possibility, overlapping with the
  extraterrestrial hypothesis, is that an NHI could have arrived on Earth from elsewhere at some point and subsequently
  taken up residence underground or underwater, or otherwise concealed itself nearby (e.g., on the moon)28.</p>
<p>Then, as to the central question of whether any intelligent species – Homo sapiens or otherwise – has actually gone
  underground in the past, there is no direct or generally accepted evidence. However, not only are there many such
  legends, a surprisingly extensive body of reports exists alleging encounters with such beings. In terms of legends,
  many cultures have myths about realms under the earth, ranging from “underworld” places associated with death and the
  afterlife, such as Sheol in Hebrew teachings (Sanders, 2009), to fabled kingdoms inhabited by godlike figures, such as
  Shambhala in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition (Maclellan, 2011). Moreover, people persuaded of the reality of these
  places have embarked on quests to find them. Numerous locations have been proposed for entrances to Shambhala for
  instance, with explorers from the Soviet Union in particular making considerable efforts to find it. These include a
  mission by the Soviet Foreign Commissariat to search Tibet in 1924 (Znamenski, 2012), and an expedition from 1924 to
  1928 by prominent theosophists Nicholas and Helena Roerich, covering vast areas of Central Asia, including Belukha
  Mountain in the Altai Mountains (along the border of Russia and Kazakhstan), which in the region is commonly believed
  to host such an entrance (McCannon, 2002). However, such efforts to locate these realms have seemingly proved
  fruitless, and their supposed inhabitants elusive.</p>
<p>That said, certain locales have attracted considerable interest as potential places to which an advanced civilization
  may have retreated, and moreover have even accrued reports of engagement with their members. Among the most well-known
  is Mount Shasta, a currently dormant volcano in the Cascade Range in California. Long revered as sacred by indigenous
  tribes of the region (Hall & Hall, 2004), more recently it has also become a magnet for “non-indigenous spiritual
  pilgrims” (Huntsinger & Fernández‐Giménez, 2000). One contributing factor to the latter are stories emerging in the
  early 20th century linking it to the myth of Lemuria (see endnote 21), suggesting that before this legendary
  civilization disappeared beneath the ocean, some survivors trekked over land to the American continent and eventually
  took refuge inside the mountain29. Of course, these stories are most likely nothing more than imaginative fictions or
  embellished rumours. Sceptics would surely point to the appeal of occult philosophies during that era, viewing these
  narratives perhaps as literary attempts to capitalize on these trends. However, Mt. Shasta continues to be notorious
  for unusual activity, which helps explain its growing appeal to spiritual pilgrims. Relatedly, the mountain is also
  infamous for numerous mysterious disappearances, in which people have gone missing without a trace (Srivastava, 2021).
  Then, to return to our central UAP theme, Wallenstein (2012) notes the mountain is one of the most prominent UAP
  hotspots in the US: www.ufosightingsusa.com (2023) records 25 officially reported sightings from 1995 to 2020, and
  there even seems to be recent photographic evidence of UAP emerging out of its peak, including one described as a
  “large light” with a cigar-shaped object directly below it, which suddenly took off and disappeared from sight
  (Kettley, 2019).</p>
<p>To that point, in our final section below we return to our main theme, and the reason people are contemplating a CTH,
  namely UAP activity suggestive of NHI actually having some durable concealed presence on Earth. First though, our
  discussion would be lacking if we did not touch upon an area of speculation that is even stranger than the material
  above, bringing us even further into unusual ontological territory, but which is nevertheless a prominent theme across
  cultures worldwide, and even more relevantly is a long-standing topic within the UAP arena. This concerns what might
  be called “magical” cryptoterrestrials.</p>
