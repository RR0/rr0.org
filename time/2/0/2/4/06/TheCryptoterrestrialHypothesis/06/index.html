<p>The ideas canvassed thus far, while not generally accepted by contemporary natural science paradigms, nevertheless
  still fit somewhat within their rough boundaries. Aliens on the ocean floor or subterranean hominids would be highly
  surprising but not genuinely metaphysically revisionary in any strong sense, and essentially just involve
  extrapolating from activities in which we humans already undeniably engage, from flying spacecraft to living in caves.
  However, as noted above, a striking feature of the UAP topic has been the extent to which its phenomena seem to resist
  explanation in conventional terms (e.g., craft without visible means of propulsion or sources of exhaust). Such
  observations have prompted some observers, including in the US federal government and defense establishment, to
  speculate that unconventional “ultraterrestrial” explanations are precisely what is called for – from interdimensional
  beings (Lomas, 2023a), to future human time travellers (Masters, 2019; 2022), to the panoply of aethereal NHIs
  recognized in most cultures, such as the class of beings known in the contemporary West as angels (Lomas & Case,
  2023), which Case and Lomas (forthcoming) label “sacraterrestrials” or “aetherrestrials.” Most relevantly here, among
  these varied unconventional hypotheses is a fascinating class of proposed ultraterrestrial beings that overlap with
  notions like angels but which can still be considered part of the cryptoterrestrial paradigm. Specifically, this is
  the crowd of concealed or fully integrated terrestrial NHIs, or perhaps Non-Conventional Human Intelligences, that go
  by many names the world over, but which have traditionally been grouped in European cultures under the broad heading
  of “faerie” or “longaevi,” the “longlivers”: fairies, elves, gnomes, brownies, trolls, and the like. As Lewis (1960)
  noted in his study of the medieval worldview, the longaevi’s “place of residence is ambiguous between air and earth,”
  with their nature conceived as “a third rational species distinct from angels and men” (p.124, 129).</p>
<p>One of the most compendious and influential sources of pre-modern fairy lore, for example, is the Rev. Robert Kirk’s
  1691 book The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns, and Fairies (Kirk, 2021), a survey of Scots-Irish folk beliefs
  regarding faerie, at least some of which he deemed credible30. The pre-modern traditions about these beings collected
  by Kirk feature tales of a subterranean civilization engaging in uncanny aerial apparitions and periodically abducting
  humans (usually for brief periods). This, of course, has important family resemblances to the CTH, albeit without the
  Space-Age framing which is so intuitive for us today. It might well be that some part of the “magical” framing is the
  result of pre-modern attempts to interpret advanced technology, whether extraterrestrial, inter-temporal, or
  cryptoterrestrial. After all, according to Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law, “any sufficiently advanced technology is
  indistinguishable from magic.” However, we ought not rule out the “magical” framing potentially being at least as
  close to the truth as the technological one, which could itself be an imposition by observers anchored on the tropes
  and techniques of the Space Age (Lomas & Case, 2023). It bears emphasis that, while Kirk took these traditions and
  reports seriously, he was hardly credulous: he justified his “modest inquiry” into such phenomena by reflecting, “How
  much is written of pygmies, fairies, nymphs, sirens, apparitions, which though not the tenth part true, yet could not
  spring of nothing?” (p.64) And while contemporary readers might feel justified in thinking all such reports are now
  intrinsically incredible, this arguably has more to do with metaphysical prejudices than with any growth in our
  empirical or theoretical acquaintance with the world.</p>
<p>As philosopher and theologian David Bentley Hart (2009) observed in an essay on Kirk’s Secret Commonwealth, “One need
  not believe in fairies to grasp that there is no good reason why one ought not to do so. To see the world as inhabited
  by these vital intelligences, or to believe that behind the outward forms of nature there might be an unperceived
  realm of intelligent order, is simply to respond rationally to one of the ways in which the world seems to address us,
  when we intuit simultaneously its rational frame and the depth of mystery it seems to hide from us.” Disbelief in the
  very possibility of fairies or other spiritual forms of life, however one defines them, might be entailed by a
  materialist metaphysics of mind (though even this is more often asserted than argued), but then, materialism (or
  physicalism or naturalism) has been subject to cogent critiques from a variety of “mind-first” or at least
  non-reductive standpoints, from Plato’s Phaedo right up to the present (Nagel, 2012; Hart, 2012; Kastrup, 2019).
  Indeed, Hart (2022) goes so far as to argue that classical theism entails the existence of something like
  fairies31.</p>
<p>Of course, one might concede the possibility of belief in the longaevi but reject their actuality on the empirical
  grounds that we simply can’t find them, any more than we can find unicorns or the Loch Ness monster. This is a more
  reasonable position, one even shared at least in part by Kirk and Hart themselves, but it too ought to be held
  lightly. After all, direct acquaintance with these phenomena has always been believed to be rare, and even today
  people continue to report a variety of broadly supernatural encounters. Most Icelanders for example are at least
  unwilling to deny the existence of the elves and trolls who figure so prominently in their folklore (Iceland Magazine,
  2016), while many Irish remain open to – or perhaps, fearful of – the existence of fairies (Phelan, 2023). And Hart
  (2012b) describes a sometime English acquaintance, Reuben, who believed himself to possess that “second sight” which
  allowed him to plainly see spiritual beings all around him, until a well-intentioned course of state-mandated
  anti-psychotic drugs “closed the door” within him, leaving him depressed and listless until his premature death a few
  years later. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat (2017) has even argued – as per Vallée (e.g., 2008) – that the most
  likely explanation of “contemporary U.F.O. narratives” is that they are “of a piece with stories about Northern
  European fairies and their worldwide kith and kin – and that it’s more reasonable to think that we’re reading our
  space age preoccupations into a persistent phenomenon that might be much weirder than a simple visitation from the
  stars” (cf. Douthat, 2023).</p>
<p>Moreover, some UAP reports, while not explicitly connected to traditions concerning fairies, bear striking
  resemblance to aspects of those traditions; indeed, this is the central theme of Vallée’s (1969) classic Passport to
  Magonia: On UFOs, Folklore, and Parallel Worlds. Some of the encounters described above – for instance, abductions
  near Mt. Shasta – already “rhyme” in significant ways with fairy lore. Another intriguing example is the spate of
  “airship” sightings in 1896-1897 that captivated attention in the US, which – as charted by Vallée – involve
  “aeronauts” interacting with witnesses in ways that have a strange dreamlike quality32. Perhaps even stranger are the
  occasional references to mysterious lands concealed within Earth that are home to NHI. In some sense, these could be
  regarded as “non-local,” in that they are not easily accommodated by a conventional understanding of Earth’s geology
  and geography, and instead seem suggestive of another terrestrial dimension that is usually unseen. One prominent
  rumour centres on a military mission from 1946-1947 known as Operation Highjump, led by Rear Admiral Richard Byrd,
  ostensibly to establish an Antarctic research base. The trip itself is well documented (e.g., Byrd, 1956). However,
  there have long been strange rumours regarding the mission, both in terms of its real purpose and actual outcome,
  including the claim that Byrd himself was pulled through some kind of “vortex” while flying and encountered a
  fantastical city inside the Earth inhabited by an advanced race of beings. Significantly, although certain aspects of
  these rumours have been debunked – as for instance explained on an episode of The Why Files (2022) – other parts are
  nevertheless potentially credible, including Byrd appearing to have a period of “missing time” on one of his flights,
  and intensive UAP activity that could be interpreted as being in the service of protecting a secret base33. As a
  result, the story has compelled the attention of UAP scholars over the years (Harrison, 2021). That said, it does
  likely fall into the category of myth rather than veridical reports, on a par with Churchward’s (1926) tales of Mu.
  Still, such is the sheer “high strangeness” of the UAP topic (Vallée & Davis, 2004) – and potentially also of
  Antarctica itself, about which there are numerous UAP-related narratives besides that associated with Byrd, including
  of NHI bases, as well as unusual photographic data that seems suggestive of anomalous structures34 – that we should
  not completely rule it out.</p>
