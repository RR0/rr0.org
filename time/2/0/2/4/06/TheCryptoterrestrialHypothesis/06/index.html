<p>The ideas canvassed thus far, while not generally accepted by contemporary natural science paradigms, nevertheless
  still fit somewhat within their rough boundaries. Aliens on the ocean floor or subterranean hominids would be highly
  surprising but not genuinely metaphysically revisionary in any strong sense, and essentially just involve
  extrapolating from activities in which we humans already undeniably engage, from flying spacecraft to living in caves.
  However, as noted above, a striking feature of the UAP topic has been the extent to which its phenomena seem to resist
  explanation in conventional terms (e.g., craft without visible means of propulsion or sources of exhaust). Such
  observations have prompted some observers, including in the US federal government and defense establishment, to
  speculate that unconventional “ultraterrestrial” explanations are precisely what is called for – from interdimensional
  beings <span class="source">Lomas, T. (2023). The ultraterrestrial hypothesis: A case for scientific openness to an “interdimensional”

  West as angels <span class="source">Lomas, T., & Case, B. (2023). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/zygo.12891">From angels to aliens: Humankind’s

  which Case and Lomas (forthcoming) label “sacraterrestrials” or “aetherrestrials.” Most relevantly here, among these
  varied unconventional hypotheses is a fascinating class of proposed ultraterrestrial beings that overlap with notions
  like angels but which can still be considered part of the cryptoterrestrial paradigm. Specifically, this is the crowd
  of concealed or fully integrated terrestrial NHIs, or perhaps Non-Conventional Human Intelligences, that go by many
  names the world over, but which have traditionally been grouped in European cultures under the broad heading of
  “faerie” or “longaevi,” the “longlivers”: fairies, elves, gnomes, brownies, trolls, and the like. As Lewis (1960)
  noted in his study of the medieval worldview, the longaevi’s <q>place of residence is ambiguous between air and
    earth,</q> with their nature conceived as “a third rational species distinct from angels and men” (p.124, 129).</p>
<p>One of the most compendious and influential sources of pre-modern fairy lore, for example, is the Rev. Robert Kirk’s
  1691 book The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns, and Fairies <span class="source">Kirk, R. (2021). The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns, and Fairies. Arabi Manor.</span>,
  a survey of Scots-Irish folk beliefs regarding faerie, at least some of which he deemed credible <span class="note">Kirk describes his subject as “the subterranean and (for the most part) invisible people” (p. 29), and notes that fairies “are said to be of a middle nature betwixt man and angel,” both as to their constitution – being framed “of intelligent studious spirits, and light changeable bodies, (like those called astral) somewhat of the nature of a condensed cloud” (p.51) – and as to their lifespan (“They live much longer than we; yet die at last, or at least vanish from that state” (p. 56)). While “their bodies of congealed air are sometimes carried aloft,” Kirk notes, their “ordinary dwellings” were thought to be subterranean, “the earth being full of cavities and cells, and there being…no such things as a pure wilderness in the whole universe” (p.52). Kirk describes reports of “women yet alive who tell that they were taken away when in child-bed to nurse Fairy children,” and were brought down into underground cities illuminated by “continual lamps and fires, often seen without fuel to sustain them” (p.56). He also emphasizes, however, that most people are completely incapable of seeing fairy-folk, this requiring some kind of mysterious “second sight,” an endowment which seems to be place-specific, with some seers reporting “that several did see the second sight when in the Highlands or the Isles, yet when transported to live in other countries, especially in America, they quite lose this quality” (p.78)</span>.
  The pre-modern traditions about these beings collected by Kirk feature tales of a subterranean civilization engaging
  in uncanny aerial apparitions and periodically abducting humans (usually for brief periods). This, of course, has
  important family resemblances to the CTH, albeit without the Space-Age framing which is so intuitive for us today. It
  might well be that some part of the “magical” framing is the result of pre-modern attempts to interpret advanced
  technology, whether extraterrestrial, intertemporal, or cryptoterrestrial. After all, according to Arthur C. Clarke’s
  Third Law, “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” However, we ought not rule out the
  “magical” framing potentially being at least as close to the truth as the technological one, which could itself be an
  imposition by observers anchored on the tropes and techniques of the Space Age <span class="source">Lomas, T., & Case, B. (2023). <a
    href="https://doi.org/10.1111/zygo.12891">From angels to aliens: Humankind’s
    ongoing encounters with, and evolving interpretations of, the genuine celestial unknown</a>. Zygon®, 58(3), 614–635</span>.
  It bears emphasis that, while Kirk took these traditions and reports seriously, he was hardly credulous: he justified
  his “modest inquiry” into such phenomena by reflecting, <q>How much is written of pygmies, fairies, nymphs, sirens,
    apparitions, which though not the tenth part true, yet could not spring of nothing?</q> (p.64) And while
  contemporary readers might feel justified in thinking all such reports are now intrinsically incredible, this arguably
  has more to do with metaphysical prejudices than with any growth in our empirical or theoretical acquaintance with the
  world.</p>
<p>As philosopher and theologian David Bentley Hart (2009) observed in an essay on Kirk’s Secret Commonwealth, <q>One
  need not believe in fairies to grasp that there is no good reason why one ought not to do so. To see the world as
  inhabited by these vital intelligences, or to believe that behind the outward forms of nature there might be an
  unperceived realm of intelligent order, is simply to respond rationally to one of the ways in which the world seems to
  address us, when we intuit simultaneously its rational frame and the depth of mystery it seems to hide from us.</q>
  Disbelief in the very possibility of fairies or other spiritual forms of life, however one defines them, might be
  entailed by a materialist metaphysics of mind (though even this is more often asserted than argued), but then,
  materialism (or physicalism or naturalism) has been subject to cogent critiques from a variety of “mind-first” or at
  least non-reductive standpoints, from Plato’s Phaedo right up to the present <span class="source">Nagel, T. (2012). Mind and Cosmos: Why the Neo-Darwinian, Materialist Conception of Reality Is Almost Certainly
    False. Oxford University Press</span> <span class="source">Hart, 2012</span> <span class="source">Kastrup, B. (2019). The Idea of the World: A Multi-Disciplinary Argument for the Mental Nature of Reality . IFF
    Books</span>. Indeed, Hart (2022) goes so far as to argue that classical theism entails the existence of something
  like fairies <span class="note">As Hart (2022) puts it, “If you believe that everything arises from an infinite act of mind – the rock over there no less than the intelligence in you – then you believe that there’s the presence of … an infinite knowing logos within the discrete logos that constitutes each thing as what it is. There’s a depth – even a personal depth, so to speak – in everything, an inner awareness that knows each reality from inside … or from deeper than inside … There is one who knows what it’s like to be a rock. And wouldn’t that infinite personal depth have to express itself … in a finite personal interiority of some sort? … A personal, reflective dimension as the necessarily contracted mode in which the contracted infinite act of mind is exemplified in that thing? And why shouldn’t we call that dimension or mode by its classical names – dryads, hamadryads, naiads, nereids … kami and tama … yaksas and yaksinis and gandharvas and apsaras … nymphs and fairies and elves and longaevi of every kind? (p.75)</span>.
</p>
<p>Of course, one might concede the possibility of belief in the longaevi but reject their actuality on the empirical
  grounds that we simply can’t find them, any more than we can find unicorns or the Loch Ness monster. This is a more
  reasonable position, one even shared at least in part by Kirk and Hart themselves, but it too ought to be held
  lightly. After all, direct acquaintance with these phenomena has always been believed to be rare, and even today
  people continue to report a variety of broadly supernatural encounters. Most Icelanders for example are at least
  unwilling to deny the existence of the elves and trolls who figure so prominently in their folklore (Iceland Magazine,
  2016), while many Irish remain open to – or perhaps, fearful of – the existence of fairies (Phelan, 2023). And Hart
  (2012b) describes a sometime English acquaintance, Reuben, who believed himself to possess that “second sight” which
  allowed him to plainly see spiritual beings all around him, until a well-intentioned course of state-mandated
  anti-psychotic drugs “closed the door” within him, leaving him depressed and listless until his premature death a few
  years later. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat <span class="source">Douthat, R. (2017, December 23). <a
    href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/opinion/alien-encounters-christmas-ufo.html">Flying saucers and other fairy tales</a>. The New York Times</span>
  has even argued – as per Vallée <span class="source"><span class="people">Vallée, Jacques</span> (2008). Dimensions: A Casebook of Alien Contact. Anomalist Books</span>
  – that the most likely explanation of “contemporary U.F.O. narratives” is that they are <q>of a piece with stories
    about Northern European fairies and their worldwide kith and kin – and that it’s more reasonable to think that we’re
    reading our space age preoccupations into a persistent phenomenon that might be much weirder than a simple
    visitation from the stars</q> <span class="source">Douthat, R. (2023, June 10). <a

</p>
<p>Moreover, some UAP reports, while not explicitly connected to traditions concerning fairies, bear striking
  resemblance to aspects of those traditions; indeed, this is the central theme of Vallée’s <span class="source"><span
    class="people">Vallée, Jacques</span> (1969). Passport to Magonia: On UFOs, Folklore, and Parallel Worlds.
    Henry Regnery Company</span> classic Passport to Magonia: On UFOs, Folklore, and Parallel Worlds. Some of the
  encounters described above – for instance, abductions near Mt. Shasta – already “rhyme” in significant ways with fairy
  lore. Another intriguing example is the spate of “airship” sightings in 1896-1897 that captivated attention in the US,
  which – as charted by Vallée – involve “aeronauts” interacting with witnesses in ways that have a strange dreamlike
  quality <span class="note">In 1896-1897, the US saw a spate of UAP sightings that seemed to resemble “airships,” curiously involving apparent technology that, as DeLonge and Levenda (2017) put it, was merely “twenty or thirty years (at most) beyond the capability” of humans at that time (p.89). Although sceptics have suggested such technology could have been within human reach at that point (Danalek, 2010), newspaper reports of the events are replete with unusual details that resist such explanations (see Busby, 1994), not least sightings of unusual beings. For example, in The Dallas Morning News, Haydon (1897) reported an airship had actually crashed, noting, “The pilot of this ship is supposed to have been the only one on board, and while his remains are badly disfigured, enough of the original has been picked up to show he was not an inhabitant of this world.” Most relevantly here though, some witnesses report interacting with the pilots of these airship, with these experiences resembling the uncanny encounters often found in fairy folklore. Even though many of the “aeronauts” were “indistinguishable from the average American population of the time,” as Vallée (2008) puts it, descriptions of interactions generally seem to have a strange dreamlike quality, as is evident in the examples cited by Vallée. In one report in the Arkansas Gazette, for example, Captain James Hooton describes encountering a “medium-size looking man aboard” as follows: “I noticed that he was wearing smoked glasses, [and] was tinkering around what seemed to be the back end of the ship, and as I approached I was too dumbfounded to speak. He looked at me in surprise, and said: "Good day, sir; good day." I asked: "Is this the airship?" And he replied: "Yes, sir,"”. After the man briefly mentioned that the craft used “condensed air and aeroplanes, but you will know more later on,” it “gradually arose with a hissing sound.” In another account, Constable Sumpter and Deputy Sheriff McLemore are reported as approaching a shining UAP which descended over a distant hill, when “A man with a long dark beard came forth with a lantern in his hand, and on being informed who we were proceeded to tell us that he and the others – a young man and a woman – were travelling through the country in an airship,” and that “the man with the whiskers invited us to take a ride, saying that he could take us where it was not raining.” A third curious report describes witnesses seeing a “heavy object dragging along with a rope attached … On looking up they saw what they supposed was the airship … After some ten minutes, a man was seen descending the rope … He wore a light blue sailor suit and was small in size. He stopped when he discovered parties at the anchor, and cut the rope below him and sailed off in a northeast direction.” Other accounts, as for example summarized by Enigma Labs (2023), involve an aeronaut who allegedly introduced himself as “Wilson,” while on another occasion he insisted a witness “call me Smith,” giving him a $10 bill to buy “lubricating oil,” telling him to keep the change. In yet another encounter, the aeronaut claimed he was transporting dynamite to Cuba, and even offered an ex-Arkansas senator a ride there to go “kill Spaniards.” These are almost like fairy stories reimagined in the age and place of the modern Wild West</span>.
  Perhaps even stranger are the occasional references to mysterious lands concealed within Earth that are home to NHI.
  In some sense, these could be regarded as “non-local,” in that they are not easily accommodated by a conventional
  understanding of Earth’s geology and geography, and instead seem suggestive of another terrestrial dimension that is
  usually unseen. One prominent rumour centres on a military mission from 1946-1947 known as <a
    href="/org/us/dod/navy/projet/Highjump">Operation Highjump</a>, led by Rear Admiral Richard Byrd, ostensibly to
  establish an Antarctic research base. The trip itself is well documented <span class="source"><span class="people">Byrd, Richard E.</span> (1956, August). <a
    href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80R01731R000400300002-7.pdf">All-out assault on Antarctica. The National
    Geographic Magazine</a>, 141–180</span>. However, there have long been strange rumours regarding the mission, both
  in terms of its real purpose and actual outcome, including the claim that Byrd himself was pulled through some kind of
  “vortex” while flying and encountered a fantastical city inside the Earth inhabited by an advanced race of beings.
  Significantly, although certain aspects of these rumours have been debunked – as for instance explained on an episode
  of The Why Files <span class="source">The Why Files. (2022, July 7). Operation Highjump | Mission: Find and destroy the secret Nazi UFO base In
    Antarctica</span> – other parts are nevertheless potentially credible, including Byrd appearing to have a period of
  “missing time” on one of his flights, and intensive UAP activity that could be interpreted as being in the service of
  protecting a secret base <span class="note">Many of the rumours surrounding Operation Highjump stem from an ostensible “missing diary” which surfaced in the 1970s, allegedly written by Byrd (1990) during the operation, subtitled, “A Secret Expedition and Journey to a Paradise Inside the Earth.” In this, he claimed to have been pulled through a “vortex” while flying over an unknown mountain range, whereupon he entered “inner Earth” and encountered a fantastical city, inhabited by humanoid creatures. Seemingly summoned as representative of humanity, he was reprimanded by a figure called “The Master” about the invention of the atomic bomb and warned a dark age is to come if humans do not mend their ways. However, as discussed on The Why Files (2022), this is widely believed to be a work of fiction. For example, whole paragraphs of what The Master apparently said to Byrd are seemingly plagiarized from the 1937 film Lost Horizon (in which the main character talks to The Dalai Lama who issues the same kind of environmental warning). However, other rumours about the mission are less easily dismissed, or are at least rather strange. These even include events relating to the trip recounted in the seemingly fictional diary, most notably the claim that Byrd’s experience involved a period of “missing time”; for instance, records show that Byrd did take a flight that arrived back at base three hours late, despite him being in a small short-range airplane that in theory would not have had enough fuel for that length of flight. Other stories of the expedition that have some corroborating evidence include the claim that the mission was cut short because it had faced attacks from UAP appearing out of the water, which apparently was verified by a secret Soviet intelligence report that was released (along with many others) after the collapse of the USSR. As summarized on The Why Files: According to documents leaked in 1991, things … take a strange turn just two days after arriving. Bright lights were seen on the horizon. The sailors thought it was another ship but they were below the Antarctic circle in uncharted waters. The lights then ascended at a 45 degree angle into the sky very quickly. They tried to make radar contact but were out of range. Three hours later, five more lights appeared in the sky and began flying directly toward the ships. Anti-aircraft guns and 20-millimeter cannons were fired but had no effect. A radio operator stationed on the USS Brownson gave testimony of how strange crafts suddenly appeared from the ocean. This is corroborated by Lieutenant John Sayerson, who said objects shot vertically out of the water at tremendous speeds. One object flew between the mass of his ship with such force that the radio antenna oscillated back and forth from the turbulence. An aircraft from the USS Currituck took to the sky but was immediately struck by a beam of energy and destroyed. About 10 miles away the torpedo boat USS Maddox burst into flames and began to sink. According to the report this was the first attack of several that would occur over the next few weeks. February 26 would be the last engagement with the unknown craft: the Navy task force ordered retreat and left the area a full six months before their mission was supposed to end</span>.
  As a result, the story has compelled the attention of UAP scholars over the years <span class="source">Harrison, S. (2021). <a

  on a par with Churchward’s <span class="source">Churchward, J. (1926). Lost Continent of Mu, the Motherland of Man . Kessinger Publishing</span>

  and potentially also of Antarctica itself, about which there are numerous UAP-related narratives besides that
  associated with Byrd, including of NHI bases, as well as unusual photographic data that seems suggestive of anomalous
  structures34 – that we should not completely rule it out.
