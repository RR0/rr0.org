<p>Let’s now bring the discussion back to where we started: the empirical mystery of UAP. Myths of lost or underground
  civilizations are fascinating, but people might be tempted to leave such ideas in the realm of speculative literature
  and esoteric religion. However, the reason the CTH is being invoked is because of the two empirical mysteries, noted
  above, around UAP activity (a) underwater, and (b) in relation to underground or underwater “entry” points. We do not
  merely mean UAP have been observed in these locations (even if such sightings may be what encouraged people to
  consider this hypothesis to begin with). After all, an underwater UAP could still be extraterrestrial,
  interdimensional, extratempestrial, etc. in origin. Rather, what might tip the balance of probability towards a
  CTH-specific interpretation would be indications of a relatively permanent NHI presence on or around Earth, possibly
  involving some kind of “base.” In that respect, some argue there is such evidence, albeit contentious and contested.
  Here we briefly note a few such examples (though it is beyond our scope to be exhaustive), including suggestions of
  bases underground, underwater, and on the moon.</p>
<p>In terms of potential underground NHI bases or enclaves, numerous locations have been alleged. One is Antarctica, as
  noted in the previous section (and discussed in Endnote 34). Another is the so-called “Dulce Base” that some people
  believe exists under Archuleta Mesa near Dulce, New Mexico. As with many aspects of this topic, the allegations are
  suffused with confusion and mystery. Claims of an NHI base there are thought to have first arisen from Albuquerque
  businessman Paul Bennewitz (Barkun, 2006), though it transpires he had been fed disinformation by Ufologist Bill Moore
  and an Air Force intelligence operative called Richard Doty (who has corroborated this claim), possibly to distract
  him from genuine US military bases in the area (Rojas, 2014). However, the rumour has persisted, particularly because
  of Phil Schneider, who claimed publicly – before his untimely death in 1996, ostensibly by suicide – that he had been
  employed there as an engineer, and that it was in fact jointly operated by the US military and a NHI species (with the
  latter having long been the original occupants of the mesa, and who were more recently encountered when the military
  were constructing their base)35. It goes without saying that these claims have not been substantiated. Nevertheless,
  some people close to the UAP topic think they should be considered (Faletto, 2019).</p>
<p>There are also allegations of NHI bases underwater. For context, by some estimates, more than 80% of Earth’s oceans
  remain unexplored and uncharted, not merely because of their immense size, but also due to factors such as limited
  visibility (Petsko, 2020). Indeed, scientists investigating these unknown territories continue to make startling
  discoveries: an exploration of the Gulf of Alaska recently retrieved “a mysterious golden ‘orb’” from 3,300 meters
  underwater, and although believed to be “biological in origin,” researchers have no idea what it is, and are
  reportedly trying to ascertain if it is “associated with a known species, a new species or represents a previously
  unknown stage of life” (Osborne, 2023). As the expedition coordinator said, “While somewhat humbling to be stumped by
  this finding, it serves as a reminder of how little we know about our own planet and how much is left to learn and
  appreciate about our ocean.” Relatedly, there have been UAP events involving objects or entities that would appear to
  resemble some form of marine life, such as an airborne incursion over a US military base by an object resembling a
  “jellyfish” that has been officially designated as a UAP by intelligence agencies, as noted above. Given our relative
  ignorance of, and especially lack of access to, the underwater realms of our planet, it has been argued that deep
  oceans would be an ideal place for an NHI to conceal their presence (at least, assuming they could cope with water
  pressures many times greater than at sea-level). This possibility has been influentially explored in creative
  endeavours like James Cameron’s 1989 film The Abyss, which may be more than just fiction, with journalist/filmmaker
  Jeremy Corbell (2022) saying “I know for sure” that it was “highly informed by the actual information we have about
  the UFO phenomenon.” In terms of potential locales for NHI to “hide,” Tim Gallaudet (2023a) – former head of the
  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, introduced above – and Preston Dennett (2018) suggest one such base
  could lie in the Catalina Channel off the southern California Coast,36 while other locations have also been alleged37.
  Indeed, Gallaudet (2023b) actually suggested authorities had established communication with an NHI (albeit without
  specifying their location), saying “I think it's about time that we do disclose that we are in contact with non-human
  intelligence.” Other cases include NHIs known as “Friends” who supposedly lived in bases along the Adriatic coast,
  with whom various Italians claimed to be in contact between 1954 and 1990 (Verma, 2023d). As such, there have been
  calls to more actively and systematically search underwater for UAP activity; as marine scientist Brian Helmuth put
  it, “If I were investigating an alien planet like Earth, the ocean would definitely be the place to start” (cited in
  Dixit, 2023).</p>
<p>A third site of intrigue is the moon, and particularly its “far” side, which remains perennially hidden from view.
  Indeed, of all possible cryptoterrestrial locations, it has attracted the most speculation, with many strands of
  intriguing evidence accumulating over the years – of differing levels of ambiguity and quality – giving rise to many
  claims of variable credibility38. Indeed, some observers suggest the moon itself is very strange, characterised, as
  recently noted by Avi Loeb (2024), by numerous extraordinary “coincidences regarding its size, behaviour, and
  composition”; as a result, some have speculated that the entire object may be an artificial NHI construction (Knight &
  Butler, 2006, Chase, 2022)39. Perhaps the most keenly studied stories are those associated with NASA missions and
  observations. Most directly, there is apparent photographic evidence in the public domain which, while not
  confirmatory of NHI, does at least seem anomalous and hard to explain, and which some have interpreted as “lunar
  bases” (Hoagland & Bara, 2007), although sceptics have sought to find various naturalistic explanations for these,
  with varying degrees of plausibility40. Relatedly, some NASA whistleblowers – such as Karl Wolfe (Griffiths, 2018) and
  Ken Johnston (Verma, 2022a) – claim that even more conclusive photographic evidence of potential bases exists, but
  that NASA has actively sought to deny, suppress, and conceal such information41. Finally, there are the views of the
  actual Apollo astronauts, and although none have said (in public at least) that they encountered such bases, many have
  been vocal about their beliefs in NHI, most famously Edgar Mitchell, who is on record in 2008 as saying, “Yes, there
  have been E.T. visitations, there have been crashed craft, and bodies recovered. We are not alone in the universe,
  they have been coming here for a long time” (cited in McKeown, 2015) 42. In any case, whatever the validity of these
  claims, scientists like Davies and Wagner (2013) have proposed specifically searching for “alien artifacts” on the
  moon, given that, (a) extraterrestrial NHIs may well have engaged with it at some point in the history of the solar
  system, and moreover, (b) unlike Earth the lunar environment could preserve artifacts for millions of years.</p>
