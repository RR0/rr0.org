<p>Let’s now bring the discussion back to where we started: the empirical mystery of UAP. Myths of lost or underground
  civilizations are fascinating, but people might be tempted to leave such ideas in the realm of speculative literature
  and esoteric religion. However, the reason the CTH is being invoked is because of the two empirical mysteries, noted
  above, around UAP activity (a) underwater, and (b) in relation to underground or underwater “entry” points. We do not
  merely mean UAP have been observed in these locations (even if such sightings may be what encouraged people to
  consider this hypothesis to begin with). After all, an underwater UAP could still be extraterrestrial,
  interdimensional, extratempestrial, etc. in origin. Rather, what might tip the balance of probability towards a
  CTH-specific interpretation would be indications of a relatively permanent NHI presence on or around Earth, possibly
  involving some kind of “base.” In that respect, some argue there is such evidence, albeit contentious and contested.
  Here we briefly note a few such examples (though it is beyond our scope to be exhaustive), including suggestions of
  bases underground, underwater, and on the moon.</p>
<p>In terms of potential underground NHI bases or enclaves, numerous locations have been alleged. One is Antarctica, as
  noted in the previous section <span class="note">Antarctica has long been a site of intrigue, both in relation to the UAP topic and also just on its own terms. To
begin with, observers have scoured photographic evidence on sites like Google Earth looking for apparent anomalies. As a result, some curious structures and objects have potentially been identified, although there is much debate about their interpretation (see e.g., https://captainantarctica.com.au/anomalies/google-earth-anomalies/, posted in 2018, for seven such examples). One is an apparent pyramid, which led some people to argue this was a remnant of a long-lost civilization since buried beneath the ice, though sceptics have argued in response that mountains do have the potential to become pyramid-shaped through natural “freeze-thaw” type erosion (Geggel, 2016). Another source of intrigue regarding the region are military “whistleblower” accounts of unusual features and activity in the region, such as one reported by UAP researcher Linda Moulton Howe (Earthfiles, 2017), which she said had been provided by a “retired US Navy petty officer” who had apparently led a c-130 crew “flying cargo and doing rescues in Antarctica from 1984-85 period to 1997.” His most notable allegation was summarized by Howe as follows: “[The crew] saw a huge football field-sized hole in the ice, only about five to ten miles from the geographic South Pole, that was supposed to be an air sampling station, but in a no-fly zone. During an emergency medevac crisis, to speed up their trip, the crew flew across that no-fly zone and apparently saw what they were not supposed to see: an alleged entrance to what was rumoured to be a human and ET science collaboration research base under the ice… [He] and his flight crew received several orders at different times to not talk, and were sternly told, “you did not see the ice hole, you saw nothing”.” More generally, regarding the potentially unusual nature of the region, some observers find significance and intrigue in the existence of the Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959 by 12 major powers, which protects the continent as “a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science” (IAATO, 2023). Of course, the most likely explanation is that the Treaty should be taken at face value, with the participating nations – and subsequently the whole world – genuinely agreeing not to advance territorial claims over the region and instead preserving it for scientific exploration. Nevertheless, for people persuaded that clandestine NHI bases on Earth are being kept secret by the military powers, the Treaty does also plausibly serve these more esoteric goals, not least because it essentially places the location “off limits” to the public. Such sceptics note, for example, that world nations are rarely so co-operative when it comes to ceding or disavowing territorial claims, and wonder if other motives
may be at play, such as maintaining secrecy regarding aspects of the content (e.g., whether an NHI presence or base, the remnants of an extinct civilization, or something else entirely) (Salla, 2021)</span>.
  Another is the so-called “Dulce Base” that some people believe exists under Archuleta Mesa near Dulce, New Mexico. As
  with many aspects of this topic, the allegations are suffused with confusion and mystery. Claims of an NHI base there
  are thought to have first arisen from Albuquerque businessman Paul Bennewitz <span class="source">Barkun, M. (2006). A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America. University of California
    Press.</span>, though it transpires he had been fed disinformation by Ufologist <span class="people"

    href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/exair-force-law-enforceme_b_5312650">Ex-Air Force law enforcement agent says he
    hoaxed major UFO mythologies</a>. Huffington Post</span>. However, the rumour has persisted, particularly because of
  Phil Schneider, who claimed publicly – before his untimely death in <time>1996</time>, ostensibly by suicide – that he
  had been employed there as an engineer, and that it was in fact jointly operated by the US military and a NHI species
  (with the latter having long been the original occupants of the mesa, and who were more recently encountered when the
  military were constructing their base) <span class="note">Phil Schnieder gave the following account of his alleged experience at the Dulce base at a public event in 1995 (Kent, 2023): “I'm Phil Schneider. I spent 17 years in black budget programs as a government geologist, engineer and structural engineer with aerospace applications and I'm a self-taught metallurgist. In working with the black projects, I was involved in something very controversial, almost totally unbelievable to most of you. I was involved in building another base inside of Dulce, New Mexico, which is Los Alamos laboratory. On the southwest part of the Archuleta Mesa, we were in the process of the early stages of building the four large tunnel-like holes. Some of them ran two and a half miles under the surface. Anyway, after we drilled all four holes, it took about two days to drill all four of them. When you build an underground base, you drill four basic holes, then you build, called stoves, or crossmember holes, across and then you use blasting equipment and you blast out, or tunnel out, deflagrate or melt rock out… the equipment kept coming up broken. So, we wanted to go down, send somebody down there, a human observer, or human observers in this case, to find out what was going on. When I saw green beret and black beret people … I knew something was up; the gig was up. In this process, I was lowered down in a basket of one of these holes, and … [there] was sitting a seven-foot tall alien Gray. The stench was worse than the worst garbage you can imagine. I didn't waste any time. I reached for my pistol … I carried a little Walther PPK pistol with a nine-shot clip. When you're in an almost space-suit environment and you're reaching for a gun, it's not the easiest thing to do and then to pop a clip into it and start shooting. Man, I killed two of them. Yes, they're mortal and they do die, however in the process one of them did this … All I remember is that he just kind of waved his hand in front of his chest and the next thing I know this blue beam hit me and just literally opened me up like a fish. It was some form of electrical force because it was kinda like being hit with a lightning bolt … burned all my toenails off of me. A green beret that was right behind me, he risked his life. He shoved me back in the basket and hit the button and took me up. I wouldn't be alive talkin' to you today if it wasn't for him. I'm forever indebted. He lost his life. 66 secret service agents, green berets, black berets, crack troops, lost their lives, because the government, our United States government lied, did not tell us anything about the alien threat. There's a war underneath there—and I'm talking dead serious.”</span>.
  It goes without saying that these claims have not been substantiated. Nevertheless, some people close to the UAP topic
  think they should be considered <span class="source">Faletto, J. (2019, August 1). <a
    href="https://www.discovery.com/exploration/Secret-Underground-Alien-Base-Dulce-New-Mexico">Allegedly, there is a secret underground alien base in Dulce</a>, New Mexico. Discovery.</span>.
</p>
<p>There are also allegations of NHI bases underwater. For context, by some estimates, more than 80% of Earth’s oceans
  remain unexplored and uncharted, not merely because of their immense size, but also due to factors such as limited
  visibility (Petsko, 2020). Indeed, scientists investigating these unknown territories continue to make startling
  discoveries: an exploration of the Gulf of Alaska recently retrieved “a mysterious golden ‘orb’” from 3,300 meters
  underwater, and although believed to be “biological in origin,” researchers have no idea what it is, and are
  reportedly trying to ascertain if it is “associated with a known species, a new species or represents a previously
  unknown stage of life” <span class="source">Osborne, 2023</span>. As the expedition coordinator said, “While somewhat
  humbling to be stumped by this finding, it serves as a reminder of how little we know about our own planet and how
  much is left to learn and appreciate about our ocean.” Relatedly, there have been UAP events involving objects or
  entities that would appear to resemble some form of marine life, such as an airborne incursion over a US military base
  by an object resembling a “jellyfish” that has been officially designated as a UAP by intelligence agencies, as noted
  above. Given our relative ignorance of, and especially lack of access to, the underwater realms of our planet, it has
  been argued that deep oceans would be an ideal place for an NHI to conceal their presence (at least, assuming they
  could cope with water pressures many times greater than at sea-level). This possibility has been influentially
  explored in creative endeavours like James Cameron’s 1989 film The Abyss, which may be more than just fiction, with

    Independent Publishing Platform</span> suggest one such base could lie in the Catalina Channel off the southern
  California Coast <span class="note">Claims of an underwater base in the Catalina Channel are based partly on, (a) the numerous underwater UAP observed there over the decades, (b) testimonies from people who report strange encounters with humanoid beings in the area, and (c) peculiar structure-like images available on resources such as Google Earth. As a result, as Gallaudet (2023) put it in a recent talk, “I'll just cut to the chase. You know, there's talk about, is there a UAP base in Southern California? It sounds wild, but after this week's hearing [i.e., the Congressional UAP hearing on July 26], maybe not.” Indeed, the search for other potential bases has been invigorated by resources like Google Earth, with people scouring maps looking for anomalies, generating numerous cases that some claim could be an underwater base – or at the very least seem genuinely strange – with several examples discussed by Byrd (2016). One is the outlines of an apparent structure near Baja California involving long, tube-shaped lines that stretch for some 76 miles, which notably is in the vicinity of the region noted by Gallaudet and also researchers like Dennett (2018). So too is another a strange finding six miles off the coast of Malibu, some 2,000 feet below the surface, of an oval-shaped object nearly three miles wide with a huge flat top and what “appear to be pillars or columns that seem to reveal the entrance to a darker, inner place” (Speigel, 2014). While rumours of NHI bases may be wild speculation, such sites are at least unusual and worth investigating, though from a sceptical perspective one might ask, if cryptoterrestrials wanted to hide – if indeed that would be their intention – why would they select a location merely 2,000 feet down right off the California coast.

<p>A third site of intrigue is the moon, and particularly its “far” side, which remains perennially hidden from view.
  Indeed, of all possible cryptoterrestrial locations, it has attracted the most speculation, with many strands of
  intriguing evidence accumulating over the years – of differing levels of ambiguity and quality – giving rise to many
  claims of variable credibility <span class="note">There is a long history of rumours about an NHI presence on the moon, most of which is highly contested, seen as credible by some and strongly rejected by others. A vivid example of these murky waters involves an alleged Apollo 20 mission in 1976. Officially, the last lunar lending was Apollo 17 in December 1972, with Apollo 18, 19 and 20 cancelled that year – despite already being in the construction and planning stages – supposedly due to declining public interest and budget cuts. However, in 2007 a series of videos were posted to YouTube – seemingly by William Rutledge, a retired American astronaut, under the username “retiredafb” – which purported to show secret NASA footage from an alleged Apollo 20 mission in 1976. Its alleged purpose was to investigate a two-mile-long spaceship that had apparently crashed millions of years ago on the far side of the moon, and which had been discovered by previous missions. Venturing inside the craft, the video showed the astronauts encountering the body of a humanoid female – in a state of “suspended animation” of some kind – who became dubbed the Martian “Mona Lisa” (Aerospace Engineering, 2017). Needless to say, the account has
 been much disputed. Indeed, in 2007, a French artist and writer, Theirry Speth, claimed to have created the videos in 2006 for a science fiction story he was writing that was eventually published a decade later (Speth, 2017), a claim which has been corroborated by the likes of Reuters (2022). Even so, some observers remain sceptical about Speth’s claims, suggesting his apparent “confession” may itself be a form of disinformation to discredit what is actually a genuine story; to that point, Italian ufologist Luca Scantamburlo (2010) claimed to have interviewed Rutledge himself, who confirmed it was a real mission. Thus, for example, the footage has been promoted as credible, such as by the documentary Aliens on the Moon: The Truth Exposed (Kiviat, 2014). However, critics point out that Scantanburlo never met Rutledge in person (with the interview conducted over Yahoo! Messenger), and that his claims of veracity have no weight (Hoaxeye, 2022). Essentially, while we ourselves believe the story to almost definitely be false, that we cannot be 100% certain is indicative of the tantalising and uncertain standing of the moon with respect to this topic</span>.
  Indeed, some observers suggest the moon itself is very strange, characterised, as recently noted by <span

    moon</a>. The UFO Rabbit Hole.</span>, the reason it seems “so unsettling is just the sheer preponderance of weirdness.” Essentially, there are myriad oddities and coincidences, and while any one individually might be merely curious, together they create an unnerving sense of artificiality (Knight & Butler, 2006). (1) We only ever see one side of it (i.e., one side is always facing Earth), which is only possible because the moon is rotating on its axis at the exact rate that it orbits the Earth. (2) The moon and the sun appear roughly the same size in the sky because although the sun is 400 times bigger than the moon, it is almost exactly 400 times further away from the Earth than the Moon. (3) In addition to the moon and sun appearing a similar size, the moon has a slightly tilted orbit that aligns to Earth’s orbit around the sun (in contrast to most moons, which orbit around the equator of their planets), meaning we experience eclipses. (4) It is particularly massive; although there are over 200 moons in our solar system, despite Earth being only the fifth largest planet, it has the fifth largest moon; consider that the largest moon, Jupiter’s Ganymede, is only about 50% larger than our moon, even though Jupiter is 11 times bigger than Earth. (5) It is potentially hollow in some ways (or at least has hollow cavities), based on seismic reverberations observed in tests conducted by the Apollo missions. (6) We don’t currently have a settled and definitive understanding of how or when the moon was formed, and although numerous theories have been proposed, these have been challenged by the kinds of observations noted above; for example, a prominent early explanation was the “capture” hypothesis, in which, during the chaos of the early solar system, the moon’s path happened to have intersected with that of Earth in just the right way, so became pulled into its orbit. However, since the moon is so large, and its orbit so close to Earth and also so perfectly circular, this idea has fallen out of favour. Given all these oddities, some people speculate the moon could be an artificial satellite created by an NHI, with various reasons proposed for its manufacture. Perhaps the most obvious one is that it would serve as a secret base from which to observe life on Earth. However, a deeper and more profound possibility is that it was fashioned to help create and nurture life on Earth itself. This observation is based on the recognition that, were it not for the moon, life may not have been able to emerge on Earth at all, especially its more complex forms. The essence of the argument is that the moon has a particularly profound impact on our tides (being so large and so close), which are integral to both the creation and maintenance of life (from supporting the flux of the oceans from which life is thought to have emerged, to helping regulate the climate and temperature of the planet)</span>.
  Perhaps the most keenly studied stories are those associated with NASA missions and observations. Most directly, there
  is apparent photographic evidence in the public domain which, while not confirmatory of NHI, does at least seem
  anomalous and hard to explain, and which some have interpreted as “lunar bases” <span class="source"><span

  degrees of plausibility40. Relatedly, some NASA whistleblowers – such as Karl Wolfe <span class="source">Griffiths, K. (2018, October 17). <a

    worker found evidence that ancient alien cities exist on moon, NASA fired him</a>. How and Why’s</span> – claim that
  even more conclusive photographic evidence of potential bases exists, but that NASA has actively sought to deny,
  suppress, and conceal such information <span class="note">NASA “whistleblowers” include Karl Wolfe, an Air Force photo technician, who claimed that in 1965, when on loan to NASA’s lunar orbiter project, a colleague said “in a very distressed way” that “we've discovered a base on the back side of the moon,” and proceeded to show photographs which “clearly” feature “a base which had geometric shapes … there were spherical buildings, there were very tall towers and things that looked somewhat like radar dishes.” Similarly, Ken Johnston, a former NASA aerospace engineer, has alleged that NASA has detailed photos of a lunar NHI presence, and claimed he was fired after refusing to destroy this evidence, some of which he apparently personally retained (Verma, 2022a). Indeed, some of the claims made by Richard Hoagland, as mentioned in <span
    class="note">Many people have looked for lunar anomalies using publicly available photographs taken by NASA’s Apollo missions, as well as by more recent endeavours such as NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (the LRO: a robotic spacecraft which since 2009 has been orbiting the moon gathering data), China’s Yutu 2 (the robotic rover component of CNSA's Chang'e 4 lunar mission, launched in 2018), and Google Moon (which primarily uses a mosaic of images taken by NASA’s Clementine mission in 1994). These have generated many unusual images, which some people have interpreted as evidence of an NHI presence on the moon, although in many cases sceptics have argued there is a natural explanation. Among the most well-known researchers in this area is Richard Hoagland (e.g., Hoagland & Bara, 2007), whose analyses of NASA photographs have yielded various apparently anomalous lunar structures. For instance, in 1967 the Lunar Orbiter III took a photo – frame LO-III-84-M (https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/lo3_m84.html) of the Bruce crater and the Sinus Medii Mare plain. An overexposed 44x enlargement by Hoagland revealed what seems to be an irregularly-shaped vertical object 1.5 miles tall (see https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/luna/esp_luna_26.htm), dubbed the “Shard.” Sceptics have sought to find naturalistic explanations for this: an article by Live Science (2012) for example claimed this was merely an artefact of Hoagland’s “manipulation” of image processing software, which “appears to have turned a tiny spot of light near the horizon of the moon (perhaps light from a distant star) into a blurry image artifact.” Other explanations offered have been that this is merely an ephemeral “outgassing” event – an explosive vertical release of gas, which can indeed happen naturally on the moon – that just happened to coincide with the photograph being taken. However, these “debunking” claims have themselves been critiqued and challenged; for example, the shard has a shadow cast in the correct direction (i.e., given the location of the sun at the time), while enhancements of the photo reveal no “spray” (i.e., that one might normally expect from
outgassing), both of which lend support to it being a “real” object. Hoagland suggests the potential artificiality of the shard is then lent further credibility by the apparent proximity of other seemingly anomalous objects he also identified on LO-III-84-M (and related photos), including the “Tower/Cube” (a tripodal structure that seems to extend some seven miles upwards, with a large mile-wide cube on top). Indeed, he suggests that both the Shard and Tower/Cube are translucent/transparent and are remnants of a large glass dome-like structure – with other remnants also seemingly evident in other photographs – which he theorizes was built to protect a now-vanished outpost of civilization on the moon. We have no way here of adjudicating these claims, but while not necessarily agreeing with Hoagland about the nature or interpretation of these images, we also suggest they cannot simply be dismissed out of hand. The same is true of various other anomalies people have observed in lunar images, such as several massive and seemingly artificial structures identified by Scott Wearing – involving straight lines that suggest these have been manufactured rather than forming naturally – in the Copernicus crater (Monzon, 2019) and the De Moraes Crater (Malewar, 2019). Essentially, the same principle applies here as with the CTH more generally: while we regard the probability of artificial structures on the moon as highly unlikely, we also suggest the possibility should not be ruled out and instead deserves genuine investigation.</span> – such as there being ruins of buildings, huge dome-like objects made of glass, and stone towers – are seemingly based in part on evidence provided to him by Johnston</span>.
  Finally, there are the views of the actual Apollo astronauts, and although none have said (in public at least) that
  they encountered such bases, many have been vocal about their beliefs in NHI, most famously Edgar Mitchell, who is on
  record in <time>2008</time> as saying, <q>Yes, there have been E.T. visitations, there have been crashed craft, and
    bodies recovered. We are not alone in the universe, they have been coming here for a long time</q> <span
    class="source">McKeown, R. (2015, December 18). <a

    exist? Incredible footage shows UFOs in space</a>. Daily Star</span> <span class="note">In terms of NASA astronauts, most have accounts of witnessing a UAP, at least technically speaking (i.e., phenomena that is unidentified and anomalous). More relevantly though, many have also expressed belief in, or at least openness to, an NHI explanation for UAP (e.g., as listed on The UFO Rabbit Hole, 2022). Perhaps most prominent is Edgar Mitchell, as noted in the main text, although in public he has sometimes denied that he has personally seen a UAP. However, according to Coulthart (2021), Mitchell told one of Coulthart’s sources (one of Mitchell’s “closest personal friends”) that – in Coulthart’s words – “every Apollo mission was followed out, observed while there, and followed back.” Or consider Buzz Aldrin, who in an interview for Kiviat’s (2014) admittedly sensationalistic and controversial documentary Aliens on the Moon, said of his Apollo mission, “I saw this illumination that was moving with respect to the stars. We were smart enough to not say “Houston there’s a light out there that’s following us.” So technically, it becomes an unidentified flying object.” Perhaps the most vivid and unusual response among the Apollo astronauts to the NHI question came from Apollo 15 command module pilot Al Worden, who on a British TV program in 2017 said, “We are the aliens, but we just think they are somebody else. But we are the ones who came from somewhere else, because somebody else had to survive, and they got into little spacecraft then they came here and landed, and they started civilization here. And if you don’t believe me, go get books on Ancient Sumerians and see what they had to say” (cited in Verma, 2022c). His voice can therefore be added to others, discussed in endnote 28, who have similarly advocated for an extraterrestrial origin for human beings</span>.
  In any case, whatever the validity of these claims, scientists like Davies and Wagner (2013) have proposed
  specifically searching for “alien artifacts” on the moon, given that, (a) extraterrestrial NHIs may well have engaged
  with it at some point in the history of the solar system, and moreover, (b) unlike Earth the lunar environment could
  preserve artifacts for millions of years.</p>
