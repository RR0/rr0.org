<p>This paper has made the case for taking seriously the CTH as a potential explanation for UAP, while noting that it
  probably ranks lower than other hypotheses, such as the extraterrestrial explanation, although such calculations are
  hard to quantify. To be precise, the material above actually contains four different CTHs. All would involve entities
  existing in stealth during recent human history – and possibly even before the emergence of Homo sapiens in some
  cases, such as CTH 2 – but differ in the nature of the beings in question.</p>
<ol>
  <li>CTH1: Human cryptoterrestrials. A technologically advanced ancient human civilization that was largely destroyed
    long ago (e.g., by flood), but continued to exist in remnant form.</li>
  <li>CTH2: Hominid or theropod cryptoterrestrials. A technologically advanced non-human civilization consisting of some
    terrestrial animal which evolved to live in stealth (e.g., underground), perhaps a hominid, or alternatively a
    species much more distantly related to us (e.g., descendants of unknown, intelligent dinosaurs).</li>
  <li>CTH3: Former extraterrestrial or extratempestrial cryptoterrestrials. Extraterrestrial aliens or our intertemporal
    descendants who “arrived” on Earth from elsewhere in the cosmos or from the human future, respectively, and
    concealed themselves in stealth.</li>
  <li>CTH4: Magical Cryptoterrestrials. Entities which are less like homegrown aliens and more like earthbound angels,
    relating to the world inhabited by humans in ways that (at least from our present perspective) are less
    technological than magical, who are known in European languages by names like fairies, elves, nymphs, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>We might note that, in his detailed taxonomy of UAP hypotheses, Nell <span class="source">Nell, Karl (2023, November 18). <a
  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1QCFtod6i8">The Schumer Amendment and
    Controlled Disclosure</a>. Sol Foundation Conference</span> also offered four CTHs: ancient / proto-human survival;
  breakaway civilization; cryptids / humanoids; and stranded “Gods.” Thus, we can see some subtle classificatory
  differences between the two schemas. Although we share our CTH 2 in common (namely, hominid or theropod
  cryptoterrestrials), the remainder differ subtly: arguably, CTH 1 and 2 in his taxonomy are both variables of our CTH
  1; although our CTH 3, involving extraterrestrial or extratempestrial beings, does feature in his taxonomy, he does
  not categorize these as cryptoterrestrials per se; similarly, with regard to our CTH 4, while some of his hypotheses
  could be interpreted as “magical,” he also does not file these within the cryptoterrestrial category; conversely,
  while we are open to the idea of “stranded Gods,” we have not considered these as being situated within the
  cryptoterrestrial category. However, classificatory nuances aside, it is interesting to see our own taxonomy – which
  we prepared before and without knowledge of Nell’s schema – share considerable similarities with his.</p>
<p>Finally, in closing, it’s worth comparing these CTHs to assess their relative strengths in explaining UAP. CTHs 1-2
  have the advantage over the <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses/intelligence/HET">extraterrestrial
    hypothesis (ETH)</a> of not having to appeal to interstellar space travel – an extraordinary technological feat for
  any species – to account for UAP. Nonetheless, CTHs 1-3 suffer from some of the same weaknesses as the ETH, as well as
  several which are unique to them. For instance, if the cryptoterrestrials belong to a human (or hominid or theropod)
  civilization with advanced technology, we would still have to explain how their craft seem to defy physical laws
  (e.g., speeds and rates of acceleration which seem very likely to kill anything living), as well as why the remnants
  of an advanced past civilization haven’t yet been discovered despite our broad temporal and geographic archaeological
  and paleoanthropological knowledge. And CTHs 1-2 presumably cannot explain this away by appealing to the builder’s
  discovery of, e.g., some as-yet-unknown super-resilient substance, since they live on the same planet as us.
  Furthermore, if the cryptoterrestrials belong to a conventional but highly advanced civilization, it seems reasonable
  to wonder why they have chosen to remain hidden from humans for so long. The ETH can at least posit that, e.g., we’ve
  only recently been visited by aliens for the first time, perhaps by a small number of outriding scouts with orders not
  to interfere too boldly. But on CTHs 1-2, this silence seems more puzzling still, particularly since the
  cryptoterrestrials would be, ex hypothesi, both our longtime neighbors and by far our technological superiors.</p>
<p>The principal weakness of CTH 4, by contrast, is its utter strangeness, particularly for readers schooled to limit
  themselves to modes of explanation within the bounds of, say, the standard model of physics. While belief in
  extraterrestrials is tenable, belief in (something like) fairies is simply not a live option for many scientists. On
  the other hand, this weakness might equally and paradoxically be CTH 4’s principal strength: accepting that explaining
  UAPs will require (as Quine, 1951, once wrote in a very different context) “swelling ontology to simplify theory.”
  Given the apparent implausibility of explaining at least some aspects of UAP by reference to beings much like
  ourselves, just more advanced in relevant respects, CTH 4 (like the ultraterrestrial hypothesis more broadly) explains
  them in terms of beings so unlike ourselves that we have to resort to words like “magic” and “supernatural” to account
  for them, especially considering labels like fairies, elves, angels, nymphs, etc. were ascribed at a time that
  predates rapid scientific progress and our more recent ability to understand previously “magical” encounters in more
  conventional terms. In other words, considering our historic and prehistoric ancestors likely interacted with this
  same phenomenon, current humans are undoubtedly better placed to comprehend such advancements, less as magic, but as a
  result of continued evolution of both technology and consciousness. CTH 4 is unlike the interdimensional
  ultraterrestrial hypothesis in that it sees the agents of UAP as in some sense at home on Earth – trolls and fairies
  would be terrestrial and perhaps even social or cultural beings in a way that angels and demons seem not to be. But,
  indeed, CTH 4 also suggests that, if human traditions are to be trusted, these beings have never been fully hidden
  from us, with people in all times and places reporting encounters with something like magical cryptoterrestrials, even
  though they don’t appear to (or can’t be seen by) most people.</p>
<p>All four CTHs are far-fetched on their face; we entertain them here because some aspects of UAP are strange enough
  that they seem to call for unconventional explanations. Most investigations of UAP to-date have focused on the ETH,
  which does have several lines of evidence in its favor <span class="source">Lomas, T. (2024). The extraterrestrial hypothesis: A case for scientific openness to an interstellar explanation
    for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. Philosophy and Cosmology, 32</span>. Nonetheless, the ETH does not exhaust the
  possible accounts of UAP. Given how little is known about these strange phenomena, it seems prudent to keep every line
  of inquiry – including the various CTHs – in play. Indeed, this is a fitting summary of the CTH: it may be exceedingly
  improbable, but hopefully this paper has shown it should nevertheless be kept on the table as we seek to understand
  the ongoing empirical mystery of UAP. This point was made in a recent article in Scientific American, for example,
  titled <q>It’s time to hear from social scientists about UFOs</q> <span class="source">Eghiwgian, G., & Peters, C. (2023, October 2). <a
    href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/its-time-to-hear-from-social-scientists-about-ufos/">It’s time to hear from social scientists about UFOs</a>. Scientific
    American</span>. It notes the topic “often evokes talk of a separate, mysterious intelligence that must somehow be
  behind the sightings,” and that <q>We need scholars to figure out how to talk to a being with a nonhuman mind. But we
    should also examine our assumptions in thinking about and doing research on such intelligence.</q> It further argues
  how <q>easily reason falls into anthropocentrism and cultural bias when dealing with the nonhuman,</q> citing work by
  Bohlmann and Bürger <span class="source">Bohlmann, U. M., & Bürger, M. J. F. (2018). <a
    href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2017.11.033">Anthropomorphism in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence –
    The limits of cognition?</a> Acta Astronautica, 143, 163–168</span> which suggests scientific assumptions around UAP
  and NHI tend to be constrained by epistemological limitations that are heavily anthropomorphized. As noted above, the
  first main “extraordinary” hypothesis for NHI is often humanoid-like extraterrestrials. They therefore ask, “How to
  look for something we have no idea of?” One possibility they suggest are sentient “swarms” (“single-cell organisms
  that operate in groups … controlled by a single hive-mind”), but they also note UAP may involve “something else
  entirely.” In that respect, as this paper has hopefully demonstrated, we ought to include openness to a
  cryptoterrestrial hypothesis in a spirit of curious and genuine enquiry.</p>
