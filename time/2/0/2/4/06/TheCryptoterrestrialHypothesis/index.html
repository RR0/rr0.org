<p class="abstract">Recent years have seen increasing public attention and indeed concern regarding Unidentified
  Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). Hypotheses for such phenomena tend to fall into two classes: a conventional terrestrial
  explanation (e.g., human-made technology), or an extraterrestrial explanation (i.e., advanced civilizations from
  elsewhere in the cosmos). However, there is also a third minority class of hypothesis: an unconventional terrestrial
  explanation, outside the prevailing consensus view of the universe. This is the ultraterrestrial hypothesis, which
  includes as a subset the “cryptoterrestrial” hypothesis, namely the notion that UAP may reflect activities of
  intelligent beings concealed in stealth here on Earth (e.g., underground), and/or its near environs (e.g., the moon),
  and/or even “walking among us” (e.g., passing as humans). Although this idea is likely to be regarded sceptically by
  most scientists, such are the nature of some UAP that we argue this possibility should not be summarily dismissed, and
  instead deserves genuine consideration in a spirit of epistemic humility and openness.</p>

<p>Received: 12 March 2024 / Accepted: 22 April 2024 / Published: October 2024</p>
<p>This paper explores a hypothesis concerning Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), and follows another by the same
  first author focusing on a related hypothesis recently published in the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology (Lomas,
  2023a). Essentially, the discourse around UAP is dominated by two main classes of explanation: a conventional
  terrestrial origin (e.g., human technology), or an extraterrestrial origin (i.e., advanced civilizations arriving from
  elsewhere). However, such is the strange nature of many UAP that observers close to the topic have been compelled to
  consider a more unconventional set of theories known collectively as the “ultraterrestrial” hypothesis. This denotes a
  broad category of conjecture centred around the possibility that UAP may involve forms of non-human intelligence (NHI)
  that are already present in Earth’s environment in some sense, which Puthoff (2022) describes as “sequestered
  terrestrial cultures… existing alongside us in distinct stealth.” One is an “interdimensional” hypothesis, which was
  the focus of the previous paper; this suggests UAP may involve beings from dimensions that coexist alongside the four
  dimensions of spacetime we usually perceive, and/or that UAP occupants are “extratempestrial,” traveling through the
  fourth dimension to visit different periods of Earth’s history, which may involve our descendants returning to study
  their own hominin evolutionary past (Masters, 2019, 2022). In writing that paper though, the author became
  increasingly aware of the depth of evidence and theory that also tentatively supports another ultraterrestrial
  explanation: the “cryptoterrestrial” hypothesis (CTH) – our focus here – which holds that UAP may reflect activities
  of NHIs concealed here on Earth (e.g., underground) and its environs. Indeed, the philosopher Bernado Kastrup (2024)
  recently argued that a version of the CTH was – despite its seemingly outlandish, unlikely, and “far out” nature – the
  “most reasonable scenario” for UAP and NHI. As such, a paper which explored the CTH in depth seemed a logical next
  step, and furthermore a useful counterpart to the interdimensional paper.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, UAP constitute an extraordinary empirical mystery, which science is surely obligated to investigate,
  yet has rarely done so (at least in an open, public, visible way), especially when it comes to these more
  unconventional ultraterrestrial hypotheses. As such, together, the previous and current paper will hopefully serve as
  valuable pieces of this emergent jigsaw puzzle that is humanity’s attempt to better understanding this existentially
  important yet hitherto all-too-often overlooked phenomenon. The paper begins by briefly noting the recent history and
  concern over this topic; however, this subject has been extensively covered elsewhere – including by Lomas (2023a),
  whose paper offers a relatively recent summary of the relevant terrain – so we will merely point to such sources
  rather than delving into detail. Then, we explore the CTH over five sections, reflecting on: (a) limits to historical
  and geological knowledge; (2) traces of lost civilizations; (3) traces of underground civilizations; (4) traditions
  around “magical” cryptoterrestrials; and (5) UAP-related activity underground, underwater, and nearby (i.e., the
  moon). We conclude by noting that across these various considerations are actually four distinct CTHs, whose merits we
  briefly consider. We recognize these CTHs may rightly be regarded sceptically by most scientists, but argue they
  nevertheless should not be ruled out, and deserve consideration in a spirit of epistemic humility and openness. </p>

1 The introduction – and to an extent the article more broadly – focuses mainly on a North American context, for various reasons, including: (a) limiting its scope to a manageable amount; (b) of all world regions, this has had the most UAP activity, both in terms of sightings and attention paid to them; and (c) this is the authors’ own context and area of expertise. However, it should be emphasized that, contrary to some misconceptions, this is a genuinely worldwide phenomenon (Lomas, 2023b). For the US Congressional UAP hearing on 26 July 2023, for example, the journalist George Knapp submitted testimony regarding UAP investigations conducted by the USSR during the Cold War, and stated that during a 10-year period, “thousands” of case files were accumulated, including 45 incidents in which “Russian warplanes engaged with UFOs, chased them, even shot at them” (Eberhart, 2023). Or take Latin America, of which The Washington Post reports that at least four countries – Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, and Peru — have dedicated government programs that for decades have assessed UAP (McCoy, 2023), while others like Brazil similarly have an extensive history of sightings, with Vernet (2023) reporting that its Air Force has investigated 674 events just between 1954 and 2005 (i.e., omitting more recent cases). Even nations like China, which have historically been more secretive on this topic, have admitted tracking the phenomenon, with an article in the South China Morning Post acknowledging that “China military uses AI to track rapidly increasing UFOs” (Chen, 2021). That said, not all countries have approached the issue in identical ways; it appears for example that authorities in Latin America have generally been more open compared to counterparts elsewhere (McCoy, 2023). Nevertheless, there are indications that many trends observed in the US, discussed here, pertain to other countries.   2 Critics of AARO have accused it of deliberately downplaying the extraordinary nature of some evidence, per comparable previous investigations. Boswell (2022) reports a source in the Office of the Director of National
27   Intelligence saying, “They're patting themselves on the back that they've resolved over half of them… But we don't give a crap about the ones they've resolved. Yeah, there's balloons up there, and balloons are sometimes mistaken for UAP. But there are s***loads of classified videos that are pretty profound and pretty clear. They don't want to talk about this stuff, because they really, really don't know what the hell they are.” Indeed, AARO, and the Department of Defense (DoD) more generally, were rebuked by the DoD Inspector General (2024) in a critical classified report in August 2023 (of which an unclassified version was released in January 2024). Among the complaints was the charge that “the DoD has not used a coordinated approach to detect, report, collect, analyze, and identify UAP,” and consequently, “lacks assurance that national security and flight safety threats to the United States from UAP have been identified and mitigated.” Going further, in an article in The Hill, von Rennenkampft (2024a) explicitly accuses the Pentagon of lying about specific UAP cases, citing in particular an incident over the Gulf of Mexico in January 2023. In the Congressional UAP hearing, Rep. Matt Gaetz divulged that it had involved four objects that moved in a “very clear formation [with] equidistant” separation,” with these details not only obtained from the pilot but picked up by radar. However, in late April, AARO published a case resolution report that concluded with “moderate” confidence that the UAP observed by a military pilot was a balloon, likely “a large commercial lighting balloon.” As von Rennenkampft argues, this “so-called explanation insults the intelligence of any reader who takes a few moments to review the details of the incident,” and hence “serves as a microcosm of the many absurd and implausible explanations that the government has offered up over the years for countless UFO incidents.”  As such, in the eyes of many critics, AARO has become discredited as a genuine attempt to engage with the issue, instead seeming to serve – as per its predecessors – to downplay and denigrate the topic. In March 2024, for example, AARO (2024) released a Historical Record Report, purporting to cover more than 70 years of US records relating to UAP, and stated that it had “found no evidence that any USG investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed that any sighting of a UAP represented extraterrestrial technology.” In response though, observers were scathing at what they regarded as a yet another official attempt to obfuscate the subject; indeed, Lue Elizondo (2024), former director of a UAP investigative program at the Pentagon, publicly called it “intentionally dishonest, inaccurate, and dangerously misleading.” Moreover, it has been revealed that skepticism and mistrust regarding AARO has led to figures with relevant information (e.g., whistleblowers) refusing to engage with them, with Senator Gillibrand recently divulging that two knowledgeable individuals with whom she has met “refused to meet with” Kirkpatrick or his office, as discussed in a recent article by von Rennenkampft (2024b). Indeed, commenting on this article, Elizondo (2024) said, “I encourage everyone to read this article carefully. It succinctly illustrates the distrust of AARO’s former leadership. I was told some time ago that senior elements in AARO were trying to have Dave [Grusch] prosecuted for going public. And the Pentagon wonders why people don’t trust them? Trust works both ways!”  3 Over the decades various investigative efforts have been marshalled by the US to examine UAP, most notably Project Blue Book, which ran from 1952 to 1969. However, as per the admission by Rear Admiral Hillenkoetter quoted in the main text, critics have accused these of attempting to downplay or obscure the topic by minimizing or ignoring the potentially extraordinary nature of some UAP. A 1955 Blue Book report, for example, “prepared by a panel of scientists both in and out of the Air Force,” examined 2199 cases. Of the 213 in the “excellent” category (i.e., the most credible and of the highest quality), while the majority were judged as having prosaic explanations – including astronomical phenomena (52), an aircraft (41), a balloon (25), or other / insufficient information (24) – one third (71) were classified “unknown.” However, despite this large percentage, the overall conclusion was that it was “highly improbable” that the UAP studied “represent observations of technological developments outside the range of present-day scientific knowledge.” Significantly, this attitude of downplaying the topic and overlooking the extraordinary nature of some UAP seems to persist today, pervading the efforts of AARO, as noted in endnote 2.   4 In terms of understanding the significance of Grusch’s allegations, it is important to appreciate the apparent nature of his role, authority, and security clearances within the institutions in which he has served. In that respect, one such account was provided by an alleged member of the US intelligence community in a detailed post on a private UAP discussion group on Facebook that was shared on X, with the poster’s permission, by a prominent UAP commentator (Murgia, 2024). Without being able to vouch for its veracity, commentators did suggest it is plausible. As such, it is worth including some excerpts from the post here – focusing mainly on aspects that address questions of Grusch’s credibility – since it potentially offers valuable context to the nature of Grusch’s claims.   I'm a former member of the US intelligence community. Here's why I think aliens are real. Let's talk about David Grusch. He's the guy who testified before Congress last year. Once upon a time, David Grusch was a GS-15 (Colonel equivalent) at the National Reconaissance Office (NRO). The NRO is a DOD agency. They basically manage all the US's satellites. Grusch was the intel chief in the NRO's Operations Center. That means he was the top intelligence person in the Operations Center. The
28   operations center is where they monitor what's actually happening in space with the satellites. In addition, he was also the agency's lead for Special Access Programs (SAP). You might hear of SAPs as being above Top Secret. That's kind of true, kind of not. Point is, you have to have the right clearance and the need to know to get access to any classified information. As NRO's lead for SAPs, he was read into every single SAP that NRO was connected to. NRO is DOD's main space based intelligence agency. He knew everything it was possible to know at NRO. He also coordinated NRO's contribution to the President's Daily Brief. This means, when it comes to intelligence coming from NRO, Grusch knew everything the President knew. He was also NRO's representative to DOD's UAP Task Force for two years. If ANYONE in DOD had access to classified government programs about UAPs and aliens - it was this dude … To me, Grusch has as much credibility in this area as it's possible to have. But don't take MY word for it. When Grusch brought his concerns about the gov't coverup to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (IGIC), they didn't laugh him out of their office. Grusch was able to show the IGIC everything. EVERYTHING. All the true classified evidence for crashed craft, alien bodies, everything. No matter what SAP this information belonged to, the IGIC is cleared to access it. Upon examining all that evidence - and there was MOUNTAINS of it - the IGIC said that Grusch's claims were "credible" and "urgent". He did NOT say that Grusch was correct. In legal terms, this is an indictment not a conviction. This is a little like a judge refusing to throw a case out but insisting that the case has merit. Except it's actually MORE than that. The IGIC doesn't adjudicate these cases. That's not their job. Their job is to say, "Hey, this case has merit, and it should be investigated. This person isn't making this up." For the IGIC to say that this is credible is about the biggest bombshell you and I are likely to see any time soon. This is an incredibly experienced and powerful member of the intelligence community saying, "Yep, this is legit." To add that it's "urgent" means not only that this needs to be investigated, but that it needs to begin immediately… It's PAINFULLY obvious that Grusch is telling the truth. It couldn't possibly BE more obvious. There couldn't BE a more credible witness… I don't know how much or of what kind of evidence you want, but this is about as good as it gets until all this stuff is actually declassified.   5 Besides the prominent people who have corroborated Grusch’s allegations – such as Tim Gallaudet and Karl Nell, as noted in the text – other significant figures have made comparable claims (without necessarily vouching for Grusch specifically). In 2023 James Lacatski, for instance, a rocket scientist and former Defense Intelligence Agency intelligence officer who led a secret US program investigating UAP from 2008-2010 – the Advanced Aerospace System Weapons Application Program – published a book that states “the United States was in possession of a craft of unknown origin” (Lacatski et al., 2023). Curiously, the book was cleared for release by the Pentagon; queried about this by Jeremy Corbell (2023), who asked, “You told us, because you were allowed to tell us, that our government has a UFO in its possession and had been able to access the inside of it, right?”, Lacatski replied, “Yes, I was allowed to tell you.” Another notable revelation was posted on X by Christopher Mellon (2024), former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, who is closely connected to the UAP topic; sharing a screenshot of text communication with someone seemingly involved with UAP crash retrievals, the exchange indicated that a UAP had been recovered from a relatively famous 1953 “UFO crash” near Kingman, Arizona.    6 In an article titled, “Top senators believe the US secretly recovered UFOs”, von Rennenkampff (2024b) notes that “Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and the late Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) were not alone in their focus on UFOs. The Democratic heavyweights received critical support and encouragement from a bipartisan group of high-profile senators over the years, including former fighter pilot and famed astronaut John Glenn (D-Ohio); Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), who observed a UFO as a  World War II pilot; Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), then-chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense; 2008 GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.); Senate Intelligence Vice Chairman Marco Rubio (R-Fla.); Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.).” The article further outlines political efforts to uncover the details of alleged UAP crash retrieval programs: “In late 2011, for example, the top scientist at the Department of Homeland Security met with Lieberman, then chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Reid to discuss the establishment of an ultra-secret UFO program. As outlined in remarkable detail in newly released documents, the intent of the proposed program was to “gain access to and inventory” UFOs secretly under “investigation in National Laboratories, government organizations and/or contractors.””  7 As noted in the main text, the provisions in the proposed UAP Disclosure Act were significantly weakened when only minimal aspects were passed into law in December 2023 within the National Defense Authorization Act for the fiscal year 2024 (of which it was a proposed amendment). Notably, resistance reportedly came from House Representatives with close ties to the very aerospace companies rumoured to have engaged in UAP reverse engineering efforts, and hence who would be affected by, and moreover motivated to oppose, the
29   original legislation (Sharp, 2023). As Schumer (2023) himself posted on X, “It is an outrage that the House didn't work with us on our UAP proposal for a review board [one of the most consequential aspects of the proposed legislation]. This means declassification of UAP records will be up to the same entities who have blocked and obfuscated their disclosure for decades. We will keep working to change the status quo”. Crucially, it seems highly unlikely the Senate Majority Leader would make such public remarks, and especially propose such remarkable legislation, absent highly credible corroborating evidence or testimony. Furthermore, even in its stripped-back state, the NDAA still contains some remarkable UAP-related provisions and language, including requiring federal agencies to release “all records that most un-ambiguously and definitively pertain to unidentified anomalous phenomena, technologies of unknown origin, and non-human intelligence” (HR.2670, Sections 1841-1843; see Johnson, 2023).  8 It may be worth noting that if UAP occupants turn out to be our interdimensional and/or extratempestrial human descendants, then using the term “Non-Human Intelligence” (NHI) provides agencies like AARO plausible deniability when claiming there is no evidence of NHI activity, technology, crash-retrieval programs, etc.   9 Karl Nell’s (2023) classificatory taxonomy has three overarching categories (physical, psychosocial, and meta-physical) with myriad sub-categories, as follows:  1.

Emanations of godhead  10 Regarding the capabilities of underwater UAP, one was even reported as travelling faster than the speed of sound underwater – which at 1500 meters/second is more than four times the speed of sound in air (about 340 meters/second) – and had a close encounter with a nuclear submarine (Verma, 2023e). Moreover, such sightings have a long history. A report in Nature by Pringle (1879), for instance, offers an account by Capt. Evans, Navy
31   hydrographer, who described seeing “luminous waves or pulsations under the water, moving at great speed and passing under the ship from the south-south-west. On looking towards the East, the appearance was of a revolving wheel … whose spokes were illuminated.” Many similar reports have accumulated over the decades (e.g., Railway and Marine News, 1912).  11 Arguably the most intriguing and well-studied UAP case of recent years is a series of encounters in November 2004 involving the US Navy’s Carrier Strike Group Eleven, particularly the USS Nimitz nuclear aircraft carrier, which have been subjected to detailed analysis (e.g., Knuth et al., 2019). Essentially, situated off the Californian Coast, over a two-week period the group encountered as many as 100 UAPs. This culminated in a dramatic sequence of interactions on November 14th, which began when two F/A-18F Super Hornets on a training exercise engaged at close quarters a white airborne UAP, shaped like a cylindrical butane tank (or “Tic-Tac”), moving erratically back and forth, involving instantaneous changes in direction without changing speed, despite lacking apparent flight surfaces or means of propulsion, which eventually suddenly accelerated as if “shot out of a rifle” and was out of sight in a split second. Subsequently, F/A-18Fs with infrared recording technologies went to investigate, and managed to film one of the UAP (albeit from a considerable distance), a segment of which was released to the public in 2017. Most relevantly here, when the two F/A-18F Super Hornets engaged with the Tic-Tac, as described by Corbell (2022), the UAP was observed moving over a “round disturbance in the water … but underneath that ‘whitewater’ was an object … that appeared from the altitude to be cross-shaped … like a ‘T' … and this object was ‘doing something,’ so in the words that we said to me [by a source] … [the Tic-Tac] appeared to be “docking” with whatever was there just below the surface.”   12 Elizondo’s full account runs as follows: “It’s pretty incredible … I'm not gonna go into too much detail… The person [who told Elizondo] is kind of very cagey about this. But you have a helicopter going out of a Caribbean island on a regular basis because the navy likes to test fire some of its cruise missile technology and whatnot, and what will happen is that after the cruise missile runs out of fuel, it kind of … splashes into the ocean. It will sink, and then at a certain time it … rises up and we go and fetch it and we analyze it for telemetry… Long story short, helicopter crew goes out to recover one of these things. As they are recovering it … they're pulling up and something what was described round and circular, about the size of a small island, a black dark color, starts rising to the surface. It doesn't break the water, but it starts rising to the surface. They thought, ‘wow, that's really really peculiar.’ Well, the next month goes around and they go out to retrieve … another missile that was test-fired, and this time we've got a frogman hanging down from the rope about to latch on to the missile, and this thing starts coming out of the water again. And if you know about the Puerto Rican trench out there, you're talking about water that's 22,000 feet deep. It's the second deepest part of the ocean. The thing starts rising up, and the thing is starting to come to the surface. The frogman is literally trying to climb the rope; they're doing an emergency ascent. Everybody is absolutely ‘panic at the disco’ freaking out, you know, ‘what the hell is that, what's going on.’ And as they start to pull up, it sucks the missile underwater and then disappears, never to be seen again … Incidents like that just kind of make the hair stand up on the back your neck.”  13 Former CIA officer Jim Semivan, for example, said “There’s an entity out there! There’s some kind of non-human intelligence that’s living with us on this F**KING planet” (cited in Verma, 2023a). Indeed, John Ramirez – who served at the CIA Directorate of Science and Technology, Directorate of Intelligence, and ODNI National Counterproliferation Center between 1984 and 2009 – suggested these ultraterrestrial NHI could even be “walking among us” unrecognized as integrated members of modern human society, even if – according to his speculation – they actually have “reptilian” origins, as discussed in the main text (Verma, 2023b). To that point, retired Army sergeant Clifford Stone – who claims to have worked as part of an elite military unit from 1968 to 1990 tasked with recovering crashed UAP – has claimed that authorities are aware of 57 different NHI species, many of whom “look very much like you and myself, that could walk among us and you wouldn't even notice the difference” (cited in Lewis-Kraus, 2021).  14 As Hublin et al. (2018) put it, the “exact place and time of emergence of H. sapiens remain obscure because the fossil record is scarce and the chronological age of many key specimens remains uncertain.” As such, any new discovery has the potential to re-calibrate theories and timelines. Many revisions are relatively subtle or minor. However, sometimes they are more substantial. Consider that until recently, it was generally held that our genus Homo first emerged around 2.3 million years ago in Africa, and our species Homo sapiens around 200,000 years ago in East Africa (Wood, 2017). However, a recent discovery in Ethiopia shifted the origin of Homo back an incredible half a million years to 2.8 million years ago (Villmoare et al., 2015), while a find in Morocco shifted Homo sapiens back to 300,000 years ago in North Africa (Hublin et al., 2018). Yet still more recently the find of a new fossil ape at an 8.7-million-year-old site in Turkey is challenging the long-accepted idea of our origins being in Africa at all, instead suggesting the ancestors of African apes and humans may have evolved in Europe before migrating to Africa some nine to seven million years ago (Sevim-Erol et al., 2023).
32   Similarly, new discoveries are prompting re-evaluations of other hominid species; for example, Berger et al. (2023) claim an ancient branch of humans, Homo nalendi, displayed sophisticated behaviours – including symbolic art and burying their dead – some 300,000 years ago, nearly a quarter of a million years before Homo sapiens (although their findings have been contested; McKie, 2023a). Moreover, much about the dynamics of these eras of evolution remain unknown. For example, analysing the genomic sequences of people today, Hu et al. (2023) suggest our human ancestors went through a “severe population bottleneck” between around 930,000 and 813,000 years ago – hypothesized to have been driven by climatic changes at the transition between the Early and Middle Pleistocene periods – in which the number of Homo sapiens went down from around 100,000 to as few as 1,280 breeding individuals, with this bottleneck lasting for about 117,000 years, bringing our species close to extinction. Given such contingencies and gaps in our knowledge, scholars are well aware how precarious is our knowledge of human evolution, and how little we should take as final and definitive.   Furthermore, this sense of uncertainty and contingency even extends into relatively modern human history. The standard narrative is that only around 10,000 BCE did early humans transition from existing as scattered groups of hunter-gatherers into instead developing permanent settlements anchored around a reliable agricultural food supply in the “Neolithic Revolution” (Weisdorf, 2005). Out of such settlements gradually emerged relatively modern societies, characterized by large communities comprising numerous tribes, the creation of monumental architecture, and innovations in metallurgy and writing. The earliest examples are usually thought to have emerged around 4,000 BCE in Mesopotamia – a region roughly encompassing what is now eastern Syria, southeastern Turkey, and most of Iraq – often called the “cradle” of civilization, including the empires of Assyria, Akkad, and Babylon (Algaze, 2009). From this area, for example, hails the world’s oldest surviving work of literature, The Epic of Gilgamesh, dated to around 2,100 BCE (George, 2002). Comparable developments were also taking place around the world; China for example can also lay claim to being one of the oldest known civilizations, developing advanced craftmanship techniques (e.g., a “rotary machine” for carving jade) around 3,500 BCE (Wang & Shi, 2020), and its founding Xia Dynasty emerging circa 2,070 BCE (San, 2014). However, this standard narrative of our cultural evolution has been challenged by discoveries like Göbekli Tepe.  15 Our relative lack of understanding of our planet’s history was emphasized by Elizondo (2021) in an interview which included discussion of the CTH. As he put it, “How much of our own history do we really know? You know, we can go back 5,000 years, pretty easily; 8,000 years, things start to get a little murky, right? And anything much beyond that we really have no clue.” He further discussed how dynamic Earth’s environment is, noting “every time we have an ice age every roughly 10-15,000 years, the entire topography of Earth changes, the climate changes, animals change.” Moreover, knowledge is hampered by how easily evidence is lost to time, especially given how impermeable materials can be: “It's really hard to make anything that last more than a few 1,000 years… The pyramids… [are] 5,000 years old, and they don't look so great, and probably … you might have a little hill of sand in 100,000 years, but that's going to be about it… Even mountains in millions of years become deserts, right? Time moves on. Then you have the subduction zones of Earth that eventually, if you wait long enough, the surface of the planet all gets recycled anyways. So, it’s all going to get sucked down into the mantle and get spit out the other end as new land, so nothing is indelible on this planet.” Kastrup (2024) makes a similar point: “Any sign of abandoned urban and industrial infrastructure is unlikely to survive a period of only a few million years, due to weather erosion. Synthesized chemicals, alloys and other compounds, technological artefacts, as well as terrain signatures such as mining holes, are ultimately unlikely to survive the constant recycling of the Earth’s crust through plate tectonics. What is now the Earth’s crust will eventually sink into the molten asthenosphere and mantel beneath, where it will be reforged, just to eventually re-emerge through volcanic activity as a brand-new crust. As a rough estimate, if we assume an average plate movement of a few centimeters per year, it could take only tens of millions of years for large swathes of the Earth's crust—especially the ocean crust but, to a more limited degree, also the continental crust—to be recycled in this manner. No conspicuous remnants of an ancient, technological, nonhuman civilization would likely survive all this.”  16 There are essentially two competing hypotheses regarding the Cydonia “Face.” Either it is, (a), a naturally occurring feature of the geography that just happens to resemble a face, or (b) an artificial construction designed by an NHI to look like a face. Although (a) has tended to be the prevailing, widely-accepted explanation, some observers have pointed to other apparent anomalies in the vicinity that argue against it and tip the balance of probability towards (b) (Hoagland, 1992; Corlotto, 1997). For a start, the “platform” on which the Face is situated seems to have a high degree of architectural symmetry, with four equally proportioned sides at right angles to each other. Equally intriguingly, various large objects are situated relatively nearby (10-20 km southwest) that seem similarly, (1) unusual, (2) of comparable size, and (3) arranged in an organized pattern, and which have been collectively dubbed the “City.” Taking the Face itself in isolation, arguably hypothesis (a)
33   is more reasonable. However, when these other contextual factors are included in the calculation, some people suggest that (b) starts to become more plausible.   17 An early and eloquent exposition of the paraphysical hypothesis was provided by RAF Air Marshal Sir Victor, Goddard, KCB, СВЕ, МА, а very high-ranking member of the British government, in a public lecture in May 1969 (see @SpinDubTracks, 2024). As one can see, at points this hypothesis intersects and overlaps with the interdimensional hypothesis (i.e., entities residing in other dimensions). However, one might well imagine paraphysical entities that are not interdimensional, but are “simply” normally invisible to us for some reason. That while it may be that some operators of UFO are normally the paraphysical denizens of a planet other than Earth, there is no logical need for this to be so. For, if the materiality of UFO is paraphysical (and consequently normally invisible), UFO could more plausibly be creations of an invisible world coincident with the space of our physical Earth planet than creations in the paraphysical realms of any other physical planet in the solar system... Given that real UFO are paraphysical, capable of reflecting light like ghosts; and given also that (according to many observers) they remain visible as they change position at ultrahigh speeds from one point to another, it follows that those that remain visible in transition do not dematerialize for that swift transition, and therefore, their mass must be of a diaphanous (very diffuse) nature, and their substance relatively etheric... The observed validity of this supports the paraphysical assertion and makes the likelihood of UFO being Earth-created greater than the likelihood of their creation on another planet... The astral world of illusion, which (on psychical evidence) is greatly inhabited by illusion-prone spirits, is well known for its multifarious imaginative activities and exhortations. Seemingly some of its denizens are eager to exemplify principalities and powers. Others pronounce upon morality, spirituality, Deity, etc. All of these astral exponents who invoke human consciousness may be sincere, but many of their theses may be framed to propagate some special phantasm, perhaps of an earlier incarnation, or to indulge an inveterate and continuing technological urge toward materialistic progress, or simply to astonish and disturb the gullible for the devil of it.  18 Details about an apparent “Jellyfish” UAP were released by Jeremy Corbell (2024), reported as follows:  Today we release the RAW footage of a military filmed UAP incursion within a United States joint operations base. This UAP of unknown origin displayed transmedium capability - and has been officially designated by the United States intelligence agencies as a UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena). This designation is currently maintained. THE “JELLYFISH” UAP RAW footage received / Video #1 DATE / TIME - October 2018 (night) LOCATION - This footage was taken at a United States joint operations base in Iraq. IMAGING TYPE - Thermographic / Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR). EVENT DESCRIPTION - An incursion by an object of unknown origin was filmed at a United States joint operations base in Iraq. The object was designated UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena), and was tracked for a durational period. The object moved through a sensitive military installation - and eventually traversed over a body of water, where it actuated a controlled descent - submerging into the water. After an observational period of about seventeen minutes - the UAP reemerged from the body of water and shot-off at an extreme rate of speed - beyond the optical scope of the observation platform. The origin, intent and capability of the Anomalous Aerial Vehicle remains unknown. Official designation remains UAP. ADDITIONAL DETAILS REPORTED BY DIRECT EYEWITNESSES & THOSE FAMILIAR WITH THE FULL RAW FOOTAGE • The UAP displayed transmedium capability - The UAP was filmed entering the water with a controlled descent. The UAP emerged from the water about seventeen minutes later and orientated into a sudden and rapid directional flight - beyond the optical range of the platform monitoring it. • The UAP displayed low observability - The UAP was not visible with Night Vision (IR) and appeared to jam the targeting capability of the optical platform. • The UAP displayed positive lift - without the normally associated aerodynamic means for lift and thrust. The signatures typically associated with the propulsion maneuvers observed - were absent. FULL VIDEO : https://youtu.be/7bns_WhNAQM.  Interestingly, sightings resembling an airborne “jellyfish” seem to date back decades. A report from the Halifax Evening News in July 1954, for example, reported that an air stewardess on a flight from New York to London saw “a formation of strange machines flying parallel to the airliner for more than 80 miles,” involving “six small, black objects and one larger machine, a “flying jellyfish,” which appeared to change shape constantly” (see Infini, 2024). Indeed, going further back, representations of jellyfish-like UAP can seemingly even be found on historic works of art, such as the 17th Century Svetishoveil Cathedral Fresco depicting the crucifixion of Christ (Open-Minded Approach, 2024).  19  There are thought to have been five main ice ages in the history of our planet, the last being the Quaternery, from around 2.6 million years ago until the present. These are characterised by low global temperatures and
34   glacial expansion across Earth’s surface, leading to geological changes such as lower sea levels and reshaping of landscapes. Moreover, within these broad epochs are times when the glacial and ice sheet coverages peak, known as glaciations, in which such changes are heightened (Ehlers et al., 2018). The most recent, usually referred simply as “The Ice Age,” was from 29,000 to 18,000 years ago, when eight percent of the planet was covered in ice, and sea levels were approximately 125 metres lower than today. However, around 20,000 years ago, the planet began to warm – possibly caused by a tilt in the Earth’s axis (Bajo et al., 2020) – producing a period of melting that lasted around 8,000 years, involving the gradual but relentless rising of sea levels. Moreover, amidst this general rising were more dramatic eras involving sudden collapses of ice sheets, creating catastrophic “meltwater pulses,” causing sharp and extreme rises. The most significant occurred during the Bølling–Allerød interstadial, an abrupt warm period dated to 14,690 to 12,890 years ago (Rasmussen et al., 2006). This coincided with Meltwater pulse 1A – possibly attributed to melting of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and indeed which may have caused the Bølling–Allerød interstadial – in which global sea levels rose by about 20 meters in a little as 500 years (Weaver et al., 2003). Moreover, a particularly dramatic flood around 13,000 years ago – possibly caused by an outburst from the North American glacial Lake Agassiz (Murton et al., 2010), although some speculate it could have involved an impact from a comet or asteroid (Sweatman, 2021; Moore et al., 2024) – caused a return to ice age conditions for over 1,000 years, an era known as the Younger Dryas. Moreover, the warming phase at the end, around 11,500 years ago, was also abrupt, with more melting and sharp sea level rises.  20 The debate about Yonaguni on the Joe Rogan (2024) podcast was between Graham Hancock (a British writer, researcher, and television presenter) and Dr Flint Dibble (a prominent archaeologist). Hancock is a well-known advocate of the theory that an ancient civilization was wiped out by a cataclysm related to the ending of the Ice Age, as elaborated in his recent Netflix series, “Ancient Apocalypse.” However, he is a rather polarizing and – depending on one’s perspective – controversial figure, whose views have been dismissed by prominent academics as “pseudoarchaeology”; indeed, the very first sentence of his Wikipedia article describes him as a someone who “promotes pseudoscientific theories involving ancient civilizations and hypothetical lost lands.” The significance of the Rogan podcast was that it offered an opportunity for Hancock to discuss these charges, and the topic generally, with a prominent representative of academic archaeology. Part of the episode focused on Yonaguni, with a fascinating discussion on the plausibility of it being human-made architecture. Dibble suggested the straight lines could have been formed naturally, given that “nature sometimes looks bizarre,” while Hancock argued forcefully against the likeliness of that explanation. Rogan took a somewhat middle ground, and without being fully persuaded of Hancock’s position, noted that “Some of the right angles and what looks like passageways … that's a wild one ... Things look weird in nature, [but this] blows me away.” In the end, Dibble did concede “It’s certainly crazy, I’ll give you that.” Overall, though, it was striking the extent to which Dibble seemed to dismiss intriguing underwater structures out of hand; in relation to another potential structure, the “Bimini Road” – a 0.8 km long line of roughly rectangular limestone blocks in the Bahamas – Dibble said, “I'm just looking for some proof here. [Laughing] It's all right, but things look cool I get that, but it's like a question of how do we tell the difference between man-made and natural and that's not easy and I've never really again seen architecture like this.” Rogan then pushed back, somewhat incredulous: “This doesn't intrigue you? You don't look at that and go, ‘wow, that really looks man-made’”.  Also of note, the discussion covered the retraction of Natawidjaja et al.’s (2023) article, which – as noted in the main text – had suggested that Gunung Padang features human megalithic constructions dating to between 25,000 and 14,000 BCE. While Dibble argued against the authors’ interpretations of the data and the conclusions in the paper (which is certainly a legitimate move), Hancock accused him and his colleagues of orchestrating a pressure campaign to compel the journal to retract the paper (i.e., instead of publishing a critical response), which Hancock felt was not reasonable. Hancock for example noted Dibble’s apparent sway with prominent media outlets like The Guardian, which before the retraction had published articles, citing Dibble, that were highly critical of the study, and moreover argued that some of the animus directed towards the paper was due to his own link to the research (such as it being the centrepiece of an episode of Ancient Apocalypse). This allegation does seem substantiated by the fact that one piece in The Guardian suggests that “Controversy [about the paper] has been fuelled by the discovery that the paper was proofread by the controversial British writer Graham Hancock” (McKie, 2023b). The fact that the mere act of Hancock proofreading the paper is mentioned as grounds for suspicion does lend support to his claim that Natawidjaja’s work has been unfairly targeted and disparaged for its association with Hancock.  21 The notion of Lemuria was first proposed by zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater (1864) based on his observations of the distribution of Lemurs, namely that dozens of species are found on Madagascar alone, but only a handful elsewhere (Bressan, 2013). As a result, he speculated Lemurs had originated in Madagascar and spread to Africa and Asia by a land bridge that once connected these continents, which he named Lemuria. Although it has since been shown that this distribution of Lemurs could have also been achieved by shifting plate tectonics, geologists
35   have discovered traces of a “Precambrian microcontinent” in the Indian Ocean that disappeared some 84 million years ago, which – Lemurs aside – does allude to the possibility of a lost landmass (Torsvik et al., 2013). In any case, Sclater’s notion of Lemuria captivated attention, and also inspired similar related myths, most notably by British archaeologist Augustus Le Plongeon (1900), who developed the notion of “Mu.” In 1875 he and his wife Alice undertook the first excavation of Chichen Itza, a Mayan city built around 600-900 CE. Based on murals and inscriptions, they came to believe there had been a historical Mayan ruler called Queen Moo. Over time, her legend became intertwined with that of Lemuria, especially by Churchward (1926) in his book Lost Continent of Mu, the Motherland of Man. He vividly depicted Mu as a land in the Pacific that had been home to an advanced civilization, called the Naacal, which flourished between 50,000 and 12,000 years ago and was the progenitor of advanced societies elsewhere (hence the book title). However, he claimed the land was “completely obliterated in almost a single night” after a series of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Churchward’s specific claims have of course been widely disputed, and moreover critiqued on various levels, such as upholding 19th Century ideals around imperialism (Deane, 2008). Even so, many people nevertheless suspect our understanding of history is incomplete, and there may have existed civilizations of which evidence has now been lost, as discussed in the main text.   22 In terms of lost landmasses, Norman et al. (2024) for example suggest there is a “now-drowned region” northwest of the Australian continent that once existed as an “extensive archipelago” capable of supporting between 50,000 and 500,000 people. They argue that two periods of rapid global sea level rise – around 14,000 years ago (Meltwater Pulse 1A) and between 12,000 and 9,000 years ago – resulted in the rapid drowning of ∼50% of the Northwest Shelf, causing a retreat of human populations.  23 Among the most famous “out of place artifacts” is the “Antikythera mechanism,” a Greek hand-powered orrery – a mechanical model of the solar system used to predict astronomical positions – described as the earliest known example of an analogue computer, thought to have been created around 150 BCE (Seiradakis & Edmunds, 2018). Another notable example is the “Baghdad Battery,” a name given to three artifacts – a ceramic pot, tube of copper, and rod of iron – discovered together in 1936 by archaeologist Wilhelm Konig which are believed to date to either the Parthian (150 BCE – 223 CE) or Sasanian (224 – 650 CE) empires, and which Koenig argued constitute an electric battery, a conclusion with which modern scholars still concur (Keyser, 1993). Similarly perplexing is the “Schist Disk,” discovered by Egyptologist Brian Walter Emery in 1936 while excavating the tomb of Prince Sabu (circa 3,000 BCE) (Coffey, 2023). This is striking on many fronts, including composition (derived from clay and mud which have undergone a series of extreme physical-chemical changes) and design (resembling a “concave steering wheel of a car,” with three curved “shovels” that resemble the helix of a boat, together with an opening that would appear to function as the receptacle of an axis of a wheel), as well being seemingly flawless yet with no prototypes or failed attempts ever found. In addition to such objects are not artifacts per se but apparent examples of technologies and techniques that seem to surpass what we thought people at the time possessed. For example, Cairo’s Egyptian museum includes a large granite box, ostensibly dated to 3,000 BCE, that appears to be sliced with millimeter accuracy and precision from top to bottom (Olsen, 2023); crucially, craftspeople at the time were thought to only have copper chisels and hammers, but copper is rated about three on the Mohs Scale of Hardness, yet the rose-granite of the box ranks about an eight (with diamond ranking a 10). Similarly, people have been intrigued by design ideas that seem out of place, such as a 450-page manuscript written between 1529 and 1569 by a military officer for the Imperial court of Vienna, Conrad Haas, which contains elaborate technical details for multistage rocketry, much of which accurately anticipates designs used in 20th century spaceflight programs (Verma, 2022b). Moreover, as noted in the main text, some potential artifacts are far older. A mysterious pyramid in China’s Qinghai Province, for example, features three caves filled with iron pipes which lead to a nearby lake, which were determined by the Beijing Institute of Geology to have been smelted an astonishing 150,000 years ago, many tens of thousands of years before Homo sapiens are thought capable of such techniques (MacIsaac, 2014), although sceptics suggest they might have a more prosaic origin in the fossilization of tree roots (Bauer, 2019).   24 Derinkuyu is carved out of the soft volcanic rock of the region, harnessing its naturally occurring caverns and tunnels. It extends down 85 meters and across 18 levels, and incredibly is estimated to have housed as many as 20,000 people, plus livestock and food stores (Ulusay & Aydan, 2018). Even more remarkably, this is just one of some 36 underground cities in the Cappadocia region in central Turkey, with others perhaps yet to be discovered. As to their origins, archaeologists speculate these could have been started as long ago as 2,000 BCE by the Hittites who dominated the region at the time, but were undoubtedly extended by the many groups who have since occupied the area, such as the Phrygians around 700 BCE (Sari & Özsoy, 2010). While these cities may have served many purposes, they are thought to have above all been sources of refuge and protection, including from persecution by rival groups as well as from natural elements (Erdem, 2008).
36   25 Jane Goodall has been asked about Sasquatch (or “Bigfoot”) in many interviews (see Murgia, 2023a, for a compilation), and indeed says “everybody talks to me” about the subject. In one interview with Yahoo News she said, “I’m a romantic. I would like Bigfoot to exist. I’ve met people who swear they’ve seen bigfoot. And I think the interesting thing is that in every single continent there is an equivalent of Bigfoot or Sasquatch. There’s the Yeti. There’s the Yarri in Australia. There’s the Chinese wild man. And on and on and on. And I’ve had stories from people who … you have to believe them. So, there’s something. I don’t know what it is. I’m always open-minded.” Similarly, in an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, she recounted a story in which she was “in the midst of Ecuador, with jungle all around, and a few little isolated communities. And hunters used to go from community to community. So, I asked my translator, I said, ‘When you meet one of these hunters,’ all I said [to ask] was, ‘Have you seen a monkey without a tail?’ And five of them came back and said, ‘Oh yeah, there are monkeys without tails. They walk upright and they’re six foot high.” Asked by Kimmel what these could be, she said, “Maybe, you know, remnant Neanderthals or something.” In a third interview, she was even more definitive, saying emphatically, “I’m sure they exist. I’ve talked to so many Native Americans who all described the same sounds. Two who’ve seen them. I’ve probably got about, oh, thirty books [about similar creatures] that have come from different parts of the world.”  26 The immediate reaction to the “Nasca mummies” presented by Maussan was overwhelmingly sceptical, with an article in Newsweek immediately after, titled “Have 'alien' bodies shown in Mexico already been debunked?” (Norton, 2023), exemplifying the general tone. Based on the assessment of multiple radiographs and images from CT scans carried out by the third author of the current article, who holds a PhD in biological anthropology with a specialization in hominin evolutionary and comparative anatomy, among the most glaring suggestions of their inauthenticity are: (1) a lack of bilateral symmetry within each individual specimen; (2) no consistency in skeletal morphology across the various specimens presented, indicating a lack of synapomorphies and therefore no shared evolutionary relationship, which, in addition to a clear observable trend toward a more sophisticated manner in which the bones are organized, is highly suggestive of a change over time in how they were fabricated; (3) that some of the bones used in their construction were taken from adolescents, as indicated by unfused epiphyses on the long bones, while other epiphyses within the same specimen are fully fused, indicating they were taken from different individuals of different ages and combined to make a new entity; (4) that some of the bones used were cut off at the ends, others were taken from the arms and used as legs and vice versa, while animal bones were used in place of human bones in certain specimens; (5) a glaring lack of functional articulation points, to the extent that – in a “form follows function” basic biomechanics capacity – none of these diminutive creatures would have been capable of moving any of their body parts and would therefor lack mobility for even simple tasks; (6) metal, stick, glue, and other inorganic objects used to hold the bones in place; see for example the type specimen (NA-01) dubbed “Josephina,” who has an acknowledged metal plate stretching mediolaterally and inferior to the clavicle, connecting the left and right side near the anterior surface of the two scapulae, which was considered to have been “implanted…to stabilize her broken and healed clavicle” (Miles, 2022), while the more parsimonious explanation is that the metal piece was inserted to keep the left and right sides of the body from detaching during and after construction. Additionally, other inorganic connectors can be seen in the wrist and hand morphology of certain specimens, which themselves are a mess of various carpals, metacarpals, phalanges, and occasionally metatarsals, which are often turned in the opposite direction, and as with many of the long bones, lack any sensical articulation points; (7) despite possessing a mouth (with no dentition and highly erratic and disjointed masticatory anatomy), if these creatures were to consume any food (or breath for that matter), there is no oesophagus or trachea connecting the mouth to the rest of the body, which would prohibit basic functions like eating and breathing; and (8) on the whole, these specimens lack clear provenience, especially considering that “two figurines turned up in the Lima airport offices of courier DHL in a cardboard box, and were made to look like mummified bodies dressed in traditional Andean attire,” which, according to Flavio Estrada, and archaeologist with Peru’s Institute for Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences, “They’re not extraterrestrials. They’re dolls made from animal bones from this planet joined together with modern synthetic glue… it’s totally a made-up story” (Aquino, 2024). This remains the general consensus among scientists: “The opinion of academics, archaeologists, and scientists is unanimous: Part of these mummies are modified pre-Hispanic human bodies, while the rest, especially the smaller ones—like those presented this week in the Mexican Congress—are bodies assembled with animal and human bones” (Lagos, 2023). That said, we ought to acknowledge that numerous other similar specimens have allegedly been discovered, as discussed on a recent episode of That UFO Podcast (2024). As such, extending the spirit of openness that we have sought to bring to this paper more generally, we cannot necessarily assume that our scepticism regarding the specimens associated with Maussan would necessarily apply to other cases. That said, based on our analysis of this particular case, we are generally sceptical of the entire “mummies” phenomenon – at least until further evidence emerges.
37   27 Many cultures have legends of races of giants that were once supposed to have roamed the Earth, with such myths reflected in place names associated with these beings, like Giant’s Causeway in Ireland, or Asthipura (“Town of Bones”) in India, thought to contain remains of the great warriors – which include giants – of the epic battle of Mahabharata (Mayor, 2007). Perhaps most interesting vis-à-vis this notion of “giants” is that people claim to have actually found evidence of such. Some consists of apparent fossilized traces of huge humanoid beings, such as giant footprint about 1.2 m long in granite near Mpuluzi in South Africa (Doyle & Wieland, 2012). Another source of intrigue are forms of architecture that seem too large to have been designed for humans, such as a recently unearthed and previously-unknown “biblical-era” layer of the Philistine city of Gath in Israel, which dates to the 11th Century BCE when – especially pertinently – according to Samuel I 17, the future King David slew the giant Goliath. (Borschel, 2019). Finally, there have long been reports of large skeletons, with over 1,000 accounts of seven-foot and taller skeletons found in ancient burial sites over a two-hundred-year period in North America alone (Newman, 2022).  28 The possibility of an extraterrestrial civilization visiting Earth and taking up subterranean residence before the emergence of Homo sapiens is one possible explanation for a CTH. That said, their arrival would not necessarily have to pre-date humans. Ever since Erich von Däniken’s (1968) hugely popular book Chariots of the Gods? Unsolved Mysteries of the Past, there has been a rich seam of speculation that extraterrestrial entities may have interacted with and even guided humans (with Däniken arguing that technologies and religions of many ancient civilizations were given to them by these visitors, who were interpreted and welcomed as gods). Indeed, an even more radical possibility is that we Homo sapiens have an extraterrestrial origin (Lomas & Case, 2024), whether: life in general being seeded from elsewhere, known as panspermia, as famously suggested by the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, Francis Crick (Crick & Orgel, 1973); or Homo sapiens specifically, as articulated by for instance by ecologist Ellis Silver (2022); or whether we did originate here but have somehow had our evolution and DNA manipulated by extraterrestrials, possible via interbreeding, as argued by Fenton and Fenton (2020). Indeed, even figures who represent a more “mainstream” perspective on evolution are open to such ideas; Richard Dawkins for example was interviewed in 2008 and said, “It could be that at some earlier time, somewhere in the Universe, a civilization evolved, by probably some kind of Darwinian means, to a very, very high-level of technology, and designed a form of life that they seeded onto, perhaps this planet. Now, that is a possibility and an intriguing possibility. And I suppose it's possible that you might find evidence for that if you look at the details of our chemistry and molecular biology. You might find a signature of some sort of designer, and that designer could well be a higher intelligence from elsewhere in the Universe” (cited by Murgia, 2023b). Even more relevantly, people have explicitly connected these ideas to the UAP topic. Coulthart (2023b) says he has “a hunch from tips that have been dropped to me [by sources in the intelligence community] that our origins are probably because of those NHIs … and that a lot of our pre-history is better explained if you take into account the idea that there has been an NHI presence on this planet for much of human evolution and history.” Making a similar point, Kastrup (2023) predicted that “within the next 20 years (perhaps sooner), we will witness three tightly inter-related, gigantic revolutions in our understanding of reality,” including “the official recognition of the presence and role of non-human intelligence (NHI) throughout our history” (with the other two being firstly the “rejection of physicalism and embracement of idealism as the only plausible metaphysics,” and secondly “a new understanding of the nature of time that will revolutionise the ontological status of past and future, as well as our understanding of the meaning of birth and death”).    29 The first author to connect Mount Shasta to Lemuria was apparently Frederick Spencer Oliver (1899), who presented himself as an amanuensis for a “spirit” named Phylos the Thibetan. His book made claims of a tunnel to a secret city inside Mount Shasta, which hosted a “mystic brotherhood” of escapees from Lemuria. Similarly, Beckley (1993) includes a narrative given by a woman who claims to be a princess, called Sharula, from Telos, a subterranean city beneath the mountain with a population of some 1.5 million, apparently constructed about 14,000 years ago at the collapse of Lemuria around the end of the Ice Age. Likewise, Hamilton (1986) gives an account of this same person, suggesting Telos was built inside an “artificial dome-shaped cavern in the Earth a mile or so beneath Mount Shasta.” Other texts offer further details about this realm and its supposed inhabitants. Cerve (1931) wrote of “odd-looking persons” who were “tall, graceful, and agile … with larger heads, much larger foreheads” who would visit local towns and “trade nuggets and gold dust for some modern commodities.” Likewise, Lanser (1932) said “The Lemurians have been seen on various occasions; they have been encountered in the Shasta forest, but only for a brief glimpse, for they possess the uncanny secret knowledge of the Tibetan masters and, if they desire, can blend themselves into their surroundings and vanish. At times they came into the neighboring towns--tall, barefoot, noble-looking men.” Moreover, Maurice Doreal (no date) even suggested he himself had been invited into the underground realm in 1931 by two inhabitants who had attended his lecture. He claimed they came to a space “about two miles in height and about twenty miles long and fifteen miles wide and it was as light as a bright summer day, because suspended, almost in the center of that great cavern of space was a giant glowing mass of light” (p.14). Somewhat similarly, in Beckley’s (1993) account, Sharula claimed
38   Telos has “perpetual light through a process of energizing stones to create full spectrum lighting,” whereby the inhabitants can “process them with the forces that make small suns” (p.122).   30 Kirk describes his subject as “the subterranean and (for the most part) invisible people” (p. 29), and notes that fairies “are said to be of a middle nature betwixt man and angel,” both as to their constitution – being framed “of intelligent studious spirits, and light changeable bodies, (like those called astral) somewhat of the nature of a condensed cloud” (p.51) – and as to their lifespan (“They live much longer than we; yet die at last, or at least vanish from that state” (p. 56)). While “their bodies of congealed air are sometimes carried aloft,” Kirk notes, their “ordinary dwellings” were thought to be subterranean, “the earth being full of cavities and cells, and there being…no such things as a pure wilderness in the whole universe” (p.52). Kirk describes reports of “women yet alive who tell that they were taken away when in child-bed to nurse Fairy children,” and were brought down into underground cities illuminated by “continual lamps and fires, often seen without fuel to sustain them” (p.56). He also emphasizes, however, that most people are completely incapable of seeing fairy-folk, this requiring some kind of mysterious “second sight,” an endowment which seems to be place-specific, with some seers reporting “that several did see the second sight when in the Highlands or the Isles, yet when transported to live in other countries, especially in America, they quite lose this quality” (p.78).   31 As Hart (2022) puts it, “If you believe that everything arises from an infinite act of mind – the rock over there no less than the intelligence in you – then you believe that there’s the presence of … an infinite knowing logos within the discrete logos that constitutes each thing as what it is. There’s a depth – even a personal depth, so to speak – in everything, an inner awareness that knows each reality from inside … or from deeper than inside … There is one who knows what it’s like to be a rock. And wouldn’t that infinite personal depth have to express itself … in a finite personal interiority of some sort? … A personal, reflective dimension as the necessarily contracted mode in which the contracted infinite act of mind is exemplified in that thing? And why shouldn’t we call that dimension or mode by its classical names – dryads, hamadryads, naiads, nereids … kami and tama … yaksas and yaksinis and gandharvas and apsaras … nymphs and fairies and elves and longaevi of every kind? (p.75).   32 In 1896-1897, the US saw a spate of UAP sightings that seemed to resemble “airships,” curiously involving apparent technology that, as DeLonge and Levenda (2017) put it, was merely “twenty or thirty years (at most) beyond the capability” of humans at that time (p.89). Although sceptics have suggested such technology could have been within human reach at that point (Danalek, 2010), newspaper reports of the events are replete with unusual details that resist such explanations (see Busby, 1994), not least sightings of unusual beings. For example, in The Dallas Morning News, Haydon (1897) reported an airship had actually crashed, noting, “The pilot of this ship is supposed to have been the only one on board, and while his remains are badly disfigured, enough of the original has been picked up to show he was not an inhabitant of this world.” Most relevantly here though, some witnesses report interacting with the pilots of these airship, with these experiences resembling the uncanny encounters often found in fairy folklore. Even though many of the “aeronauts” were “indistinguishable from the average American population of the time,” as Vallée (2008) puts it, descriptions of interactions generally seem to have a strange dreamlike quality, as is evident in the examples cited by Vallée. In one report in the Arkansas Gazette, for example, Captain James Hooton describes encountering a “medium-size looking man aboard” as follows: “I noticed that he was wearing smoked glasses, [and] was tinkering around what seemed to be the back end of the ship, and as I approached I was too dumbfounded to speak. He looked at me in surprise, and said: "Good day, sir; good day." I asked: "Is this the airship?" And he replied: "Yes, sir,"”. After the man briefly mentioned that the craft used “condensed air and aeroplanes, but you will know more later on,” it “gradually arose with a hissing sound.” In another account, Constable Sumpter and Deputy Sheriff McLemore are reported as approaching a shining UAP which descended over a distant hill, when “A man with a long dark beard came forth with a lantern in his hand, and on being informed who we were proceeded to tell us that he and the others – a young man and a woman – were travelling through the country in an airship,” and that “the man with the whiskers invited us to take a ride, saying that he could take us where it was not raining.” A third curious report describes witnesses seeing a “heavy object dragging along with a rope attached … On looking up they saw what they supposed was the airship … After some ten minutes, a man was seen descending the rope … He wore a light blue sailor suit and was small in size. He stopped when he discovered parties at the anchor, and cut the rope below him and sailed off in a northeast direction.” Other accounts, as for example summarized by Enigma Labs (2023), involve an aeronaut who allegedly introduced himself as “Wilson,” while on another occasion he insisted a witness “call me Smith,” giving him a $10 bill to buy “lubricating oil,” telling him to keep the change. In yet another encounter, the aeronaut claimed he was transporting dynamite to Cuba, and even offered an ex-Arkansas senator a ride there to go “kill Spaniards.” These are almost like fairy stories reimagined in the age and place of the modern Wild West.
39   33 Many of the rumours surrounding Operation Highjump stem from an ostensible “missing diary” which surfaced in the 1970s, allegedly written by Byrd (1990) during the operation, subtitled, “A Secret Expedition and Journey to a Paradise Inside the Earth.” In this, he claimed to have been pulled through a “vortex” while flying over an unknown mountain range, whereupon he entered “inner Earth” and encountered a fantastical city, inhabited by humanoid creatures. Seemingly summoned as representative of humanity, he was reprimanded by a figure called “The Master” about the invention of the atomic bomb and warned a dark age is to come if humans do not mend their ways. However, as discussed on The Why Files (2022), this is widely believed to be a work of fiction. For example, whole paragraphs of what The Master apparently said to Byrd are seemingly plagiarized from the 1937 film Lost Horizon (in which the main character talks to The Dalai Lama who issues the same kind of environmental warning). However, other rumours about the mission are less easily dismissed, or are at least rather strange. These even include events relating to the trip recounted in the seemingly fictional diary, most notably the claim that Byrd’s experience involved a period of “missing time”; for instance, records show that Byrd did take a flight that arrived back at base three hours late, despite him being in a small short-range airplane that in theory would not have had enough fuel for that length of flight. Other stories of the expedition that have some corroborating evidence include the claim that the mission was cut short because it had faced attacks from UAP appearing out of the water, which apparently was verified by a secret Soviet intelligence report that was released (along with many others) after the collapse of the USSR. As summarized on The Why Files: According to documents leaked in 1991, things … take a strange turn just two days after arriving. Bright lights were seen on the horizon. The sailors thought it was another ship but they were below the Antarctic circle in uncharted waters. The lights then ascended at a 45 degree angle into the sky very quickly. They tried to make radar contact but were out of range. Three hours later, five more lights appeared in the sky and began flying directly toward the ships. Anti-aircraft guns and 20-millimeter cannons were fired but had no effect. A radio operator stationed on the USS Brownson gave testimony of how strange crafts suddenly appeared from the ocean. This is corroborated by Lieutenant John Sayerson, who said objects shot vertically out of the water at tremendous speeds. One object flew between the mass of his ship with such force that the radio antenna oscillated back and forth from the turbulence. An aircraft from the USS Currituck took to the sky but was immediately struck by a beam of energy and destroyed. About 10 miles away the torpedo boat USS Maddox burst into flames and began to sink. According to the report this was the first attack of several that would occur over the next few weeks. February 26 would be the last engagement with the unknown craft: the Navy task force ordered retreat and left the area a full six months before their mission was supposed to end.    34Antarctica has long been a site of intrigue, both in relation to the UAP topic and also just on its own terms. To begin with, observers have scoured photographic evidence on sites like Google Earth looking for apparent anomalies. As a result, some curious structures and objects have potentially been identified, although there is much debate about their interpretation (see e.g., https://captainantarctica.com.au/anomalies/google-earth-anomalies/, posted in 2018, for seven such examples). One is an apparent pyramid, which led some people to argue this was a remnant of a long-lost civilization since buried beneath the ice, though sceptics have argued in response that mountains do have the potential to become pyramid-shaped through natural “freeze-thaw” type erosion (Geggel, 2016). Another source of intrigue regarding the region are military “whistleblower” accounts of unusual features and activity in the region, such as one reported by UAP researcher Linda Moulton Howe (Earthfiles, 2017), which she said had been provided by a “retired US Navy petty officer” who had apparently led a c-130 crew “flying cargo and doing rescues in Antarctica from 1984-85 period to 1997.” His most notable allegation was summarized by Howe as follows: “[The crew] saw a huge football field-sized hole in the ice, only about five to ten miles from the geographic South Pole, that was supposed to be an air sampling station, but in a no-fly zone. During an emergency medevac crisis, to speed up their trip, the crew flew across that no-fly zone and apparently saw what they were not supposed to see: an alleged entrance to what was rumoured to be a human and ET science collaboration research base under the ice… [He] and his flight crew received several orders at different times to not talk, and were sternly told, “you did not see the ice hole, you saw nothing”.” More generally, regarding the potentially unusual nature of the region, some observers find significance and intrigue in the existence of the Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959 by 12 major powers, which protects the continent as “a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science” (IAATO, 2023). Of course, the most likely explanation is that the Treaty should be taken at face value, with the participating nations – and subsequently the whole world – genuinely agreeing not to advance territorial claims over the region and instead preserving it for scientific exploration. Nevertheless, for people persuaded that clandestine NHI bases on Earth are being kept secret by the military powers, the Treaty does also plausibly serve these more esoteric goals, not least because it essentially places the location “off limits” to the public. Such sceptics note, for example, that world nations are rarely so co-operative when it comes to ceding or disavowing territorial claims, and wonder if other motives
40   may be at play, such as maintaining secrecy regarding aspects of the content (e.g., whether an NHI presence or base, the remnants of an extinct civilization, or something else entirely) (Salla, 2021).   35 Phil Schnieder gave the following account of his alleged experience at the Dulce base at a public event in 1995 (Kent, 2023): “I'm Phil Schneider. I spent 17 years in black budget programs as a government geologist, engineer and structural engineer with aerospace applications and I'm a self-taught metallurgist. In working with the black projects, I was involved in something very controversial, almost totally unbelievable to most of you. I was involved in building another base inside of Dulce, New Mexico, which is Los Alamos laboratory. On the southwest part of the Archuleta Mesa, we were in the process of the early stages of building the four large tunnel-like holes. Some of them ran two and a half miles under the surface. Anyway, after we drilled all four holes, it took about two days to drill all four of them. When you build an underground base, you drill four basic holes, then you build, called stoves, or crossmember holes, across and then you use blasting equipment and you blast out, or tunnel out, deflagrate or melt rock out… the equipment kept coming up broken. So, we wanted to go down, send somebody down there, a human observer, or human observers in this case, to find out what was going on. When I saw green beret and black beret people … I knew something was up; the gig was up. In this process, I was lowered down in a basket of one of these holes, and … [there] was sitting a seven-foot tall alien Gray. The stench was worse than the worst garbage you can imagine. I didn't waste any time. I reached for my pistol … I carried a little Walther PPK pistol with a nine-shot clip. When you're in an almost space-suit environment and you're reaching for a gun, it's not the easiest thing to do and then to pop a clip into it and start shooting. Man, I killed two of them. Yes, they're mortal and they do die, however in the process one of them did this … All I remember is that he just kind of waved his hand in front of his chest and the next thing I know this blue beam hit me and just literally opened me up like a fish. It was some form of electrical force because it was kinda like being hit with a lightning bolt … burned all my toenails off of me. A green beret that was right behind me, he risked his life. He shoved me back in the basket and hit the button and took me up. I wouldn't be alive talkin' to you today if it wasn't for him. I'm forever indebted. He lost his life. 66 secret service agents, green berets, black berets, crack troops, lost their lives, because the government, our United States government lied, did not tell us anything about the alien threat. There's a war underneath there—and I'm talking dead serious.”  36 Claims of an underwater base in the Catalina Channel are based partly on, (a) the numerous underwater UAP observed there over the decades, (b) testimonies from people who report strange encounters with humanoid beings in the area, and (c) peculiar structure-like images available on resources such as Google Earth. As a result, as Gallaudet (2023) put it in a recent talk, “I'll just cut to the chase. You know, there's talk about, is there a UAP base in Southern California? It sounds wild, but after this week's hearing [i.e., the Congressional UAP hearing on July 26], maybe not.” Indeed, the search for other potential bases has been invigorated by resources like Google Earth, with people scouring maps looking for anomalies, generating numerous cases that some claim could be an underwater base – or at the very least seem genuinely strange – with several examples discussed by Byrd (2016). One is the outlines of an apparent structure near Baja California involving long, tube-shaped lines that stretch for some 76 miles, which notably is in the vicinity of the region noted by Gallaudet and also researchers like Dennett (2018). So too is another a strange finding six miles off the coast of Malibu, some 2,000 feet below the surface, of an oval-shaped object nearly three miles wide with a huge flat top and what “appear to be pillars or columns that seem to reveal the entrance to a darker, inner place” (Speigel, 2014). While rumours of NHI bases may be wild speculation, such sites are at least unusual and worth investigating, though from a sceptical perspective one might ask, if cryptoterrestrials wanted to hide – if indeed that would be their intention – why would they select a location merely 2,000 feet down right off the California coast.  37 Regarding other potential underwater NHI bases, the author Michael Salla (2024) for example has suggested, based on an apparent US military informant, that there is “a space ark is located at the bottom of the Atlantic with naval ships surrounding it.”  38 There is a long history of rumours about an NHI presence on the moon, most of which is highly contested, seen as credible by some and strongly rejected by others. A vivid example of these murky waters involves an alleged Apollo 20 mission in 1976. Officially, the last lunar lending was Apollo 17 in December 1972, with Apollo 18, 19 and 20 cancelled that year – despite already being in the construction and planning stages – supposedly due to declining public interest and budget cuts. However, in 2007 a series of videos were posted to YouTube – seemingly by William Rutledge, a retired American astronaut, under the username “retiredafb” – which purported to show secret NASA footage from an alleged Apollo 20 mission in 1976. Its alleged purpose was to investigate a two-mile-long spaceship that had apparently crashed millions of years ago on the far side of the moon, and which had been discovered by previous missions. Venturing inside the craft, the video showed the astronauts encountering the body of a humanoid female – in a state of “suspended animation” of some kind – who became dubbed the Martian “Mona Lisa” (Aerospace Engineering, 2017). Needless to say, the account has
41   been much disputed. Indeed, in 2007, a French artist and writer, Theirry Speth, claimed to have created the videos in 2006 for a science fiction story he was writing that was eventually published a decade later (Speth, 2017), a claim which has been corroborated by the likes of Reuters (2022). Even so, some observers remain sceptical about Speth’s claims, suggesting his apparent “confession” may itself be a form of disinformation to discredit what is actually a genuine story; to that point, Italian ufologist Luca Scantamburlo (2010) claimed to have interviewed Rutledge himself, who confirmed it was a real mission. Thus, for example, the footage has been promoted as credible, such as by the documentary Aliens on the Moon: The Truth Exposed (Kiviat, 2014). However, critics point out that Scantanburlo never met Rutledge in person (with the interview conducted over Yahoo! Messenger), and that his claims of veracity have no weight (Hoaxeye, 2022). Essentially, while we ourselves believe the story to almost definitely be false, that we cannot be 100% certain is indicative of the tantalising and uncertain standing of the moon with respect to this topic.   39 In terms of the strangeness of the moon, as discussed on an episode of The UFO Rabbit Hole podcast (Chase, 2022), the reason it seems “so unsettling is just the sheer preponderance of weirdness.” Essentially, there are myriad oddities and coincidences, and while any one individually might be merely curious, together they create an unnerving sense of artificiality (Knight & Butler, 2006). (1) We only ever see one side of it (i.e., one side is always facing Earth), which is only possible because the moon is rotating on its axis at the exact rate that it orbits the Earth. (2) The moon and the sun appear roughly the same size in the sky because although the sun is 400 times bigger than the moon, it is almost exactly 400 times further away from the Earth than the Moon. (3) In addition to the moon and sun appearing a similar size, the moon has a slightly tilted orbit that aligns to Earth’s orbit around the sun (in contrast to most moons, which orbit around the equator of their planets), meaning we experience eclipses. (4) It is particularly massive; although there are over 200 moons in our solar system, despite Earth being only the fifth largest planet, it has the fifth largest moon; consider that the largest moon, Jupiter’s Ganymede, is only about 50% larger than our moon, even though Jupiter is 11 times bigger than Earth. (5) It is potentially hollow in some ways (or at least has hollow cavities), based on seismic reverberations observed in tests conducted by the Apollo missions. (6) We don’t currently have a settled and definitive understanding of how or when the moon was formed, and although numerous theories have been proposed, these have been challenged by the kinds of observations noted above; for example, a prominent early explanation was the “capture” hypothesis, in which, during the chaos of the early solar system, the moon’s path happened to have intersected with that of Earth in just the right way, so became pulled into its orbit. However, since the moon is so large, and its orbit so close to Earth and also so perfectly circular, this idea has fallen out of favour. Given all these oddities, some people speculate the moon could be an artificial satellite created by an NHI, with various reasons proposed for its manufacture. Perhaps the most obvious one is that it would serve as a secret base from which to observe life on Earth. However, a deeper and more profound possibility is that it was fashioned to help create and nurture life on Earth itself. This observation is based on the recognition that, were it not for the moon, life may not have been able to emerge on Earth at all, especially its more complex forms. The essence of the argument is that the moon has a particularly profound impact on our tides (being so large and so close), which are integral to both the creation and maintenance of life (from supporting the flux of the oceans from which life is thought to have emerged, to helping regulate the climate and temperature of the planet).  40 Many people have looked for lunar anomalies using publicly available photographs taken by NASA’s Apollo missions, as well as by more recent endeavours such as NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (the LRO: a robotic spacecraft which since 2009 has been orbiting the moon gathering data), China’s Yutu 2 (the robotic rover component of CNSA's Chang'e 4 lunar mission, launched in 2018), and Google Moon (which primarily uses a mosaic of images taken by NASA’s Clementine mission in 1994). These have generated many unusual images, which some people have interpreted as evidence of an NHI presence on the moon, although in many cases sceptics have argued there is a natural explanation. Among the most well-known researchers in this area is Richard Hoagland (e.g., Hoagland & Bara, 2007), whose analyses of NASA photographs have yielded various apparently anomalous lunar structures. For instance, in 1967 the Lunar Orbiter III took a photo – frame LO-III-84-M (https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/lo3_m84.html) of the Bruce crater and the Sinus Medii Mare plain. An overexposed 44x enlargement by Hoagland revealed what seems to be an irregularly-shaped vertical object 1.5 miles tall (see https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/luna/esp_luna_26.htm), dubbed the “Shard.” Sceptics have sought to find naturalistic explanations for this: an article by Live Science (2012) for example claimed this was merely an artefact of Hoagland’s “manipulation” of image processing software, which “appears to have turned a tiny spot of light near the horizon of the moon (perhaps light from a distant star) into a blurry image artifact.” Other explanations offered have been that this is merely an ephemeral “outgassing” event – an explosive vertical release of gas, which can indeed happen naturally on the moon – that just happened to coincide with the photograph being taken. However, these “debunking” claims have themselves been critiqued and challenged; for example, the shard has a shadow cast in the correct direction (i.e., given the location of the sun at the time), while enhancements of the photo reveal no “spray” (i.e., that one might normally expect from
42   outgassing), both of which lend support to it being a “real” object. Hoagland suggests the potential artificiality of the shard is then lent further credibility by the apparent proximity of other seemingly anomalous objects he also identified on LO-III-84-M (and related photos), including the “Tower/Cube” (a tripodal structure that seems to extend some seven miles upwards, with a large mile-wide cube on top). Indeed, he suggests that both the Shard and Tower/Cube are translucent/transparent and are remnants of a large glass dome-like structure – with other remnants also seemingly evident in other photographs – which he theorizes was built to protect a now-vanished outpost of civilization on the moon. We have no way here of adjudicating these claims, but while not necessarily agreeing with Hoagland about the nature or interpretation of these images, we also suggest they cannot simply be dismissed out of hand. The same is true of various other anomalies people have observed in lunar images, such as several massive and seemingly artificial structures identified by Scott Wearing – involving straight lines that suggest these have been manufactured rather than forming naturally – in the Copernicus crater (Monzon, 2019) and the De Moraes Crater (Malewar, 2019). Essentially, the same principle applies here as with the CTH more generally: while we regard the probability of artificial structures on the moon as highly unlikely, we also suggest the possibility should not be ruled out and instead deserves genuine investigation.  41 NASA “whistleblowers” include Karl Wolfe, an Air Force photo technician, who claimed that in 1965, when on loan to NASA’s lunar orbiter project, a colleague said “in a very distressed way” that “we've discovered a base on the back side of the moon,” and proceeded to show photographs which “clearly” feature “a base which had geometric shapes … there were spherical buildings, there were very tall towers and things that looked somewhat like radar dishes.” Similarly, Ken Johnston, a former NASA aerospace engineer, has alleged that NASA has detailed photos of a lunar NHI presence, and claimed he was fired after refusing to destroy this evidence, some of which he apparently personally retained (Verma, 2022a). Indeed, some of the claims made by Richard Hoagland, as mentioned in endnote 40 – such as there being ruins of buildings, huge dome-like objects made of glass, and stone towers – are seemingly based in part on evidence provided to him by Johnston.  42 In terms of NASA astronauts, most have accounts of witnessing a UAP, at least technically speaking (i.e., phenomena that is unidentified and anomalous). More relevantly though, many have also expressed belief in, or at least openness to, an NHI explanation for UAP (e.g., as listed on The UFO Rabbit Hole, 2022). Perhaps most prominent is Edgar Mitchell, as noted in the main text, although in public he has sometimes denied that he has personally seen a UAP. However, according to Coulthart (2021), Mitchell told one of Coulthart’s sources (one of Mitchell’s “closest personal friends”) that – in Coulthart’s words – “every Apollo mission was followed out, observed while there, and followed back.” Or consider Buzz Aldrin, who in an interview for Kiviat’s (2014) admittedly sensationalistic and controversial documentary Aliens on the Moon, said of his Apollo mission, “I saw this illumination that was moving with respect to the stars. We were smart enough to not say “Houston there’s a light out there that’s following us.” So technically, it becomes an unidentified flying object.” Perhaps the most vivid and unusual response among the Apollo astronauts to the NHI question came from Apollo 15 command module pilot Al Worden, who on a British TV program in 2017 said, “We are the aliens, but we just think they are somebody else. But we are the ones who came from somewhere else, because somebody else had to survive, and they got into little spacecraft then they came here and landed, and they started civilization here. And if you don’t believe me, go get books on Ancient Sumerians and see what they had to say” (cited in Verma, 2022c). His voice can therefore be added to others, discussed in endnote 28, who have similarly advocated for an extraterrestrial origin for human beings.
