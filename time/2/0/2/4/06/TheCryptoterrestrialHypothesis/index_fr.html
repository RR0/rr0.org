<p class="abstract">Ces dernières années ont vu un intérêt croissant et de fait une inquiétude du public face aux <a
  href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">Phénomènes Aériens Non-normaux (PANs)</a>. Les <a
  href="/science/crypto/ufo/analyse/hypotheses">hypotheses pour expliquer ces phénomènes</a> tendent à se répartir en 2
  classes : une explication terrestre conventionnelle (c.-à-d., technologie de fabrication humaine), ou une explication
  extraterrestre (c.-à-d., des civilisations avancées venant d'ailleurs dans le cosmos). Cependant, il existe également
  une 3ᵉ classe d'hypothèses minoritaire : une explication terrestre non-conventionnelle, en-dehors de la vision
  consensuelle prévalente de l'univers. Il s'agit de l'hypothèse ultraterrestre, qui inclut le sous-ensemble de
  l'hypothèse “cryptoterrestre”, c'est-à-dire la notion que les <a href="/science/crypto/ufo/PAN.html">PAN</a>s
  pourraient refléter les activités d'êtres intelligents furtivement cachés ici sur Terre (c.-à-d., sous terre), et/ou
  ses environs proches (c.-à-d., la <a href="/place/systeme/solaire/planete/terre/lune">Lune</a>), et/ou même <q>marchant
    parmi nous</q> (c.-à-d., passant comme des humains). Bien qu'il soit probable que cette idée soit considérée avec
  scepticisme par la plupart des scientifiques, such are the nature of some UAP that we argue this possibility should
  not be summarily dismissed, and instead deserves genuine consideration in a spirit of epistemic humility and openness.

<p>This paper explores a hypothesis concerning Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), and follows another by the same
  first author focusing on a related hypothesis recently published in the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology (Lomas,
  2023a). Essentially, the discourse around UAP is dominated by two main classes of explanation: a conventional
  terrestrial origin (e.g., human technology), or an extraterrestrial origin (i.e., advanced civilizations arriving from
  elsewhere). However, such is the strange nature of many UAP that observers close to the topic have been compelled to
  consider a more unconventional set of theories known collectively as the “ultraterrestrial” hypothesis. This denotes a
  broad category of conjecture centred around the possibility that UAP may involve forms of non-human intelligence (NHI)
  that are already present in Earth’s environment in some sense, which Puthoff (2022) describes as “sequestered
  terrestrial cultures… existing alongside us in distinct stealth.” One is an “interdimensional” hypothesis, which was
  the focus of the previous paper; this suggests UAP may involve beings from dimensions that coexist alongside the four
  dimensions of spacetime we usually perceive, and/or that UAP occupants are “extratempestrial,” traveling through the
  fourth dimension to visit different periods of Earth’s history, which may involve our descendants returning to study
  their own hominin evolutionary past (Masters, 2019, 2022). In writing that paper though, the author became
  increasingly aware of the depth of evidence and theory that also tentatively supports another ultraterrestrial
  explanation: the “cryptoterrestrial” hypothesis (CTH) – our focus here – which holds that UAP may reflect activities
  of NHIs concealed here on Earth (e.g., underground) and its environs. Indeed, the philosopher Bernado Kastrup (2024)
  recently argued that a version of the CTH was – despite its seemingly outlandish, unlikely, and “far out” nature – the
  “most reasonable scenario” for UAP and NHI. As such, a paper which explored the CTH in depth seemed a logical next
  step, and furthermore a useful counterpart to the interdimensional paper.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, UAP constitute an extraordinary empirical mystery, which science is surely obligated to investigate,
  yet has rarely done so (at least in an open, public, visible way), especially when it comes to these more
  unconventional ultraterrestrial hypotheses. As such, together, the previous and current paper will hopefully serve as
  valuable pieces of this emergent jigsaw puzzle that is humanity’s attempt to better understanding this existentially
  important yet hitherto all-too-often overlooked phenomenon. The paper begins by briefly noting the recent history and
  concern over this topic; however, this subject has been extensively covered elsewhere – including by Lomas (2023a),
  whose paper offers a relatively recent summary of the relevant terrain – so we will merely point to such sources
  rather than delving into detail. Then, we explore the CTH over five sections, reflecting on: (a) limits to historical
  and geological knowledge; (2) traces of lost civilizations; (3) traces of underground civilizations; (4) traditions
  around “magical” cryptoterrestrials; and (5) UAP-related activity underground, underwater, and nearby (i.e., the
  moon). We conclude by noting that across these various considerations are actually four distinct CTHs, whose merits we
  briefly consider. We recognize these CTHs may rightly be regarded sceptically by most scientists, but argue they
  nevertheless should not be ruled out, and deserve consideration in a spirit of epistemic humility and openness. </p>
