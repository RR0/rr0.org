  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Ce document est le résultat d'une enquête interne de plusieurs années sur les sujets des Phénomènes Anormaux
    Non-identifiés (PAN), Technologies d'Origine Inconnue (TOU) et Intelligence Non-Humaine (INH). Cette enquête a été
    entreprise en réponse à des menaces crédibles et urgentes pour la sécurité et le bien public des États-Unis
    d'Amérique — et est fournie au Congrès à travers les mécanismes de lanceur d'alerte sur les PANs établis par l'Acte
    d'Autorisation de la Défense Nationale de l'Année Fiscale 2023, ainsi que l'Acte d'Autorisation du Renseignement
    National de l'Année Fiscale 2023. Les données consultées durant cette enquête, résumées dans ce rapport, proviennent
    de données non publiques détenues par la Branche Exécutive du Gouvernement des États-Unis (<abbr
      title="United States Government">USG</abbr>). L'auteur a eu accès à ces informations alors qu'il accomplissait son
    service légal en tant qu'employé du <a href="/org/us/dod">Département de la Défense</a>. Cette version publique du
    rapport des auteurs a été revue et approuvée pour diffusion publique par le Département d'État, Bureau des Affaires
    Publiques Générales.</p>
  <p>Les résultats de cette enquête sont profondément dérangeants. Des éléments de l'exécutif américain ont conspiré
    pour empêcher le législatif d'exercer ses pouvoirs légaux de gouvernance par rapport aux questions liées aux PANs,
    TOU et d'INH. Les informations fournies par l'auteur suggèrent fortement que l'exécutif américain a géré des
    questions PAN/INH sans que le Congrès soit informé, ou que le Congrès l'ait supervisé ou autorisé ; et ce durant un
    moment, très probablement des décennies. Cette conspiration criminelle garde le gouvernement élu des États-Unis et
    ses citoyens dans l'ignorance des découvertes profondes et des menaces terribles venant de l'existence des PANs, INH
    et de leurs technologies.</p>
  <p>Des éléments explicites démontrant la réalité des PANs, INH, et TOU ont été mises à la dispositions du Congrès par
    plusieurs lanceurs d'alerte indépendants sur les PANs. Ce document n'est qu'un des éléments de preuves fournis au
    Congrès ; il en existe bien d'autres et on peut espérer qu'ils seront rendus publics. Dans cette version publique du
    rapport, les informations sont organisées en steps catégories d'éléments, dont : un Programme d'Accès Spéciale
    Clandestin (<abbr title="Unacknowledged Special Access Program">USAP</abbr>) ; du Renseignement d'Imagerie (<abbr

    américain ; ainsi que d'autres sources sensibles. Toutes les informations dans ce rapport sont dérivées d'accès à

  <h2>Section 1: Unacknowledged Special Access Program — IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION.</h2>
  <p>IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION 1s an Unacknowledged Souda Access Program (USAP) established following the public
    disclosure of the AATIP/AAWSAP programs by <span class="people">Luis Elizondo</span> in <time>2017</time>. <u>Upon
      disclosure to Congress, it was determined that this USAP and its Collateral information have not been lawfully
      reported to Congress.</u></p>
  <p>IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION’s SOI mission is collecting imagery intelligence on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP)
    and ARV/RV (Reproduction Vehicles) utilizing tasked and untasked U.S. military-intelligence resources. As part of a
    network of SAPs linked to Non-Human Intelligence (NHI) and UAP technologies, IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION acts as a
    nexus for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence on the activities, capabilities, and locations of
    anomalous aerospace threats that originate from foreign or unidentified sources.</p>
  <p>The intelligence within the IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION program primarily consists of high-quality Imagery
    Intelligence (IMINT) and collateral Measurement and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT) of UAPs and ARV/RVs within
    Barth's atmosphere. The collection platforms involved are a blend of tasked and untasked capabilities in Low Earth
    Orbit (LEO), the upper atmosphere, military and civilian aviation altitudes and maritime environments. IMMACULATE
    CONSTELLATION pays particular attention to anomalous aerospace platforms that have been developed through the study
    or acquisition of technologies of unknown origin by foreign nations or unknown entities. UAP and ARV/RV signatures
    and preferred operating areas are known to the program, enabling a degree of strategic awareness and warning. -
    Finally, IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION shows that UAP and ARV/RVs are operating. around the globe, often in close
    proximity to sensitive RSI assets and locations.</p>
  <p>The categorization of IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION as a lucia USAP, with various ‘child’ SAPs under its umbrella,
    indicates a high level of compartmentalization and secrecy. In effect, IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION serves as a central
    or 'parent' USAP that consolidates observations of UAP and ARV activities detected by tasked and untasked collection
    platforms. Sophisticated internal information security controls are a major part of the IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION
    program, which enforces compartmentalization by | detecting, quarantining, and transferring UAP and RV imagety
    collection incidents before they are circulated within the Military Intelligence Enterprise.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION shows that the USGi is not only aware of UAPs and TUO, but also foreign
    state efforts to replicate UAP and TUO capabilities. The data. within IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION reveals the capacity
    of the U.S. Armed Services and Military Intelligence Community to detect, track, identify, and engage anomalous
    transmedium platforms. IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION also demonstrates the extant capability to detect, quarantine, and
    transfer UAP and RV collection incidents before they are observed and circulated within the Military Intelligence
    Enterprise, partially explaining why | many otherwise cleared members of the military and IC are unaware of UAP
    activities. Finally, the existence of IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION provides verifiable evidence ofthe witting
    participation by elements of the U.S. Armed Services, Defense Civil Service, and the Intelligence Community in a
    global surveillance and reconnalssance mission tasked with monitoring UAPs and ARV/RVs.</p>

  <h2>Section 2: USG Imagery Intelligence</h2>
  <p>The USG maintains Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) databases accessible to personnel with appropriate security
    clearances and mission need. These databases are scattered across Various organizations and services, leading to a
    fragmented ownership structure. This dispersion | complicates the timely and comprehensive gathering of IMINT
    related to Unidentified Aerial. Phenomena (UAPs). Control over access to these datasets primarily reside with the
    Military Intelligence Enterprise, the Combatant Commands, the Armed Services, and individual Program Managers.</p>
  <p>The IMINT collected from datasets available to the DoD, and reviewed for this report, provide compelling evidence
    for UAP which defy prosaic explanations. There is a large number of unique imagery sensors available to the U.S.
    military and intelligence community DITER Infrared (IR)/Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR), Full Motion Video (FMV),
    Thermal, and Still Photography. The multitude of wavelengths collected by these sensors have captured. UAP
    characteristics that are difficult or impossible to observe with the human eye alone. Subtle atmospheric effects
    associated with UAPS are visible through the sensors employed by the U.S. military and intelligence agencies,
    enabling unique analytic techniques. The verifiable chain of custody for UAP IMINT collected by U.S. military assets
    ensures a high level of confidence in the accuracy and integrity of the data gathered. The following examples are
    presented:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>CENTCOM Cuboid Formation of Metallic Orbs</b>: On USG networks, there exists daytimeFMV and daytime-FLIR
      footage of a formation of ~12 metallic otbs skimming the ocean surface at high-speed before dispersing in multiple
      directions. The rapid and agile maneuvering of the metallic orbs were incompatible with known aerospace vehicles
      and were between 3-6 meters in diameter. In the opening segment of this footage, the ~12 metallic orbs flew in a
      tight ‘cuboid’ formation; the metallic orbs were in three vertical-square formations of <4 orbs each, arranged in
      a three-pronged configuration, creating the illusion of a cube shape at distance. AIl the orbs were white-hot
      against the black-cold ocean in the FLIR footage, and each sphere created a feint. atmospheric distortion both
      around itself and as a heat-shimmer ‘contrail’. The metallic orbs moved in this cube formation over the ocean for
      some time, before rapidly breaking formation as pairs. The sensor platform lost track of most of the metallic orbs
      as they ascended in altitude and accelerated in speed but maintained observation on a pair of metallic orbs
      continuing the original trajectory of the larger formation.</li>
    <li><b>CENTCOM Fast Mover Observed Transiting Over Sensitive Facilities</b>: On USG networks, there exists FLIR
      footage of a small-medium oval UAP flying at high speed and low to the surface. The footage begins as routine
      surveillance of a sensitive coastal facility, when the oval UAP rapidly comes into frame as it flies above coastal
      facilities. The oval UAP then makes a rapid turn towards the ocean where it is tracked by the collection platform.
      The oval UAP is tracked flying low over the open ocean at high usa before the track is lost.</li>
    <li>INDOPACOM Intelligence Vessels Positioned to Collect on LAN Vehicle: On USG networks, there exists Infrared
      footage of and imagery of a grouping of vessels engaged in SIGINT and MASINT collection at night in a specific
      area of the Pacific Ocean. In this footage, which was in close-proximity to the vessels, a large equilateral
      triangle UAP suddenly appears directly over the ships. Three bright points are seen at each bottom corner of the
      UAP, which is observed to slowly rotate on its horizontal axis. This rotation partially reveals a-horizontal bar
      of sweeping lights. Intelligence analysis associated with this event specifies that the equilateral triangle is a
      Reproduction Vehicle (RV) and concludes that the vessels must have been aware of the RV”s frequent use of those
      coordinates, due to foreign pre-positioning of advanced collection assets at the exact time and place. After a
      brief period of hovering and slowly rotating © approximately 500-1000 meters above the ocean, the RV suddenly lia
      and the footage ends.</li>
    <li><b>INDOPACOM Equilateral Triangle UAP Tails Unwitting Vessel</b>: On USG networks, there exists infrared footage
      of an equilateral-triangle UAP, approximately fighter-jet sized, hovering less than 200 meters above a vessel, in
      the night at a location i in the Pacific. Intelligence analysis associated with this event specifies that the
      equilateral-triangle is an ARV/RV of unknown origin. The vessel gives no signs that it is aware of the ARV/RV
      maintaining altitude and bearing directly overhead. Two lights on the underside of the ARV/RV are visible, while a
      third is blocked from view due to a slightly upward IRE of orientation.</li>
    <li><b>INDOPACOM Large Disc Using Clouds as Concealment</b>: On USG networks there exists OPIR footage of a large
      saucer shaped UAP emerging from within a dense cloud formation. The saucer registered black-hot against
      white-cold, with atmospheric disturbances caused by the saucer shaped UAP visible. The saucer was between 200-400
      meters in circumference and displayed symmetrical concavities on the upper surface. The saucer shaped UAP emerges
      at a shallow angle travelling upwards towards the outer atmosphere. After breaking above the cloud cover, the
      saucer shaped UAP suddenly reverses its direction, descending partially back into the cloud cover, then
      accelerating rapidly out of frame and partially obscured by the could tops. This behavior was evasive in nature
      and implied that the saucer shaped UAP had become aware that it was under observation by a space-based collection
      platform.</li>
    <li><b>INDOPACOM Boomerang UAP Observed by Pilot and Sensor Suite</b>: On USG RIST there exists FLIR footage of a
      swept-boomerang UAP maneuvering at an uncertain altitude at a location off the eastern coast of a country. The UAP
      is tracked against clouds by the sensor suite of the operating craft. The UAP is observed rapidly decelerating to
      a stationery hover, followed by the sudden emission of a sphere of light from the junction of the two ‘wings’
      which expands to partially engulf the craft in a rotating sphere of light, at which point the available footage
      ends.</li>
    <li>NORTHCOM Jellyfish UAP Crosses US-Mexico Border: On USG networks, there exists FLIR footage of an irregularly
      shaped UAP flying across the southern border. The UAP appeared in FLIR to be ‘mottled’ irregularly with hot/cold
      emissions and approximated a . jellyfish or floating ‘brain’ with hanging appendages in appearance. The UAP flew
      against the wind with no visible means of propulsion, maintained an unnatural ‘rigidity’ in its movements and
      flight path, and maintained a comparatively low altitude to geo graphic features. In appearance and behavior,
      footage of this UAP violating the airspace of the southern border resembled the same class of UAPs observed near
      DoD facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan. There exists at least one compilation video of this class of UAP, sourced
      from DoD force protection assets and Theater ISR, which uses this footage as a point of comparison.</li>
    <li><b>NORTHCOM Supersonic 'Range Fouler?' Intercepts USN Fighter</b>: On USG networks there exists FLIR footage and
      radar data of a supersonic UAP of uncertain characteristics conducting a head-on intercept of a USN fighter
      operating off the Eastern Seaboard. The UAP is observed ‘ emerging from a cloudbank at high-speed and approaching
      the USN aircraft head-on, rapidly passing over the left side of the cockpit. Radar data from this approach tracks
      the UAP on its approach towards the craft providing information on speed, heading, and elevation.</li>
    <li><b>SOUTHCOM Tic-Tac Detected by Space Asset in Proximity of Vessel</b>: On USG networks. there exists OPIR
      imagery and MASINT of a Tic-Tac UAP transiting through an area of the Atlantic Ocean. The Tic-Tac maneuvers at an
      altitude at or near local cloud cover, and correlated. electromagnetic signatures were collected by MASINT. In the
      available footage the Tic-Tac UAP transits rapidly through the field of regard as it transits the ocean. No
      observed reaction is seen to come from the vessel, but its proximity in time and space to the trajectory of this
      UAP suggests foreknowledge of the UAP event by intelligence.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Section 3: Defense Human Intelligence Reporting</h2>
  <p>The USG maintains a database of intelligence collected by military personnel across a plethora . of topics,
    including UAP. These individual reports are considered “raw” because they have not undergone evaluation,
    corroboration, or contextualization into a finished analytical product by Military Intelligence Community analysts.
    A significant volume of reports documenting firsthand encounters with Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) or
    Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) by DoD personnel exists within defense HUMINT databases. Many of these UAP
    reports are filed by military aviators and pilots, as well as service members trained in foreign military
    intelligence collection activities, and often include photographic evidence and sensor data. When aggregated, these
    reports reveal significant information on UAP.</p>
  <p>This section is directly informed by reviewing over 400 defense HUMINT reports on encounters with UAPs/UFOs by USG
    personnel spanning from <time>1991/2022</time>. It must be noted that this dataset is not exhaustive — other HUMINT
    data sources exist which are omitted from this analysis. The defense HUMINT dataset summarized here highlights
    notable trends in the reporting stream and are presented here along with specific examples.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Common UAP/UFO Shapes Observed in Defense HUMINT Dataset</h3>
    <p>From 1991 to 2022, the most common UAP shapes reported in this USG dataset were spheres/orbs, discs/saucers
      ovals/tic-tacs, triangles, boomerang/arrowhead, and irregular/organic. The Triangles/Boomerangs/Arrowhead shapes
      were by far the rarest and spheres the most common. Variations of morphology within these categories are present
      i.e. smooth spheres and — spheres with protuberances; saucers without domes and saucers with domes; smooth ovals
      and ovals with surface structures; jellyfish or floating “brains” with appendages; and elongated triangles as well
      as equilateral triangles.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Sphere or Orb</b>: Spheres were the most reported shape, with variations ranging from smooth featureless
        orbs to spheres with visible openings or appendages. These objects prevalence suggests a possible standard in
        UAP design or function, capable of high maneuverability and speed. The diversity within the sphere category,
        spanning from simple, polished appearances to more complex structures with appendages, suggests a broad range of
        purposes or technologies e to the platform’s mission and/or the originator.</li>
      <li><b>Disc or Sauùcer</b>: Saucer-shaped UAPs, reported with and without domes, were the second-most common shape
        reported. Flat saucers were reported as well, these being disc like objects without pronounced domes.
        Traditional bi-convex UAPs are also reported in the data.</li>
      <li><b>Oval Tic-Tac</b>: Oval-shaped UAPs were infrequently tali within the dataset, and only after approximately
        2003; these UAPSs either maintained a uniform 'egg-like' symmetry, occasionally tapered into a teardrop shape.
        Cylinders with convex ends (Tic-Tacs) fall into this category, and occasionally featured visible protuberances
        on the ‘top’ or ‘bottom’ of the otherwise uniform planform.</li>
      <li><b>Triangle</b>: Triangles were among the rarest UAPS reported in the data. Most of these | sightings were
        equilateral triangles, occasionally with vertical ‘stabilizers’ visible on the ‘top’ of the UAP. Elongated
        (isosceles) types were also reported, occasionally with the same vertical stabilizers observed on the
        equilateral type.</li>
      <li><b>Boomerang or Arrowhead</b>: Boomerangs and ‘Arrowhead’ shaped UAPs were also among the rarest reported. The
        boomerang UAPs exhibited bilateral symmetry, with sweeping wings and a high aspect ratio. Arrowhead UAPs also
        showed bilateral symmetry, but possessed tapered wings and a low aspect ratio, typically with highly — swept
        leading edges.</li>
      <li><b>Irregular or Organic</b>: irregularly shaped UAPs, those that defy simple geometric description, were among
        the rarest reported sightings. Shape-shifting UAPs also appear in the dataset, typically having a spherical or
        disc-like “base” form from which irregular geometries are seen to project. “Floating brain” or “jellyfish” UAPSs
        are present as well, characterized by a central mass from which multiple “arms” or spars hang downward. Finally,
        combined shapes were also observed, including cubes within spheres, RNGCo: sauCers, and various rectangular and
        cuboid forms.</li>

    <h3>Examples of Defense HUMINT Reports on UAP:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Close Encounter by CVN Flight Deck Personnel</b>: While on active duty in the Pacific, flight deck
        personnel working night duty experienced a close encounter with a spherical UAP of medium-large size. On-duty
        flight deck crew observed a small orange-red sphere maneuvering at high altitude above the CVN. Shortly after
        first observation, the UAP rapidly descended from high altitude to a position directly above the flight deck of
        the CVN (height approximately 100-200 yards). The UAP maintained altitude and matched speed with the underway
        CVN for an uncertain period; observing personnel reported altered perceptions of time during the close
        encounter. The UAPs appeared to emit a soft orange-red light which, bizarrely, did no illuminate the ocean or
        the flight deck of the CVN despite the visual appearance of intense luminosity. The surface of the UAP was
        observed to be e dynamic, ‘roiling like the surface of the sun’. The UAP took no reported actions during the
        encounter, only maintaining a close-in proximity to the CVN. After an uncertain period, the UAP suddenly shot
        into the air, disappearing at a point high above the CVN. Observing personnel felt as if they ‘snapped out of a
        trance’ and sense of profound unease. The incident report concludes with noting that the CVN had not responded
        in any way to what was perceived as a hostile interception by the UAP.</li>
      <li><b>Metallic Orbs Intercept F-22 on CONUS Air Surveillance and Control Mission</b>: While performing a routine
        Airspace Surveillance and Control Mission in the Eastern Air Defense Sector, an F-22 fighter observed multiple
        UAP contacts at mission-altitude. Moving to intercept, the F-22 pilot noted multiple metallic orbs — slightly
        smaller than a sedan — hovering in place. Upon vectoring towards the UAPs, a smaller formation of the metallic
        orbs accelerated at rapid speed towards the F-22, which was unable to establish radar locks on the
        presumed-hostile UAPs. The F-22 broke trajectory and attempted to evade but was intercepted and boxed in by
        approximately 3-6 UAPs. One UAP maneuvered in proximity (>12 meters) to the area directly starboard of the
        cockpit; there the UAP established a rigid spatial relationship with the F-22, maintaining its exact position
        and orientation parallel with the F-22°s cockpit despite multiple evasive rolls and maneuvers. Surrounded by the
        presumed-hostile UAPs, the F-22 was forced out — ofthe mission area under the escort of the UAP formation.</li>
      <li><b>Perimeter of Sensitive Facility Breached by UAP</b>: At a military airfield located on the Eastern
        Seaboard, ground personnel reported a lengthy, low-altitude intrusion late at night by a small, spherical UAP.
        The UAP displayed visual signature management, appearing as a blurry sphere around which light was distorted or
        ‘bent’; this effect emanated outward from the central sphere, giving the appearance of a heat-haze or misty
        volume of distorted light. Ground personnel reported eyestrain, headaches, and a feeling of unease or dread
        while observing this ‘dark sphere’. The UAP was first observed while slowly crossing the runway, moving in the
        direction of a sensitive area. Once across, the UAP hovered above a grouping of ground equipment, before
        floating further towards a building within the sensitive area. The UAP then floated the building before suddenly
        disappearing. Ground personnel were uncertain of the length of the encounter, but estimated their observation
        lasted between 10 to 15 minutes.</li>

  <h2>Section 4: DoD Bureaucratic Records</h2>
  <p>Discrepancies found throughout the internal records of <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> and <a
    href="/org/us/dod">DoD</a> interactions with Congress cast serious doubts on the integrity of the DoD's statements
    to the elected leaders of the United States Government. Extant transcripts held by <a href="/org/us/dod">DoD</a>
    leadership show a pattern of trivialization, obfuscation, and outright denial of UAP data in what were intended to
    be highly classified, private, and transparent conversations with appropriate Congressional members. This same
    behavior also prevents critical members of Congress from receiving an accurate assessment of the national security
    risks posed by UAPs.</p>
  <p>Specific examples known to the author include: denying the existence of multiple Compartmented Access Programs
    (CAP5) owned by a Military Intelligence Agency which directly related to the UAP mission; denying the existence of
    joint <a href="/org/us/dod">DoD</a>/inter-department Special Access Programs (SAPs) directly. related to the UAP
    mission and the study of TUO; and finally, the denial of the existence of IMMACULATE CONSTELLATION by <a
      href="/org/us/dod">DoD</a> representatives to appropriate Congressional members and their staff.</p>
  <p>Separately, additional internal records confirm the claims of Mr. <span class="people">Lue Elizondo</span>
    regarding <a href="/org/us/dod/dia/projet/aatip">AATIP</a>/<a href="/org/us/dod/dia/dwo/projet/aawsa">AAWSAP</a>'s
    mission, activities, and findings. Additional documents support the exceptional character and credibility of Mr.
    <span class="people">Elizondo</span>, These non-public documents include letters of commendation, service award
    nominations, performance/promotion reviews, archived email chains, and <a
      href="/org/us/dod/dia/projet/aatip">AATIP</a>/<a href="/org/us/dod/dia/dwo/projet/aawsa">AAWSAP</a> program
    briefings which directly corroborate the public statements of Mr. <span
      class="people">Elizondo</span>. These records also provide additional insight into the activities of <a
      href="/org/us/dod/dia/projet/aatip">AATIP</a>/<a href="/org/us/dod/dia/dwo/projet/aawsa">AAWSAP</a>, the evolution
    of the program’s findings, and its interactions with senior <a href="/org/us/dod">DoD</a> leadership. Finally, these
    records provide insight into highly classified and suppressed areas of scientific research and technology
    development, derived from the dui and exploitation of UAP and NHI technologies.</p>

  <h2>Section 5: Restricted USG Historical Records</h2>
  <p>(G/00/162-78). This serial number corresponds to an official NSA report published in 1978. The existence and
    content of this report was verified by accessing the appropriate intelligence archives. The substance of the report
    concerns scientific research in the Soviet Union on the topics of parapsychology, ‘psi,’ and biological effects of
    UAP on human beings. Additionally, the existence of this reporting stream demonstrates that U.S. intelligence was
    explicitly tasked to collect on foreign entities active in areas often relegated to the fringes of scientific
    research, including parapsychology and the biological effects of encounters with UAP. The fact that significant
    intelligence resources were dedicated to o understanding and exploiting information related to UAPs and NHIs
    highlights a strategic commitment to understanding the full scope of UAP, NHI, and TUO. These and other classified
    accounts provide a rare public glimpse reveal the contours of a secretive, decades-long competition between major
    terrestrial powers to collect, exploit, and field novel technologies derived from the study of UAP and NHI.

  <h2>Section 6: Signals Intelligence</h2>
  <p>A substantial body of sensitive signals intelligence collected from peer and near-peer countries demonstrate
    foreign awareness of UAP events occurring over their sensitive military and | intelligence facilities — including
    nuclear weapons facilities. Due to the exceptionally sensitive nature of the sources and methods involved, only
    general conclusions are provided here:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Foreign countries are known to have observed UAPs whose inline and behaviors correlate to those observed by the
      United States.</li>
    <li>These UAP events are treated by the security apparatuses of each state as serious national security threats due
      to UAP in proximity to sensitive military and intelligence facilities.</li>
    <li>These facilities are most often associated with aerospace defense, strategic deterrence, and military-sponsored
      scientific research and development.</li>
    <li>On multiple occasions, each of these nations have attempted to intercept Lù shoot dov UAPSs violating their
      territorial airspace, and the airspace over sensitive facilities.</li>
    <li>Foreign countries have internal organizations dedicated to studying the ambiguous threat posed by UAPSs,
      deducing scientific principles through observing UAP, and the careful management of public perceptions of the UAP
      issue.</li>

  <h2>VI. CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p>The official disclosure of the existence of Non-Human indica (NHIs) and their presence on Earth is a pivotal moment
    in human history. The nature of this information is of such incomparable relevance to the public good that it
    demands to be shared. Some may object and say that disclosure at this time poses too many risks. To them it must be
    said that we will never be able to predict how individuals, families, communities, and nations will react to
    revelations of such magnitude. Moving forward, we must guard against the lure of authoritarian solutions Justified
    by expediency and appeals to national security. The Good in humanity will always. triumph through time, and it is in
    moments of crisis that our capacities for achieving the extraordinary are discovered. Be not afraid.</p>
