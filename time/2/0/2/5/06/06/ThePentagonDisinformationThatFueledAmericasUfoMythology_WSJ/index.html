<p class="abstract">U.S. military fabricated evidence of alien technology and allowed rumors to fester to cover up real
  secret-weapons programs</p>
<p>A tiny Pentagon office had spent months investigating conspiracy theories about secret Washington UFO programs when
  it uncovered a shocking truth: At least one of those theories had been fueled by the Pentagon itself.</p>
<p>The congressionally ordered probe took investigators back to the 1980s, when an Air Force colonel visited a bar near
  <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/Area51">Zone 51</a>, a top-secret site in the Nevada desert. He gave the owner photos of
  what might be flying saucers. The photos went up on the walls, and into the local lore went the idea that the U.S.
  military was secretly testing recovered alien technology.</p>
<p>But the colonel was on a mission—of disinformation. The photos were doctored, the now-retired officer confessed to
  the Pentagon investigators in <time>2023</time>. The whole exercise was a ruse to protect what was really going on at
  <a href="/org/us/dod/af/base/Area51">Zone 51</a>: The Air Force was using the site to develop top-secret stealth
  fighters, viewed as a critical edge against the <a href="/org/su">Soviet Union</a>. Military leaders were worried that
  the programs might get exposed if locals somehow glimpsed a test flight of, say, the <a
    href="/tech/aero/appareil/avion/f117">F-117</a> stealth fighter, an aircraft that truly did look out of this world.
  Better that they believe it came from Andromeda.</p>
<p>This episode, reported now for the first time, was just one of a series of discoveries the Pentagon team made as it
  investigated decades of claims that Washington was hiding what it knew about extraterrestrial life. That effort
  culminated in a report, released last year by the Defense Department, that found allegations of a government coverup
  to be baseless.</p>
<p>In fact, a Wall Street Journal investigation reveals, the report itself amounted to a coverup—but not in the way the
  UFO conspiracy industry would have people believe. The public disclosure left out the truth behind some of the
  foundational myths about UFOs: The Pentagon itself sometimes deliberately fanned the flames, in what amounted to the
  U.S. government targeting its own citizens with disinformation.</p>
<p>At the same time, the very nature of Pentagon operations—an opaque bureaucracy that kept secret programs embedded
  within secret programs, cloaked in cover stories—created fertile ground for the myths to spread.</p>
<p>These findings represent a stunning new twist in the story of America’s cultural obsession with UFOs. In the decades
  after a <time>1938</time> radio broadcast of <span class="people" title="Herbert George Wells">H.G. Wells</span>’ “The
  War of the Worlds” spread panic throughout the country, speculation about alien visitors remained largely the province
  of supermarket tabloids, Hollywood blockbusters and costumed conferences in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>More recently, things took an ominous turn when a handful of former Pentagon officials went public with allegations
  of a government program to exploit extraterrestrial technology and hide it from Americans. Those claims led to the
  Pentagon’s investigation.</p>
<p>Now, evidence is emerging that government efforts to propagate UFO mythology date back all the way to the 1950s.</p>
<p>This account is based on interviews with two dozen current and former U.S. officials, scientists and military
  contractors involved in the inquiry, as well as thousands of pages of documents, recordings, emails and text
  messages.</p>
<p>At times, as with the deception around Area 51, military officers spread false documents to create a smokescreen for
  real secret-weapons programs. In other cases, officials allowed UFO myths to take root in the interest of national
  security—for instance, to prevent the <a href="/org/su">Soviet Union</a> from detecting vulnerabilities in the systems
  protecting nuclear installations. Stories tended to take on a life of their own, such as the three-decade journey of a
  purported piece of space metal that turned out to be nothing of the sort. And one long-running practice was more like
  a fraternity hazing ritual that spun wildly out of control.</p>
<p>Investigators are still trying to determine whether the spread of disinformation was the act of local commanders and
  officers or a more centralized, institutional program.</p>
<p>The Pentagon omitted key facts in the public version of the <time>2024</time> report that could have helped put some
  UFO rumors to rest, both to protect classified secrets and to avoid embarrassment, the Journal investigation found.
  The Air Force in particular pushed to omit some details it believed could jeopardize secret programs and damage
  careers.</p>
<p>The lack of full transparency has only given more fuel to conspiracy theories. Members of Congress have formed a
  caucus, composed mainly of Republicans, to examine unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP, in bureaucratic speak.
  The caucus has demanded the intelligence community disclose which agencies <q>are involved with UAP crash retrieval
    programs.</q></p>
<p><abbr title="Make America Great Again">MAGA</abbr> skepticism about the “deep state” further feeds the notion that
  government bureaucrats have been keeping those secrets from the American public. At a November hearing of two House
  Oversight subcommittees, Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, cast doubt on the Pentagon’s report. <q>I’m
    not a mathematician, but I can tell you that doesn’t add up,</q> she said.</p>
<p><span class="people">Sean Kirkpatrick</span>, a precise, bespectacled scientist who once spent years studying
  vibrations in laser crystals, was nearing retirement from government service when he received the call that would
  change his life.</p>
<p>By <time>2022</time> he had ascended to chief scientist at the Missile and Space Intelligence Center at the Redstone
  Arsenal near Huntsville, Ala. As he sat at his desk at 6:30 one morning, drinking coffee and skimming through
  intelligence reports that had come in overnight, his Tandberg desk phone—essentially a classified version of
  FaceTime—rang.</p>
<p>It was a deputy undersecretary from the Pentagon, who was putting on a tie as he told Kirkpatrick about a new office
  Congress ordered the department to set up to examine unidentified anomalous phenomena. “The undersecretary and I put
  together a shortlist of who could do it, and you’re at the top,” the official relayed, adding that they had settled on
  Kirkpatrick because he both had a scientific background and had built a half-dozen organizations within the
  intelligence community.</p>
<p>Is that the real reason, Kirkpatrick countered, <q>or am I the only one stupid enough to say, ‘yes?’</q> In short
  order, Kirkpatrick had the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office up and running. Just the latest in an alphabet soup of
  special government projects set up to study UFOs stretching back more than half a century, <a
    href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>, as it is known, operated out of an unmarked office near the Pentagon,
  with a few dozen staffers and a classified budget. The mission fell into two buckets. One was to collect data on
  sightings, particularly around military installations, and assess whether they could be explained by earthly
  technology. Amid growing public attention, the number of such reports has skyrocketed in recent years, to 757 in the
  12 months after <time>2023-05</time> from 144 between <time>2004/2021</time>. <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>
  linked most of the incidents to balloons, birds and the proliferation of drones cluttering the skies. Many pilot
  accounts of floating orbs were actually reflections of the sun from Starlink satellites, investigators found. They are
  still examining whether some unexplained events could be foreign technology, such as Chinese aircraft using
  next-generation cloaking methods that distort their appearance.</p>
<p>The office found that some seemingly inexplicable events weren’t so strange after all. In one, a 2015 video appeared
  to show a spherical object buzzing past a jet fighter at an almost impossible speed. “Oh, my gosh dude,” the pilot can
  be heard saying in the video, laughing. But later, investigators determined there was nothing much to see—whatever the
  object was, the camera angle and relative speed of the jet had made it appear to be going much faster than it was. The
  office’s second mission proved to be more peculiar: to review the historical record going back to 1945 to assess the
  claims made by dozens of former military employees that Washington operated a secret program to harvest alien
  technology. Congress granted the office unprecedented access to America’s most highly classified programs to allow
  Kirkpatrick’s team to run the stories to ground. As <span class="people">Kirkpatrick</span> pursued his investigation,
  he started to uncover a hall of mirrors within the Pentagon, cloaked in official and nonofficial cover. On one level,
  the secrecy was understandable. The U.S., after all, had been locked in an existential battle with the <a
    href="/org/su">Soviet Union</a> for decades, each side determined to win the upper hand in the race for
  ever-more-exotic weapons. But Kirkpatrick soon discovered that some of the obsession with secrecy verged on the
  farcical. A former Air Force officer was visibly terrified when he told Kirkpatrick’s investigators that he had been
  briefed on a secret alien project decades earlier, and was warned that if he ever repeated the secret he could be
  jailed or executed. The claim would be repeated to investigators by other men who had never spoken of the matter, even
  with their spouses. It turned out the witnesses had been victims of a bizarre hazing ritual. For decades, certain new
  commanders of the Air Force’s most classified programs, as part of their induction briefings, would be handed a piece
  of paper with a photo of what looked like a flying saucer. The craft was described as an antigravity maneuvering
  vehicle.</p>
<p>The officers were told that the program they were joining, dubbed Yankee Blue, was part of an effort to
  reverse-engineer the technology on the craft. They were told never to mention it again. Many never learned it was
  fake. <span class="people">Kirkpatrick</span> found the practice had begun decades before, and appeared to continue
  still. The defense secretary’s office sent a memo out across the service in the spring of 2023 ordering the practice
  to stop immediately, but the damage was done. Investigators are still trying to determine why officers had misled
  subordinates, whether as some type of loyalty test, a more deliberate attempt to deceive or something else. After that
  <time>2023</time> discovery, <span class="people">Kirkpatrick</span>’s deputy briefed President Joe Biden’s director
  of national intelligence, Avril Haines, who was stunned. Could this be the basis for the persistent belief that the
  U.S. has an alien program that we’ve concealed from the American people? Haines wanted to know, according to people
  familiar with the matter. How extensive was it? she asked. The official responded: <q>Ma’am, we know it went on for
    decades. We are talking about hundreds and hundreds of people. These men signed NDAs. They thought it was real.</q>
  The finding could have been devastating to the Air Force. The service was particularly sensitive to the allegations of
  hazing and asked that <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> hold off on including the finding in the public
  report, even after <span class="people">Kirkpatrick</span> had briefed lawmakers on the episode. <span class="people">Kirkpatrick</span>
  retired before that report was finished and released. In a statement, a Defense Department spokeswoman acknowledged
  that <a href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a> had uncovered evidence of fake classified program materials
  relating to extraterrestrials, and had briefed lawmakers and intelligence officials. The spokeswoman, Sue Gough, said
  the department didn’t include that information in its report last year because the investigation wasn’t completed, but
  expects to provide it in another report scheduled for later this year. <q>The department is committed to releasing a
    second volume of its Historical Record Report, to include <a
      href="/org/us/dod/osd/ousd/is/aaro">AARO</a>’s findings on reports of potential pranks and inauthentic materials,</q>
  <span
    class="people">Gough</span> said.</p>
<p><span class="people">Kirkpatrick</span> investigated another mystery that stretched back 60 years. In
  <time>1967</time>, <span class="people">Robert Salas</span>, now 84, was an Air Force captain sitting in a <a
    href="/org/us/dod/af/base/Malmstrom">walk-in closet-sized bunker</a>, manning the controls of 10 nuclear missiles in
  Montana. He was prepared to launch apocalyptic strikes should <a href="/org/su">Soviet Russia</a> ever attack first,
  and got a call around 8 p.m. one night from the guard station above. <a
    href="/science/crypto/ufo/enquete/dossier/OscarFlight/index.html">A glowing reddish-orange oval was hovering over
    the front gate</a>, <span
    class="people">Salas</span> told <span
    class="people">Kirkpatrick</span>’s investigators. The guards had their rifles drawn, pointed at the oval object
  appearing to float above the gate. A horn sounded in the bunker, signaling a problem with the control system: All 10
  missiles were disabled. Salas soon learned a similar event occurred at other silos nearby. Were they under attack?
  Salas never got an answer. The next morning a helicopter was waiting to take Salas back to base. Once there he was
  ordered: Never discuss the incident.</p>
<p><span class="people">Salas</span> was one of five men interviewed by Kirkpatrick’s team who witnessed such events in
  the 1960s and ’70s. While sworn to secrecy, the men began sharing their stories in the ’90s in books and
  documentaries. <span class="people">Kirkpatrick</span>’s team dug into the story and discovered a terrestrial
  explanation. The barriers of concrete and steel surrounding America’s nuclear missiles were thick enough to give them
  a chance if hit first by a <a href="/org/su">Soviet</a> strike. But scientists at the time feared the intense storm of
  electromagnetic waves generated by a nuclear detonation might render the hardware needed to launch a counterstrike
  unusable.</p>
<p>To test this vulnerability, the Air Force developed an exotic electromagnetic generator that simulated this pulse of
  disruptive energy without the need to detonate a nuclear weapon. When activated, this device, placed on a portable
  platform 60 feet above the facility, would gather power until it glowed, sometimes with a blinding orange light. It
  would then fire a burst of energy that could resemble lightning.</p>
<p>The electromagnetic pulses snaked down cables connected to the bunker where launch commanders like Salas sat,
  disrupting the guidance systems, disabling the weapons and haunting the men to this day. But any public leak of the
  tests at the time would have allowed Russia to know that America’s nuclear arsenal could be disabled in a first
  strike. The witnesses were kept in the dark. To this day, <span class="people">Salas</span> believes he was party to
  an intergalactic intervention to stop nuclear war which the government has tried to hide. He is half-right. The
  experience left the octogenarian deeply skeptical of the U.S. military and its ability to tell the truth. <q>There is
    a gigantic coverup, not only by the Air Force, but every other federal agency that has cognizance of this
    subject,</q> he said in an interview with the Journal. <q>We were never briefed on the activities that were going
    on, the Air Force shut us out of any information.</q> Concealing the truth from men like <span
    class="people">Salas</span> and deliberate efforts to target the public with disinformation unleashed within the
  halls of the Pentagon itself a dangerous force, which would become almost unstoppable as decades passed. The paranoid
  mythology the U.S. military helped spread now has a hold over a growing number of its own senior officials who count
  themselves as believers. The crisis grew to a boil over a piece of metal mailed to a late-night radio host in <time>1996</time>,
  which the sender said they had been told was part of a crashed spaceship.</p>
